                <p>PART I.—GEOGRAPHY AND STATISTICS.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Topography.</hi><hi> ITALY</hi>, or more correctly <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Italia,</hi> is the name that has been applied both in ancient
                    and modern times to the great peninsula that projects from the mass of central
                    Europe far to the south into the Mediterranean Sea, where the great island of
                    Sicily may be considered as in fact a mere continuation or appendage of the
                    continental promontory. Confining ourselves, however, to Italy itself, its
                    natural boundaries are marked with a distinctness that is quite exceptional. The
                    portion of the Mediterranean commonly termed by geographers the Tyrrhenian Sea
                    forms its limit on the W. and S., and the Adriatic on the E.; while to the
                    north, where it joins the main continent of Europe, it is separated from the
                    adjacent regions by the mighty chain of the Alps, which sweeps round in a vast
                    semicircle from the head of the Adriatic to the shores of Nice and Monaco,
                    presenting throughout an almost unbroken mountain barrier.</p>
                <p>The land thus circumscribed extends between the parallels of 46° <hi
                    rend="superscript"> ,</hi> 40' and 37° <hi rend="italic">55'</hi> N. 1at. and
                    between 6° 35' and 18° 35' E. long. Its greatest length is from northwest to
                    south-east, in which direction it measures 620 geographical miles or 718 English
                    miles in a direct line from the boundary near Courmayeur to the Cape Sta Maria
                    di Leuca, south of Otranto, but the great mountain peninsula of Calabria extends
                    about two degrees farther south to Cape Spartivento in lat. 37° 55'. Its breadth
                    is, owing to its configuration, very irregular. The northern portion, measured
                    from the Alps at the Monte Viso to the mouth of the Po, has a breadth of about
                    230 geographical or 270 English miles, and from the Monte Viso to the head of
                    the Adriatic near the mouth of the Isonzo it measures 290 geographical or 340
                    English miles. But the peninsula of Italy, which forms the largest portion of
                    the country, nowhere exceeds 130 geographical miles in breadth, while it does
                    not generally measure more than from 90 to 100 miles across. Its southern
                    extremity, now called Calabria, forms a complete peninsula, being united to the
                    mass of Lucania or the Basilicata by an isthmus of only 35 English miles in
                    width, while that between the Gulfs of Sta Eufemia and Squillace, which connects
                    the two portions of the province, does not exceed 20 miles. The area of the
                    present kingdom of Italy, exclusive of the large islands, is computed at 93,640
                    square miles. Savoy, which until the treaty of 1860 was commonly considered as
                    included in Italy, on account of its being comprised in the kingdom of Sardinia,
                    as a matter of physical geography unquestionably belongs to France (to which it
                    is now politically united), being separated from the Italian province of
                    Piedmont by the main chain of the Alps.</p>
                <p>But, though that great range forms throughout the northern boundary of Italy, the
                    exact limits of the country at the two extremities of the Alpine chain are not
                    very clearly marked, and have been subject to considerable fluctuations both in
                    ancient and modern times. Ancient geographers appear to have generally regarded
                    the remarkable headland which descends from the Maritime Alps to the sea between
                    Nice and Monaco as the limit of Italy in that direction, and in a purely
                    geographical point of view it is probably the best point that could be selected.
                    But Augustus, who was the first to give to Italy a definite political
                    organization, carried the frontier to the river Varus or Var, a few miles west
                    of Nice, and this river continued in modern times to be generally recognized as
                    the boundary between France and Italy. It was only in 1860 that the annexation
                    of Nice and the adjoining territory to France carried the political frontier
                    farther east, to a point between Mentone and Ventimiglia, which certainly
                    constitutes no natural limit.</p>
                <p>Towards the north-east also the line of demarcation is not clearly characterized.
                    The point where the range of the Julian Alps approaches almost close to the
                    sea-shore (just at the sources of the little stream so celebrated in ancient
                    times as the Timavus) would seem to constitute the best natural limit. But in
                    the constitution of Italy by Augustus the frontier was carried farther east so
                    as to include Tergeste (Trieste), and the little river Formio (Risano) was in
                    the first instance chosen as the limit, but this was subsequently transferred to
                    the river Arsia (the Arsa), which flows into the Gulf of Quarnero, so as to
                    include almost all Istria; and the circumstance that the coast of Istria was
                    throughout the Middle Ages held by the powerful republic of Venice tended to
                    perpetuate this arrangement, so that Istria was generally regarded as belonging
                    to Italy, though certainly not forming any natural portion of that country.</p>
                <p>The only other part of the northern frontier of Italy where the boundary is not
                    clearly marked by nature is Tyrol or the valley of the Adige. Here the main
                    chain of the Alps (as marked by the watershed) recedes so far to the north that
                    it has never constituted, as it has done throughout the greater part of its
                    extent, the national limit between populations of different race and language.
                    In ancient times the upper valleys of the Adige and its tributaries were
                    inhabited by Rhoetian tribes and included in the province of Rhoetia; and the
                    line of demarcation between that province and Italy was purely arbitrary, as it
                    remains to this day. Tridentum or Trent was in the time of Pliny included in the
                    tenth region of Italy or Venetia, but he tells us that the inhabitants were a
                    Rhoetian tribe. At the present day the frontier between Austria and the kingdom
                    of Italy crosses the Adige about 30 miles below Trent, —that city and its
                    territory, which previous to the treaty of Lunéville in 1802 was governed by
                    sovereign archbishops of its own, subject only to the German emperors, being now
                    included in the Austrian empire. While the Alps thus constitute the northern
                    boundary of Italy, its configuration and internal geography are determined
                    almost entirely by the great chain of the Apennines, which branches off from the
                    Maritime Alps between Nice and Genoa, and, after stretching in the first
                    instance in an unbroken line across from the Gulf of Genoa to the Adriatic, then
                    turns more to the south, and is continued throughout the whole of Central and
                    Southern Italy, of which it forms as it were the backbone, until it ends is the
                    southernmost extremity of Calabria at Cape Spartivento. The great spur or
                    promontory projecting towards the east to Brindisi and Otranto, which figures in
                    the older maps of Italy as if it were constituted by a branch from the main
                    range of the Apennines, is not in reality so formed, and has no direct connexion
                    with the central chain.</p>
                <p>One chief result of the manner in which the Apennines thus traverse the whole of
                    Italy from the Mediterranean to the Adriatic is the marked division between
                    Northern Italy, including the region north of the Apennines and extending thence
                    to the foot of the Alps, and the central and more southerly portions of the
                    peninsula. No such line of separation exists farther south, and the terms <pb
                    break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit13newyrich/page/n452/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0913-0452-0435"/> Central and Southern Italy, though in general use
                    among geographers, and convenient for descriptive purposes, do not correspond to
                    any natural divisions of the great Italian peninsula.</p>
                <p>1. <hi rend="italic">Northern Italy.—</hi> By far the larger portion of Northern
                    Italy is occupied by the basin of the Po, which comprises the whole of the broad
                    plain extending from the foot of the Apennines to that of the Alps, together
                    with the valleys and slopes on both sides of it. Throughout its whole course
                    indeed, from its source in Monte Viso to its outflow into the Adriatic—a
                    distance of more than 5 degrees of longitude, or 220 miles in a direct line—the
                    Po receives all the waters that flow from the Apennines northwards, and all
                    those that descend from the Alps towards the south, till one comes to the Adige,
                    which, after pursuing a parallel course with the Po for a considerable distance,
                    enters the Adriatic by a separate mouth.</p>
                <p>There is no other instance in Europe of a basin of similar extent equally clearly
                    characterized,—the perfectly level character of the plain being as striking as
                    the boldness with which the lower slopes of the mountain ranges begin <hi
                    rend="superscript"> ,</hi> to rise on each side of it. This is most clearly
                    marked on the side of the Apennines, where the great Emilian Way, which has been
                    the high road from the time of the Romans to our own, preserves an unbroken
                    straight line from Rimini to Piacenza, a distance of more than 150 miles, during
                    which the underfalls of the mountains continually approach it on the left,
                    without once crossing the line of road. On the side of the Alps the boundary is
                    more varied and broken, the great projecting masses of those mountains being
                    intersected by large rivers, which produce valleys of considerable extent
                    running far up into the mountains. But still, from whatever point the traveller
                    approaches the Alps, he will be struck by the manner in which the unbroken
                    alluvial plain extends quite up to the foot of the actual mountains or their
                    immediate offshoots,—presenting in this respect a striking contrast with the
                    broken, hilly country which is found on the north side of the Alps both in
                    Switzerland and in Austria.</p>
                <p>The only exception to this uniform level occurs in the Monferrat region, which
                    consists principally of hills of moderate elevation and of Tertiary formation,
                    projecting to the north from the Ligurian Apennines, and occupying a breadth of
                    about 50 miles from the neighbourhood of Turin to that of Alessandria, around
                    which the Po is compelled to form a great bend between Turin and Valenza,
                    leaving, however, a broad strip of plain (from 15 to 30 miles across) between
                    its north bank and the foot of the Alps. The detached group of the Euganean
                    hills, within sight of the Adriatic, though separated from the nearest Alps by a
                    very narrow strip of plain, is wholly independent of that great chain, and forms
                    a separate and isolated mass of volcanic origin.</p>
                <p>The geography of Northern Italy will be best described by following the course of
                    the Po. That mighty stream has its origin as a mountain torrent descending from
                    two little dark lakes on the north flank of Monte Viso, at a height of more than
                    6000 feet above the sea; and after a course of less than 20 miles it enters the
                    plain at Saluzzo, between which and Turin, a distance of only 30 miles, it
                    receives three considerable tributaries,—the Clusone on its left bank, bringing
                    down the waters from the valley of Fenestrelle, and the Varaita and Maira on the
                    south, contributing those of two valleys of the Alps immediately south of that
                    of the Po itself. Between Turin and Valenza it receives no affluent of
                    importance on its right bank, but a few miles below the latter town it is joined
                    by the Tanaro, a large stream, which brings with it the united waters of the
                    Stura, the Bormida, and several minor rivers. All these have their sources on
                    the northern flank or reverse of the Maritime Alps, where the chain bends round
                    towards Savona, and being fed by the snows of those lofty mountains are greatly
                    superior in volume to the rivers that descend from the Apennines farther
                    east.</p>
                <p>But far more important are the great rivers that descend from the main chain of
                    the Graian and Pennine Alps, and join the Po on its left bank. Of these the Dora
                    (called for distinction’s sake Dora Riparia), which unites with the greater
                    river just below Turin, has its source in the Mont Genevre, and flows past Susa
                    at the foot of the Mont Cenis. Next comes the Stura, which rises in the glaciers
                    of the Roche Melon; then the Oreo, flowing through the Vai di Locana; and then
                    the Dora Baltea, one of the greatest of all the Alpine tributaries of the Po,
                    which has its source in the glaciers of Mont Blanc, above Courmayeur, and thence
                    descends through the Vai d’Aosta for about 70 miles till it enters the plain at
                    Ivrea, and after flowing about 20 miles more joins the Po a few miles below
                    Chivasso. This great valley—one of the most considerable on the southern side of
                    the Alps—has attracted more especial attention, in ancient as well as modern
                    times, from its leading to two of the most frequented passes across the great
                    mountain chain,—the Great and the Little St Bernard, the former diverging at
                    Aosta, and crossing the main ridges to the north into the valley of the Rhone,
                    the other following a more westerly direction into Savoy. In its course below
                    Aosta also the Dora Baltea receives several considerable tributaries, which
                    descend from the range of glaciers between Mont Blanc and Monte Rosa.</p>
                <p>About 25 miles below its confluence with the Dora, the Po receives the waters of
                    the Sesia, also a large river, which has its source above Alagna at the southern
                    foot of Monte Rosa, and after flowing by Varallo and Vercelli falls into the Po
                    about 14 miles below the latter city. About 30 miles east of this confluence,—in
                    the course of which the Po makes a great bend south to Valenza, and then returns
                    again to the northward,—it is joined by the Ticino, a large and rapid river,
                    which brings with it the outflow of the great lake called the Lago Maggiore, and
                    all the accumulated waters that· flow into it. Of these the Ticino itself has
                    its source about 10 miles above Airolo at the foot of the St Gotthard, and after
                    flowing above 36 miles through the Vai Leventina to Bellinzona, where it is
                    joined by the Moesa bringing down the waters of the Vai Misocco, enters the lake
                    through a marshy plain at Magadino, about 10 miles distant. On the west side of
                    the lake the Toccia or Tosa descends from the pass of the Gries nearly due south
                    to Domo d’Ossola, where it receives the waters of the Doveria from the Simplon,
                    and a few miles lower down those of the Vai Anzasca from the foot of Monte Rosa,
                    and 12 miles farther has its outlet into the lake between Baveno and Pallanza.
                    Besides these two great streams the Lago Maggiore is the receptacle of the
                    waters of two minor but considerable lakes—the Lago di Lugano on the east and
                    the Lago d’Orta on the west. The Ticino has a course of above 50 miles from
                    Sesto Calende, where it issues from the lake, through the level, plain, till it
                    joins the Po just below the city of Pavia.</p>
                <p>The next great affluent of the Po, the Adda, forms in like manner the outflow of
                    a great lake—the Lake of Como, and has also its sources far away in the Alps,
                    above Bormio, from whence it flows through the broad and fertile valley of the
                    Vai Tellina for a distance of more than 65 miles till it enters the lake near
                    Colico. The Adda in this part of its course has a direction almost due east to
                    west; but at the same point where it reaches the lake, another river, the Lira,
                    descends the valley of S. Giacomo, which runs nearly north and south from the
                    pass of the Splügen, thus affording one of the most direct lines of
                    communication across the Alps. The Adda flows out of <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit13newyrich/page/n453/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0913-0453-0436"/> the lake at its south-eastern extremity at Lecco,
                    and has thence a course through the plain of above 70 miles till it enters the
                    Po between Piacenza and Cremona. In this part of its course it flows by Lodi and
                    Pizzighettone, and receives the waters of two minor but considerable streams,
                    the Brembo, descending from the Vai Brembana, and the Serio from the Vai Seriana
                    above Bergamo. The Oglio, a more considerable stream than either of the last
                    two, rises in the Monte Tonale above Edolo, and descends through the Vai
                    Camonica to Lovere, where it expands into a large lake, called the Lake of Iseo
                    from the town of that name on its southern shore. Issuing from thence at its
                    southwest extremity, the Oglio has a long and winding course through the plain
                    before it finally reaches the Po a few miles above Borgoforte. In this lower
                    part of its course it receives the smaller streams of the Melia, which flows by
                    Brescia, and the Chiese, which proceeds from a small lake called the Lago
                    d'Idro, between the Lake of Iseo and that of Garda.</p>
                <p>The last of the great tributaries of the Po is the Mincio, which flows from the
                    Lago di Garda, the largest of all the Italian lakes, and has a course of about
                    40 miles from Peschiera, where it issues from the lake at its south-eastern
                    angle, till its joins the Po. About 12 miles above the confluence it passes
                    under the walls of Mantua, and expands into a broad lake-like reach so as
                    entirely to encircle that city. Nothwithstanding its extent, the Lake of Garda
                    is not fed, like those of Como and Maggiore, by the snows of the high Alps, nor
                    is the stream which enters it at its northern extremity (at Riva) commonly known
                    as the Mincio, though in reality forming the main source of that river, but is
                    termed the Sarca; it rises at the foot of the Monte Tonale.</p>
                <p>The Adige, which is formed by the junction of two streams—the Etsch or Adige
                    proper and the Eisach, both of which belong to Tyrol rather than to
                    Italy—descends as far as Verona, where it enters the great plain, with a course
                    from north to south nearly parallel to the rivers last described, and would seem
                    likely in like manner to discharge its waters into those of the Po, but below
                    Legnago it turns to the eastward and pursues a course parallel to that of the Po
                    itself for a space of about 40 miles, till it enters the Adriatic by an
                    independent mouth about 8 miles from the northern outlet of the greater stream.
                    The waters of the two rivers have, however, been made to communicate by
                    artificial cuts and canals in more than one place.</p>
                <p>The Po itself, which is here a very large stream, with an average width of from
                    400 to 600 yards, continues to flow with an undivided mass of waters as far as a
                    place called Sta Maria di Ariano, where it parts into two arms, known as the Po
                    della Maestra and Po di Goro, and these again are subdivided into several other
                    branches, forming an extensive delta above 20 miles in width from north to
                    south. The point of bifurcation is at present about 25 miles from the sea, but
                    was formerly much farther inland, more than 10 miles west of Ferrara, where a
                    small arm of the river, still called the Po di Ferrara, branches off from the
                    main stream. Previous to the year 1154 this channel was the main stream, and the
                    two small branches into which it subdivides, called the Po di Volano and Po di
                    Primaro, were in early times the two main outlets of the great river. The
                    southernmost of these, the Po di Primaro, enters the Adriatic only about 12
                    miles north of Ravenna, so that if these two arms be included, the whole delta
                    of the Po extends through a space of about 36 miles from south to north. The
                    whole course of the river, including its windings, is estimated at about 450
                    miles.</p>
                <p>Besides the delta of the Po and the large marshy tracts which it forms, there
                    exist on both sides of it extensive lagoons of salt water, generally separated
                    from the Adriatic by narrow strips of sand or embankments, partly natural partly
                    artificial, but having openings from distance to distance through these
                    barriers, which admit of the influx and efflux of the sea-water, and serve as
                    ports for communication with the mainland. The best known and the most extensive
                    of these lagoons is that in which Venice is situated, and which extends from
                    Torcello in the north to Chioggia and Brondolo in the south, a distance of above
                    40 miles; but they were formerly much more extensive, and afforded a continuous
                    means of internal navigation, by what were called “the Seven Seas” (Septem
                    Maria), from Ravenna to Altinum, a few miles north of Torcello. That city, like
                    Ravenna, originally stood in the midst of a lagoon; and the coast to the east of
                    it, the whole way to near Monfalcone, where it meets the mountains, is occupied
                    by similar expanses of water, which are, however, continually drying up and
                    becoming gradually converted into dry land. The changes in the coast-line have
                    consequently been considerable throughout this extent.</p>
                <p>The tract in the interior, adjoining this long line of lagoons, is, like the
                    basin of the Po, a broad expanse of perfectly level alluvial plain, extending
                    from the Adige eastwards to the Carnic Alps, where they approach close to the
                    Adriatic between Aquileia and Trieste, and northwards to the foot of the great
                    chain, which here sweeps round in a semicircle from the neighbourhood of Vicenza
                    to that of Aquileia. The space thus included was known in ancient times as
                    Venetia, a name applied in the Middle Ages to the well-known city; the eastern
                    portion of it became known in the Middle Ages as the Frioul or Friuli. It is
                    traversed by a number of rivers, descending from the Alpine chain; but these are
                    for the most part nothing more than mountain torrents, bringing down vast masses
                    of stones and shingle to the plain below. Beginning from the Adige and
                    proceeding from west to east the streams worthy of notice are—(1) the Brenta, a
                    navigable stream of a different character from the rest, which descends from the
                    Vai Sugana, and passes within a few miles of Padua; (2) the Piave, flowing by
                    Belluno; (3) the Tagliamento, which descends from the Carnic Alps above
                    Tolmezzo, and though a large stream has a very torrent-like character; (4) the
                    Isonzo, a deep and rapid river, which has its sources in the highest group of
                    the Julian Alps, at the foot of Mont Terglou, and brings with it the waters of
                    the Natisone, also a considerable stream.</p>
                <p>Returning to the south of the Po, the tributaries of that river on its right bank
                    below the Tanaro are very inferior .in volume and importance to those from the
                    north. Flowing from the Ligurian Apennines, which are of no great elevation and
                    never attain to the limit of perpetual snow, they have no continuous supply
                    through the year, and in summer generally dwindle into insignificant streams
                    flowing through dry beds of shingle. Beginning from the Tanaro, the principal of
                    them are—(1) the Scrivia, a small but rapid stream flowing from the Apennines at
                    the back of Genoa; (2) the Trebbia, a much larger river, though of the same
                    torrent-like character, which rises near Torriglia within 20 miles of Genoa,
                    flows by Bobbio, and joins the Po a few miles above Piacenza; (3) the Nure, a
                    few miles east of the preceding; (4) the Taro, a more considerable stream; (5)
                    the Parma, flowing by the city of the same name; (6) the Enza; (7) the Secchia,
                    which flows by Modena; (8) the Panaro, a few miles to the east of that city; (9)
                    the Reno, which flows by Bologna, but instead of holding its course till it
                    discharges its waters into the Po, is turned aside by an artificial channel into
                    the Po di Primaro. The other small streams east of this—of which the most
                    considerable are the Solaro, the Santerno, flowing by Imola, the Lamone by
                    Faenza, the Montone by Forb —all have their outlet in like manner into the Po di
                    <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit13newyrich/page/n454/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0913-0454-0437"/> Primaro, or by artificial mouths into the
                    Adriatic between Ravenna and Rimini. The river Marecchia, which enters the sea
                    immediately north of Rimini, may be considered as the natural limit of Northern
                    Italy. It was adopted by Augustus as the boundary of Gallia Cispadana; the
                    far-famed Rubicon was a trifling stream a few miles farther north, now called
                    Fiumicino.</p>
                <p>The narrow strip of coast-land between the Maritime Alps, the Apennines, and the
                    sea—called in ancient times Liguria, and now known as the Riviera of Genoa—
                    though belonging itι respect of latitude to Northern Italy, is in other respects
                    quite distinct from the region included under that name. Throughout its whole
                    extent, from Nice to Genoa on the one side, and again from Genoa to Spezia on
                    the other, it is almost wholly mountainous, being occupied by the branches and
                    offshoots of the mountain ranges at the back, which separate it throughout from
                    the great plain to the north, while they send down their lateral ridges close to
                    the water’s edge, leaving only in places a few square miles of level plains at
                    the mouths of the rivers and openings of the valleys. Rugged as it is, the
                    district thus bounded is by no means devoid of fertility, the steep slopes
                    facing the south enjoying so fine a climate as to render them very favourable
                    for the growth of fruit trees, especially the olive, which is cultivated in
                    terraces to a considerable height up the face of the mountains, while the
                    openings of the valleys are generally occupied by towns or villages.</p>
                <p>From the proximity of the mountains to the sea none of the rivers in this part of
                    Italy have any long course, and they are generally mere mountain torrents, rapid
                    and swollen in winter and spring, and almost dry in summer. The lrrgest and most
                    important are those which descend from the Maritime Alps between Nice and
                    Albenga. Beginning from the Var, which as already stated is now included in
                    France, the most considerable of them are—the Roja, which rises in the Col di
                    Tenda, and descends to Ventimiglia; the Taggia, between San Remo and Oneglia:
                    and the Centa, which enters the sea at Albenga. The other streams, which flow
                    from the range of the Apennines to the sea between Savona and Genoa, are of very
                    little importance, from the proximity of the watershed and its small elevation.
                    The same remark applies to the Riviera east of Genoa, where the Lavagna, which
                    enters the sea at Chiavari, is the only stream of any importance between Genoa
                    and the Gulf of Spezia. But immediately east of that inlet (a remarkable
                    instance of a deep land-locked gulf with no river flowing into it) the Magra,
                    which descends from Pontremoli down the valley known as the Lunigiana, is a
                    large stream, and brings with it the waters of another considerable stream, the
                    Vara. The Magra (Macra) was in ancient times the boundary between Liguria and
                    Etruria, and may be considered as constituting on this side the limit of
                    Northern Italy.</p>
                <p>The Apennines, as has been already mentioned, here traverse the whole breadth of
                    Italy, cutting off the peninsula properly so termed from the broader mass of
                    Northern Italy by a continuous barrier of considerable breadth, though of far
                    inferior elevation to that of the Alps. The Ligurian Apennines, which may be
                    considered as taking their rise in the neighbourhood of Savona, where a pass of
                    very moderate elevation connects them with the Maritime Alps, of which they are
                    in fact only a continuation, are among the least lofty portions of that long
                    range. From the neighbourhood of Savona to that of Genoa they do not rise to
                    more than 3000 to 4000 feet, and are traversed by passes of less than 2000 feet.
                    As they extend towards the east they increase in elevation: thus Monte Penna, at
                    the sources of the Taro, rises to 5704 feet; Monte Molinadigo, at the head of
                    the valley of Pontremoli, to 5100; and the Alpe di Succisa, near the pass which
                    is crossed by the road from Sarzana to Reggio, to 6600; while the Monte Cimone,
                    a little farther east, attains to the height of 7088 feet. This is the highest
                    point in the northern Apennines, and belongs to a group of summits of nearly
                    equal altitude; the range which from thence is continued between Tuscany and
                    what are now known as the Emilian provinces has a very uniform character both in
                    elevation and direction, and presents a continuous ridge from the mountains at
                    the head of the Vai di Mugello (due north of Florence) to the point where they
                    are traversed by the celebrated Furlo Pass. The highest point in this part of
                    the range is the Monte Falterona, above the sources of the Arno, which attains
                    to a height of 5408 feet. Throughout this tract the Apennines are generally
                    covered with extensive forests of chestnut, oak, and beech; while their upper
                    slopes afford admirable pasturage. But few towns of any importance are found
                    either on their northern or southern declivity, and the· former region
                    especially, though occupying a broad tract of from 30 to 40 miles in width,
                    between the crest of the Apennines and the plain of the Po, is one of the least
                    known and at the same time least interesting portions of Italy.</p>
                <p>2. <hi rend="italic">Central Italy.—</hi> It has already been observed that, this
                    term is merely one used by geographers as a matter of convenience, and does not
                    correspond to any natural division of the peninsula. Nor does it correspond with
                    any received political division, for though the kingdom of Naples, which so long
                    constituted a separate government, might be considered as representing Southern
                    Italy, its three northern provinces, known as the Abruzzi, certainly belong
                    rather to the central portion of the peninsula, with which they correspond in
                    physical characters as well as in. latitude and position. Writers on ancient
                    geography generally include Campania and Samnium also in Central Italy, a
                    division rendered convenient by the close relations existing between those
                    countries and Latium, the political centre of Italy in those days. But as a mere
                    geographical division it seems more convenient to include all the provinces that
                    formed part of the kingdom of Naples, with the exception of the three Abruzzi,
                    in Southern Italy.</p>
                <p>The geography of Central Italy is almost wholly determined by the great range of
                    the Apennines, which traverse its whole extent in a direction from about
                    north-north-east to south-south-west, almost precisely parallel to that of the
                    coast of the Adriatic from Rimini to Pescara. The line of the highest summits
                    and of the watershed ranges at a distance of about 30 to 40 miles from the
                    Adriatic, while it is separated by about double that distance from the
                    Tyrrhenian Sea on the west. It is in this part of the range that almost all the
                    highest points of the Apennines are found. Beginning from the group called the
                    Alpi della Luna near the sources of the Tiber, which attain only to a height of
                    4435 feet, they are continued by the Monte Nerone (5014 feet), Monte Catria
                    (5590), and Monte Maggio to the Monte Penino near Nocera (5169 feet), and thence
                    to the Monte della Sibilla, at the source of the N#r or Nera, which attains an
                    elevation of 7663 feet. Proceeding from thence southwards, we find in succession
                    the Monte Λ <hi rend="superscript"> 7</hi> ettore (8134 feet), the Pizzo di Sevo
                    (7945 feet), and the two great mountain masses of the Monte Corno, commonly
                    called the Gran Sasso d’Italia, the most lofty of all the Apennines, attaining
                    to a height of 9522 feet, and the Monte della Majella, but little inferior, its
                    highest summit measuring 9084 feet. Farther south than this the range decreases
                    in altitude, and no very lofty summits are found till we come to the group of
                    Monte Matese, in Samnium (6660 feet), which according to the division here
                    adopted belongs to Southern Italy. But <pb break="no"

                    enumerated, two other peaks deserve mention which, though outliers from the main
                    range, and separated from it by valleys of considerable extent, rise to a height
                    exceeding that of all but a few of the points already cited. These are the Monte

                    Fucino, rising to 8192 feet, both of which are covered with snow from November
                    till May, and being within sight of Rome are familiar objects to most visitors
                    to Italy. But though the Apennines of Central Italy, viewed in the mass, may be
                    considered as thus constituting a continuous range, they are far from having the
                    definite arrangement which characterizes their northern extension from the
                    neighbourhood of Genoa to the Adriatic. Instead of presenting, like the Alps and
                    the northern Apennines, a definite central ridge, with transverse valleys
                    leading down from it on both sides, the central Apennines in reality constitute
                    a mountain mass of very considerable breadth, composed of a number of minor
                    ranges and groups of mountains, which though very broken and irregular preserve
                    <hi rend="italic">a,</hi> generally parallel direction, and are separated by
                    upland valleys, some of them of considerable extent as well as considerable
                    elevation above the sea. Such is the basin of the Lake Fucino, situated in the
                    very centre of the whole mass, and almost exactly midway between the two seas,
                    but at an elevation of 2180 feet above them; while the upper valley of the
                    Aterno, in which Aquila is situated, is not less than 2380 feet above the level
                    of the sea. Still more elevated is the valley of the Gizio (a tributary of the
                    Aterno), of which Sulmona is the chief town, and which communicates with the
                    upper valley of the Sangro by a level plain called the Piano di Cinqua Miglia,
                    at an elevation of not less than 4298 feet, regarded as the most wintry spot in
                    Italy. Nor do the highest summits ever form a continuous ridge of great altitude
                    for any considerable distance; they are rather a series of groups separated by
                    intervals of very inferior elevation forming natural passes across the range,
                    and broken in some places (as is the case in almost all limestone countries) by
                    the waters from the upland valleys turning suddenly at right angles, and
                    breaking through the mountain ranges which bound them. Thus the two loftiest
                    groups of all, the Gran Sasso and the Majella, are separated by the deep valley
                    of the Aterno, while the Tronto, in like manner, breaks through the range
                    between Monte Vettore and the Pizzo di Sevo. This constitution of the great mass
                    of the central Apennines has in all ages exercised an important influence upon
                    the character of this portion of Italy, which may be considered as divided by
                    nature into two great regions, a cold and barren upland country, bordered on
                    both sides by rich and fertile tracts, enjoying a warm but temperate
                    climate.</p>
                <p>The district west of the Apennines, extending from the foot of the mountains to
                    the sea, which constitutes a region of great beauty and fertility, though
                    inferior in productiveness t·o northern Italy, may be considered as coinciding
                    in a general way with the countries so familiar to all students of ancient
                    history as Etruria and Latium. In modern times (until the recent union of all
                    Italy) they were comprised in Tuscany and the southern Papal States. The
                    northern part of Tuscany is indeed occupied to a considerable extent by the
                    underfalls and offshoots of the Apennines, which, besides the ordinary slopes
                    and spurs of the main range that constitutes its northern frontier towards the
                    plain of the Po, throw off several outlying ranges or groups, which attain to a
                    very considerable elevation. Of these the most remarkable fø the group between
                    the valleys of the Serchio and the Magra, commonly known as the mountains of
                    Carrara, from the celebrated marble quarries in the vicinity of that city. Two
                    of the summits of this group, the Pizzo d’Uccello and the Pania della Croce,
                    attain to 6155 and 6100 feet. Another lateral range, the Prato Magno, which
                    branches off from the central chain at the Monte Falterona, and separates the
                    upper valley of the Arno from its second basin, rises to 5188 feet; while a
                    similar branch, called the Alpe della Catenaja, of inferior elevation, divides
                    the upper course of the Arno from that of the Tiber.</p>
                <p>The rest of this tract is for the most part a hilly, broken country, but does not
                    in general rise into anything like mountains, with the exception of the Monte
                    Amiata, near Radicofani, a lofty isolated’ mass of volcanic origin, which
                    attains to a height of 5650 feet. South of this the country between the frontier
                    of Tuscany and the Tiber is in great part of volcanic origin, forming hills of
                    no great elevation, with distinct crater-shaped basins, in several instances
                    occupied by small lakes (the Lake of Bolsena, Lake of Vico, and Lake of
                    Bracciano); and this volcanic tract extends across the Campagna of Rome, till it
                    rises again in the lofty group of the Alban hills, the highest summit of which,
                    the Monte Cavo, is 3160 feet above the sea. In this part the Apennines are
                    separated from the sea by a space of only about 30 miles in width, occupied by
                    the undulating volcanic plain of the Roman Campagna, -from which the mountains
                    rise in a wall-like barrier, of which the highest point, the Monte Gennaro,
                    attains to a height of 4165 feet. South of Palestrina again, the main mass of
                    the Apennines throws off another lateral mass, known in ancient times as the
                    Volscian mountains (now called the Monti Lepini), separated from the central
                    ranges by the broad valley of the Sacco, a tributary of the Liris or Garigliano,
                    and forming a large and rugged mountain mass, nearly 5000 feet in height, which
                    descends to the sea at Terracina, and between that point and the mouth of the
                    Liris throws out several rugged mountain headlands, which may be considered as
                    constituting the natural boundary between Latium and Campania, and consequently
                    the natural limit of Central Italy. But besides these offshoots of the Apennines
                    there are in this part of Central Italy several detached mountains, rising
                    almost like islands on the sea-shore, of which the two most remarkable are the
                    Monte Argentaro on the coast of Tuscany near Orbetello (2087 feet high) and the
                    Monte Circello (1771 feet) at the angle of the Pontine Marshes, by the whole
                    breadth of which it is separated from the Volscian Apennines.</p>
                <p>The two valleys of the Arno and the Tiber (called in Italian <hi rend="italic"
                    >Teuere)</hi> may be considered as furnishing the key to the geography of all
                    this portion of Italy west of the •Apennines. The Arno, which has its source in
                    the Monte Falterona, one of the most elevated summits of the main chain of the
                    Tuscan Apennines, flows at first nearly south till in the neighbourhood of
                    Arezzo it turns abruptly to the north-west, and pursues that course as far as
                    Pontassieve, where it again makes a sudden bend to the west, and pursues a
                    westerly course from thence to the sea, passing through the two celebrated
                    cities of Florence and. Pisa. Its principal tributary is the Sieve, which joins
                    it at Pontassieve, bringing down the waters of the Vai di Mugello. The Elza and
                    the Era, which join it on its right bank, descending from the hills near Siena
                    and Volterra, are inconsiderable streams; and the Serchio, which flows from the
                    territory of Lucca and the Alpi Apuani, and formerly joined the Arno a few miles
                    from its mouth, now enters the sea by a separate channel. The most considerable
                    rivers of Tuscany south of the Arno are the Cecina, which flows through the
                    plain below Volterra, and the Ombrone, which rises in the hills near Siena, and
                    enters the sea about 12 miles below Grosseto.</p>
                <p>The Tiber, a much more important river than the Arno, and the largest in Italy
                    with the exception of the Po, rises in the Apennines, about 20 miles east of the
                    source of <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit13newyrich/page/n456/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0913-0456-0439"/> the Amo, and ∩ows nearly south by Borgo S.
                    Sepolcro and Città, di Castello, then between Perugia and Todi to Orte, just
                    below which it receives the waters of the Nera. Its tributaries in the upper
                    part of its course are of little importance, but the Nera, which rises in the
                    lofty group of the Monte della Sibilla, is a very considerable stream, and
                    brings with it the waters of the Velino (with its tributaries the Turano and the
                    Salto), which joins it a few miles below its celebrated waterfall at Terni. The
                    Teverone or Anio, which enters the Tiber a few miles above Rome, is a very
                    inferior stream to the Nera, but brings down a considerable body of water from
                    the mountains above Subiaco. It is a singular fact in the geography of Central
                    Italy that the valley of the Tiber and that of the Arno are in some measure
                    connected by that of the Chiana, a level and marshy tract, the waters from which
                    flow partly into the Arno and partly into the Tiber.</p>
                <p>The eastern declivity of the central Apennines towards the Adriatic is far less
                    interesting and varied than the western. The central range here approaches (as
                    has been already pointed out) much nearer to the sea, and hence, with few
                    exceptions, the rivers that flow from it ha√e but short courses and are of
                    comparatively little importance. They may be briefly enumerated, proceeding from
                    Rimini southwards :—(1) the Foglia; (2) the Metauro, of historical celebrity,
                    and affording access to one of the most frequented passes of the Apennines; (3)
                    the Esino; (4) the Potenza; (5) the Chienti; (6) the Aso; (7) the Tronto; (8)
                    the Vomano; (9) the Aterno; (10) the Sangro; (11) the Trign∩, which forms the
                    boundary of the southernmost province of the Abruzzi, and may therefore be taken
                    as the limit of Central Italy. Much the most considerable of these rivers is the
                    Aterno (called also the Pescara, from the city of that name at its mouth); this
                    has its sources in the Apennines above Aquila, and flows through a broad upland
                    valley in a south-east direction for above 40 miles till it approaches Popoli,
                    when it turns abruptly to the north-east, and cuts directly through the main
                    chain of the Apennines between the range of the Gran Sasso and that of the
                    Majella, descending with a very rapid course till it enters the sea at
                    Pescara.</p>
                <p>The whole of this portion of Central Italy, between the Apennines and the sea, is
                    a hilly country, much broken and cut up by the torrents from the mountains, but
                    fertile, especially in fruit-trees, olives, and vines; and hence it has been,
                    both in ancient and modern times, a populous district, containing many small
                    towns though no great cities. Its chief disadvantage is the absence of ports,
                    the coast preserving an almost unbroken straight line, with the single exception
                    of Ancona, which has in all ages been the only port worthy of the name on the
                    eastern coast of Central Italy.</p>
                <p>3. <hi rend="italic">Southern Italy.—</hi> The great central mass of the
                    Apennines, which has held its course throughout Central Italy, with a general
                    direction from north-west to southeast, may be considered as continued in the
                    same direction for about 100 miles farther, from the basin-shaped group of the
                    Monti del Matese (which rises to the height of 6660 feet) to the neighbourhood
                    of Potenza, in the heart of the province of Basilicata, corresponding nearly to
                    the ancient Lucania. The whole of the district known in ancient times as Samnium
                    (a part of which still retains the name of Sannio, though now officially
                    designated as the province of Molise) is occupied by an irregular mass of
                    mountains, of much inferior height to those of Central Italy, and having still
                    less of the character of a regular range, being broken up into a number of
                    groups or masses, intersected by rivers, which have for the most part a very
                    tortuous course. This mountainous tract, which has an average breadth of from 50
                    to 60 miles, is bounded on the west by the plain of Campania, now called the
                    Terra di Lavoro, and on the east by the much broader and more extensive tract of
                    Apulia or Puglia, composed partly of level plains, but for the most part of
                    undulating downs of very slight elevation, and contrasting strongly with the
                    mountain ranges of the Apennines, which rise abruptly above them. The central
                    mass of the mountains, however, throws out two outlying ranges, the one to the
                    west, which separates the Bay of Naples from that of Salerno, and culminates in
                    the Monte St Angelo above Castellamare (4720 feet), while the detached volcanic
                    cone of Vesuvius, which rises to near 4000 feet, is isolated from the
                    neighbouring mountains by an intervening strip of plain. On the east side in
                    like manner the Monte Gargano, a detached limestone mass which rises to the
                    height of 5120 feet, and projects in a bold spur-like promontory into the
                    Adriatic, forming the only break in the otherwise uniform coast-line of Italy on
                    that sea, though separated from the great body of the Apennines by a
                    considerable interval of low country, may be considered as merely an outlier
                    from the central mass.</p>
                <p>From the neighbourhood of Potenza, the main ridge of the Apennines is continued
                    by the Monti della Maddalena in a direction nearly due south, so that it
                    approaches within a short distance of the Gulf of Polieastro, from whence it is
                    carried on as far as the Monte Pollino, the last of the lofty summits of the
                    Apennine chain, which exceeds 7000 feet in height. The range is, however,
                    continued through the whole of the province now called Calabria, to the southern
                    extremity or “toe” of Italy, but presents in this part a very much altered
                    character, the broken limestone range which is the true continuation of the
                    chain as far as the neighbourhood of Nicastro and Catanzaro, and keeps close to
                    the west coast, being flanked on the east by a great mass of granitic mountains,
                    rising to a height of about 6000 feet, and covered with vast forests, from which
                    it derives the name of La Sila. A similar mass, but separated from the preceding
                    by a low neck of Tertiary hills, fills up the whole of the peninsular extremity
                    of Italy from Squillace to Reggio. Its highest point, called Aspromonte, attains
                    to a height of 4300 feet.</p>
                <p>While the rugged and mountainous district of Calabria, extending nearly due south
                    for a distance of more than 150 miles, thus derives its character and
                    configuration almost wholly from the range of the Apennines, by which it is
                    traversed from end to end, the case is wholly different with the long spur-like
                    promontory which projects towards the east to Brindisi and Otranto. The older
                    maps of Italy, indeed, with one accord represent the Apennines as bifurcating
                    somewhere in the neighbourhood of Venosa, and sending off an arm of the main
                    range through this eastern district, similar to that which traverses Calabria.
                    But this is entirely erroneous; the whole of the district in question is merely
                    a continuation of the low tract of Apulia, consisting of undulating downs and
                    low bare hills of very moderate elevation, with a dry calcareous soil of
                    Tertiary origin. The Monte Voltore, which rises in the neighbourhood of Melfi
                    and Venosa to a height of 4357 feet, <hi rend="subscript"> v</hi> is of volcanic
                    origin, and in great measure detached from the adjoining mass of the Apennines.
                    But eastward from this nothing like a mountain is to be found, the ranges of low
                    bare hills called the Murgie of Gravina and Altamura gradually <hi
                    rend="superscript"> 7</hi> sinking into the still more moderate level of those
                    which constitute the peninsular tract that extends between Brindisi and Taranto
                    as far as the Cape of Sta Maria di Leuca, the south-east extremity of Italy. It
                    is this projecting tract, which may be termed the “heel” or “spur” of Southern
                    Italy, that, in conjunction with the great promontory of Calabria, forms the
                    deep bay called the Gulf of Taranto, about 70 miles in width, and somewhat
                    greater <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit13newyrich/page/n457/mode/1up"

                    descend from the central mass of the Apennines.</p>
                <p>The rivers of Southern Italy are none of them of any great importance. The Liris
                    or Garigliano, which has its source in the central Apennines above Sora, not far
                    from the Lake Fucino, and enters the Gulf of Gaeta about 10 miles east of the
                    city of that name, brings down a considerable body of water; as does also the
                    Volturno, which rises in the mountains between Castel di Sangro and Agnone,
                    flows past Isernia, Venafro, and Capua, and enters the sea about 15 miles from
                    the mouth of the Garigliano. About 16 miles above Capua it receives the Calore,
                    which flows by Benevento, and is a tributary of some, importance. The Silarus or
                    Sele, which enters the Gulf of Salerno a few miles below the ruins of Paestum,
                    is the only other river of consideration on the western coast of Southern Italy.
                    Below this the watershed of the Apennines is too near to the sea on that side to
                    allow of the formation of any streams of importance. Hence the rivers that flow
                    in the opposite direction into the Adriatic and the Gulf of Taranto have much
                    longer courses, and are of more considerable volume and magnitude, though all of
                    them partaking of the character of mountain torrents, rushing down with great
                    violence in winter and after storms, but dwindling into scanty streams in the
                    summer, which hold a winding and sluggish course through the great plains of
                    Apulia. Proceeding south from the Trigno, which has been already mentioned as
                    constituting the limit of Central Italy, we find (1) the Biferno and (2) the
                    Fortore, both of them rising in the mountains of Samnium, and flowing into the
                    Adriatic west of Monte Gargano; (3) the Cervaro, south of the great promontory;
                    and (4) th) Ofanto, familiar to all scholars as the Aufidus of Horace, whose
                    description of it is characteristic of almost all the ri∣ ers of southern Italy,
                    of which it may be taken as the typical representative. It rises about 15 miles
                    west of Conza, and only about 25 miles from the Gulf of Salerno, so that it is
                    frequently (though erroneously) described as traversing the whole range of the
                    Apennines. In its lower course it flows near Canosa and traverses the celebrated
                    battlefield of Cannae. (5) The Bradan∩, which rises near Venosa, almost at the
                    foot of Monte Voltore, flows towards the south-east into the Gulf of Taranto, as
                    do the Basento, the Agri, and the Sinno, all of which descend from the central
                    chain of the Apennines south of Potenza, and water the extensive plains between
                    the mountains and the shores of the gulf. The Crati, which flows from Cosenzι
                    northwards, and then turns abruptly eastward to enter the same gulf, is the only
                    stream worthy of notice in the rugged peninsula of Calabria; while the long
                    extent of arid limestone hills projecting eastwards to Capo di Leuca does not
                    give rise to anything more than a mere streamlet, from the mouth of the Ofanto
                    to the south eastern extremity of Italy.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Lakes.—</hi> The only important lakes in Italy are those at the
                    foot of the Alps, formed by the expansion of the tributaries of the Po, which,
                    after descending from the mountain valleys in which they are at first confined,
                    spread out into considerable sheets of water before traversing the extensive
                    plain of Northern Italy. They have been already noticed in connexion with the
                    rivers by which they are formed, but may be again enumerated in order of
                    succession. They are, proceeding from west to east, (1) the Lago d’Orta, (2) the
                    Lago Maggiore, (3) the Lago di Lugano, (4) the Lago di Como, (5) the Lago
                    d’Iseo, (6) the Lago d’Idro, and (7) the Lago di Garda. Of these the last named
                    is considerably the largest, covering a superficial area of about 140 English
                    square miles. It is about 38 miles long by 12 broad at its southern extremity;
                    while the Lago Maggiore, notwithstanding its name, though considerably exceeding
                    it in length (42 miles), falls materially below it in superficial extent. They
                    are all of great depth,—the Lago Maggiore having in one part a depth of 2600
                    feet, while that of Como attains to 1925 feet. Of a wholly different character
                    is the Lago di Varese, between the Lago Maggiore and that of Lugano, which is a
                    mere shallow expanse of water, surrounded by hills of very moderate elevation.
                    Two other small lakes in the same neighbourhood, as well as those of Erba and
                    Pusiano, between Como and Lecco, are of a similar character, and scarcely worthy
                    of notice.</p>
                <p>The lakes of Central Italy, which are comparatively of trifling dimensions,
                    belong to a wholly different class. The most important of these, the Lacus
                    Fucinus of the ancients, now called the Lago di Celano, which is situated almost
                    exactly in the centre of the peninsula, occupies (as has been already pointed
                    out) a basin of considerable extent, surrounded on all sides by mountains, and
                    without any natural outlet, at an elevation of more than 2000 feet above the
                    sea. Its waters have of late years been in great part carried off by an
                    artificial channel, and more than half its surface laid bare. Next in size is
                    the Lago Trasimeno, often called the Lago di Perugia, so celebrated in Roman
                    history; it is a broad expanse of shallow waters, surrounded only by low hills,
                    but about 30 miles in circumference. The neighbouring lake of Chiusi is of
                    similar character, but much smaller dimensions. All the other lakes of Central
                    Italy, which are scattered through the volcanic districts west of the Apennines,
                    are of a wholly different formation, and occupy deep cup-shaped hollows, which
                    have undoubtedly at one time formed the craters of extinct volcanoes. Such is
                    the Lago di Bolsena, near the city of the same name, which is an extensive sheet
                    of water, as well as the much smaller Lago di Vico (the Ciminian lake of ancient
                    writers) and the Lago di Bracciano, nearer Rome, while again to the south of
                    Rome the well known lakes of Albano and Nemi have a similar origin.</p>
                <p>The only lake properly so called in Southern Italy is the Lago del Matese, in the
                    heart of the mountain group of the same name, of very trifling extent. The
                    so-called lakes on the coast of the Adriatic north and south of the promontory
                    of Gargano are in fact mere brackish lagoons communicating with the sea.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Islands.—</hi> The three great islands of Sicily, Sardinia, and
                    Corsica are so closely connected with Italy, both by geographical position and
                    community of language, that they are frequently spoken of as the Italian
                    Islands, but they will best be considered separately, and we shall here .confine
                    our attention to the smaller islands that lie scattered in the Mediterranean
                    within sight of the coasts of Italy. Of these by much the most considerable is
                    that of Elba, situated on the west coast of Central Italy, about 50 miles south
                    of Leghorn, and separated from the mainland at Piombino by a strait of only
                    about 6 miles in width. North of this, and just about midway between Corsica and
                    Tuscany, is the small island of Capraja, steep and rocky, and only 4J miles
                    long, but with a secure port; Gorgona, about 25 miles farther north, is still
                    smaller, and is a mere rock, inhabited only by a few fishermen. South of Elba
                    are the equally insignificant islets of Pianosa and Monte Cristo, while the more
                    considerable island of Giglio lies much nearer the mainland, immediately
                    opposite the remarkable mountain promontory of Monte Argentaro, itself almost an
                    island. Of a wholly different character are the islands that are found farther
                    south in the Tyrrhenian Sea. Of these Ischia and Procida, both of them situated
                    almost close to the northern headland of the Bay of Naples, are entirely of
                    volcanic origin, as is the case also with the more distant group of the Ponza
                    Islands. These are three in number—Ponza, Palmaruola, and Zannone; while
                    Vandotena (also of volcanic formation) is <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit13newyrich/page/n458/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0913-0458-0441"/> about midway between Ponza and Ischia. The island
                    of Capri, on the other hand, which is just opposite to the southern promontory
                    of the Bay of Naples, is a precipitous limestone rock. The Aeolian or Lipari
                    Islands, a remarkable volcanic group, belong rather to Sicily than to Italy,
                    though Stromboli, the most easterly of them, is about equidistant from Sicily
                    and from the mainland. The islands to the south of Sicily—Malta and Gozo, and
                    Pantellaria—in like manner do not fall within the scope of the present article.
                    Malta indeed has very little natural connexion with Sicily, and none with the
                    continent of Italy.</p>
                <p>The Italian coast of the Adriatic presents a great contrast to its opposite
                    shores, for while the coast of Dalmatia is bordered by a succession of islands,
                    great and small, the long and uniform coast-line of Italy from Otranto to Rimini
                    presents not a single adjacent island; and the small outlying group of the
                    Tremiti Islands (north of the Monte Gargano and about 15 miles from the
                    mainland) alone breaks the monotony of this part of the Adriatic.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Climate and Natural Productions.</hi></p>
                <p>The geographical position of Italy, extending from about 46° to 38° N. lat.,
                    naturally renders it one of the hottest countries in Europe. But the effect of
                    its southern latitude is to a great extent tempered by its peninsular character,
                    bounded as it is on both sides by seas of considerable extent, as well as by the
                    great range of the Alps with its snows and glaciers to the north. Great
                    differences also exist with regard to climate between Northern and Southern
                    Italy, due in great part to other circumstances as well as to difference of
                    latitude. Thus the great plain of Northern Italy is chilled by the cold winds
                    from the Alps, while the damp warm winds from the Mediterranean are to a great
                    extent intercepted by the Ligurian Apennines. Hence this part of the country has
                    a cold winter climate, so that the thermometer descends as low as 10° Fahr., and
                    the mean winter temperature of Turin is actually lower than that of Copenhagen.
                    Throughout the region north of the Apennines no plants will thrive which cannot
                    stand occasional severe frosts in winter, so that not only oranges and lemons
                    but even the olive tree cannot be grown, except in specially favoured
                    situations. On the other hand the strip of coast between the Apennines and the
                    sea, known as the Riviera of Genoa, is not only extremely favourable to the
                    growth of olives, but produces oranges and lemons in abundance, while even the
                    aloe, the cactus, and the palm flourish in many places. Indeed, the vegetation
                    of parts of this favoured district has amore southern character than is met with
                    again till below Terracina towards the south. The great plain of Lombardy,
                    however, produces ri.e in large quantities, as well as Indian corn, millet, and
                    wheat; while the mountain slopes both of the Alps and Apennines are covered with
                    vast forests of chestnuts, and the lower hills are clothed with vineyards, which
                    furnish abundance of wines, many of them of excellent quality. Silk is also an
                    important article of produce both in the north of Italy and in Tuscany, and
                    mulberries are largely planted with a view to its production.</p>
                <p>Central Italy also presents striking differences of climate and temperature
                    according to the greater or less proximity to the mountains. Thus the greater
                    part of Tuscany, and the provinces from thence to Rome, enjoy a mild winter
                    climate, and are well adapted to the growth of mulberries and olives as well as
                    vines, but it is not till after passing Terracina, in proceeding along the
                    western coast towards the south, that the vegetation of Southern Italy develops
                    itself in its full luxuriance. Even in the central parts of Tuscany, however,
                    the climate is very much affected by the neighbouring mountains, and the
                    increasing elevation of the Apennines as they proceed south naturally produces a
                    corresponding effect upon the temperature. But it is when we reach the central
                    range of the Apennines that we find the coldest districts of Italy. In all the
                    upland valleys of the Abruzzi and of Sannio, snow begins to fall early in
                    November, and heavy storms occur often as late as May; whole communities are
                    shut out for months from any intercourse with their neighbours, and some
                    villages are so long buried in snow that regular passages are made between the
                    different houses for the sake of communication among the-inhabitants. The
                    district extending from the south-east of Lake Fucino to the Piano di
                    Cinquemiglia, and enclosing the upper basin of the Sangro and the small lake of
                    Scanno, is the coldest and most bleak part of Italy south of the Alps. Heavy
                    falls of snow in June are not uncommon,, and it is only for a short time towards
                    the end of July that the nights are totally exempt from light frosts. Yet less
                    than 40 miles east of this district, and even more to the north, we find the
                    olive, the fig-tree, and the orange thriving luxuriantly on the shores of the
                    Adriatic from Ortona to Vasto. In the same way, whilst in the plains and hills
                    round Naples snow is rarely seen, and never remains long, and the thermometer
                    seldom descends to the freezing point, 20 miles east from it in the fertile
                    valley of Avellino, of no great elevation, but encircled by high mountains,
                    light frosts are not uncommon as late as June; and 18 miles farther east, in the
                    elevated region of S. Angelo de’ Lombardi and Bisaccia, the inhabitants are
                    always warmly clad, and vines grow with difficulty and only in sheltered,
                    places. But nowhere are these contrasts so striking as in Calabria. The shores,
                    especially on the Tyrrhenian Sea, present almost a continued grove of olive,
                    orange, lemon, and citron trees, which attain a size unknown in the north of
                    Italy. The sugar-cane flourishes, the cotton-plant ripens to perfection,
                    date-trees are seen in the gardens, the rocks are clothed with the prickly-pear
                    or Indian fig, the enclosures of the fields are formed by aloes and sometimes
                    pomegranates, the liquorice-root grows wild, and the mastic, the myrtle, and
                    many varieties of oleander and cistus form the underwood of the natural forests
                    of arbutus and evergreen oak. If we turn inland but 5 or 6 miles from the shore,
                    and often even less, the scene changes. High districts covered with oaks and
                    chestnuts succeed to this almost tropical vegetation; a little higher up and we
                    reach the elevated regions of the Pollino and the Sila, covered with firs and
                    pines, and affording rich pastures even in the midst of summer, when heavy dews
                    and light frosts succeed each other in July and August, and snow begins to
                    appear at the end of September or early in October. Along the shores of the
                    Adriatic, which are exposed to the north-east winds, blowing coldly from over
                    the Albanian mountains, delicate plants do not thrive so well in general as
                    under the same latitude along the shores of the Tyrrhenian Sea.</p>
                <p>Southern Italy indeed has in general a very different climate from the northern
                    portion of the kingdom; and, though large tracts are still occupied by rugged
                    mountains of sufficient elevation to retain the snow for a considerable part of
                    the year, the districts adjoining thejsea enjoy a climate similar to that of
                    Greece and the southern provinces of Spain. Unfortunately several of these
                    fertile tracts suffer severely from malaria, and especially the great plain
                    adjoining the Gulf of Tarentum, which in the early ages of history was
                    surrounded by a girdle of Greek cities, —some of which attained to almost
                    unexampled prosperity, —has for centuries past been given up to almost complete
                    desolation.</p>
                <p>It is remarkable that, of the vegetable producti ns of Italy, many of those which
                    are at the present day among the first to attract the attention of the visitor,
                    and might be thought characteristic of the country, are of comparatively<pb

                    ancient times. The olive indeed in all ages clothed the hills of a large part of
                    the country; but the orange and lemon, which now constitute so prominent a
                    feature in the warmer districts of the peninsula, are a late importation from
                    the East, while the cactus or Indian fig and the aloe, both of them so
                    conspicuous on the shores of southern Italy, as well as of the Riviera of Genoa,
                    are of Mexican origin, and consequently could not have been introduced earlier
                    than the 16th century. The same remark applies to the maize or Indian corn,
                    which is now so extensively cultivated in every part of Italy. Many botanists
                    are even of opinion that the sweet chestnut, which now constitutes so large a
                    part of the forests that clothe the sides both of the Alps and the Apennines,
                    and in some districts supplies the chief food of the inhabitants, is not
                    originally of Italian growth; it is certain at least that it had not attained in
                    ancient times to anything like the extension and importance which it possesses
                    at the present day.</p>
                <p>It may have been gathered from the preceding sketch of the physical conformation
                    and the climate of Italy that it is difficult to take a general view of the
                    state of its agriculture. The cultivation of Lombardy differs from that of
                    Calabria as much as that of Massachusetts does from that of Carolina. All that
                    can be done therefore in this general description is to notice those results of
                    agriculture which yield food, drink, or clothing to its inhabitants, or which
                    form the basis of manufacturing industry or the rudiments of foreign commerce.
                    The cereals form, as elsewhere in Europe, the chief aliment of the inhabitants;
                    in Italy, however, the lower classes in many parts subsist much on maize and
                    beans, which require little preparation to render them fit for food. In some of
                    the southern provinces wheat is made use of by the same class, both in the form
                    of bread and as macaroni, which is manipulated with great facility. Wheat and
                    maize are, on the average of years, about equal to the consumption, but little
                    can be spared for exportation; and in many of the ports •depots of foreign wheat
                    are kept to meet the variations of seasons, or to be used as articles of
                    commerce with other countries.</p>
                <p>As Italy produces abundance of wine, and consequently needs neither beer nor
                    grain-spirits, no barley is needed for these drinks, and scarcely any is
                    cultivated. Oats are but little grown, but beans of various kinds are produced
                    in abundance. Rye, the common bread-corn of the far greater portion of Europe,
                    is only raised in a few spots in the very northernmost parts of Italy, where it
                    is made into bread for the poor; whilst those of the higher classes there, as
                    well as throughout the whole peninsula in the cities, make use of wheaten bread.
                    Rice grows in many parts, in fact wherever there is a sufficiency of water to
                    insure a good produce, at such a distance from towns as not to be injurious to
                    the health of the inhabitants. A great variety of lupines are used as food,
                    especially in the soups. In some parts of the mountainous regions chestnuts are
                    a substitute for corn, and even form the principal food of the population.
                    Fruits are plentifully used, particularly figs, grapes, and melons, as food;
                    whilst .the cheapness of onions, garlic, tornatos or love-apples, and capsicums
                    renders them valuable as condiments. The potato, which ,is in such common use in
                    other parts of Europe, has been but partially introduced into Italy; and, where
                    it is cultivated, it occupies a very small proportion of the soil. Lettuces,
                    asparagus, endive, artichokes, and several kinds of turnips and of carrots are
                    grown everywhere.</p>
                <p>Animal food is far from being extensively used. The oxen yield in some parts
                    excellent in others very indifferent meat. The mutton is neither good nor
                    abundant, but has been much improved of late years. Swine furnish a plentiful
                    supply during the winter months; they are also prepared as bacon or hams, and
                    above all as sausages, the fame of which has reached England under the name of
                    the city of Bologna, where they were early and extensively prepared. The large
                    dairy farms in Lombardy also furnish great quantities of cheese of very superior
                    quality, especially that known by the name of Parmesan.</p>
                <p>The fisheries contribute largely to the supply of food in Italy, though, from the
                    number of fasts countenanced by the Catholic Church, not enough for the
                    consumption; and the deficiency is procured by commerce with the English,
                    French, and Americans, who convey to the seaports salted cod-fish from the banks
                    of Newfoundland. The native fisheries on the coast give much occupation; the
                    most considerable are those for the tunny, a very large fish, and for the
                    anchovy, a very small one. These are conducted upon a large scale by joint-stock
                    companies. The lakes and the rivers also yield some, though not a great
                    proportion, of that kind of food which ecclesiastical restrictions render
                    indispensable.</p>
                <p>The sugar-cane is not cultivated in the south of Italy, as it is found that in
                    point of strength, as well as of cost,' the sugar made from it does not succeed
                    in competition with that imported from the West Indies.</p>
                <p>The products of agriculture are sufficient for the clothing of all its
                    inhabitants; for, though wool is in general neither good nor plentiful, hemp and
                    flax are grown everywhere, and are manufactured at home; and, from the nature of
                    the climate, linen can be substituted for woollen dress during most of the
                    months of the year. Some cotton is grown in the southern divisions of Italy, but
                    not sufficient to furnish materials for their inconsiderable manufactures of
                    that article.</p>
                <p>The chief product of Italian agriculture is silk. It is produced in every part,
                    and much of is it converted into articles of dress or of furniture, where it is
                    collected; but the chief production of it is in the Neapolitan provinces and
                    Lombardy, whence the looms of England, Austria, Russia, and Germany are
                    supplied. The value of this commodity exceeds that of all the other productions
                    of Italy which are exported to foreign countries. The manufacture has of late
                    years made great progress, which it is still steadily maintaining, and the great
                    increase which has taken place in the propagation of the mulberry tree has,
                    within the last fifty years, increased the quantity of raw silk to an extent
                    that had never before been dreamed of.</p>
                <p>Another very important Italian product, which is partly used as food, partly
                    employed in home manufactures, and extensively exported as an article of foreign
                    commerce, is the oil of the olive tree. It is used as a substitute for butter in
                    the south, and even to a great degree supplies the place of milk, which is
                    comparatively little used in the peninsula. It is exported to England for use
                    with various fabrics, and as a table luxury. The planting and watching costs but
                    little labour or expense, and in a few years the income more than repays the
                    labour. The best olive oil is produced near Genoa, in Lucca, in Tuscany, and in
                    Calabria; but it is plentiful throughout the whole of Italy, except,in Lombardy
                    and in Piedmont.</p>
                <p>The -wines of Italy are not very highly valued in other countries, and almost the
                    whole that is produced is consumed at home. Vet there is little doubt that with
                    more care in the culture and preparation they might rival those of the best
                    parts of Europe. The vines are not so much grown in vineyards as in the
                    hedge-rows,—a system which doubtless injures the quality of the wine. In the
                    southern parts, however, where the vines are grown in low vineyards as in
                    Fχance, the wines are of higher quality.</p>
                <p>The mineral productions of Italy are of comparatively small value; but the copper
                    mines of Tuscany, which were <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit13newyrich/page/n460/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0913-0460-0443"/> extensively wrought in ancient times, are still
                    worked to a considerable extent. The iron of Elba, so celebrated in antiquity,
                    still bears a high character for its excellent quality, but the quantity
                    produced is limited. Many marbles of superior quality are found in different
                    parts of the Apennines, of which the white statuary marble of Carrara is the
                    most celebrated. Alabaster also abounds in Tuscany. Coal is wanting in all parts
                    of the peninsula, which must ever be a great drawback to the prosperity of
                    Italy.</p>
                <p>The geology of Italy is mainly dependent upon that of the <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Apennines</hi><hi rend="italic">ljpvf.</hi> On each side of that great chain,
                    which, as has been already stated, with its ramifications and underfalls, fills
                    up the greater part of the peninsula, are found extensive Tertiary deposits,
                    sometimes, as in Tuscany, the Monferrat, &lt;fec., forming a broken, hilly
                    country, at others spreading into broad plains or undulating downs, such as the
                    Tavoliere of Puglia, and the tract that forms the spur of Italy from Bari to
                    Otranto.</p>
                <p>But besides these, and leaving out of account the islands, the Italian peninsula
                    presents four distinct volcanic .districts. In three of them the volcanoes are
                    entirely extinct, while the fourth is still in great activity.</p>
                <p>(1) The Euganean hills form a small group extending for about 10 miles from the
                    neighbourhood of Padua to Este, and separated from the lower offshoots of the
                    Alps by a portion of the wide plain of the Padovano. Monte Venda, their highest
                    peak, is 1806 feet high.</p>
                <p>(2) The Roman district, the largest of the four, extends from the hills of Albano
                    to the frontier of Tuscany, and from the lower slopes of the Apennines to the
                    Tyrrhenian Sea. It may be divided into three groups :—the Monti Albani, the
                    highest of which, Monte Cavo, 3160 feet, is the ancient Mons Albanus, on the
                    summit of which stood the temple of Jupiter Latialis, where the assemblies of
                    the cities forming the Latin confederation were held; the Monti Cimini, which
                    extend from the valley of the Tiber to the neighbourhood of Civita Vecchia, and
                    attain at their culminating point an elevation of more than 3000 feet; and the
                    mountains of Radicofani and Monte Λmiata, the latter of which is 5650 feet high.
                    The lakes of Bolsena (Vulsiniensis), of Bracciano (Sabatinus), of Vico
                    (Ciminus), of Albano (Albanus), of Nemi (Nemorensis), and other smaller ones
                    belong to this district; while between its -south-west extremity and Monte
                    Circello the Pontine Marshes form a broad strip of alluvial soil infested by
                    malaria.</p>
                <p>(3) The volcanic region of Terra di Lavoro is separated by the Volscian mountains
                    from the Roman district. It may be also divided into three groups. Of
                    Roccamonfina, at the north-north-west end of the Campanian Plain, the highest
                    cone, called Montagna di Santa Croce, is 3200 feet. The Phlegraean Fields
                    embrace all the country round Baiae and Pozuoli and the adjoining islands. Monte
                    Barbaro (Gaurus), north-east of the site of Cumae, Monte S. Nicola (Epomeus),
                    2610 feet, in Ischia, and Camaldoli, 1488 feet, west of Naples, are the highest
                    cones. The lakes Averno (Avernus), Lucrino (Lucrinus), Fusaro (Palus Acherusia),
                    and Agnano are within this group, which has shown activity in historical times.
                    A stream of lava issued in 1198 from the crater of the Solfatara, which still
                    continues to exhale steam and noxious gases; the Lava dell’ Arso came out of the
                    north-east flank of Monte Epomeo in 1302; and Monte Nuovo, north-west of
                    Pozzuoli, 440 feet high, was thrown up in three days in September 1538. Since
                    its first historical eruption in 79 <hi rend="smallcaps">a.d.,</hi> Vesuvius or
                    Somma, •which forms the third group, has been in constant activity, and repeated
                    eruptions have taken place within the last few years. The Punta del Nasone, the
                    highest point of iSomma, is 3747 feet high, while the Punta del Palo, the
                    highest point of the brim of the crater of Vesuvius, varies materially with
                    successive eruptions from 3856 to 4235 feet.</p>
                <p>(4) The Apulian volcanic formation consists of the great mass of Monte Voltore,
                    which rises at the west end of the plains of Apulia, on the frontier of
                    Basilicata, and is surrounded by the Apennines on its south-west and north-west
                    sides. Its highest peak, the Pizzuto di Melfi, attains an elevation of 4357
                    feet. Within the widest crater there are the two small lakes of Monticchio and
                    S. Michele.</p>
                <p>In connexion with the volcanic districts we may mention <hi rend="italic"
                    >Le</hi><hi rend="italic">Hofete,</hi> the Pools of Amsanctus (Amsancti Vallis),
                    lying in a wooded valley south-east of Frigento, in the centre of Principato
                    Ultra and described by Virgil <hi rend="italic">(Aeneid,</hi> vii. 563 -71). The
                    largest of the two is not more than 160 feet in circumference, and 7 feet deep.
                    These pools emit noxious gases which, when wafted from the pools by the wind,
                    endanger animal life in the open air.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Ethnography and Ancient Geography.</hi></p>
                <p>The ethnography of ancient Italy is a very complicated and difficult subject, and
                    notwithstanding the researches of modern scholars is still involved in much
                    obscurity. The great beauty and fertility of the country, as well as the charm
                    of its climate, undoubtedly attracted from the earliest ages successive swarms
                    of invaders from the north, who sometimes drove out the previous occupants of
                    the most favoured districts, at others reduced them to a state of serfdom, or
                    settled down in the midst of them, until the two races gradually coalesced into
                    one. Ancient writers all agreed in regard to the fact of the composite character
                    of the population of Italy, and the diversity of races that were found within
                    the limits of the peninsula. But unfortunately the traditions they have
                    transmitted to us are very various and conflicting, and probably in many
                    instances founded on inadequate information, while the only safe test of the
                    affinities of nations, derived from the comparison of their languages, is to a
                    great extent deficient, from the fact that, with the single exception of Latin,
                    all the idioms that prevailed in Italy in the earliest ages have disappeared, or
                    are preserved only in a few scanty and fragmentary inscriptions. Imperfect as
                    are the means thus afforded to the philological student, they have been of late
                    years diligently turned to account, especially by German scholars, and, when
                    combined with the notices derived from ancient writers, may be considered as
                    having furnished some results that maybe relied on with reasonable
                    certainty.</p>
                <p>Leaving aside for the present the populations of Northern Italy, which belong to
                    a wholly different stock, the inhabitants of the peninsula may be regarded as
                    belonging to three principal divisions. Of these the Messapians or Iapygians in
                    the south may be considered as constituting one; while the different nations of
                    Central Italy, the Umbrians, Oscans, Sabines, and Latins, may also be classed as
                    belonging to one great family; and on the other hand the Etruscans in the west
                    undoubtedly formed a nation apart, distinct from all others within the confines
                    of Italy.</p>
                <p>1. <hi rend="italic">The Iαpygians and</hi><hi rend="italic">Oenotrians.</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">—</hi> It is certain that when the first Greek colonies in the 8th
                    and 9th centuries <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> established themselves in the
                    extreme south of Italy, they found the country in the possession of a people to
                    whom they gave the name of Oenotrians,—a name which appears to have been
                    somewhat vaguely applied by different writers so as to include a wider area or
                    be restricted within narrower limits. But the peninsula which strctcbes eastward
                    towards Greece was inhabited by a people termed by the Greeks Messapians or
                    Iapygians, whose relations to the Oenotrians are not very clearly intimated. It
                    is unfortunately in this part of the country almost exclusively that <pb

                    found, and these consist of inscriptions of so brief and fragmentary a character
                    as to afford a very imperfect basis for philological inferences. Such as they
                    are, however, they seem to lead to the conclusion that the language spoken in
                    this part of Italy was essentially distinct from the Oscan and Sabellian
                    dialects of Central Italy; while at the same time they present sufficient
                    analogies with the Latin on the one hand and the Greek on the other to show that
                    they belonged to the same family with those two well-known languages. The
                    results, therefore, of the recent examination of these long neglected documents
                    appear distinctly to confirm the statements of ancient authors, according to
                    which the inhabitants of the southern portion of the peninsula were a Pelasgic
                    race,—a term used by them in a very vague and general manner, but usually
                    employed to designate the most ancient inhabitants both of Greece and Italy, who
                    probably belonged to the same branch of the great Aryan race. The Pelasgic
                    origin of the Oenotrians is not only asserted by the concurrent testimony of
                    many ancient authors, but we are told that the native population of Southern
                    Italy, who had been reduced to a state of serfdom analogous to that of the
                    Penestae in Thessaly and the Helots in Laconia were still called Pelasgi. The
                    evidence as to the Pelasgic origin of the Messapians or Iapygians is less
                    definite; but the mythical genealogies in which the earliest Greek authors
                    embodied the received traditions concerning the relations of different tribes
                    and nations all point to the same conclusion; and they certainly regarded the
                    neighbouring tribes of the Peucetians and Daunians, who occupied a part of the
                    country subsequently known as Apulia, as derived from the same stock. A strong
                    confirmation of this view is found in the facility with which the inhabitants of
                    these countries assimilated Greek customs and manners, though the actual Greek
                    colonies founded among them in historical times were comparatively few.</p>
                <p>It must be observed that the name of Italians was at one time confined to the
                    Oenotrians; indeed, according to Antiochus of Syracuse, the name of Italy was at
                    first still more limited, being applied only to the southern portion of the
                    peninsula now known as Calabria. But in the time of that historian, as well as
                    of Thucydides, the names of Oenotria and Italia, which appear to have been at
                    that period regarded as synonymous, had come to be extended so as to include the
                    shore of the Tarentine Gulf as far as Metapontum and from thence across to the
                    Gulfs of Laus and Posidonia on the Tyrrhenian Sea. It thus still comprised only
                    the two provinces subsequently known as Lucania and Bruttium.</p>
                <p>2. The tribes of Central Italy, from the Umbrians in the north to the Campanians
                    in the south, are known by existing remains of their languages to have spoken
                    cognate dialects, presenting unquestionable affinities with each other, as well
                    as with the earlier forms of the well-known language of the Latins. The
                    differences, however, are still very considerable, and confirm the testimony of
                    historical tradition, as preserved to us by ancient writers, in leading us to
                    divide them into five separate groups, viz., the Umbrians, Sabines, Latins,
                    Volscians, and Oscans, or as they are sometimes termed Sabellians, including the
                    Samnites and Campanians, and the tribes (such as the Lucanians, Frentani,
                    &amp;c.) who are distinctly recorded to have emanated from the Samnites.</p>
                <p>(1) The <hi rend="italic">Umbrians,</hi> who occupied in historical times the
                    eastern portion of the peninsula between Etruria and the Adriatic, were at an
                    earlier period a much more powerful nation, and not only occupied the extensive
                    tract subsequently wrested from them by the Gauls, but extended their dominion
                    from sea to sea, and held the greater part, if not the whole, of the territory
                    afterwards possessed by the Etruscans, which is said to have been wrested by
                    that people foot by foot from the Umbrians. The concurrent voice of the
                    traditions preserved to us from antiquity points to the Umbrians as one of the
                    most ancient nations of Italy; and this is confirmed by the still extant remains
                    of their language as shown in the celebrated inscriptions known as the <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Eugubine Tables</hi><hi rend="italic">{q.v.),</hi> by far the
                    most important monument of any of the early Italian languages that has been
                    transmitted to our time. The elaborate examination of this valuable record in
                    recent times may be considered as establishing clearly, on the one hand, the
                    distinctness of the language from that of the neighbouring Etruscans, and, on
                    the other, its close affinity with the Oscan, as spoken by the Sabellian tribes,
                    and with the old Latin. The same researches tend to prove that the Umbrian
                    dialect is the most ancient of these cognate tongues, and probably represents
                    most nearly the original form of this branch of the great Indo-Teutonic family.
                    They may be taken also as distinctly negativing the theory put forth by some
                    ancient writers, and maintained by several modern inquirers, that the Umbrians
                    were a Celtic race.</p>
                <p>Before the time when the Umbrians came into contact with the advancing power of
                    Rome, their importance had greatly declined. The Etruscans had conquered from
                    them the whole territory west of the Apennines, from the foot of the mountains
                    to the Tyrrhenian Sea, while the Senonian Gauls, who invaded the north of Italy
                    in the 4th century <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.,</hi> permanently established
                    themselves in possession of the fertile district between the Apennines and the
                    Adriatic, extending from the neighbourhood of Ravenna to that of Ancona, which
                    continued to be known until long afterwar ds as the “Ager Gallicus.”</p>
                <p>(2) The <hi rend="italic">Sabines</hi> are a people of whom, familiar as is their
                    name to the student of Roman history, we know very little. Their language is
                    totally lost; not a single inscription has been preserved to us, and it appears
                    to have fallen into disuse at a comparatively early period. But even from the
                    few scattered notices of Sabine words preserved by Roman grammarians it is
                    evident that it possessed strong affinities with the Oscan and Umbrian; and the
                    facility with which it passed into those of the neighbouring races is a strong
                    reason against there being any marked diversity between them. The traditions
                    recorded by ancient writers, untrustworthy as they are in detail, all concur in
                    pointing to the same result,—that the Sabines were a very ancient people, who,
                    at the earliest period of which any memory was preserved, were settled in the
                    lofty mountain districts about the sources of the A ternus and the Velinus, from
                    which they subsequently descended into the more fertile valleys about Reate, and
                    at one time extended their dominion to within a few miles of Rome,—Cures, which
                    was universally reckoned a Sabine city, being only 24 miles from the capital,
                    while Nomentum and Eretum, still nearer Rome, are included by several writers as
                    Sabine towns.</p>
                <p>That a people inhabiting so rugged and inclement a district as that which is
                    represented as the original abode of the Sabines should have spread themselves
                    into the neighbouring regions, and established offshoots in somewhat more
                    favoured lands, is entirely in accordance with probability, and hence we can
                    have no difficulty in accepting the tradition that the Picentes, or inhabitants
                    of Picenum,—the fertile district along the coast of the Adriatic between that
                    sea and the main ridge of the Apennines, from beyond Ancona to the river
                    Matrino,—were of Sabine origin. The same thing is expressly asserted by Ovid
                    (himself a native of the district) of the Peligni, a tribe who occupied the
                    upland valley of the Gizio, of which Sulmo was the capital; and there can be
                    little doubt that the <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit13newyrich/page/n462/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0913-0462-0445"/> sime remark applied to three other tribes which
                    were contiguous to them, and always appear in the Roman history in close
                    political union with them :—the Marsi, who held the basin of the Lake Fucino and
                    the surrounding mountains, and the Vestini and Marrucini, who extended from the
                    confines of the Marsi and Peligni down to the Adriatic, each people occupying
                    but a narrow strip on the north and south sides respectively of the Aternus.</p>
                <p>(3) The <hi rend="italic">Latins,</hi> who were destined in the end to become the
                    rulers of all Italy, were in the first instance a comparatively insignificant
                    people, surrounded on all sides by more powerful nations. When we first become
                    acquainted with their history they occupied only the tract extending from the
                    Tiber on the north to the Volscian mountains and the Pontine Marshes on the
                    south, and from the sea to the underfalls of the Apennines about Tibur (Tivoli)
                    and Praeneste (Palestrina). It was not till a much later period that the name of
                    Latium was extended so as to include the land of the Volscians and the Aurunci
                    to the borders of Campania.</p>
                <p>The ethnical relations of the Latins have been peculiarly confused by the
                    conflicting statements of ancient authors, who endeavoured to connect them on
                    the one hand with the vast floating mass of Greek traditions, and on the other
                    to add dignity to their origin by tracing them back to indigenous heroes or
                    deities. Of their real origin as a people, or of the period when they first
                    settled in the fertile district where we find them established at the dawn of
                    historical record, we have no trustworthy information. But from the manifold
                    traditions preserved to us by Dionysius and other authors we may perhaps gather
                    two facts. The statement that the Latins were derived (in part at least) from a
                    people who dwelt originally in the lofty mountains of the central Apennines,
                    from whence they descended into the comparatively fertile region between the
                    mountains and the sea, probably represents in a general way correctly the course
                    of their immigration; while the idea involved in several of these traditions,
                    that the population of ancient Latium was in part derived from a Pelasgic
                    origin, is confirmed by philological investigation of the Latin language, which
                    may be considered as establishing the conclusion that it contained a
                    considerable Pelasgic or old Greek element, together with another portion which
                    was common to the languages of the adjacent nations of Central Italy, the
                    Umbrians, Oscans, &lt;tc., whom we are now considering. The co existence of
                    these two diverse elements in Latin was long ago pointed out by Niebuhr, who
                    attributed it to the conquest of one race by another at a period anterior to all
                    historical record. It may perhaps be more safely ascribed to the branching off
                    of the Latin race from the parent stock at an earlier period than the other
                    languages of Central Italy, while the differences that separated them from those
                    of the early inhabitants of Greece were less marked than they afterwards
                    became.</p>
                <p>(4) The <hi rend="italic">Volscians,</hi> who ultimately became merged in the
                    more progressive Latin race, are undoubtedly represented to us in the early
                    Roman history as a distinct people, not only politically separate from the Latin
                    league, but having a distinct language of their own, which was neither Latin nor
                    Oscan. The very scanty remains of it that have been preserved to us by
                    inscriptions, while they confirm this statement, show at the same time
                    remarkable analogies with the Umbrian, and thus tend to prove that the Volscians
                    had occupied from a very early period the rugged mountain district where we find
                    them established in historical times, and had retained their dialect with less
                    change than their Sabellian and Oscan neighbours.</p>
                <p>Of the <hi rend="italic">Aequians,</hi> who held a mountainous district adjoining
                    that of the Volscians, we cannot be said to know anything beyond the fact that
                    the two nations appear constantly in Roman history in alliance against the
                    rising republic, from which, however, we are hardly entitled to argue their
                    common descent. But it is certain that both the Aequians and the petty tribe of
                    the <hi rend="italic">Hernicans</hi> are in early ages uniformly represented as
                    distinct from the Latins, though their territory was included in Latium, in the
                    more extended sense of the term, while the native population had in the days of
                    Livy almost wholly disappeared.</p>
                <p>(5) The <hi rend="italic">Oscans,</hi> or as the Greeks wrote the name <hi
                    rend="italic">Opicans</hi> (the native form was <hi rend="italic">Op
                    scans),</hi> were the possessors of the greater part of Central Italy, as well
                    as the southern part of the peninsula, at the time that the Romans were carrying
                    on their long protracted struggle for its dominion. At the same time it must be
                    observed that it was never used in ancient times as a proper ethnic appellation.
                    No tribe or nation of the name appears among those with which Rome was engaged
                    in hostilities; and, though the term Oscan is frequently used by ancient writers
                    as applied to the language of Campania, there is no proof that it was ever
                    employed by them in the more general sense adopted by modern scholars. It is,
                    however, as a matter of convenience, a useful term to designate the nation or
                    group of tribes composed of the Samnites, together with their descendants or
                    offshoots, the Campanians, Lucanians, and Bruttians. The name Sabellians, used
                    by the Roman poets, has been employed by some modern writers in much the same
                    signification.</p>
                <p>Of the nations comprised under this general appellation, much the most powerful
                    were the <hi rend="italic">Samnites,</hi> who occupied, not merely the small
                    mountain district known in modern days as Sannio, but the whole region of the
                    central Apennines from the upper valley of the Sagrus (Sangro) on the north to
                    that of the Aufidus on the south, while towards the west they held the valleys
                    of the Vulturous and its various tributaries down to the point where they
                    emerged into the fertile plain of Campania. The territory thus defined was, like
                    that of the Sabines, a wholly inland district, but the Samnites were not long
                    content with these narrow limits, and at an early period we find them carrying
                    their arms and extending their settlements to the sea on both sides. The
                    Frentani, who separated them from the Adriatic to the north, are distinctly
                    termed by Strabo a Samnite people, and distinguished by him as such from the
                    adjoining tribes of the Vestini and Marrucini. A more important extension was
                    that towards the west, where they conquered the whole of the rich province of
                    Campania, with the exception of the districts on the coast still retained by the
                    Greek colonies. This conquest appears to have taken place as late at the 5th
                    century <hi rend="smallcaps">b,c.,</hi> but the same causes continued in
                    operation, and during the course of the next half century the Samnites spread
                    themselves through the whole of Lucania, and even carried their arms to the
                    extremity of the southern peninsula. The Lucanians therefore, when they first
                    became known to the Romans, were a Samnite people, though possessing a separate
                    political organization. They at this time ruled over the whole country called by
                    the Greeks Oenotria, down to the Sicilian Strait, and had reduced the previous
                    inhabitants to a state of serfdom. Hence not long afterwards there arose in the
                    southernmost part of the peninsula (the modern Calabria) an insurrection,
                    represented as a mere casual outbreak of outlaws and fugitive slaves, but
                    probably in reality a revolt of the native population who, under the name of
                    Bruttians, established their independence, and retained possession of the whole
                    of this wild and mountainous country, till they passed, together with the
                    Lucanians, under the all-absorbing dominion of Rome.</p>
                <p>It is more difficult to. determine to what extent the Apulians had received an
                    admixture of the Samnite <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit13newyrich/page/n463/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0913-0463-0446"/> element, but there seems no doubt that the
                    northern part of the province known to the Romans under that name had been
                    occupied by a Samnite population, while the tribes south of Mount Garganus—the
                    Daunians and Peucetians—probably retained their nationality, though brought
                    under subjection by the Samnites.</p>
                <p>The monuments of the Oscan language, though not numerous, are more considerable
                    than those of any other of the early Italian languages, except the Umbrian, and
                    can for the most part be interpreted with reasonable certainty by the assistance
                    of Latin. The most important of them are—(1) The Tabula Bantina, a bronze tablet
                    found in the neighbourhood of Bantia (Banzi), on the borders of Apulia and
                    Lucania, which relates to the municipal affairs of that town; (2) the Cippus
                    Abellanus, so called from its having been found near Abella in Campania,
                    containing a treaty or agreement between the two neighbouring cities of Nola and
                    Abella; and (3) a bronze tablet more recently discovered in the neighbourhood of
                    Agnone in northern Samnium, recording the dedication of various sacred
                    offerings. It is interesting to observe that these three specimens of the
                    ancient dialect have been found in nearly the most distant quarters of the Oscan
                    territory. None have as yet been found in Lucania or Bruttium, but we know from
                    Festus that the Bruttians spoke Oscan. The language was thus at one time spoken
                    through the whole of the southern peninsula. It doubtless ceased to be employed
                    officially after the defeat of the Samnites and their allies in the Social War
                    (90-88 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.)</hi>; but the numerous minor inscriptions
                    found rudely scratched or painted on the walls of Pompeii show that it continued
                    in vernacular use until a much later period.</p>
                <p>3. <hi rend="italic">The Etruscans.</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi> The obscure
                    question of the origin and affinities of this remarkable people, and the
                    attempts that have been made to interpret their language, have been fully
                    discussed in the article <hi rend="smallcaps">Etruria.</hi> For the present we
                    must be content to acquiesce in the conclusion, which is in accordance with all
                    the statements of ancient authors, that they were a people wholly distinct from
                    all others in Italy, while the researches of modern writers have been able to
                    throw but very little light upon their language or ethnical affinities.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Northern Italy.—</hi> The ethnography of Northern Italy is much
                    more simple than that of the central regions of the peninsula. At the time when
                    the Romans first became acquainted with this part of Italy, the whole country
                    was divided among three nations—the Gauls, the Ligurians, and the Veneti or
                    Venetians.</p>
                <p>(1) Of these the <hi rend="italic">Gauls,</hi> who occupied the extensive plains
                    in the valley of the Po and its tributaries, and had extended their dominion
                    from the Alps to the Apennines and the Adriatic, were unquestionably intruders
                    or immigrants, who had crossed the Alps at a comparatively late period. The last
                    emigration was that in which the Senones or Senonian Gauls established
                    themselves, as has been already mentioned, in the coast land of Umbria between
                    the Apennines and the Adriatic; and this invasion was, according to the Roman
                    historians, directly connected with the capture of Rome in 390 <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> But the migration of the great mass of the Gauls who
                    occupied-the plains of Northern Italy undoubtedly took place at a much earlier
                    period, and is assigned by Livy, our only authority on the subject, and who
                    unfortunately does not mention the sources from which he derived his
                    information, to the reign of the elder Tarquin at Rome (616-578 <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">b.c.).</hi> Who were the people that inhabited this country
                    previous to their irruption we do not know with certainty, but the districts
                    adjoining the foot of the Alps on the west were undoubtedly in the hands of
                    Ligurian tribes, and those in the south at the foot of the Apennines had
                    probably been at one time occupied by the Umbrians, who had, however, previous
                    to the Gaulish invasion been either driven out or reduced tσ∙ subjection by the
                    Etruscans. Of the character and extent of the Etruscan settlements in the region
                    north of the Apennines we have very little information ∙, but the statements of
                    ancient authors that they had at one time extended their dominion over a
                    considerable part of Northern Italy, and founded large cities—among which
                    Felsina (afterwards called Bononia) and Mantua are especially mentioned— have
                    been confirmed of late years by the discovery of undoubted Etruscan remains at
                    Bologna and other places north of the Apennines (see <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Etruria).</hi> But it may well be doubted whether they ever formed the
                    population of these countries; it appears more probable that they were merely a
                    race of more civilized settlers in the midst of the native tribes.</p>
                <p>Of the Gaulish tribes whose names are known to us as established in the north of
                    Italy at the time when they first came into collision with the Roman arms, the
                    most important were the Insubres and Cenomani to the north of the Po, and the
                    Boii and Lingones to the south of that river. Immediately west of the Ticinus,
                    the Laevi are expressly called by Livy a Ligurian tribe, while beyond the Adige
                    to the east began the Veneti and Euganei, so that the territory thus occupied by
                    the Gauls was far from comprising the whole tract subsequently known as Gallia
                    Cisalpina.</p>
                <p>(2) The <hi rend="italic">Ligurians</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Ligures</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">—</hi> the Greek form of the name is Ligyes—are a people of whose
                    origin and affinities we know absolutely nothing, but whom we find from the
                    earliest times in possession of the rugged mountainous tract with which their
                    name is inseparably connected. They were, when we first hear of them,
                    considerably more extensively spread than at a later period,—the south coast of
                    Gaul, subsequently included in the Roman province of that name, having been
                    originally occupied by Ligurian tribes. Thus the Sallyes or Salluvii, in whose
                    territory the Greek colony of Massilia was founded (about 600 <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">b.c.),</hi> are distinctly described as a Ligurian tribe, and
                    it may be considered certain that they held the whole country from the Maritime
                    Alps to the Rhone, while Scylax represents them as intermixed with Iberian
                    tribes in the tract from the mouths of the Rhone to the foot of the Pyrenees.
                    But all authorities agree that they were a separate nationality, distinct alike
                    from the Iberians and from the Gauls. No trace of their language has been
                    preserved and all theories as to their origin must be purely conjectural.</p>
                <p>At the time when they first came in contact with the Roman arms, the Ligurians
                    not only occupied the coast of the Mediterranean and underfalls of the Maritime
                    Alps and Apennines from the Var to the Magra, but the much more extensive tract
                    comprising the northern slopes of those mountains towards the valley of the Po.
                    As has been already mentioned, it is probable that they were still more
                    extensively spread in this direction prior to the irruption of the Gauls, but
                    even in the historical period we find it distinctly stated that the Laevi and
                    Libici, tribes immediately west of the Ticinus, were of Ligurian race. The same
                    thing is told us both by Strabo and Pliny of the Taurini, and was probably true
                    also of their neighbours the Salassi. But the tribes who appear in history as
                    the indomitable foes of Rome, against whom they waged for nearly a century and a
                    half (237-109 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.)</hi> a war much resembling that of the
                    Circassians against Russia in modern times, were those on the two flanks of the
                    Apennines, and the southern slopes of the Maritime Alps. Here the Ingauni and
                    Intemelii in the western Riviera, and the Statielli on the reverse of the
                    mountains were the most conspicuous tribes; while towards the east the Apuani,
                    who held the Lunigiana and the rugged mountain group above Carrara, <pb
                    break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit13newyrich/page/n466/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0913-0466-0447"/> and the Friniates, who extended along the crest
                    of the Apennines from thence to the neighbourhood of Florence, were the subjects
                    of repeated triumphs, and gave the Romans more real trouble than their more
                    brilliant conquests in Macedonia and Asia.</p>
                <p>(3) The <hi rend="italic">Veneti</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Venetians,</hi> who
                    held the north-eastern portion of the great plain of Northern Italy, from the
                    Adige to the Alps of theFrioul, were, according to the concurrent statements of
                    ancient authors, a distinct people from their neighbours the Gauls. Attempts
                    were made by some Greek writers to connect them with the Eneti or Heneti,
                    mentioned by Homer, as a people of Paphlagonia, and several modern authors have
                    sought to identify them with the Venedae or Wends on the shores of the Baltic.
                    But all such theories, based as they are solely on resemblances of name, are of
                    little value. On the other hand it is distinctly stated by Herodotus that they
                    were an Illyrian tribe; and, though this may very likely be a mere inference
                    from their juxtaposition, it is not improbable in itself that they were of the
                    same race with their neighbours the Istrians and Liburnians.</p>
                <p>But, besides the Veneti properly so called, two other tribes were found in
                    historical times within the limits of the province as constitute! by Augustus.
                    (1) The <hi rend="italic">Ewja-ηeans,</hi> though they had at this period
                    dwindled into an insignificant tribe, had at one time been a powerful people,
                    and according to the statement of Livy (himself a native of this country) had
                    originally occupied the whole tract between the Alps and the sea, from which
                    they had been expelled by the Veneti. And this tradition is confirmed by the
                    fact that remnants of them still lingered in the Italian valleys of the Alps as
                    late as the time of Pliny, and that their name remained inseparably attached,
                    both in ancient and modern times, to the little group of volcanic hills between
                    Padua and Verona, which are still known as the Euganean hills. (2) The <hi
                    rend="italic">Carni,</hi> who occupied the northern part of the Frioul, at the
                    foot of the Alps, together with the adjoining mountains, appear to have been
                    certainly a tribe of Celtic or Gaulish origin, and distinct from the Venetians,
                    though included in the province of that name.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Consolidation of Italy.—</hi> We have seen that the name of
                    Italy was originally applied only to the southernmost part of the peninsula, and
                    was only gradually extended so as to comprise the central regions, such as
                    Latium and Campania, which were designated by writers as late as Thucydides and
                    Aristotle as in Opicia. The progress of this change cannot be followed in
                    detail, but there can be little doubt that the extension of the Roman arms, and
                    the gradual union of the nations of the peninsula under one dominant power,
                    would contribute to the introduction, or rather would make the necessity felt,
                    for the use of one general appellation. At first indeed the term was apparently
                    confined to the regions of the central and southern districts, exclusive of
                    Cisalpine Gaul and the whole tract north of the Apennines, and this continued to
                    be the official or definite signification of the name down to the end of the
                    republic. But the natural limits of Italy are so clearly marked that the name
                    came to be generally employed as a geographical term at a much earlier period.
                    Thus we already find Polybius repeatedly applying it in this wider signification
                    to the whole country, as far as the foot of the Alps; and it is evident from
                    many passages in the Latin writers that this was the familiar use of the term in
                    the days of Cicero and Caesar. The official distinction was, however, still
                    retained. Cisalpine Gaul, including the whole of Northern Italy, still
                    constituted a “province,” an appellation never applied to Italy itself. As such
                    it was assigned to Julius Caesar, together with Transalpine Gaul, and it was not
                    till he crossed the Rubicon that he entered Italy in the strict sense of the
                    term.</p>
                <p>Augustus was the first who gave a definite administrative organization to Italy
                    as a whole, and at the same time gave official sanction to that wider
                    acceptation of the name, which had already established itself in familiar usage,
                    and which has continued to prevail ever since.</p>
                <p>The division of Italy into eleven regions (Plate V.), instituted by Augustus for
                    administrative purposes, which continued in official use till the reign of
                    Constantine, was based mainly on the territorial divisions previously existing,
                    and preserved with few exceptions the ancient limits.</p>
                <p>The first region comprised Latium (in the more extended sense of the term, as
                    including the land of the Volscians, Hernicans, and Auruncans), together with
                    Campania and the district of the Picentini. It thus extended from the mouth of
                    the Tiber to that of the Silarus.</p>
                <p>The second region included Apulia and Calabria (the name by which the Romans
                    usually designated the district known to the Greeks as Messapia or Iapygia),
                    together with the land of the Hirpini, which had usually been considered as a
                    part of Samnium.</p>
                <p>The third region contained Lucania and Bruttium; it was bounded on the west coast
                    by the Silarus, on the east by the Bradanus.</p>
                <p>The fourth region comprised all the Samnites (except the Hirpini), together with
                    the Sabines and the cognate tribes of the Frentani, Marrucini, Marsi, Peligni,
                    Vestini, and Aequiculi. It was separated from Apulia on the south by the river
                    Tifernus, and from Picenum on the north by the Matrinus.</p>
                <p>The fifth region was composed solely of Picenum, extending along the coast of the
                    Adriatic from the mouth of the Matrinus to that of the Aesis, beyond Ancona.</p>
                <p>The sixth region was formed by Umbria, in the more extended sense of the term, as
                    including the Ager Gallicus, along the coast of the Adriatic from the Aesis to
                    the Ariminus, and separated from Etruria on the west by the Tiber.</p>
                <p>The seventh region consisted of Etruria, which preserved its ancient limits,
                    extending from the Tiber to the Tyrrhenian Sea, and separated from Liguria on
                    the north by the river Macra.</p>
                <p>The eighth region, termed Gallia Cispadana, comprised the southern portion of
                    Cisalpine Gaul, and was bounded on the north (as its name implied) by the river
                    Padus or Po, from above Placentia to its mouth. It was separated from Etruria
                    and L <hi rend="superscript"> τ</hi> mbria by the main chain of the Apennines;
                    and the river Ariminus was substituted for the far-famed Rubicon as its limit on
                    the Adriatic.</p>
                <p>The ninth region comprised Liguria, extending along the sea-coast from the Varus
                    to the Macra, and inland as far as the river Padus, which constituted its
                    northern boundary from its source in Mount Vesulus to its confluence with the
                    Trebia just above Placentia.</p>
                <p>The tenth region included Venetia from the Padus and Adriatic to the Alps, to
                    which was annexed the neighbouring peninsula of Istria, and to the west the
                    territory of the Cenomani, a Gaulish tribe, extending from the Athesis to the
                    Addua, which had previously been regarded as a part of Gallia Cisalpina.</p>
                <p>The eleventh region, known as Gallia Transpadana, included all the rest of
                    Cisalpine Gaul from the Padus on the south and the Addua on the east to the foot
                    of the Alps.</p>
                <p>The arrangementsthus established by Augustus continued almost unchanged till the
                    time of Constantine, and formed the basis of all subsequent administrative
                    divisions until the fall of the Western empire. It is not worth while to follow
                    in detail the changes introduced during the 4th century. It was the invasion of
                    the Lombards that first broke up the general system of the Roman administration,
                    and prepared the way for the redistribution of Italy in the Middle Ages on a
                    wholly different basis. <hi rend="smallcaps">(e. h. b.)</hi><pb break="no"

                <p>The preceding sections have dealt with Italy the country as a permanent physical
                    unity; here it is proposed to consider Italy the kingdom as a modern political
                    and social unity. In dealing with the various aspects of the subject we shall be
                    continually reminded of the fact that Italy is one of the very youngest of the
                    greater nations of Europe. In attempting to trace back the movement of any
                    department of social activity, the investigator here finds his retrospect soon
                    interrupted and closed; instead of the statistics of the kingdom of Italy he has
                    only the statistics, fragmentary and incapable of comparison, of the several
                    states by whose incorporation it has been formed.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Extent.—</hi> Of the Italian frontier 294 miles coincide with
                    that of France, 355 with that of Switzerland, and 269 with that of Austria.
                    Owing mainly to natural causes, but partly also to political traditions, the
                    line is a very irregular one; and at various points it has been subjected to
                    rectifications on a small scale since the consolidation of the kingdom. The
                    limits towards France are determined by the convention signed at Turin in 1861.
                    The same year saw the revision of the line between Lombardy and Ticino on the
                    basis of the treaty of Varese, 1752. In 1863 the boundary of the Grisons was
                    slightly modified, and the Lei valley assigned to Italy; in 1873 the frontier
                    was fixed between Teramo and Brusio and at the Alp de Cravairola; and in 1875 a
                    district of 4324 acres, or nearly 7 square miles, which had been in dispute was
                    assigned to Italy by the arbitration of the United States, and incorporated with
                    the province of Novara. Ou the surrender of the Austrian provinces of Italy to
                    the new kingdom in 1867, it was decided that the frontier between the two states
                    should be that of the actual administration of the Lombardo-Venetian
                    kingdom.</p>
                <p>The total area of the kingdom of Italy is given officially as 296,322 <hi
                    rend="superscript"> -</hi> 91 square kilometres or 114,380 <hi
                    rend="superscript"> ,</hi> 64 square miles; but the estimate confessedly rests
                    on data that are to a considerable extent provisional. It was published by
                    Maestri, the head of the general direction of statistics in the census returns
                    for 1861, and the investigations of the minister of public works in 1871 tended
                    to confirm its general accuracy. But that it should be more than a very fair
                    approximation to the truth is impossible in the defective state of the Italian
                    surveys. Though various parts of the country were carefully gone over for
                    cadastral purposes by commissions appointed by several of the independent states
                    of the peninsula,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>In the
                    ancient Piedmont provinces a cadastral survey was undertaken as early as 1677,
                    but it was not finished till 1729; in the Modenese provinces that of Garfagnana
                    goes back to 1533, that of Rola to 1785, that of the “plain and hill” to 1791;
                    in the Tuscan provinces the cadastre was compiled between 1822 and 1834; and the
                    Lombardo-Venetian provinces have a double cadastre, the first dating from 1718,
                    the second commenced in 1828. See <hi rend="italic">Atti del</hi><hi

                <p>Of these Abruzzi and Molise, Campania, Apulia, Basilicata, and the Calabrias are
                    not unfrequently grouped together in statistical tables under the name of the
                    Neapolitan territory (Napoletano). The provinces which formed the Sardinian
                    kingdom are often spoken of as the Ancient Provinces.</p>
                <p>These compartimenti, however, are not true administrative divisions, but rather
                    conventional groupings of a number of provinces. It is the province which forms
                    the true administrative unit. According to modern nomenclature it always takes
                    its name from the capoluogo (chef-lieu or administrative centre), which is the
                    seat of the prefect. The provinces are subdivided into so many circles or
                    districts (the name <hi rend="italic">circondario</hi> being employedin all
                    parts of the kingdom except the Veneto, where the old established word <hi
                    rend="italic">distrctto</hi> is still in use). The division known as the <hi
                    rend="italic">mandamento</hi> has to do with the legal administration only. It
                    must be noted that formerly many of the provinces had special designations other
                    than those of their chief towns, and that some of these are still of not
                    infrequent occurrence especially outside of Italy. Thus Reggio corresponds to
                    Calabria Ulteriore Prima, Catanzaro to Calabria Ulteriore Seconda, Cosenza to
                    Calabria Citeriore, Teramo to Abruzzo Llteriore Primo, Aquila to Abruzzo
                    Ulteriore Secondo, Chieti to Abruzzo Citeriore, Campobasso to Molise, Foggia to
                    Capitanata, Lecce to Terra d’Otranto, Bari to Terra di Bari, Avellino to
                    Principato Ulteriore, Salerno to Principato Citeriore, Caserta to Terra di
                    Lavoro, Potenza to Basilicata.</p>
                <p>The following table (II.) gives the provinces, with their respective areas,
                    according to Professor Baccarini in the <hi rend="italic">xinnuario Statistico

                <p>At this last date (1861) the population of the kingdom exclusive of the province
                    of Rome was 21,777,334. The census of 1871 showed for the whole kingdom a total
                    of 26,801,154; and it is estimated that this had increased by 1875 to
                    27,482,174, and by 1879 to 28,437,091. The census of 1861 gave 10,897,236 males
                    and 10,880,098 females, that of 1871 13,472,213 malesand 13,328,892 females. At
                    the latter date 36 per cent, of the population were married, and 6 per cent, in
                    a state of widowhood.</p>
                <p>The 1871 census shows that the males are in distinct excess of the females for
                    the first fifteen years of life, that after that age the excess is on the side
                    of the females, and becomes very strong between nineteen and twenty-one, and
                    that between thirty-one and seventy-one the advantage is for the most part on
                    the side of the males. (See Luigi Ranieri’s elaborate study in <hi rend="italic"

                    of population, and that the aggregate population in December 1876 of the
                    communes which were thus situated or did not keep their registers up to date was
                    no less than 7,002,456, or more than one-fourth of the population of the country

                <p>During the fifteen years 1865-79 the marriages averaged 7'48 annually in every
                    1000 inhabitants, the births 37’1 (104 males to 100 females), and the deaths
                    30'4. The average number of children (births and still-births) per marriage was
                    4 '68. There is very little difference in the percentage of the marriages in the
                    urban and the rural communes; but in the matter of births and still more in
                    deaths the urban communes stand higher than the rural. The following table (VII.

                <p>It appears from these last figures (1879) that 10’57 per cent, of the children

                    the country, are eitheι ’ illegitimate or unacknowledged by their parents, and
                    that, while the proportion of males to females is overhead 106 oi’ 107 to 100,
                    the proportion in the case of the illegitimate is 112 in the towns. The province
                    of Rome, the Marches, Umbria, Emilia, and Sardinia are the regions in which
                    illegitimacy most prevails,—17,13, 12, 10, and 9 per cent, being their
                    respective figures for 1878, while little more than 1 per cent, is shown for
                    Campania and Apulia. It is a painful fact that in the space of ten years 305,105
                    children have been abandoned by their parents. The rate of infant mortality,
                    also, speaks of ignorance and. neglect: in 1877, for example, 214,093 children
                    (t.e,, nearly 21 per cent.) died in the first year of existence, and other
                    196,841 perished before they completed their tenth year.<note anchored="true"

                    of emigrants in the twelve years 1869-1880 is 1,407,723. Taking the figures for
                    1876-80 it would appear that about 37,000 Italians go every year to France,
                    19,000 to Austria-Hungary, 14,000 to Switzerland, 7000 to Germany, about 3000 to
                    the other states of Europe, 20,000 to America (about a third of them to the La
                    Plata republics), and from 2000 to 3000 to the other parts of the world. A large
                    proportion of this body of people, however, return to their native country after
                    a longer or shorter period of absence; and the actual loss of population by this
                    means is reduced to about 25,000 or 30,000 per annum. The compartimenti which
                    contribute most to the total of the permanent emigration are Piedmont, Liguria,
                    Lombardy, and the Veneto; Emilia, Tuscany, Umbria, the Marches, Latium, Sicily,
                    and Sardinia have only a very small share.</p>

                    surpassed by Roumania, Denmark, Russia, Prussia, France, Hungary, &amp;c., and

                    4,192,083 acres, and yields 85,506,660 bushels. That the cultivation of rice is
                    less widely distributed is the natural result of the fact that it requires about
                    107,000 gallons of water per annum for every acre, and that its cultivation is
                    found in many places to be extremely prejudicial to the healthiness of the

                    the predominant crop. The chief seat of this cereal is Novara, and more
                    particularly the circondario of Vercelli, which alone yields about 6,875,000
                    bushels of rice in a year. The total acreage is 573,925 acres, with a total
                    production of 26,998,915 bushels. Neither barley nor rye is of great importance,

                    19,369,000 bushels. The best crops are obtained in the provinces of Caserta,

                    in that regard displaced by maize. Buckwheat (the <hi rend="italic">grano

                    of Cuneo, Como, Belluno, and Treviso. The manufacture of rnaccaroni and similar
                    foodstuff is well known as a characteristic Italian industry. It is pretty
                    extensively distributed, and is often carried on in very primitive fashion. The
                    extent of the industry may be judged from the fact that, while the Italians
                    themselves consume enormous quantities, they are at the same time able to export
                    from 50,000 to 70,000 quintals of “pastes.”</p>
                <p>Beans are a very common crop—those belonging to the genera <hi rend="italic"

                    cultivated are the white haricots. In many places a crop of beans is obtained
                    from the field just cleared of the wheat. Lentils are grown in most parts of the
                    country, —a small sort being that most in favour. Pease hold a less important
                    place than that assigned to them in more northern lands. The total area under

                    is the variety most usual in Central and Northern Italy. <hi rend="italic"
                    >Lupinus rarius</hi> —which does not do so well for green fodder—is most usual

                <p>The potato is now found as a common object of cultivation in nearly every region
                    of Italy except the provinces of Mantua, Girgenti, and Trapani. For field
                    cultivation the variety still almost universally in vogue is that introduced by
                    the grand-dukes of Tuscany at the beginning of the 17th century. It is
                    calculated that the total crop of potatoes may average 19,387,000 bushels.
                    Turnips are pretty largely grown, more especially in the central districts of
                    the peninsula, for use as winter fodder for the cattle. Many attempts have been
                    made to introduce the cultivation of beet, but the plant does not succeed to
                    much satisfaction.</p>
                <p>Gardening is seldom carried on in Italy on a large or expensive scale, except in
                    the neighbourhood of such places as Milan, Genoa, Florence, Palermo, Catania,
                    and Naples. Some of the marketgardens in the outskirts of this last city,
                    however, are said to bring in about £32 per acre, and to be let for £14 or £15.
                    Forcing is seldom resorted to. Among the plants most largely cultivated in the
                    ordinary gardens are various kindsof cabbage, lettuces, fennel, asparagus,
                    spinach, beet, garlic and onions, gourds, melons and cucumbers, and tomatoes.
                    The fennel is eaten both raw and cooked,—often instead of fruit after dinner.
                    The asparagus is seldom bleached.</p>
                <p>With the exception of rape, colza, and linseed, few of the oil seeds are grown to
                    any considerable extent. The sun-flower is cultivated on a small scale in the
                    Veneto, and the ground nut <hi rend="italic">(Aradiis</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >hypogaea)</hi> in a few places in Lombardy. The annual crop of the castor-oil
                    plant (which has become wild in Sicily and in Verona) is estimated at 6,000,000
                    lb of seed. Sesamum, formerly common in the Bologna and Lucca districts, is now
                    almost confined to Sicily. Madder used to be largely cultivated in the provinces
                    of Naples and Caserta (in the former 27,000 acres were devoted to it as late as
                    1863), but in Italy as elsewhere the dye plants are becoming of less importance.
                    The collecting of saffron is also less common than it used to be. In <pb

                    Siena) it was formerly an important industry; now it chiefly flourishes in the
                    province of Aquila and other parts of the Napoletano, and in the island of
                    Sicily. Aniseed is abundantly grown in the Romagna and the Abruzzi; the province
                    of Aquila produces about 800 quintals per annum. Liquorice grows wild in all the
                    southern part of the peninsula, and in some portions of Sicily is considered a
                    vile weed; but in certain localities, as in the province of Teramo, it is the
                    object of regular cultivation.</p>
                <p>The vine is cultivated throughout the length and breadth of Italy, but in not a
                    few of the provinces its relative importance is slight. While in some of the
                    districts of the south and the centre the vine occupies from 10 to 20 per cent,
                    of the cultivated area, in some of the northern provinces, such as Sondrio,
                    Belluno, Grosseto, &amp;c., the average is only about 1 or 2 per cent. The
                    methods of cultivation are sufficiently varied; but the planting of the vines by
                    themselves in long rows of insignificant bushes is decidedly the exception. In
                    Lombardy, Emilia, Romagna, Tuscany, the Marches, Umbria, the Terra di Lavoro,
                    and other southern provinces, they are trained to trees which are either left in
                    their natural state or subjected to pruning and pollarding. In Campania and
                    Terra di Lavoro the vines are allowed to climb freely to the tops of the poplars
                    much as they would do in their native woods; but the wines obtained by this
                    system of cultivation are said to be of inferior quality. In the rest of Italy
                    the elm and the maple are the trees mainly employed as supports. Artificial
                    props of several kinds—wires, cane work, trellis work, &amp;c.—are also in use
                    in many districts, and in some the plant is simply permitted to trail along the
                    ground. The vintage takes place, according to locality and climate, from the
                    beginning of September to the beginning of November. Table XI. gives details for
                    the different districts :—</p>

                <p>Next to the cereals and the vine the most important object of cultivation in
                    Italy is the olive. In Sicily and the provinces of Reggio, Catanzaro, Cosenza,
                    and Lecce this tree flourishes freely and without shelter; as far north as Rome,
                    Aquila, and Teramo it requires only the slightest protection; in the rest of the
                    peninsula it runs the risk of damage by frost every ten years or so. The
                    proportion of ground under olives is no less than from 20 to 36 per cent, at
                    Porto Maurizio, and in Reggio, Lecce, Bari, Chieti, and Leghorn it averages from
                    10 to 19 per cent. Throughout Piedmont, Lombardy, the Veneto, and the greater
                    part of Emilia, the tree is of little importance, though in a number of the
                    provinces it is cultivated on a small scale. In the olive there is great variety
                    of kinds, and the methods of cultivation differ greatly in different districts;
                    in Bari, Chieti, and Lecce, for instance, there are regular woods of nothing but
                    olive-trees, while in middle Italy we have olive-orchards with the interspaces
                    occupied by crops of various kinds. The Tuscan oils from Lucca, Calci, and Buti
                    are considered the best in the world; and those of Bari, Umbria, and western
                    Liguria rank next. The following table (XII.) indicates more particularly the
                    distribution of the cultivation :—</p>

                    <hi rend="italic">Citrus Bigaradia</hi> being probably due to the Arabs; but it
                    has received so great a development in certain parts of the country as to be
                    highly characteristic. Sicily stands <hi rend="italic">jacile</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">princeps</hi> in this respect,—the area occupied by the <hi
                    rend="italic">agrumeti</hi> or lemon and orange orchards in the province of
                    Palermo alone having increased from 11,525 acres in 1854 to 54,340 in 1874.
                    lleggio, Calabria, Catanzaro, Cosenza, Lecce, Salerno, Naples, and Caserta are
                    the continental provinces which come next after Sicily. In Sardinia the
                    cultivation is extensive, but receives little attention. Crude lime-juice is
                    exported from Italy to the amount of about 10,000 quintals annually, and
                    concentrated lime-juice to the amount of from 11,000 to 17,000 quintals.
                    Essential oils are extracted from the rind of the agrami, more particularly from
                    that of the lemon and the bergamot; the latter, however, is almost confined to
                    the province of Reggio Calabria, where the average production amounts to 220,000
                    lb,—an enormous quantity when it is remembered that 1000 bergamots are required
                    for every lb. A perfume called <hi rend="italic">acqua nanfa·,</hi> or <hi
                    rend="italic">lanfa,</hi> is obtained from the distillation of the
                    orange-flowers, and the petals are also made into a conserve at Syracuse. Of the
                    agrumi in their natural state the exportation has increased from 832,410
                    quintals (value 24,139,890 lire<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    In Southern Italy almonds, carob-trees, and figs are cultivated on a very
                    extensive scale. The value of the almonds exported in 1876 (a favourable year)
                    amounted to 13,570,000 lire. Walnuts are mainly grown in Piedmont, and
                    particularly in the province of Cuneo; hazels, on the contrary, have their
                    greatest diffusion in the south, and particularly in the island of Sicily and
                    the province of Avellino.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"

                    culture is confined to the province of Caltanisetta.</p>
                <p>The great variety in physical and social conditions which exists throughout the
                    peninsula gives corresponding variety to the methods of agriculture. In the
                    matter for instance of rotation of .crops there is an amazing diversity—shifts
                    of two years, three years, four years, six years, and in many cases whatever
                    order strikes the fancy of the farmer. The fields of Tuscany for the most part
                    bear wheat one year and maize the next, in perpetual interchanges, relieved to
                    some extent by green crops. A similar method prevails in the Abruzzi, and in the
                    provinces of Salerno, Benevento, and Avellino. In the plains of Lombardy a six
                    year shift is common :—either wheat, clover, maize, rice, rice, rice (the last
                    year manured with lupines), or maize, wheat followed by clover, clover, clover
                    ploughed in and rice, rice, and rice manured with lupines. The Emilian region is
                    one where regular rotations are best observed,—a common shift being grain,
                    maize, clover, beans and vetches, &amp;c., grain, which has the disadvantage of
                    the grain crops succeeding each other. In the province of Naples, Caserta,
                    &amp;c., the method of fallows is widely adopted, the ground· often being left
                    in this state for fifteen or twenty years; and in some parts of Sicily there is
                    a regular interchange of fallow and crop year by year. The following scheme
                    indicates a common Sicilian method of a type which has many varieties :—fallow,
                    grain, grain, pasture, pasture—other two divisions of the area following the
                    same order, but commencing respectively with the two years of grain and the two
                    of pasture.</p>
                <p>In the matter of implements the Italian agriculturist is far behind. The old
                    Roman plough, for instance, as it is described by Virgil and Columella, may
                    still be seen in use in various parts of the country; in Sardinia the plough
                    that figures on the ancient monuments of the island might have been copied from
                    that at work in the fields. Great improvements, however, have taken place in the
                    more progressive regions; iron has replaced wood, and coulter and share have
                    been increased in massiveness. But even in the Veneto the heavy plough drawn by
                    as many it may be as six pair of oxen cuts the furrow no deeper than 9 inches.
                    As we proceed southwards the fashion becomes more simple and antique. The spade
                    or <hi rend="italic">vanga</hi> is a favourite implement, and in some parts, as
                    in Emilia for instance, it is used to deepen the furrow made by the plough.
                    Sowing and reaping machines have been successfully introduced in the lowland
                    regions, but a large proportion of the country is little fitted for their
                    employment.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>A suggestive
                    table of the proportion of mountainous and lowland country in the several
                    provinces will be found in the <hi rend="italic">Studii</hi> published by the
                    Geographical Society in 1875. It is reprinted in the <hi rend="italic">Annuario
                    Stat,</hi> for 1881. According to this, the mountainous area is considerably in
                    excess of the lowland.</p></note> Thrashing machines even in the remoter
                    districts have largely displaced the flail and the floor; and straw cutters,
                    com-shellers, and similar inventions have begun to make their way. Manuring even
                    of a very ordinary kind is but little attended to in a great part of the
                    country; though it has been a custom from time immemorial to grow a crop of
                    lupines for the sole purpose of returning them to the soil as a stimulus.</p>
                <p>Though Italy is so distinctively an agricultural country, and has been subject so
                    long to regular process of cultivation, a large proportion of its arable land is
                    still in astate of utter neglect. It is calculated that the aggregate of the
                    more important districts ready to give abundant increase in return for the
                    labour of reclamation amounts to 571,000 acres; anil more than twice that
                    quantity might be utilized. The most important works undertaken in this,
                    direction since the formation of the kingdom are the draining df Lago Fucino and
                    Lago Trasimeno, and the great scheme for the improvement of the “Agro Romano”
                    decreed by parliament on 11th December 1878.</p>
                <p>The breed of cattle most widely distributed throughout Italy is that known as the
                    Podolian, usually with white or grey coat and enormous horns. Of the numerous
                    sub-varieties, the finest is said to be that of the Vai di Chiana, where the
                    animals are stall-fed all the year round; and next to this is ranked the
                    so-called Valle Tiberina type. The wilder and ruder varieties are those which
                    roam in vast herds over the Tuscan and Roman <hi rend="italic">maremmas,</hi>
                    and the corresponding districts in Apulia and other regions. In the Alpine <pb
                    break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit13newyrich/page/n471/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0913-0471-0452"/> districts there is a stock cμιite distinct from
                    the Podolian, generally called <hi rend="italic">razza montanina.</hi> These
                    animals are much smaller in stature and more regular in form than their Podolian
                    cousins; and they are mainly kept for dairy purposes. Another stock, with no
                    close allies nearer than the south of France, is found in the plain of Kaceonigi
                    and Carmagnola; the mouse-coloured Swiss breed, occurs in the neighbourhood of
                    Milan; the Tyrolese breed stretches south to Padua and Modena; and a red-coated
                    breed named of Reggio or Friuli, is familiar both in what were the duchies of
                    Parma and Modena, and in the provinces of Udine and Treviso. Other less
                    important types exist in the southern parts of the peninsula; in Sicily the
                    so-called Modica race is of note; and in Sardinia there is a very distinct stock
                    which seldom exceeds the weight of 700 lb. Buffaloes are kept in several
                    districts, more particularly of Southern Italy. Their total number is estimated
                    at 15,190.</p>
                <p>Sheep are not reared in any considerable numbers by the agriculturists of Italy;
                    but enormous flocks are possessed by professional sheep-farmers, who pasture
                    them in the mountains in the summer, and bring them down to the plains in the
                    winter. The breeds vary from region to region. At Saluzzo in Piedmont there is a
                    stock with hanging ears, arched face, and tall stature, kept for its dairy
                    qualities; and in the Biellese the merino breed is maintained by some of the
                    larger proprietors. In the upper valleys of the Alps there are many local
                    varieties, one of which at Ossola is like the Scotch blackface. Liguria is not
                    much adapted for sheep-farming on a large scale; but a number of small flocks
                    come down to the plain of Tuscany in the winter. With the exception of a few
                    sub-Alpine districts near Bergamo and Brescia, the great Lombard plain is
                    decidedly unpastoral. The Bergamo sheep is the largest breed in the country; and
                    that of Cadore and Belluno approaches it in size. In the Venetian districts the
                    farmers often nave small stationary flocks. Throughout the Roman province, and
                    Umbria, Apulia, the Capitanata, and the Calabrias, we find in its full
                    development a remarkable system of pastoral migration which has been in
                    existence from the most ancient times, and which has attracted attention as much
                    by its picturesqueness as by its industrial importance. Merino sheep have been
                    acclimatized in the Abruzzi, the Caρitanata, and the Basilicata. The total
                    number of sheep in the kingdom is estimated at nearly 7,000,009, and that of
                    goats at more than 1,500,000. According to returns for 1876 (the figures of
                    which are almost certainly below the mark) the cattle amount to 3,489,125, the
                    horses to 657,544, the asses to 498,766, the mules to 293,868, and the pigs to
                    1,553,582.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi

                <p>The north of Italy has long been known for its great dairy districts. Parmesan
                    cheese, otherwise called Lodigiano (from Lodi) or grana, was presented to King
                    Louis XII. as early as 1509. In 1878 there were in the province of Parma alone
                    one hundred and sixtyseven caselli or dairies, manipulating about
                    l,830,554gallons of milk, and manufacturing 26,091 Parmesan cheeses of aggregate
                    weight of 927,315 lb, besides' 6963 tt&gt; of the variety of Stracchino, 2318 lb
                    of Gorgonzola, 324,062 lb of butter, and 497,442 of <hi rend="italic"

                    9). Between 1864 and 1873 the value of the cheese increased from 1'66 lire to 2
                    <hi rend="superscript"> -</hi> 75 lire per lb. Parmesan is not confined to the
                    province from which it derives its name; it is manufactured in all that part of
                    Emilia which is in the neighbourhood of the Po, and in the provinces of Brescia,
                    Bergamo, Pavia, Novara, and Alessandria. Gorgonzola, which takes its name from a
                    town in the province, has become general throughout the whole of Lombardy, in
                    the eastern parts of the “ancient provinces,” and in the province of Cuneo. The
                    cheese known as the caccio-cavallo, which when two or three years old is worth
                    three or four lire the kilogramme, is produced in regions extending from 37° to
                    43° N. lat. Gruyère, so extensively manufactured in Switzerland and France, is
                    also produced in Italy in the Alpine regions andin Sicily. With the exception of
                    Parmesan, Gorgonzola, La Fontina, and Gruyère, most of the Italian cheese is
                    consumed in the locality of its production. It is estimated that in 1879 England
                    imported upwards of 3000 Parmesans and 5000 Gorgonzolas. The institution known
                    as the <hi rend="italic">lattcria</hi><hi rend="italic">sociale,</hi> or
                    co-operative dairy-farm has been in use in Parma for centuries, and is a
                    familiar arrangement in many districts. For further details on this interesting
                    industry the reader may consult Cantoni’s <hi rend="italic">Pindustria del
                    latte,</hi> and the account of the <hi rend="italic">esposizione di
                    caseificio,</hi> held at Portici in 1877, in the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Annali</hi><hi rend="italic">di Agricoltura,</hi> 1879. The extent of the
                    butter exportation is seen from Table XXII., p. 456. France is the great market
                    for the fresh butter; but it appears that England is rapidly becoming a customer
                    of some importance; instead of 10 tons, as in 1875, it received 500 tons in
                    1879-80.</p>
                <p>Among the various methods by which the relation of the landholder to the tiller
                    of the soil is regulated, the more noteworthy are the mezzadria (mezzeria or
                    metayer) system, the boaria or schiaven-</p>
                <p>deria, the economia, and the aflittanza or affittamento. This last is practically
                    the same as the ordinary renting system in England and Scotland, the rent
                    sometimes being paid in money <hi rend="italic">(affitto a danari),</hi>
                    sometimes in kind <hi rend="italic">(affitto</hi><hi rend="italic">a
                    grano),</hi> sometimes partly in money and partly in kind, and the periods
                    varying from one year to leasesof six or nine years. In the typical mezzadria
                    the owner receives frequently one half of the produce of the soil, and the
                    mezzadro or farmer the other; but of course there are many minor modifications
                    in the terms of the contract.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>Caruso, for instance, in his work on <hi rend="italic"
                    >Sistemi d'amministrazione,</hi> describes a variety in use at Gallico, in
                    Reggio Calabria. In order to establish new <hi rend="italic">agrumeti, or</hi>
                    orange orchards, advantage is taken of the following arrangements. The peasant
                    undertakes to dig the holes, to furnish and place the cuttings, and to watch and
                    take care of the plants up to the seventh year. The <hi rend="italic"
                    >magoli,</hi> or interspaces between the rows, he cultivates as a garden, and
                    pays for this a rent of about 229 lire per hectare. The produce of the orchard
                    is divided equally between contadino and landlord, and at the end of the seventh
                    year, the value of the garden being estimated, the former receives a third of
                    the amount, and the landlord remains in full possession of the rest.</p></note>
                    The live-stock is usually the property of the mezzadro, who.pays a fixed rent
                    for the use of the pasturage. By the terzeria system, on the other hand, the
                    animals and plant are the property of the landholder, or two-thirds his and
                    one-third the tenant’s. Under the schiavenderia or boaria system, the boario (so
                    called from his care of the cattle) receives such a quantity of the produce of
                    the soil or of money as pays for his labour, and the landlord remains
                    practically his own farmer. The live stock of course is the landlord’s property,
                    but the boario has a right to certain perquisites connected with this department
                    of his labour. Economia is the name given to a system by which “the holder of
                    the land, whether landlord or tenant, pays certain families who perform under
                    his direction, with his capital and at his risk, the various labours of
                    cultivation.” The peculiar conditions of certain parts of the country produce
                    peculiar arrangements: the Roman Campagna, for example, which could not be
                    permanently inhabited owing to the malaria, used to be cultivated in the
                    following fashion. Companies of peasants from the Abruzzi, the Marches, &amp;c.,
                    under the direction of chiefs or “corporals,” performed the work of sowing the
                    fields in the autumn, and returned in June to gather in the harvest, —the
                    tenants of the farms usually making considerable profits from the undertaking.

                    country, its manufacturing industries are of considerable importance, and some
                    of them have a long and varied history. Of chief note is the silk trade,—though
                    it has suffered greatly from the silkworm disease which broke out in 1854.
                    Accordingto De Vecchi <hi rend="italic">(Arch. di</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Stak,</hi> 1876) the total annual production of raw silk in Italy previously
                    amounted to 7,612,000 ft; in 1865 it was reduced to 3,876,400 lb, but it has
                    since considerably recovered its ground. The average, indeed, for the ten years
                    1868-1877 is given by the same authority as 5,753,880 lb; and according to the
                    report of Luigi Maccia to the Milan chamber of commerce in 1881 the cocoon
                    harvest amounted in 1878 to 81,843,740 lb, in 1879 to 41,648,200 ft, and in 1880
                    to 79,546,280 lb, which would represent in round numbers 5,500,000 lb of raw
                    silk for the first year, 2,798,000 lb for the second, and 5,345,000 for the
                    third.</p>

                <p>As a silk-producing country in fact Italy ranks second only to China, and leaves
                    all its other competitors far behind. The culture is carried on in at least 5300
                    communes, andin 1877 it was calculated that 4839 men, 81,165 women, and 25,373
                    children were employed in the unwinding of the cocoons—an operation which was
                    formerly effected for the most part by the growers themselves, but has now
                    passed into the hands of those who can bring better appliances and more modern
                    methods to bear. The district in which the unwinding is most extensively carried
                    on is Lombardy, and it is there too that improvements in the process are most
                    widely adopted: while in the Veneto, for example, there are 10,031 of the
                    old-fashioned ovens to 4698 of the modern steam apparatuses, in Lombardy the
                    latter number 29,576 and the former only 9305. If we turn to what is more
                    distinctively the manufacture of the silk, we find the pre-eminence of Lombardy
                    more strongly emphasized. The position it occupies is evident from the following

                <p>The raw material for these silk-throwing factories is partly obtained from
                    abroad, in spite of the large home supply already indicated; fora considerable
                    proportion of this—though much less than was formerly the case—is exported for
                    manufacture at Lyons and elsewhere. According to Signor Fuzier in his Paris
                    exhibition report, 44,000,000 lb of silk from other European countries, and
                    176,000,000 Γb from Asia, are worked up by the Italian spinners. The special
                    department of <hi rend="italic">cascami</hi> employs about 27,000 spindles in
                    Jesi, Novara, Meina, and Zuniglio.</p>
                <p>In silk-weaving Italy stands comparatively low. Signor Ellena, general director
                    of the customs,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>A latge
                    proportion of the facts mentioned in this section on the manufaot tires are

                    1880.</p></note> estimates the number of looms at from 10,000 to 12,000, of
                    which only 665 were power-looms—very meagre totals in comparison with those even
                    of the Swiss canton of Zurich, which numbers about 1000 power-looms and 40,000
                    handlooms. Lombardy (especially the town of Como)is again the principal seat of
                    the industry, Campania ranking second, an 1 Piedmont third.</p>
                <p>Next in importance to the silk industry stands the cotton manufacture. During the
                    American war the cultivation of cotton in Italy received a rematkable but
                    temporary stimulus. In 1864 it occupied about 227,645 acres, and the produce
                    amounted to 622,896 quintals, but the corresponding figures for 1873 were only
                    85,422 acres and 180,230 quintals. In 1877 Italy had only about 880,000 cotton
                    spindles, or rather more than Belgium; and these consumed about 264,000 quintals
                    of the fibre. Liguria and Piedmont contain the greatest number of spinning
                    mills. In the number of its cotton looms, however, Lombardy stands highest, and
                    Liguria, Piedmont, and Campania follow. The total number for the country is
                    stated at more than 13,000. Of the cotton goods the great proportion consists in
                    the coarser fabrics,—muslins, tulles, &amp;c., being obtained almost exclusively
                    from abroad. The average importation of cotton yarn for the ten years 1870-1879
                    amounted to 109,000 quintals, and that of cotton fabrics during the same period
                    to 116,000 quintals.</p>
                <p>As has been already seen, Italy is a great wool-growing country; and while it
                    exports about 1,760,000 lb of the native produce, it imports, mainly from South
                    America, a quantity varying from 10,382,680 ft in 1870 to 18,983,600 ft in 1879.
                    The following table (XVI.) indicates the extent of the industry, which, unlike
                    that of cotton, has a long and in parts brilliant history in the country :—</p>

                <p>More than 3000 hands are further employed in the shoddy trade. With few
                    exceptions, the Italian factories receive the wool in its raw state from the
                    grower, and perform in succession all the various operations of washing,
                    scouring, carding, dyeing, weaving, and dressing. They manage to supply a large
                    part of the home demand, and also export a small quantity of goods.</p>
                <p>The flax and hemp industries have been prosecuted in Italy for centuries; but a
                    large proportion of the manufacture is still carried on by hand-loom weavers
                    working in their own houses—to the number probably of more than 68,000. The
                    following table (XVII.) indicates the distribution of the factories: —</p>

                <p>The manufacture of jute is quite insignificant :—two weaving factories in
                    Lombardy and Liguria, and spinning mills at Crema, Poirina, and Grugliasco. It
                    is estimated that about 8400 hands are employed in the making of ropes and
                    cordage; and of the produce in this department there is a very considerable
                    export, varying in the ten years 1870-79 from a minimum of 20,797 quintals in
                    1870 to a maximum of 36,908 in 1873. The factories that produce mixed fabrics
                    are 210 in number, and upwards of 5000 hands are employed in them.</p>
                <p>The extent to which weaving is carried on in the simple domestic fashion has been
                    indicated in connexion with the linen trade; it also maintains its ground in
                    several of the other departments, and the. popular prejudice—it prejudice it
                    be—in favour of the firm-wrought fabrics that are thus produced will long keep
                    the clack of the solitary loom familiar to the inhabitants of many a town and
                    village. It is said that there are at least 230,000 of them at work throughout
                    the country.</p>
                <p>The making of felt hats, which gives employment to nearly 5000 hands, is mainly
                    carried on in Piedmont, and particularly in the circondario of Biella and at
                    Intra. The produce is for the most part of a coarse quality, but finds a market
                    not only in Italy but also in France, Austria and Switzerland, the Argentine
                    Confederation, and Tunis. The trade in straw hats is rapidly growing in
                    importance: while in 1867 the number exported was only 7661, it rose in 1877 to
                    4,526,000.</p>
                <p>Owing to the abundance of the raw material, Italy has long been successful in the
                    manufacture of paper from linen rags according to the old-fashioned processes;
                    and the development of the more modern methods has been fostered by the ready
                    availability of water power, though on the other hand the outlays for chemicals,
                    machinery, and fuel are serious drawbacks. The supply of home-made paper is far
                    in excess of the demand, and there is a corresponding excess of export over
                    import, more especially in blottirg and packing papers. The imported paper is
                    almost exclusively of the finer qualities. According to Signor Avondo, the
                    annual quantity of rags obtained in Italy is 88,000,000 lb. There was formerly a
                    great export of rags to America in the shape of packing material for
                    marble-blocks.</p>
                <p>In the manufacture of leather and skins Italy has long been successfully engaged:
                    and though the industry has now to compete" with the new enterprise of India and
                    America, the annual production is valued at £4,000,000. The staple article is
                    shoe leather; in the finer departments—such as kid skins—foreign competition is
                    too strong for the full development of the native industry. It is estimated that
                    there are upwards of 1300 works in the country, employing more than 10,000
                    hands.</p>
                <p>A private company, established in 1868 under the name of Regia Cointeressata,
                    secured for fifteen years the exclusive privilege of manufacturing and selling
                    tobacco in continental Italy and Sardinia, on condition of paying to the state
                    an annual rent and a certain proportion of the gains after the rent was
                    deducted. In the period 1869-1870 the rent was to be 66,894,811 lire, in the
                    second period (1871-74) 72,293,032, in the third (1875-1878) 79,484,891, and for
                    the fourth (1879-1884) 93,000,000. Up to 1875 the Government share in the
                    ultimate profit was fixed at 40 per cent., and from 1875 at 50 per cent. The
                    results of this arrangement have not been equal to the anticipations formed in
                    regard to them. In 1877, however, the Regia extended its control to the island
                    of Sicily.</p>
                <p>According to the regulation of 1879 the cultivation of tobacco for exportation is
                    permitted in any part of the country on payment of a licence, while the
                    cultivation for the inland monopoly is restricted to certain regions annually
                    determined, and within these regions no cultivation for export can be carried
                    on. The rules are of a very rigid description. The provinces in which the
                    monopoly cultivation has usually been located are Vicenza, Ancona, Perugia,
                    Rome, Benevento, Salerno, Lecce, Sassari, Catania, and Messina. The total area
                    of the ground so occupied was only 4500 hectares (11,120 acres) in 1877; to
                    satisfy the national demand from internal sources would require from 18,000 to
                    20,000 hectares (44,480 to 49,420 acres). On an average it is calculated that
                    every inhabitant of Italy uses about 5 oz. of snuff, 10 oz. of cut tobacco, and
                    9⅜ oz. of cigars annually—the total expense being 5*518 lire or 4s. βd. per
                    head.</p>
                <p>The manufacture of oils is among the most flourishing of the minor industries,
                    and the demand which it makes on foreign countries for supplies of raw material
                    is rapidly increasing. The amount of oil-seeds imported in 1870 was 27,000
                    quintals, in 1879 211,400 quintals. And at the same time the consumption of the
                    oils within the country exceeds the quantity manufactured, so that the excess of
                    the import over the export of oil in 1879, for instance, was 135,660 quintals.
                    There are 437 oil works in the kingdom (198 in Lombardy), and they employ nearly
                    2000 hands. Rape, linseed, ricinus, ground-nuts, and sesamum are all made use
                    of, especially the first and last. Soap works are said to number as many as 537
                    (151 in Sicily alone, and 87 in Apulia), and to engage 1770 men, 135 women, and
                    179 children; and the exportation of soap, which was less than a third of the
                    importation in 1870, has increased till the excess is strongly in its favour.
                    The 10 stearine-candle factories employ upwards of 500 hands, and form the
                    nucleus of what may be a large industry.</p>
                <p>The sugar manufacture is of limited extent. During the Austrian rule it was
                    carried on in Lombardy and Venice with the support of the state; but the
                    political changes proved fatal to its existence, and it was not till 1872 that
                    the first sugar refinery of the kingdom of Italy was established at
                    Samρierdarena. This, however, proved a flourishing business, and supplied about
                    one quarter of the entire consumption of Italy, which was estimated at
                    176,000,000 tt&gt;; in 1876 it employed 500 hands, and carried on distilling
                    operations. Beet-root sugar has been manufactured since 1869 at Anagni, where
                    the factory was formerly protected and privileged by the Papal Government; and
                    there are other factories at Rieti, Cesa (in the Val di Chiana), &amp;c.
                    (English Parliamentary Papers:— <hi rend="italic">Reports on Sugar Industries in
                    Foreign Countries,</hi> 1876.)</p>
                <p>In 1877 there were 9583 distilleries in the country, and 370 manufactories of
                    aerated waters. The brewing establishments amounted to 145, and manufactured
                    2,488,838 gallons. Both barley and hops are largely imported from abroad, the
                    hops mainly from Austria and Germany. In the following table (XVIII.) the first
                    column indicates the quantity of beer annually imported, the second the quantity

                <p>The iron manufacture has increased in importance in Italy during the last decade.
                    In 1872 the production of wrought iron and steel was estimated at 48,909 tons;
                    in 1877 it was 73,000 tons, and 12,000 hands were employed in the works. Liguria
                    has the credit of nearly half of the total amount. The works at Savona, Voltri,
                    and Pra, at Vobarno near Lake Garda, and at Vai d’Elsa deserve mention. Some of
                    these have furnaces of the Siemens type.</p>
                <p>Considerable progress has also been made in the manufacture of machinery; the
                    number of men employed in this department (the Government factories being
                    omitted) increased from less than 12,000 in 1872 to 15,000 in 1877. The Italian
                    mechanicians do not seek to compete with foreigners in the production of large
                    steam engines and hydraulic motors, but devote their attention to the minor
                    kinds of machinery for wool and cotton factories, dye works, railways,
                    &amp;c.</p>
                <p>The principal chemical works are those of sulphuric acid at Milan, Turin, Naples,
                    and Genoa, of hydrochloric acid at Milan, of nitric acid at Milan and Avigliana
                    near Turin, of carbon disulphide at Bari, Pisa, San Giuliano, and of quinine at
                    Milan and Genoa. This last manufacture, though it only dates from 1870, exceeds
                    that of any other European country. The quinine is partly exported to Russia.
                    Tartaric acid, as a matter of course in a wine-growing country, is produced in
                    abundance. Glue-making is also a widely diffused industry, and the manufacture

                    remains the art has for the most part perished. The works at Vinovo, which had
                    fame in the 18th century, came to an untimely end in 1820; those of Castelli (in
                    Abruzzo Ult. I.) were supplanted by Charles III.’s establishment at

                    surprising execution was closed before the end of the century. The first place
                    now belongs to the Della Doccia works at Florence. Founded in 1735 by the
                    marquis Carlo Ginori, they maintained a reputation of the very highest kind down
                    to about 1860; but since then they have not kept pace with their younger rivals
                    in other lands. They still, however, are commercially successful, producing to
                    the value of 700,000 or 800,000 lire, and employing 600 workers. Other cities
                    where the ceramic industries keep their ground are Pesaro, Gubbio, Faenza (whose
                    name long ago became the distinctive term for the finer kind of potter’s work in
                    France, <hi rend="italic">faience),</hi> Savona and Albissola, Turin, Mondovi,
                    Cuneo, Castellamonte (more than 30 establishments, 500 workmen), Milan, Brescia,
                    Sassuolo, Imola, Rimini, Pemgia, Castelli, &amp;c. It is estimated that the
                    total production of the finer wares amounts on the average to 10,000,000 lire
                    per annum. The ruder branches of the art—the making of tiles and common wares—is
                    pretty generally diffused. (For further details see Giuseppe Corona’s <hi
                    rend="italic">Report</hi><hi rend="italic">on the French Exhibition of</hi>

                <p>The jeweller’s art as a matter of course received large encouragement in a
                    country which had so many independent courts; but nowhere has it attained a
                    fuller development than at Rome. A vast variety of trinkets—-in coral, glass,
                    lava, &amp;c.—is exported from Italy, or carried away by the annual host of
                    tourists. In 1877, for example, while 388 quintals of raw coral were imported,
                    563 quintals of wrought coral were exported, and in the same year no less than
                    22,891 quintals of imitation jewellery in glass. The copying of the paintings of
                    the old masters is becoming an art industry of no small mercantile importance in
                    some of the larger cities.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"

                <p>The production of mosaics is an art industry still carried on with much success
                    in Italy, which indeed ranks exceedingly high in the department. The great works
                    of the Vatican are especially famous (more than 17,000 distinct tints are
                    employed in their productions)* and there are many other establishments in Rome.
                    The Florentine mosaics are perhaps better known abroad; they arc composed of
                    larger pieces than the Roman. Those of the Venetian artists are remarkable for
                    the boldness of their colouring.</p>
                <p>The small amount of capital accumulated in the country, the heavy expenses
                    involved in the importation of much of the machinery necessary for the larger
                    industries, the comparative inexpertness of the mass of the operatives, and the
                    difficulty consequent upon these and other circumstances of competing with
                    foreign manufacturers who can produce at a cheaper r⅛te—these are some of the
                    reasons of the backward state of Italian manufacturing industry. The
                    inexpertness of the operatives—due to lack of experience and of education—is the
                    more noteworthy because it counteracts the advantage to be derived from the
                    cheapness of labour. The principle of the division of labour has comparatively
                    limited application. From the same factory, for instance, may be obtained
                    ploughshares and theodolites.</p>

                <p>To complete the total for Trapani, it is necessary to add 26 boats with 471
                    hands, which are employed in the sponge fishery off Tunis. For Italy, as for the
                    other Mediterranean nations, the tunny fishing is of considerable moment. The
                    more important stations are those in Sicily, Sardinia, and Elba. Apart from
                    local consumption the annual value of the Sardinian fishery is estimated at
                    4,000,000 lire, and that of Sicily at about half as much.</p>
                <p>The anchovy and sardine fisheries are carried on by Italian boats, not only on
                    the Ligurian and Tuscan coasts, but on those of France, Spain, Barbary,
                    Dalmatia, and Istria. Among the stations which take an active share in this
                    department are Sestri and Riva,</p>
                <p>Cecina and Castiglione, Porto Ercole, Porto Longone in Elba, Ancona, and
                    Chioggia. The success of the fishermen is now seldom so great as it was before
                    1868; and 2 lire per day is the most that can be gained in the best months at
                    the better stations. The annual value of the sardines brought to Terracina is
                    stated at 6300 lire, and that of the anchovies at 7000; and the corresponding
                    figures for Porto d’Anzio and Palermo are respectively 98,000 and 32,000 lire,
                    200,000 and 400,000. Civita Vecchia has a total for the two kinds of 15,000
                    lire.</p>

                    against them being a species of harpoon or <hi rend="italic">drafineria.</hi> As
                    many as fifty fish may be caught in a single day off the coast of Sicily, and
                    twenty off the coasts of Calabria. Each fish weighs on an average from 220 to
                    440 lb; and the quantity captured in the season in the two districts indicated
                    may amount to 308,000 lb.</p>
                <p>Coral is obtained in various parts of the Italian waters, more especially in the
                    neighbourhood of the island of Elba and the Gulf of Naples, and the Italian
                    coral fishers extend their voyages to the African coast and the islands of Cape
                    Verd. In 1869 it was stated that upwards of 490 vessels, of 2712 tons total
                    burden, were employed in the department, by far the greater proportion of them
                    belonging to Torre del Greco. The statistics given in Table XIX. show but little
                    change. The hardships endured by the more adventurous fishers are extremely’
                    severe, and the gain is comparatively slight. (Compare Green’s <hi rend="italic"

                <p>Of special importance are the lagoon fisheries of Orbetello, of the Mare Piccolo
                    of Taranto, the Lago Verzimino or Salpi, and the Lago di Varano, and more
                    particularly of Comacchio. Eels, soles, mullets, and various other kinds of fish
                    are there obtained in enormous quantities.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    mitigated to some degree by the mildness of the climate and the cheapness of
                    certain articles of food, pauperism in its most painful forms is a widespread
                    evil in Italy’. At Venice, out of a total population of 130,000, 36,000 are
                    regular recipients of official charity. The slums of Naples are foul ami
                    overcrowded as the slums of London. Nor is the destitution confined to the
                    cities. The condition of the agricultural labourers is in many cases deplorable.
                    In the districts of Como, Milan, Pavia, and Lodi, the food of the contadino,
                    according to F. Cardani and F. Massara, consists of maize bread, badly cooked,
                    heavy’ and rancid, and thin soup composed of rice or .“pasta” of inferior
                    quality and vegetables often old and spoiled. In Soutirera Italy, says Villari,
                    the peasants live in miserable houses, with a sack of straw for their bed, and
                    black bread for their sole sustenance. Maize is the general food stuff in the
                    northern ami central provinces, but begins to he rarer in Tuscany and Rome; it
                    is again widely diffused in the upper provinces of Naples; but in Calabria and
                    Apulia it forms the principal nutriment of scarcely a fourth of the communes,
                    and in Sicily it disappears almost completely. In Piedmont, Lombardy, and the
                    Veneto it is used mainly in the form of polenta, hut also in the form of bread,
                    and in the Napoletano in the form of a finer kind of polenta. Lombardy, the
                    Veneto, Emilia, and the Marches are the regions where wheaten bread is least
                    employed by the peasants. Barley is mainly consumed in Apulia and Calabria, rye
                    in Sicily and Lombardy. In certain communes of the Marches and the Abruzzi
                    acorns constitute the ordinary diet of the poor. Wheaten pastes are most
                    extensively employed by the people in Liguria, Sicily, and the upper Neapolitan
                    provinces. Animal food holds but little place in the dietary of the poor; and
                    even in the house of the well-to-do peasant butcher meat appears but seldom.
                    According to Dr Raseri, who has investigated the point by means of the customs
                    returns and similar statistics, Sardinia is the region where animal food is most
                    largely employed, and Sicily that where it is least.</p>
                <p>Wine is naturally the prevailing drink throughout the country; but the extent of
                    the consumption varies greatly from region to region, the average in the Roman
                    province, Umbria, and Sardinia much exceeding that in the provinces of Naples
                    and in Sicily. Tħc use of alcohol is greatest in the Lombardo-Venetian cities;
                    and it is there only that beer is of importance as a beverage. Cases of
                    accidental death and of insanity attributable to the misuse of stimulants are
                    much more frequent in the north than in the south or centre, andin both respects
                    Liguria has an unenviable pre-eminence.</p>
                <p>An idea of the extent to which even the peasantry are oppressed by penury may be
                    obtained from the investigations made by the Government into the spread of the
                    terrible disease known as the <hi rend="italic">pellagra.</hi> First clearly
                    described as an Italian disease by Frapolli in 1771, the pellagra has within the
                    present century gradually’ become more common and severe. In 1839 it was
                    estimated that the number of pellagra patients was 20,282 in the “compartment of
                    Lombardy, and in 1856 it had increased to 38,777. According to <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0913-0475-0456"/> returns tor 1879 it appears that there were
                    97,855 patients in the kingdom—by far the greater proportion being in Lombardy,
                    the Veneto, and Emilia, where they actually formed 31’70, 30'52, and 23'66 per
                    thousand of the agricultural population. The disease has many forms, and not
                    unfrequently ends in insanity. And to what are its ravages to be ascribed? To
                    insufficient and unwholesome food, and more particularly to the use of maize in
                    a state unfit for human consumption.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                <p>The interest of the Italians is gradually being aroused in the sanitary condition
                    of their cities and towns. Many of the provincial capitals and cathedral cities

                    matters of concern to a number of the more important communes; and such cities
                    more especially as Naples and Catania are bestowing much attentif n on the

                    countries of the Mediterranean seaboard, and the railway communication which it
                    now possesses with the Transalpine lands combine to give Italy an important
                    place as a trading-country,—a place which would have been more important if all
                    departments of activity had not fallen into so sad a state during the long
                    period of its political decadence. In a country with a population comparatively
                    so dense, and with so large a number of considerable cities as we have seen
                    Italy to possess, it is evident on the face of it that the internal trade must
                    amount to no small aggregate; but the simple agricultural life which is led by a
                    large proportion of the inhabitants, the capacity which many regions possess of
                    satisfying the demands of local consumption, limited at once in volume and
                    variety, and the lack in many cases of free and frequent means of communication
                    tend to restrain the scope and complexity of this interchange. That both the
                    internal trade and the foreign commerce of Italy are in process of rapid
                    development it is impossible to doubt. Of the former movement some idea may be
                    obtained from the railway statistics, which, however, owing to the

                <p>“1111873,” says Dr A. Brunialti, the author of “Le grandi vie del commercio
                    intemazionale,” published in <hi rend="italic">Studij sulla</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Geografin</hi><hi rend="italic">dell’ Italia</hi> (Florence,
                    1875), issued by the Italian Geographical Society, “Italy, with a total of
                    2,400,000,000 lire, was eighth in the list of commercial nations of Europe,
                    being exceeded by Great Britain (17,000,000,000 lire), Germany,
                    France,Russia,Belgium, Austria, and Holland, though Belgium is less than
                    one-tenth of Italy in area, and has not more than one-fifth of its population,
                    and Holland is not much bigger than Belgium, and has one-third less of a
                    population.” In 1877 it was still eighth on the list, and some of the smaller
                    countries had made greater advance. The Italian trade with France and with
                    Switzerland has enormously increased since the unification of the kingdom; and
                    the same may be said of the trade with Russia. Since the opening of the Suez
                    Canal advantage has been taken of the new opportunities of trade with the
                    East.</p>
                <p>Table XXL gives the geographical distribution of the Italian trade during 1869,
                    1873, and 1879. In 1880 the whole value of the imports (excluding transit trade)
                    was 1,225,644,170 lire, and the corresponding number for the exports
                    1,132,289,192.</p>
                <p>The Italian exports, as a natural consequence of the undeveloped state of the
                    industries and the preponderance of its agriculture, mainly consist of such
                    products as wine, oil, fruit, cattle, &amp;c.</p>

                    importation over exportation in the case of raw wool was 4,249,135 kilogrammes

                    but at an enormous distance, is Austria, and fourth Greece. It is calculated
                    that in the vessels, native and foreign, that visited the Italian ports in 1879,
                    no less than 1,748,717 men were engaged as seamen.</p>
                <p>The Government undertakes the engineering works necessary for the improvement and

                <p>The marine showed a total strength of 167,282 men,—8 being captains of the class
                    technically called “superior,” 4122 captains of “long course,” and 2504 captains
                    of the higher coasting class.</p>

                    others more than 1000. The steamers belonging to the country at the close of
                    1879 were 151 in number (aggregate burden 72,666 tons), of which 70 were
                    Genoese, 11 Neapolitan, and 51 Palermitan. Of the total, 128 were screwsteamers
                    and 23 paddle-steamers. Boats adapted for fishing were registered at the same
                    date as 15,411, of which no fewer than 1953 belonged to the Naples district, and
                    1399 to that of Messina. Shipbuilding was carried on in 50 ship yards in 1879;
                    and they produced 269 vessels, with a total burden of 21,213 tons.</p>

                    96,010 tons); in the next three years there was a decline; by 1875 the figures
                    of 1869 were again almost reached, but since then there has been a very notable
                    decrease. The number of workmen engaged in 1879 was 14,179, of whom 182 were

                <p>Thus the total cost may be stated at £100,800,000. At the end of 1879 the rolling
                    stock consisted of 1385 locomotives, 4301 carriages, and 23,483 waggons. The
                    total expenditure of the railways for the year 1879 was 101,088,901 lire, and
                    the total receipts 164,672,340.</p>
                <p>Except in the northern part of the country the Italian railway system is still
                    far from complete. With the French system it is connected by the coast-line from
                    Genoa to Nice, and by the line from Turin to Geneva, which passes through the
                    Mont Cenis tunnel. With the Austrian system there is connexion by the line which
                    runs up the valley of the Adige from Verona to Botzen and by the lines which
                    cross the eastern frontiers at Pontebba and Cormons respectively. From Milan to
                    Piacenza, from Piacenza to Bologna, from Bologna to Ancona, and from Ancona to
                    Brindisi, there is free route from the north right along the eastern coast; but
                    the lines on the western coast take the traveller no farther south than a little
                    beyond Salerno, and to reach Reggio from Naples involves a tremendous circuit.
                    *By the law of July 29, 1879, a great number of new lines received parliamentary
                    sanction, the effect of which will be to complete the western coast-line, to
                    increase the number of routes from the western to the eastern seaboard, and to
                    furnish railway communication to numerous cities and districts which are now
                    without it.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Roads and Canals.—</hi> It was found that on 31st December 1877
                    there existed in the kingdom 5151 miles of national reads, 15,596 of provincial
                    roads, and 48,295 of communal roads—all very unequally distributed throughout
                    the country. The navigable canals have an aggregate length of about 663 miles,
                    and the navigable portions of the rivers an aggregate length of 1100.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Postal and Telegraphic System.—</hi> The rate of development
                    attained by the postal system is shown by the following figures. From 1862 to
                    1879 (both inclusive) the number of offices has increased from 2220 to 3272, the
                    number of letters from 71,502,779 per annum to 143,587,709, the yearly
                    expenditure from 21,740,226 lire to <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit13newyrich/page/n477/mode/1up"

                    11,944,797 lire to 26,998,784. There was a deficit in each of the six years
                    1862- 1868; since then there has always been at least a slight surplus.
                    Post-office savings banks were introduced by the law of 1875. In the first year
                    1989 offices were opened, and the amount of the deposits was 3,709,357 lire. In
                    1879 the offices numbered 3259, and the deposits amounted to 33,564,370
                    lire.</p>
                <p>The telegraphic system took its beginning in Italy in 1861 By the end of 1866 the
                    lines had reached an aggregate length of 14,000 kilometres, and a
                    wire-development of 38,000; and by the close of 1879 the corresponding figures
                    were 25,533 and 84,101 kilometres. The country was thus, if the ratio of the
                    lines to the area be considered, a long way in advance of Spain and Hungary, but
                    considerably behind the other chief states of Europe. The following are the
                    submarine cables belonging to the state :— Bagnara-Torre di Faro (dating from
                    1876); Carmitello-Ganzirri, uniting Sicily and Calabria; Otranto-Valona (dating
                    from 1863); Pozzuoli-Procida; Procida-Ischia; Sardinia-Carloforte;
                    Sardinia-Isola della Maddalena; Piombino-Elba; Venice-Chioggia. France maintains
                    a cable between Corsica and Leghorn, and between Corsica and Sardinia; the
                    Mediterranean Extension Company keeps up communication between Sicily and Malta,
                    and between Otranto and Corfu, and the Eastern Telegraph Company has lines
                    between Calabria and Sicily, Orbetello and Sardinia, and Otranto and Alexandria
                    (via Zante and Crete). The number of telegraph offices in 1879, Government and
                    private, was 2480. The number of telegrams despatched in 1877 and 1879 was as

                    capable of bearing arms are under obligation of military service from their
                    twenty-first to the end of their thirty-ninth year. They are divided into three
                    categories: the first and second consist of those who are to serve successively

                    cavalry five years under· arms, and for the rest of their time forming the

                    army, four or three years in the mobile, and the remainder of their term in the

                <p>By the law of 15th May 1877 the country is divided into ten army corps districts,
                    the seats of which are Verona, Milan, Turin, Piacenza, Bologna, Florence, Rome,
                    Naples, Bari, and Palermo. These are broken up into twenty military divisions,
                    one half of which are centred in the cities just mentioned and the other half in
                    Padua, Brescia, Genoa, Ancona, Perugia, Salerno, Chieti, Catanzaro, Messina. The

                    2162 gunners. The greatest of the naval establishments in the kingdom is that of
                    Spezia, which was opened about 1876, instead of the similar establishment at
                    Genoa. The arsenal in 1879 had an area measuring 3930 feet in length by 2450 in
                    breadth. Two other arsenals are maintained at Naples and Venice respectively.
                    The workmen employed in the various establishments numbered 6292 in 1879.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Religion.—</hi> The Roman Catholic Church claims the great mass
                    of the Italian population; but, besides the ordinary Latin rite, several others
                    are recognized in the country. The Armenians of Venice maintain their
                    traditional characteristics. The Albanians of the southern provinces still
                    employ the Greek rite and the Greek language in their public worship, and their
                    priests, like those of the Greek Church, are allowed to marry. And certain
                    peculiarities introduced by St Ambrose distinguish the ritual of Milan from that
                    of the general church. Up to 1871 the island of Sicily was, according to the
                    bull of Urban II., ecclesiastically dependent on the king, and exempt from the
                    canonical power of the pope.</p>
                <p>Though the territorial authority of the papal see was abolished in 1870, the fact
                    that Italy, and Rome more particularly, is the seat of the administrative centre
                    of the vast organization of the church is not without significance to the
                    nation. In the same city in which the administrative functions of the body
                    politic are centralized there still exists the court of the spiritual potentate
                    with a total personnel (in 1879) of 1821 souls.</p>
                <p>The number of episcopal dioceses in Italy is 265; but as it sometimes happens
                    that more than one io subject to the same bishop, the number of these
                    functionaries is somewhat less. Every diocese has full individuality as a
                    corporation, and possesses a cathedral with a chapter of canons, a number of
                    minor benefices, and a seminary. The number of canons before the law of 1867 was
                    4699. Including the so-called patriarch of Venice, there are thirty-seven
                    metropolitans who have jurisdiction not only over their own immediate dioceses,

                <p>There are 24,980 parishes in the kingdom, and the parish priest has a
                    considerable influence in the country districts, though since 1866 he can no
                    longer act as a state official. About 800,000 lire are spent annually by the
                    Fondo pel Culto in augmentation of the parochial stipends. The parishes vary
                    greatly both in size and population, some having as many as 14,000 inhabitants,
                    and others less than 100. The priest in the country has a glebe or <hi
                    rend="italic">podere</hi> which he cultivates like any of the lesser landholders
                    of his district; and he is thus interested in the state of the markets, the
                    character of the harvest, and the general condition of affairs.</p>
                <p>As in every diocese there is a seminary or diocesan school, the number of such
                    institutions exceeds that of the royal, provincial, and communal lyceums (7tcez
                    <hi rend="superscript"> -</hi>) and gymnasiums <hi rend="italic">{ginnasi).</hi>
                    In so far as they concern themselves with secular education, they are subject to
                    the supervision of the minister of instruction. At the time of the inspection of
                    1877—78 they were found to have 17,478 pupils, of whom only 3547 were studying
                    theology.</p>
                <p>The only Protestant denomination with a true historical position in Italy is that
                    of the Waldensians, which has taken advantage of the religious liberty of the
                    new kingdom to come down from the mountain fastnesses. Besides the sixteen
                    churches (with 11,958 members in 1879) which it possessed at the time of its
                    recognition by law in the kingdom of Sardinia in 1848, it numbers thirty-nine
                    churches and thirty-two mission stations scattered throughout the country as far
                    south as Sicily; and it maintains between twenty and thirty elementary schools.
                    The ‘-Free Italian Church,” founded in 187Ö by twenty-three churches which
                    declared themselves independent of the Waldensian organization, consisted in
                    1879 of thirty-six churches and thirty-five stations; and since 1876 it has a
                    theological college in Rome. Ina number of the larger cities of N orthern and
                    Central Italy there are considerable congregations of the “Free Christian
                    Church,” a community or “brotherhood” which believes that stated ministers and
                    church statistics are both un-Christian. The Wesleyan Meth odist Church, having
                    carried on evangelizing operations in Italy since 1861, has forty-three churches
                    and stations with about 1306 communicants, and in its elementary schools 776
                    scholars. Of less extent are the more modera attainments of the American
                    Episcopal Methodists, the American Baptists, and the English Baptists. Several
                    orphanages, refuges, and schools of special purpose owe their existence to
                    Protestant benevolence. Compare Giorgio Curcio, “Progamma per una statistica dei
                    culti in Italia,” in <hi rend="italic">Annali</hi><hi rend="italic">di</hi><hi

                <p><hi rend="italic">Religious</hi><hi rend="italic">Foundations.—</hi> As far back
                    as 1855 an Act was passed in the Sardinian states for the disestablishment of
                    all houses of the religious orders not engaged in preaching, teaching, or the
                    care of the sick, of all chapters of collegiate churches not having a cure of
                    souls or existing in towns of less than 20,000 inhabitants, and of all private
                    benefices for which no service was paid by the holders. The property and money
                    thus obtained were used to form an ecclesiastical fund <hi rend="italic">{Cassa
                    Ecclesiastica)</hi> distinct from the finances of the state. This Act resulted
                    in the suppression cf 274 monasteries with 3733 friars, of 61 nunneries with
                    1756 nuns, and of 2722 chapters and benefices. In 1860 and 1861 the royal
                    commissioners (even before the constitution of the new kingdom of Italy had been
                    formally declared) issued decrees by which there were abolished—(1) in Umbria,
                    197 monasteries and 102 convents with 1809 male and 2393 female associates, and
                    836 chapters or benefices; (2) in the Marches, 292 monasteries and 127 convents
                    with 2950 male and 2728 female associates; (3) in the Neapolitan provinces, 747
                    monasteries and 275 convents with 8787 male and 7493 female associates. There
                    were thus disestablished in the space of seyen or eight years 2075 houses of the
                    regular clergy occupied by 31,649 persons; and the confiscated property <hi
                    rend="superscript"> 7</hi> yielded a revenue of 9,957,457 lire, or £398,298. And
                    at the same time there had been suppressed 11,889 chapters and benefices of the
                    secular clergy, which yielded an annual income of 4,978,728 lire, or £199,149.
                    The value of the capital thus potentially freed from the dead hand was estimated
                    at £12,000,000; though hitherto the ecclesiastical possessions in Lombardy,
                    Emilia, Tuscany, and Sicily had been left untouched. As yet the Cassa
                    Ecclesiastica had no right to dispose of the property thus entrusted to it; but
                    in 1862 an Act was passed by which it transferred all its real property <hi
                    rend="italic">{bcni</hi><hi rend="italic">stabili</hi> or <hi rend="italic"
                    >immobili)</hi> to the national domain, and was credited with a corresponding
                    amount by the exchequer. The property could now be disposed of like the other
                    property of the domain; and except in Sicily, where the system of emphyteusis
                    was adopted, the church lands began to be sold by auction. In order to encourage
                    the poorer classes of the people to become landholders, it was decided that the
                    lots offered for sale should be small, and that the purchaser should be allowed
                    to pay by five or ten yearly instalments. By a new Act in 1866 the process of
                    secularization was extended to the whole kingdom. All the members of the
                    suppressed communities received full exercise of all the ordinary political and
                    civil rights of laymen; and annuities were granted to all those who had taken
                    permanent religious vows prior to 18th January 1864. To priests and choristers,
                    for example, of the proprietary or endowed orders were assigned 600 lire per
                    annum if they were upwards of sixty years of age, 400 if upwards of 40, and 360
                    if younger. The Cassa Ecclesiastica was abolished, and in its stead was
                    instituted a <hi rend="italic">Fondo pel Cullo,</hi> or public worship fund,
                    attached to the department of grace and justice, and administered by a director
                    and a council consisting of three senators, three deputies, and three nominees
                    of the king. From the general confiscation were exempted the buildings actually
                    used for public worship, as episcopal residences or seminaries, &amp;c., or
                    which had been appropriated to the use of schools, poorhouses, hospitals,
                    &amp;c., by the communes and provinces in keeping with the acts of 1861 and
                    1864; as well as the buildings, appurtenances, and movable property of the
                    abbeys of Monte Casino, Della Cava dei TirrenifSan Martino della Scala,
                    Monreale, Certosa near Pavia, and other establishments of the same kind of
                    importance as architectural or historical monuments. An annuity equal to the
                    ascertained revenue of the suppressed institutions was placed to the credit of
                    the fund in the Government 5 per cent, consols. A fourth of this sum was tobe
                    handed over to the communes to be employed on works of beneficence or education
                    as soon as a surplus was obtained from that part of the annuity assigned for the
                    payment of monastic pensions; and in Sicily, indeed, 209 communes entered on
                    their privileges as soon as the patrimony was liquidated. Another Act following
                    on August 15, 1867, decreed the suppression of certain foundations which had
                    escaped the action of previous measures, put an extraordinary tax of 30 per
                    .cent, on the whole of the patrimony <hi rend="superscript"> 7</hi> of the
                    chureh, and granted the Government the right of issuing 5 per cent, bonds
                    sufficient to bring into the treasury 400,000,000 lire, which were to be

                    the whole legislation from 1855 to 1867 was the abrogation of nearly 50,000
                    ecclesiastical foundations which were rendering almost no service to the country
                    beyond that of supporting an idle population of more than 60,000 souls. The
                    following figures (Table XXXIII.) summarize the chief facts of the suppression

                <p>The total of the real property taken over by the domain up to 31st December 1877
                    may be estimated as yielding an aggregate revenue of 30,969,465 lire or
                    £1,238,778 and possessing a capital value of 839,776,076 lire or £33,910,430. Of
                    the latter sum 530,649,932 lire represent the property disposed of for the
                    benefit of the state, 75,542,813 the property granted in emphyteusis, &amp;c.,
                    8,098,294 the property handed over to Government for administrative purposes,
                    125,191,797 the property transferred to lawful claimants, and 100,293,200 the
                    property not yet alienated. The Fondo pel Culto derives its income from four
                    different sources:—(1) as already indicated, from the public funds; (2) from the
                    buildings still occupied by the ex-monks, &amp;c., and other property not
                    transferred to the domain; (3) from rents, ground-annuals, livelli, tithes, and
                    other annual dues; (4) from contributions exacted from the revenues of
                    ecclesiastical foundations still maintained. The third source is especially
                    valuable, yielding in 1876, for example, 13,984,000 lire, and being capable of
                    considerable augmentation under judicious management. The total expenditure of
                    the fund during the ten years from the institution of the same to the close of
                    1876 amounted to 278,399,592 lire or £11,135,983, distributed as follows (Table

                <p>The heaviest of these items is one that is gradually diminishing, and will
                    finally become extinct, by the dying out of the pensioners. On the 31st of
                    December· 1876 the deficit of the fund was 48,312,686 lire or
                    £1,932,507,—650,180 lire having been the deficit taken over from the Cassa
                    Ecclesiastica. By 1879 the debt was reduced to 1,688,719 lire.</p>
                <p>Hitherto only a passing allusion has been made to the legislation relating to the
                    Roman territory acquired after the passing of the Acts above indicated. In the
                    province as distinguished from the city the only thing requisite was to make the
                    existing measures applicable, but in the case of the city and the suburban
                    districts special enactments had to be provided. According to the census of 1871
                    there were in the city and province of Rome 474 monastic establishments (311 for
                    monks, 163 for nuns), occupied by 4326 monks and 3825 nuns, and possessing a
                    gross revenue of 4,780,891 lire. - Of these, 126 monasteries and 90 convents
                    were situated in the city, 51 monasteries and 22 convents in the
                    “suburbicariates.” The action of the law of June 19th 1873 has left untouched 23
                    of the monasteries and 49 of the convents, which had either the character of
                    private institutions, or were supported by foreign funds. In the city alone 2977
                    individuals became recipients of pensions from the fund to the aggregate value
                    of 1,319,832 lire.</p>
                <p>Table XXXV. furnishes details regarding the suppression and modification of
                    ecclesiastical foundations.</p>
                <p>For further information, see G. C. Bertozzi, “Notizie stoιiche e statistiche sul
                    riordinamento dell’ asse ecclesiastico nel regno d’Italia,” in <hi rend="italic"
                    >Annali</hi><hi rend="italic">di Stat.,</hi> 1879; and the summary of the same
                    by Bellini in the <hi rend="italic">Archivio di Stat.,</hi> 1880.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Education.—</hi> In the matter of education the kingdom of
                    Italy at the time of its formation might almost be described as a desert, broken
                    every here and there by an oasis of matchless fertility and luxuriance. The
                    learning of the learned was high, and the ignorance of the ignorant profound. As
                    late as the census of 1861 it was found that in a population of 21,777,331 there
                    were no less than 16,999,701 “analphabètes,” or persons absolutely destitute of
                    instruction, absolutely unable to read. Of children between five and twelve as
                    many as 82 per cent, were in this condition; of those between twelve and
                    nineteen 71 per cent. And, as was natural, the ignorance was greater in the
                    female sex than in the male: while 59 per cent, of the men married in 1866 were
                    obliged to make their mark, 78 per cent, of the women were in like case. In
                    certain parts of the country matters were even worse. Μ. Natoli found, <hi
                    rend="italic">c.g.,</hi> that in the Basilicata the illiterate class comprised
                    912 out of every 1000 inhabitants. It was thus no light task that presented
                    itself to the department of education; and the progress that has been attained
                    does honour to its activity: in 1879 only 48 per cent, of the bridegrooms and 70
                    per cent, of the brides were unable to sign their names.</p>
                <p>The administration of the education department is not so strictly centralized as
                    it is in France. The minister of public instruction is assisted by a permanent
                    council of fourteen ordinary and seven extraordinary members nominated by the
                    king and chosen from the upper ranks of the educational profession. And this
                    council has no mere nominal existence; it meets regularly thrice a week, though
                    it often contains men of European celebrity. Five of its members, selected by
                    the king, constitute a fine arts commission. Another general council — the <hi
                    rend="italic">Proυcditorato</hi><hi rend="italic">Centrale</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >—</hi> established in 1867, has special control of secondary and primary
                    instruction. In each of the sixty-nine provinces there is a <hi rend="italic"
                    >consiglio scolastico</hi> or school board, under the presidency of the prefect,
                    which has the right of supervision in regard to the sanitary and moral state of
                    the provincial schools, private as well as public. By the law of 1859 (known as
                    the Casati Act) every commune of 4000 inhabitants is bound to maintain a primary
                    school; but as a matter of fact some of the communes are too small and poor to
                    have a school of their own, and are permitted to send their children to the
                    schools of neighbouring communes. Elementary instruction is gratuitous, and by
                    the law of 15th July 1877 the compulsory principle was brought into operation as
                    far as the condition of the communes allows—Or, in other words, in all communes
                    of less than 5000 inhabitants provided with one teacher for every 1000, in all
                    communes of from 10O0 to 12,000 inhabitants provided with a teacher for every
                    1200, and in all the larger communes with one for every 1500. According to the

                <p>in 1878 by the minister of public instruction on the effects of the law, Northern
                    Italy was in the most favourable condition, having a much greater proportion of
                    communes than either Central or Southern Italy. While in the north only 383,916
                    inhabitants— scattered in little groups through the mountainous districts—were
                    unable to make use of the existing means of instruction, in Central Italy this
                    was found to be the case with 1,230,599 (out of a total population of 6⅛
                    millions); and matters were still worse in the south. In the central regions 498
                    of the 1235 communes were unable to enforce the law through lack of the legal
                    number of teachers, and in the southern provinces it would have been requisite
                    to increase the teaching staff by 1536. The following statistics indicate the
                    extent of the organization for primary instruction in 1879 ι<note

                    infant asylums, are after the Aporti method— <hi rend="italic">-forse,</hi> says

                    a certain number are conducted on FroebeΓs kindergarten system, which was
                    introduced among the Italians by the baroness Marienholtz-Bulow and George P.
                    Marsh the American minister. The principal institutions for secondary education
                    are the gymnasiums and the lyceums. The former have a course of five years, and
                    the instruction comprises Greek, Latin, Italian, history, geography, and
                    arithmetic; the latter, with a three years course, add to those subjects
                    philosophy, mathematics, physics, chemistry, and natural history. There are
                    seven masters or “professors” in each lyceum. The pupils entering the lyceum are
                    usually from fourteen to fifteen years of age; they are only admitted on
                    presenting a satisfactory gymnasial certificate. According to a pleasant custom,
                    the lyceum usually bears the name of some person of national and at the same
                    time local celebrity—as the Leopardi lyceum at Macerata. As the gymnasiums and
                    lyceums are too exclusively devoted to what is known as classical education
                    satisfactorily to subserve the necessities of modern life, they have been
                    supplemented by a very considerable number of technical schools, the earliest of
                    which in Italy dates as far back as 1848. No fewer than 43 trade schools were
                    subsidized by the minister of instruction in 1878-79. Most of the secondary
                    education institutions were intended for boys. In 1861 the municipality of Milan
                    founded a “high school” for girls, and their example has met with very
                    commendable imitation. A variety of establishments for female education were of
                    course in existence throughout the country at a much earlier date, but they were
                    organized on the basis for the most part of old-fashioned ideas in regard to
                    what was appropriate for women. Such are the so-called <hi rend="italic"
                    >conser-vatorii</hi> of Tuscany—which were originally purely religious
                    foundations, and only partially secularized by Leopold I.—and the St Mary
                    colleges of Sicily, which have occasioned so much controversy as to whether they
                    are educational or charitable institutions. The Government lyceums and
                    gymnasiums had 18,021 pupils in 1879, the other public lyceums and gymnasiums
                    11,779, lyceums and gymnasiums attached to the seminaries 11,650, and private
                    lyceums and gymnasiums 7139—making a total of 48,589.</p>
                <p>For the higher education Italy possesses no fewer than seventeen national
                    universities. They are all of more or less ancient date, except that of Rome,
                    which was opened in 1870, and it is a respect for this antiquity which is in
                    some cases the chief cause of their preservation. That several of them are of
                    comparatively small importance is shown by the following figures, exhibiting the
                    number of students or hearers of lectures for the year 1879 :—Naples had 2817,
                    Turin 1509, Padua 948, Pavia 672, Rome 648, Pisa 586, Bologna 569, Genoa 480,
                    Palermo 449, Modena 195, Parma 194, Siena 181, Catania 168, Messina 128,
                    Cagliari 95, Sassari 93, Macerata 82. Besides the seventeen establishments there
                    are four free universities, those of Perιιgia and Ferrara with three faculties
                    each, and those of Camerino and Urbino with two faculties. They are all
                    small,—the students for 1879 numbering 65 in Perugia, 60 in Urbino, 46 in
                    Feιτara, and 43 in Camerino. Theology has ceased to be a subject of instruction
                    in the national universities. In 1876-77 there were 3314 students in the faculty
                    of jurisprudence, 2842 in that of medicine, 1257 in that of the mathematical
                    sciences, and 212 in that of philosophy and letters. The university teaching
                    staff consists of ordinary professors, extraordinary professors, and free
                    professors, the last corresponding to the “Privat - docenten” of Germany. A
                    certificate of attendance at a lyceum is requisite for admission as a university
                    student, and candidates are further subjected to a preliminary examination.</p>
                <p>Among the institutions which cooperate with the universities it is sufficient to
                    mention the institute for the higher studies and the school of the social
                    sciences at Florence, the scientific and literary academy of Milan, the upper
                    technical institute of Milan, the engineering schools at Naples, Rome, and
                    Turin, the veterinary colleges at Milan, Naples, and Turin, the royal school of
                    commerce at Venice, the royal school of medicine and surgery at Naples. As an
                    indication of the extent to which such a list might be carried, we may take the
                    department of agricultural training. Here we have agrarian institutes and
                    farming colleges at Rome (1872), Castelletti near Signi (1864), Motrone in the
                    province of Lucca (1874), Macerata (1868), Cosenza (1870), Grumello del Monte
                    near Bergamo, Brescia (1876), Brasegnane near Padua (1872), Pesaro (1876),
                    Palermo (1819), Caltagirone (1868), Brindisi (1872), Lecce (refounded 1879),
                    &amp;c.; and many of these establishments have considerable pieces of land for
                    the purpose of practical training. The Middle Calabria school of agriculture
                    (1876) is also a school of <hi rend="italic">pastorizia</hi> or shepherd craft.
                    An <hi rend="italic">Istituto forestale</hi> was started at Vallombrosa in 1869,
                    and in the eight years (1872-1879) it has sent out eighty-three licentiates of
                    forestry. The school of “viticulture and enology,” or vine-growing and
                    wine-making, at Conegliano dates from 1876; it publishes a <hi rend="italic"
                    >Rivista di Viticoltura.</hi> A school of zootechnia and caseificio, or the
                    principles of cattle-breeding and cheese-making, exists at Reggio Emilia; and at
                    Palermo there is a special school for the art of sulphur-mining.</p>
                <p>In 1879 about 2,000,000 lire were devoted by the Government to the encouragement
                    of art. Art schools exist at Bologna, Carrara, Florence, Lucca, Massa, Milan,
                    Modena, Naples, Parma, Ravenna, Rome, Reggio Emilia, Turin, Urbino, Venice; and
                    the number of pupils has increased from about 3000 in 1862 to 5000 in 1879.
                    Besides these fifteen official establishments, of which that of Milan—with a
                    maximum of 1491 pupils—is by far the largest, there are academies at Genoa,
                    Bergamo, Verona, Siena, Pisa, and Perugia. A <hi rend="italic">Museo
                    Tiberino</hi> has been established by the commission charged to superintend the
                    exploration of the Tiber. Five musical conservatorios are supported by
                    Government at Florence, Milan, Naples, Palermo, and Parma.</p>
                <p>Next to the difficulty of arousing the interest of the mass of the people in
                    matters of education, so as to secure the realization of the legal enactments,
                    the greatest difficulty perhaps with which the administration has had to contend
                    has been that of obtaining a sufficient supply of teachers competent for their
                    task. In the normal and “magistral” schools training is provided at the national
                    expense for candidates, whether male or female, for the teaching profession. The
                    age for entrance is fixed at sixteen for male and fifteen for female students,
                    and the course of study lasts for three years. In 1877-78 there were 35 normal
                    and “magistral” schools for male and 67 for female teachers. The number of
                    pupils was 7854 (1447 males and 6407 females).</p>

                <p>The great Italian public libraries are those of Turin, Milan, Naples, Florence.
                    Florence receives a copyright copy of all new books and new editions. The Pavia
                    library is especially rich in works in natural science, the legacy left by
                    Professor Frank enabling it to purchase from 1500 to 1600 new works per annum.
                    The total number of new books added to all the state libraries, which now number
                    33, was in 1872 about 14,000. The readers numbered 853,901, besides 9008
                    teachers who got books home with them. More recent statistics show comparatively
                    little change.</p>
                <p>Among the philanthropic educational institutions those for the tuition of
                    deaf-mutes deserve particular mention. It was in Italy that some of the earlier
                    attempts were made to give instruction to this class of unfortunates; and two of
                    its most important establishments, the royal institute of deaf-mutes at Genoa
                    and the corresponding institute at Milan, date respectively from 1801 and 1805.
                    From a report (Rome, 1880) which was compiled for the instruction of the second
                    international congress of deaf-mute teachers (Milan, 1881) it appears that there
                    are thirty-five establishments of this class, with 1491 pupils in 1880, the
                    largest being at Milan, Bologna, Naples, Turin, and Genoa. The total number of
                    deaf-mutes in the kingdom is estimated at nearly 12,000; and hence it is
                    calculated that the number of pupils would require to be about 7000. Th⅛oral
                    method is very generally em∣ Joyed in the Italian institutions,—the rich
                    vowel-system of the Italian language giving a favourable basis of
                    operations.</p>
                <p>From the <hi rend="italic">Strenna-Album</hi> of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Associazionc della Stampa</hi> (Rome, 1881) we learn that the number of
                    periodicals published in Italy in 1880 was 1454, or about one to every 8000 of
                    the reading population,—a statement that compares favourably with corresponding
                    statistics of other countries. One paper, <hi rend="italic">Gazzetta Nazionale
                    Genovese,</hi> dates its origin as far back as 1797; all the others belong to
                    the present century, 162 having appeared for the first time in 1876, 227 in
                    1877, 240 in 1878, and 246 in 1879. The total number published in 1836 was only
                    185, in 1857 it amounted to 311, in 1864 to 450, in 1871 to 765, and in 1875 to
                    914. According to the statistics of 1875, more than the half of the total number
                    of 494 were published at Milan (104), Florence (82), Turin (68), Rome, Naples,
                    Bologna, Palermo, and Venice. See <hi rend="italic">Archivio di Statistica,</hi>

                <p><hi rend="italic">Beneficence.—</hi> A first attempt to form an idea of the
                    number and nature of the beneficent institutions of Italy was made by the
                    Government in 1862, and the result was published in 1864 in the <hi
                    rend="italic">Calendario</hi><hi rend="italic">generate del Regno.</hi> A fuller
                    inquiry was undertaken in 1863 by the board of statistics under the direction of
                    Pietro Maestri, and the information was communicated to the public in 15 large
                    volumes published between 1868 and 1872. According to this inquiry, usually
                    called of 1861, because the data refer to the state of the institutions in that
                    year, the total number of benevolent institutions (exclusive of the province of
                    Pome) was 20,123 (of which 3866 were purely religious foundations), and their
                    property was valued at1,100,932,000 lire. The amount of money annually expended
                    by these institutions was about 86,000,000; and on an average 6,305,000, or
                    about a fourth of the population, were recipients of their bounty in one form or
                    other. In 1862 a law was passed by which the control of all public institutions
                    of a charitable nature was placed in the hands of the communal authorities, and
                    these have to appoint a charity committee to superintend the department and
                    balance the accounts. In the case of all institutions subsidized by the state,
                    the accounts must be presented to the minister of the interior; and to this
                    functionary is assigned the right of dissolving or reorganizing any institution
                    which the communal authorities report as misdirected or defective. Every
                    institution is obliged to have a regular treasurer, with surety. During the
                    eighteen years that the law has been in force, it has greatly improved the state
                    of matters; but that there is much room for further improvement appears from the
                    fact that nearly the half of their gross income is of no avail for the special
                    purposes for which they exist.</p>

                <p>It appears that the number of asylums is deficient in the Napoletano and in
                    Sicily and Sardinia, while of all the regions Emilia and the Marches are the
                    best supplied. Of the institutions included in the table, some are maintained by
                    the provinces, such as those of Cuneo, Alessandria, Bergamo, &amp;c., others by
                    the municipalities, others again by private individuals. Among the larger
                    establishments are the public asylums of Genoa <hi rend="italic">{Manicomio
                    pubblicd),</hi> Milan, Aversa (819 inmates), Rome (715), Siena (791), Florence
                    (712). Venice has separate establishments for its male and female lunatics.</p>
                <p>The idea of establishing seaside hospitals to which patients could be taken from
                    the inland districts for change of air has been carried into effect more
                    extensively in Italy than in most other countries. Such institutions exist at
                    Viareggio (since 1856), Voltri (1862), Fano (1863), Leghorn (1864), Sestri
                    Levante (1867), Porto d’Anzio (1868), Venice (1868), Porto S. Stefano (187θ),
                    Rimini (1870), Riccione (1871), Loano (1871), Celle (1872), Grado (1873),
                    Palermo (1874), Pisa (Bocca d’Arno, 1876), Cagliari (1879). In many cases a very
                    considerable number of communes have the right of sending their patients to a
                    given hospital; that of Loano for instance receives from thirty-four communes
                    which have committees of transmission. See Dr Gaetano Pini, “Gli ospizi marini e

                <p><hi rend="italic">Administration of Justice.—</hi> Though, in the opinion of the
                    most competent judges, Italy is still in the main free from that curse of
                    civilized countries, a distinctly differentiated criminal class, there is hardly
                    a country of Europe which presents from year to year such appalling tables of
                    criminality. Leaving out of view the question of brigandage—which is of moment
                    only in the southern provinces, where through long inertness the arm of the law
                    had become comparatively powerless—crimes of violence are exceptionally
                    frequent, and (to take the statistics of 1875) the number of persons undergoing
                    punishment in a given year is in the ratio of 175’51 for every 100,000
                    inhabitants. In proportion to population there are four times as many persons
                    condemned to death or penal servitude for life as in France, twice as many to
                    hard labour, five times as many to solitary confinement. And it cannot be said
                    that that part of the administration whose duty it is to deal with this
                    multitude of lawbreakers is in a state of competent efficiency. Trial by jury is
                    in force, but there seems good reason to question the fitness of a large part of
                    th population for the exercise of the functions thus devolved upon them. “Not
                    guilty with extenuating circumstances” is an amusing but suggestive verdict.
                    Though according to the law of 1865 there is only to be one court of cassation
                    in the country, as an actual fact there are five, as follows (Table XXXIX.)

                    appeal having previously been dependent on Florence, and those of
                    Ancona-Macerata, Bologna, and Cagliari on Turin. The number of courts of assize
                    varies from year to year, according to royal decree: in 1874 there were 86, in
                    1876, 92. Of civil and correctional tribunals there are 162, and of “praetors”
                    1813. The praetors are both civil and criminal judges; in the civil department
                    they can decide in all cases involving less than 1500 lire. It is considered
                    part of their duty to endeavour to bring litigants tc∙ terms without proceeding
                    to formal trial; and, that this desirable object may be more frequently secured,
                    a special class of judges or arbitrators, known as conciliatori—of ancient
                    establishment in the Neapolitan provinces—was rendered common to all Italy at
                    the legislative unification of 1865. At the request of parties in dispute, they
                    may deal with cases involving any amount, but their decisions are final only as
                    far as 30 lire, and they have no control—any more than the praetors—of questions
                    affecting the taxes. The value of this class of functionaries is evident from
                    the fact that in 1875, for example, about 25 per cent, of the cases presented<pb

                    concilia-torial functions were settled by compromise, and out of 769,533 cases
                    580,066 received definitive sentence.</p>
                <p>The “establishments of detention” are of three kinds those of preventive
                    detention, or judiciary prisons; those of penal detention, for culprits of full
                    age∙^ and those of correction, or reformatories for prisoners under age. The

                <p>Of the total number of establishments 51 belong to the Lombardo-Venetian
                    provinces, 42 to the ancient continental provinces, 31 to the Tuscan provinces,
                    15 to the Parma and Modena provinces, 55 to the Roman, 80 to the Neapolitan, and

                    hitter defect and 51 for the former.</p>
                <p>In the convict establishments there were 17,576 prisoners in December 1879. The
                    mean for 1870 was 13,663, and every succeeding year has seen an increase. In the
                    ten years frbm 1870 to 1879 the total admissions have been 31,470. During that
                    period 4846 received remission of their sentence, and 5176 died in prison. The
                    following are the convict establishments, arranged in order of importance—Porto

                    Porto d’Anzio, Terracina, and Trapani. The establishment at Varignano was made a

                <p>According to the confession of Italian investigators, the state of the judiciary
                    prisons is often deplorable in the extreme. ‘ ‘ When I see,” writes Beltrami

                    judiciary prisons in the beginning of 1875 (and the differences are not very
                    great in the different years), the number of persons committed to prison
                    amounting in the year to 356,511, and the number of those discharged to 257,854,
                    when I see that, while 127,837 are liberated on the termination of their
                    punishment or through act of clemency, no less than 81,087 owe their liberation
                    to the fact that they have not been found guilty of the crimes laid to their
                    charge, and when I consider the unhappy condition of most of our establishments
                    of preventive detention, my heart aches to think what a hotbed of corruption
                    they constitute, and what a current of moral pestilence must find issue from
                    them.”</p>
                <p>Capital punishment was in 1875, after much debate, adopted as the supreme penalty
                    for the whole kingdom (inclusive of Tuscany, where it had not previously been in
                    force); but in November 1877 the chambers voted by a large majority for the
                    exclusion of the death-penalty from the new code. Between 1867 and 1876
                    inclusive 392 persons were condemned to death, but 351 received commutation of
                    sentence, and only 34 were executed. In the same period 222 cases were subjected
                    to a second trial, with the result that 20 of the accused parties were
                    completely acquitted of the charge on which they had been previously condemned
                    to death, and the whole of the remainder had their sentences commuted to penal
                    servitude for life or some minor penalty. See <hi rend="italic">Notizie sulle

                <p><hi rend="italic">Political Administration.—</hi> The constitution of the kingdom
                    of Italy is based upon that presented to the Sardinians by King Charles Albert,
                    4th March 1848. The crown is hereditary in the male line of the house of Savoy.
                    The king—whose majority is attained at the close of his eighteenth year—cannot
                    exercise his legislative functions except in agreement with the voice of the
                    national parliament, and on his accession to the throne he is bound to take, an
                    oath in the presence of both chambers that he will obey the constitution. By the
                    law of 17th March 1861 his title is “by God’s grace and through the will of the
                    nation king of Italy.” His executive functions are exercised by means of
                    responsible ministers, nine in number—(1) the minister of foreign affairs, (2)
                    of the interior, (3)</p>
                <p>of public instruction, (4) of finance and the treasury, (5) of war, (6) of
                    marine, (7) of grace, justice, and worship, (8) of public works, (9) of
                    agriculture, industry, and commerce. These departments are to all intents the
                    same as those which under slightly different designations existed in the kingdom
                    of Sardinia in 1860, just before the title of king of Italy was assumed by
                    Victor Emmanuel. The ministry of agriculture, however, which was instituted by
                    Cavour in July of that year, was abolished in 1878, but it was restored in 1879.
                    A permanent hydrographic commission was instituted in 1866, a council of
                    meteorology in 1876, and an independent board of statistics <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Direzione della Statistical)</hi> in 1878. There was a meteorological
                    department in connexion with the ministry of agriculture as early as 1865, and a
                    statistical department as early as 1861.</p>
                <p>The Italian parliament consists of two houses or chambers—a senate and a chamber
                    of deputies. The senate consists of the princes of the royal family (who are
                    admitted to the sittings at the age of twenty-one, but cannot vote till they
                    have completed their twenty-fifth year) and an unlimited number of persons,
                    forty years of age or upwards, chosen by the king from the ranks of the
                    archbishops andbishops, ministers of thecrown and highadministrative
                    functionaries, admirals and generals, members of the provincial councils and of
                    the Turin academy, persons who have rendered special services to their country,
                    or who for three years have paid 3000 lire of direct taxation. Since the removal
                    to Rome the parliament is accommodated in the palace at Monte Citorio. Neither
                    senators nor deputies are paid for their services, but they have the right to a
                    free pass over the whole railway system of the country. All measures must be
                    carried by an absolute majority, or one half of the members and one. The
                    parliamentary oath does not contain the name of God; the member simply says, “I
                    swear to be faithful to the king and loyally to observe the statutes and laws of
                    the land.” According to the law there must be a new election every five years;
                    the actual duration of parliaments, however, has hitherto been on an average two
                    and a half.</p>
                <p>The registered electors for 1879 amounted to 627,838, out of a population
                    estimated at 28,437,091, or 2 ’ 21 per cent.; in other words, Italy has 7’77
                    electors in every 100 males above twenty-one years of age. The highest
                    proportions were in Porto Maurizio 5 Ό6 per cent., Genoa 3’63, Leghorn 3‘67, and
                    Alessandria 3 <hi rend="superscript"> -</hi> 32 per cent. The lowest of all was
                    Syracuse 0 <hi rend="superscript"> -</hi> 07 per cent. Thirty-five provinces
                    besides those mentioned had upwards of 2 per cent., and all the rest had upwards
                    of 1 and less than 2. Of the total electorate 489,044 had their place on the
                    roll through the payment of not less than 40 lire of direct Government taxes and
                    provincial “super-imposts”; 5922 in virtue of the value of theiι∙ factories,
                    workshops, or warehouses; 1412 as sea-captains or employers of at least 30
                    operatives; 1502 as holders of Government stock of the annual worth of 600 lire;
                    2934 in virtue of the amount of their house-rent,—making an aggregate of 15,158
                    whose right was due to their wealth. On the other hand there were 550 members of
                    scientific academies, chambers of commerce, and directors of agrarian
                    commissions; 5631 professors, ex-professors, and teachers in the higher
                    institutions; 43,045 functionaries and employés, civil and military; 1452
                    persons decorated with the national orders of knighthood; 33,936 holders of
                    university degrees (laureati); 27,522 solicitors, accountants, geometricians,
                    chemists, &amp;c.; 870 money agents and brokers,—making a total of 112,906 whose
                    right depended on education and social influence.</p>
                <p>According to the law of 1860, in force in 1880, there are 508 electoral colleges,
                    or as they would be called in England parliamentary constituencies, the largest
                    of which are the third college of Palermo with 84,767 inhabitants, and the third
                    of Turin with 76,654, and the smallest S. Sepolcro with 30,463, and Benevento
                    with 25,460.</p>

                    which have taken place in Italy. They are interesting as showing an increase of
                    political activity among the people. As is well known, the watchword of the
                    ultramontane party has been “neither electors nor elected”; their abstention
                    helps partly to explain the small percentage of the electors who have

                    rend="italic">—</hi> It was not till 1865 that the administrative unity of Italy
                    was realized. Up to that year some of the regions of the kingdom, such as
                    Tuscany, continued to have a kind of autonomy; but by the laws of 20th March the
                    whole country was divided into 69 provinces and 8545 communes. The extent to
                    which communal independence had been maintained in Italy through all the
                    centuries of its political disintegration was strongly in its favour. By the new
                    law the communal council was to consist of 80 members if the commune had more
                    than 250,000 inhabitants, of 60 members if more than 60,000, of 40 if more than
                    30,000, of 30 if more than 10,000, of 20 if more than 3000, and in all other
                    cases of 15. It was found by the census of 1861 that the first category was
                    represented by only 1 commune, the second by 12, the third by 34, the fourth by
                    265, the fifth by 1762, and the sixth by 6471. As many of the communes,
                    especially in the north, were found to have a very small population, a
                    considerable number of them havé been wisely incorporated with others. The
                    syndic <hi rend="italic">{sindaco)</hi> or chief magistrate of the commune is
                    appointed by the king for three years, and he is assisted by a “municipal junta”
                    consisting of ten assessors and four substitutes for the communes of the first
                    category, and of 8 + 4, 6 + 2, 4 + 2, and 2 + 2 respectively in those of the
                    others. The communal council meets in ordinary course twice a year. Eligibility
                    for office as a councillor is determined very much by the same considerations as
                    affect the political suffrage, the main criterion being the amount of direct
                    taxes paid. All those in receipt of communal salaries are excluded, and, if a
                    sufficient number can be obtained without them, all who are unable to read.</p>
                <p>The provincial councils consist of 60, 50, 40, or 20 members, according as the
                    population exceeds 600,000, 400,000, or 200,000, or falls below this last
                    number. Each council elects its own president; its sessions, which in regular
                    course occur once a year, are opened and closed by the prefect or his substitute
                    in the king’s name. The term of office for the provincial council is five years.
                    A “provincial deputation” or standing committee, appointed by the council, acts
                    under the presidency of the prefect as the representative of the same throughout
                    the year.</p>
                <p>The various sections of the local government—municipal, communal, and provincial
                    councils—are left remarkably free from interference on the part of the central
                    authorities. There is a prefect in every province, but, to quote Gallenga’s
                    words, he is little more than the head of the provincial police. In point of
                    local influence the syndic, who in the large cities is usually a nobleman or
                    distinguished statesman, is the more important functionary.</p>
                <p>The principal law regulative of communal taxation is that of July 3, 1864. By
                    this the communes were allowed, not only to impose independently of the state an
                    additional tax or super-impost <hi rend="italic">{sovrimposta)</hi> on the
                    articles already subjected to the national octroi, but also to charge a local
                    customs duty on other articles of meat and drink, on forage, fuel, building
                    materials, soaps, fatty matters, and other objects of the same class. Italy thus
                    took rank, says Alessio, as one of the European countries in which the greatest
                    liberty of taxation was granted to the local corporations. Further licence has
                    been since conceded, in 1869, 1870, &amp;c. In 1877 the total income of the
                    communes amounted to 228,733,014 lire or nearly £9,115,000, and of this sum
                    38'71 per cent, was furnished by the communal octroi proper <hi rend="italic"
                    >(dazio</hi><hi rend="italic">consumo),</hi> 31 <hi rend="superscript"> -</hi>
                    24 by the super-impost on the land, 6'10 per cent, by the hearth-money or <hi
                    rend="italic">fuocatico,</hi> 3 <hi rend="superscript"> -</hi> 27 by the tax on
                    cattle and horses, and the remainder by a variety of taxes on public and private
                    conveyances, dogs, domestics, riding and carriage horses, &amp;c. A tax on
                    photographs and <hi rend="italic">insigne,</hi> first rendered legal in 1875,
                    and only adopted by a few of the communes, is the least valuable on the list.
                    Foreigners, except when they really take up permanent residence in a commune,
                    are for the most part exempted from the local taxation. The effect of many of
                    the taxes, especially as applied by the short-sighted local policy, has proved
                    highly prejudicial to the development of industries. The tax, for instance, on
                    wood and coal tells against the glassworks of Venice, the potteries of Florence,
                    the gold and silver work of Milan. At Voltri taxes are paid on nearly all the
                    raw materials of the cotton industry, on the coal, the petroleum, the oil, the
                    very flour needed for the dressing of the stuffs, &amp;c. Paper is taxed in many
                    towns (at Bologna as much as 7 per cent.), at Genoa not only paper but printed
                    matter, at Reggio Emilia types and printing machines. There is often a most
                    extraordinary difference in the amount imposed on the same article: every
                    quintal of wax for stearine candles, for example, pays 5 lire in one city, 10 in
                    another, 40 in a third. In many cases, as at Bergamo, Como, Parma, &amp;c., the
                    result is that the factories show a tendency to locate themselves outside of the
                    communal limits.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>See G.
                    Alessio, “L'iraposta del dazio consumo in Italia,” in <hi rend="italic"
                    >Annali</hi><hi rend="italic">di Stat.,</hi> 1880.</p></note></p>
                <p>And in spite of this superabundant taxation the debts of the communes are
                    unusually numerous, and in some instances give rise to grave concern. Italy has
                    the honour of being the first of European nations to furnish regular returns in
                    regard to the whole department of provincial and communal debts; and the light
                    thrown by these on the state of the local finances is very instructive. At the
                    inquiry in 1873 it was found that the total of the debts of the communes
                    amounted to 545,129,128 lire, and that of the provinces to 54,401,390. By 1877
                    these figures had increased to 707,551,255 for the communes, and 90,073,603 for
                    the provinces. Nearly the half of the communal increase of 162 millions was due
                    to the two cities of Florence and Naples, the former being responsible for
                    36,933,905 lire of the increase, and the latter for 36,726,188 lire. The state
                    of the Florentine finances is particularly noteworthy. It is estimated that the
                    <hi rend="italic">dazio</hi><hi rend="italic">consumo</hi> cost every inhabitant
                    30 <hi rend="superscript"> -</hi> ll lire in 1877, and 31'58 in 1878 (the only
                    other chief cities with similar amounts being Genoa, with respectively 33 ami
                    27⅜ lire, and Rome with 28⅜ and 29.⅛), and the total communal taxation is stated
                    at 54 lire per head. On March 18, 1878, Florence suspended payment of the
                    capital and three months later of the interest on its debts, which amounted to
                    about 160,000,000 lire. A royal commission was appointed in J une 1879 for the
                    liquidation of the debt, and it put into operation a scheme by which the debt
                    will be cleared off by 1939. Full details will be found in the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Report of the British Consul for Florence,</hi> 1880, or in Mr Anthony
                    Trollope’s interesting survey in the <hi rend="italic">British and Foreign
                    Quarterly heview,</hi> 1879. The other cities where the local customs press
                    heaviest on the citizens are Palermo and Catania (20 lire), Leghorn (nearly 20),
                    Siena (19), Pavia (18), Milan (17), Turin (16). Among those that suffer least
                    are Belluno, Arezzo, and Sondrio. At the close of 1878 it was calculated that
                    the quota of the communal debt for every individual would amount to 913’62 lire
                    at Florence, to 309'60 at Pisa, to 274 at Genoa, to 248 ’ 52 at Naples, and that
                    on an average of all the <hi rend="italic">caρoluogi</hi> or provincial chief
                    towns the quota would be 140’96 lire. See <hi rend="italic">Statistica dci

                    keep the balance on the right side of the national account; in Italy it long
                    seemed as if no Government could do so. To attain the <hi rend="italic"
                    >pareggio,</hi> or in familiar phrase to make both ends meet, was the dream and
                    the despair of minister after minister. Money was wanted for so many things;
                    taxes of any considerable value could be imposed on so few. The various parts of
                    the national organization had to be put with all possible speed into a condition
                    not altogether unworthy of the prestige and the promise of the kingdom. What in
                    other countries had been the growth of generations, Italy was called upon to
                    produce at once by “forcing.” To attain her nominal or political unity she had
                    to submit to many sacrifices; to make the unity something better than a musical
                    word, she had to submit to many more. That she should have spent so much on her
                    army, her fortifications, and her fleet, is matter of regret in spite of the
                    secondary purposes which such things subserve; that at the same time she has
                    aimed high, and acted liberally in respect of more needful if less ostentatious

                    it must never be forgotten what an inheritance of debt and disorganization

                <p>The following table (XL·II.) of debt, revenue, and expenditure (given in millions
                    of lire =£40,000), shows that on the whole the financial condition of the
                    country, considered in itself and apart from the causes to which it is due, is
                    an improving if not a satisfactory one. It must be noted that in the columns of
                    revenue and expenditure no account is taken of the movement of the capitals, of
                    the expenses connected with the railway system, or of the debts and payments of
                    one part of the administration to another.</p>

                <p>The figures, it must be noted, represent the interest, not the capital. A large
                    proportion of the Italian consols are held in small amounts, for the most part
                    by French investors, and the greatest holder after France appears to be England.
                    In the Bourse of Paris in 1879, for instance, 11,912,000 lire of the stock were
                    presented for certification, in the Exchange of London 8,319,000 lire; and after
                    these places comes Berlin with only 1,453,000 lire. The value of the 5 per cent,
                    stock at Paris, which was as low as 39 <hi rend="superscript"> -</hi> 40 in the
                    course of 1866, has risen rapidly nearly every year, especially since 1875, and
                    in the course of 1880 was as high as 87’60. A similar advance was observable in
                    the Italian exchanges; from 43 <hi rend="superscript"> -</hi> 52 in 1866 the
                    value rose to 94 <hi rend="superscript"> -</hi> 20 in 1880.</p>
                <p>In the matter of taxation the Italian statesmen have mainly followed in the
                    footsteps of the French; and the revenue is eked out by several imposts of the
                    most questionable character. Mr Gallenga even goes so far as to say that * ‘
                    there is hardly an unwise, inhuman, unpopular, or even immoral tax to which the
                    Government has not been compelled to resort.” It is a small matter that the <hi
                    rend="italic">aurum</hi><hi rend="italic">lustrale</hi> of ancient Pome should
                    again figure in the Italian budget; but it is a serious thing when the salt
                    monopoly, the lottery, a gristtax, and an octroi are among the most important of
                    its items. The grist-tax, which pressed heavily on the very means of life, and
                    aggravated the already aggravated misery of the poorer classes, has happily been
                    reduced in 1880 from 2 lire to Γ50 per hectolitre, and is destined to disappear
                    altogether in 1884. Against the octroi, which, as shown in the paragraph dealing
                    with the communal administration, tells severely on the prosperity of several
                    important industries, an intelligent opposition is beginning to gather head; and
                    the law in this respect will probably be amended or abrogated before long. The

                    provisional Tuscan Government in 1860, the Bank of Naples dating from 1816, and
                    the Bank of Sicily due to a decree of 1843. The two Tuscan banks and the Roman
                    and the National Bank are joint-stock companies, with their capital subscribed
                    in shares. The capital of the four joint-stock banks amounted in the aggregate
                    to 255,000,000 lire, of which 200,000,000 belonged to the National Bank,
                    30,000,000 to the National Tuscan, 15,000,000 to the Roman, and 10,000,000 to
                    the Tuscan Credit. By the law of 1874 the Bank of Naples was authorized to carry
                    its capital by 1885 to 48,750,000 lire, and the Bank of Sicily to 12,000,000;
                    the actual amounts in 1877 were 39,000,000 in the one case, and 9,200,000 in the
                    other. The law just mentioned united the six banks into a <hi rend="italic"
                    >consorzio</hi> or union, bound if required to furnish to the national exchequer
                    bank-notes to the value of 1,000,000,000 lire manufactured and renewed at their
                    common expense; but by the law of 7th April 1881 (mentioned in detail further
                    on) the consorzio ceased on the 30th June 1881. The following table (XLVII.)
                    indicates the position of the issue of bank notes both by the consortium and by
                    the individual banks on their own account on the 30th September 1880.</p>

                <p>It appears that 50 of these societies existed before 1850, and that 186 were
                    commenced between that year and 1861. How rapid the increase has been is shown
                    by the fact that in 1876, 1877, and 1878 there were nearly as many new societies
                    started annually as in that decade. Piedmont, Lombardy, Tuscany, and Sicily are
                    the districts where the number is greatest. For the most part the societies are
                    open to operatives in any trade or industry, but at least 391 are exclusively
                    intended for some particular class— <hi rend="italic">e.g.,</hi> doctors,
                    employes, teachers, &amp;e. Of the 2091 indicated, 1537 are for men only, 70 for
                    women only, and 484 for either.</p>

                    <hi rend="italic">Credit-genosscnchaften</hi> of Germany, have increased in
                    number from 40 in 1869 to 123 in 1878. From a paper by Luzzati, the enthusiastic
                    and laborious president of the association of the people’s banks, we find that
                    84 of these institutions which furnished him with details of their working had
                    at the close of 1877 a capital of 34,941,593 lire, divided into 710,869 shares,
                    and a reserve fund of 10,436,143 lire. The greater number of these banks are in
                    Lombardy, Venice, Piedmont, and Liguria. Societies of ordinary credit increased
                    from 19 in 1869 to 143 in 1873, but by 1878 the number had again sunk to 102,
                    owing to the monetary crises through which the country had passed.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Currency.—</hi> Italy is a member of the Latin monetary league
                    founded in 1865. By this the coining of pieces worth 2 lire or less was limited
                    to 6 lire per inhabitant, so that the amount of such coins permissible before
                    the incorporation of Venice was 141,000,000, and after that date 156,000,000. By
                    the convention of 1875 the coining of silver coins of 5 lire was limited to
                    50,000,000, and this amount was reduced to 30,000,000 by the convention of 1876.
                    The actual value coined from 1862 to 1875 has been :—gold, 236,167,200 lire;
                    silver— 5 lire pieces, 281,637,025, and pieces of minor value (1 lire, 2 lire,
                    20 centesimi, and 50 centesimi), all coined between 1862 and 1868 inclusive,
                    156,000,000; bronze, 76,190,442 lire. By the conventions of 1878 and 1879 it was
                    agreed that the minor silver coinage of Italy should not be received in the
                    public exchequer of the other states of the league until an end was put to the
                    forced paper currency; and France, Belgium, Greece, and Switzerland have

                <p>The Italian Government has been put to much expense in the matter of the
                    unification of the coinage, and the process of withdrawing the coins of the
                    separate ex-Governments is still going on. Table LI. indicates the value in lire
                    of the coins withdrawn from circulation between 1862 and 1871.</p>
                <p>From 1872 to 1879 the value of the gold withdrawn was 6,080,295 lire, and that of
                    the silver 143,130,871; of the total (149,211,166 lire) the greater proportion
                    (129,898,338) belonged to the Two Sicilies and 16,815,207 to Rome. In 1866 the
                    Government felt itself constrained to establish a forced paper currency; the
                    proposals made from time to time for its abrogation remained mere proposals till
                    1881. The parliament of that year, however, passed an Act (7th April), on the
                    basis of a bill presented by the ministers Magliani and Miceli, of which the
                    chief features are as follows:<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    currency is to be brought to an end by the close of 1883,—644,000,000 lire of
                    metallic money (400,000,000 of the amount in gold being obtained by a foreign
                    loan); of these, 44,000,000 lire to be given to the National Bank as repayment
                    of the loan in gold made to the state in 1875, which, according to the contract,
                    was to be repaid three months before the cessation of the forced currency; the
                    remaining 600,000,000 to be employed in withdrawing from circulation that amount
                    of the “consortial” or union notes, of which 940,000,000 lire are in
                    circulation,—the 340,000,000 to become regular Government notes payable at sight
                    in the principal Government treasuries; all the small notes of 50 centesimi, 1,
                    2, and 5 lire, the circulation of which in September 1879 amounted to
                    315,500,000 lire, to be got rid of, as well as 284,000,000 in notes of 1000,
                    250, and 100 lire,—so that the 340,000,000 lire in regular notes left in
                    existence should all be of the value of 10 and 20 lire, with the exception of
                    46,500,000 in larger amounts. The consortium of the banks came to a close on the
                    30th June 1881, and the “consortial” notes actually current are formed into a
                    direct national debt.</p>

                    xml:id="kp-eb0913-0486-0467"/> PART II.—HISTORY.</p>
                <p>The difficulty of Italian history lies in this that until our own time the
                    Italians have had no political unity, no independence, no organized existence as
                    a nation. Split up into numerous and mutually hostile communities, they never,
                    through the fourteen centuries which have elapsed since the end of the old
                    Western empire, shook off the yoke of foreigners completely; they never until
                    lately learned to merge their local and conflicting interests in the common good
                    of undivided Italy. Their history is therefore not the history of a single
                    people, centralizing and absorbing its constituent elements by a process of
                    continued evolution, but of a group of cognate populations, exemplifying divers
                    types of constitutional development.</p>
                <p>Without attaching undue importance to the date 476 as marking the boundary
                    between ancient and modern history, there is no doubt that this year opened a
                    new age for thé Italian people. Odovakar, a chief of the Herulians, deposed
                    Romulus, the last Augustus of the West, and placed the peninsula beneath the
                    titular sway of the Byzantine emperors. At Pavia the barbarian conquerors of
                    Italy proclaimed him king, and he received from Zeno the dignity of Roman
                    patrician. Thus began that system of mixed government, Teutonic and Roman,
                    which, in the absence of a national monarch, impressed the institutions of new
                    Italy from the earliest date with dualism. The same revolution vested supreme
                    authority in a non-resident and inefficient autocrat, whose title gave him the
                    right to interfere in Italian affairs, but who lacked the power and will to rule
                    the people for his own or their advantage. Odovakar inaugurated that long series
                    of foreign rulers— Greeks, Franks, Germans, Spaniards, and Austrians—who have
                    successively contributed to the misgovernment of Italy from distant seats of
                    empire.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Gothic and Lombard Kingdoms.</hi></p>
                <p>In 488 Theodoric, king of the East Goths, received commission from the Greek
                    emperor, Zeno, to undertake the affairs of Italy. He defeated Odovakar, drove
                    him to Ravenna, besieged him there, and in 493 completed the conquest of the
                    country by murdering the Herulian chief with his own hand. Theodoric respected
                    the Roman institutions which he found in Italy, held the Eternal City sacred,
                    and governed by ministers chosen from the Roman population. He settled at
                    Ravenna, which had been the capita] of Italy since the days of Honorius, and
                    which still testifies by its monuments to the Gothic chieftain’s Romanizing
                    policy. Those who believe that the Italians would have gained strength by
                    unification in a single monarchy must regret that this Gothic kingdom lacked the
                    elements of stability. The Goths, except in the valley of the Po, resembled an
                    army of occupation rather than a people numerous enough to blend with the Italic
                    stock. Though their rule was favourable to the Romans, they were Arians; and
                    religious differences, combined with the pride and jealousies of a nation
                    accustomed to imperial honours, rendered the inhabitants of Italy eager to throw
                    off their yoke. When, therefore, Justinian undertook the reconquest of Italy,
                    his generals, Belisarius and Narses, were supported by the south. The struggle
                    of the Greeks and the Goths was carried on for fourteen years, between 539 and
                    553, when Teia, the last Gothic king, was finally defeated in a bloody battle
                    near Vesuvius. At its close the provinces of Italy were placed beneath Greek
                    dukes, controlled by a governor-general, entitled exarch, who ruled in the
                    Byzantine emperor’s name at Ravenna.</p>
                <p>This new settlement lasted but a few years. Narses had employed Lombard
                    auxiliaries in his campaigns against the Goths; and when he was recalled by an
                    insulting message from the empress in 565, he is said to have invited this
                    fiercest and rudest of the Teutonic clans to seize the spoils of Italy. Be this
                    as it may, the Lombards, their ranks swelled by the Gepidae, whom they had
                    lately conquered, and by the wrecks of other barbarian tribes, passed southward
                    under their king Alboin in 568. The Herulian invaders had been but a band of
                    adventurers; the Goths were an army; the Lombards, far more formidable, were a
                    nation in movement. Pavia offered stubborn resistance; but after a three years’
                    siege it was taken, and Alboin made it the capital of his new kingdom.</p>
                <p>In order to understand the future history of Italy, it is necessary to form a
                    clear conception of the method pursued by the Lombards in their conquest.
                    Penetrating the peninsula, and advancing like a glacier or half-liquid stream of
                    mud, they occupied the valley of the Po, and moved slowly downward through the
                    centre of the country. Numerous as they were compared with their Gothic
                    predecessors, they had not strength or multitude enough to occupy the whole
                    peninsula. Venice, which since the days of Attila had offered an asylum to Roman
                    refugees from the northern cities, was left untouched. So was Genoa with its
                    Riviera. Ravenna, entrenched within her lagoons, remained a Greek city. Rome,
                    protected by invincible prestige, escaped. The sea-coast cities of the south,
                    and the islands, Sicily, Sardinia, and Corsica, preserved their independence.
                    Thus the Lombards neither occupied the extremities nor subjugated the
                    brain-centre of the country. The strength of Alboin’s kingdom was in the north;
                    his capital, Pavia. As his people pressed southward, they omitted to possess
                    themselves of the coasts; and what was worse for the future of these conquerors,
                    the original impetus of the invasion was checked by the untimely murder of
                    Alboin in 573. After this event, the semi-independent chiefs of the Lombard
                    tribe, who borrowed the title of dukes from their Roman predecessors, seem to
                    have been contented with consolidating their power in the districts each had
                    occupied. The duchies of Spoleto in the centre, and of Benevento in the south,
                    inserted wedge-like into the middle of the peninsula, and enclosing independent
                    Rome, were but loosely united to the kingdom at Pavia. Italy was broken up into
                    districts, each offering points for attack from without, and fostering the seeds
                    of internal revolution. Three separate capitals must be discriminated—Pavia, the
                    seat of the new Lombard kingdom; Ravenna, the garrison city of the Byzantine
                    emperor; and Rome, the rallying point of the old nation, where the successor of
                    St Peter was already beginning to assume that national protectorate which proved
                    so influential in the future.</p>
                <p>It is not necessary to write the history of the Lombard kingdom in detail.
                    Suffice it to say that the rule of the Lombards proved at first far more
                    oppressive to the native population, and was less intelligent of their old
                    customs, than that of the Goths had been. Wherever the Lombards had the upper
                    hand, they placed the country under military rule, resembling in its general
                    character what we now know as the feudal system. Though there is reason to
                    suppose that the Roman laws were still administered within the cities, yet the
                    Lombard code was that of the kingdom; and the Lombards being Arians, they added
                    the oppression of religious intolerance to that of martial despotism and
                    barbarous cupidity. The Italians were reduced to the last extremity when Gregory
                    the Great <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit13newyrich/page/n487/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0913-0487-0468"/> (590-604), having strengthened his position by
                    diplomatic relations with the duchy of Spoleto, and brought about the conversion
                    of the Lombards to orthodoxy, raised the cause of the remaining Roman population
                    throughout Italy. The fruit of his policy, which made of Rome a counterpoise
                    against the effete empire of the Greeks upon the one hand and against the
                    pressure of the feudal kingdom on the other, was seen in the succeeding century.
                    When Leo the Isaurian published his decrees against the worship of images in
                    726, Gregory II. allied himself with Liudprand, the Lombard king, threw off
                    allegiance to Byzantium, and established the autonomy of Rome. This pope
                    initiated the dangerous policy of playing one hostile force off against another
                    with a view to securing independence. He used the Lombards in his struggle with
                    the Greeks, leaving to his successors the duty of checking these unnatural
                    allies. This was accomplished by calling the Franks in against the Lombards.
                    Liudprand pressed hard, not only upon the Greek dominions of the exarchate, but
                    also upon Rome. His successors, Rachis and Astolf, attempted to follow the same
                    game of conquest. But the popes, Gregory III., Zachary, and Stephen II.,
                    determining at any cost to espouse the national cause and to aggrandize their
                    own office, continued to rely upon the Franks. Pippin twice crossed the Alps,
                    and forced Astolf to relinquish his acquisitions, including Ravenna, Pentapolis,
                    the coast towns of Romagna, and some cities in the duchy of Spoleto. These he
                    handed over to the pope of Rome. This donation of Pippin in 756 confirmed the
                    papal see in the protectorate of the Italic party, and conferred upon it
                    sovereign rights. The virtual outcome of the contest carried on by Rome since
                    the year 726 with Byzantium and Pavia was to place the popes in the position
                    held by the Greek exarch, and to confirm the limitation of the Lombard kingdom.
                    We must, however, be cautious to remember that the south of Italy was
                    comparatively unaffected. The dukes of the Greek empire and the Lombard dukes of
                    Benevento, together with a few autonomous commercial cities, still divided Italy
                    below the Campagna of Rome.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Prankish Emperors.</hi></p>
                <p>The Franko-Papal alliance, which conferred a crown on Pippin and sovereign rights
                    upon the see of Rome, held within itself that ideal of mutually supporting
                    papacy and empire which exercised so powerful an influence in mediaeval history.
                    When Charles the Great (Charlemagne) deposed his father-in-law Desiderius, the
                    last Lombard king, in 774, and when he received the circlet of the empire from
                    Leo III. at Rome in 800, he did but complete and ratify the compact offered to
                    his grandfather, Charles Martel, by Gregory III. The relations between the new
                    emperor and the pope were ill defined; and this proved the source of infinite
                    disasters to Italy and Europe in the sequel. But for the moment each seemed
                    necessary to the other; and that sufficed. Charles took possession of the
                    kingdom of Italy, as limited by Pippin’s settlement. The pope was confirmed in
                    his rectorship of the cities ceded by Astolf, with the further understanding,
                    tacit rather than expressed, that, even as he had wrung these provinces for the
                    Italic people from both Greeks and Lombards, so in the future he might claim the
                    protectorate of such portions of Italy, external to the kingdom, as he should be
                    able to acquire. This, at any rate, seems to be the meaning of that obscure
                    re-settlement of the peninsula which Charles effected. The kingdom of Italy,
                    transmitted on his death by Charles the Great, and afterwards confirmed to his
                    grandson Lothar by the peace of Verdun in 843, stretched from the Alps to
                    Terracina. The duchy of Benevento remained tributary, but independent. The
                    cities of Gaeta and Naples, Sicily, and the so-called Theme of Lombardy in South
                    Apulia and Calabria, still recognized the Byzantine emperor. Venice stood aloof,
                    professing a nominal allegiance to the East. The parcels into which the Lombards
                    had divided the peninsula remained thus virtually unaltered, except for the new
                    authority acquired by the see of Rome.</p>
                <p>Internally Charles left the affairs of the Italian kingdom much as he found them,
                    except that he appears to have pursued the policy of breaking up the larger
                    fiefs of the Lombards, substituting counts for their dukes, and adding to the
                    privileges of the bishops. We may reckon these measures among the earliest
                    advantages extended to the cities, which still contained the bulk of the old
                    Roman population, and which were destined to intervene with decisive effect two
                    centuries later in Italian history. It should also here be noticed that the
                    changes introduced into the holding of the fiefs, whether by altering their
                    boundaries or substituting Frankish for Lombard vassals, were chief among the
                    causes why the feudal system took no permanent hold in Italy. Feudalism was not
                    at any time a national institution. The hierarchy of dukes and marquises and
                    counts consisted of foreign soldiers imposed on the indigenous inhabitants; and
                    the rapid succession of conquerors, Lombards, Franks, and Germans following each
                    other at no long interval, and each endeavouring to weaken the remaining
                    strength of his predecessor, prevented this alien hierarchy from acquiring
                    fixity by permanence of tenure. Among the many miseries inflicted upon Italy by
                    the frequent changes of her northern rulers, this at least may be reckoned a
                    blessing.</p>
                <p>The Italians acknowledged eight kings of the house of Charles the Great, ending
                    in Charles the Fat, who was deposed in 888. After them followed ten sovereigns,
                    some of whom have been misnamed Italians by writers too eager to catch at any
                    resemblance of national glory for a people passive in the hands of foreign
                    masters, The truth is that no period in Italian history was less really glorious
                    than that which came to a close in 961 by Berengar H.’s cession of his rights to
                    Otto the Great. It was a period marked in the first place by the conquests of
                    the Saracens, who began to occupy Sicily early in the 9th century, overran
                    Calabria and Apulia, took Bari, and threatened Rome. In the second place it was
                    marked by a restoration of the Greeks to power. In 890 they established
                    themselves again at Bari, and ruled the Theme of Lombardy by means of an officer
                    entitled Catapan. In the third place it was marked by a decline of good
                    government in Rome. Early in the 10th century the papacy fell into the hands of
                    a noble family, known eventually as the counts of Tusculum, who almost succeeded
                    in rendering the office hereditary, and in uniting the civil and ecclesiastical
                    functions of the city under a single member of their house. It is not necessary
                    to relate the scandals of Marozia’s and Theodora’s female reign, the infamies of
                    John XII., or the intrigues which tended to convert Rome into a duchy. The most
                    important fact for the historian of Italy to notice is that during this time the
                    popes abandoned, not only their high duties as chiefs of Christendom, but also
                    their protectorate of Italian liberties. A fourth humiliating episode in this
                    period was the invasion of the Magyar barbarians, who overran the north of
                    Italy, and reduced its fairest provinces to the condition of a wilderness.
                    Anarchy and misery are indeed the main features of that long space of time which
                    elapsed between the death of Charles the Great and the descent of Otto. Through
                    the almost impenetrable darkness and confusion we only discern this much, that
                    Italy was powerless to constitute herself a nation.</p>
                <p>The discords which followed on the break-up of the Carolingian power, and the
                    weakness of the so-called Italian emperors, who were unable to control the

                    and Spoleto), from whose ranks they sprang, exposed Italy to ever-increasing
                    misrule. The country by this time had become thickly covered over with castles,
                    the seats of greater or lesser nobles, all of whom were eager to detach
                    themselves from strict allegiance to the “Regno.” The cities, exposed to pillage
                    by Huns in the north and Saracens in the south, and ravaged on the coast by
                    Norse pirates, asserted their right to enclose themselves with walls, and taught
                    their burghers the use of arms. Within the circuit of their ramparts, the
                    bishops already began to exercise authority in rivalry with the counts, to whom,
                    since the days of Theodoric, had been entrusted the government of the Italian
                    burghs. Agreeably to feudal customs, these nobles, as they grew in power,
                    retired from the town, and built themselves fortresses on points of vantage in
                    the neighbourhood. Thus the titular king of Italy found himself simultaneously
                    at war with those great vassals who had chosen him from their own class, with
                    the turbulent factions of the Roman aristocracy, with unruly bishops in the
                    growing cities, and with the multitude of minor counts and barons who occupied
                    the open lands, and who changed sides according to the interests of the moment.
                    The last king of the quasi-Italian succession, Berengar II., marquis of Ivrea
                    (951-961), made a vigorous effort to restore the authority of the regno; and had
                    he succeeded, it is not impossible that now at the last moment Italy might have
                    become an independent nation. But this attempt at unification was reckoned to
                    Berengar for a crime. He only won the hatred of all classes, and was represented
                    by the obscure annalists of that period as an oppressor of the church and a
                    remorseless tyrant. In Italy, divided between feudal nobles and almost
                    hereditary ecclesiastics, of foreign blood and alien sympathies, there was no
                    national feeling. Berengar stood alone against a multitude, unanimous in their
                    intolerance of discipline. His predecessor in the kingdom, Lothar, had left a
                    young and beautiful widow, Adelheid. Berengar imprisoned her upon the Lake of
                    Como, and threatened her with a forced marriage to his son Adalbert. She escaped
                    to the castle of Canossa, where the great count of Tuscany espoused her cause,
                    and appealed in her behalf to Otto the Saxon. The king of Germany descended into
                    Italy, and took Adelheid in marriage. After this episode Berengar was more
                    discredited and impotent than ever. In the extremity of his fortunes he had
                    recourse himself to Otto, making a formal cession of the Italian kingdom, in his
                    own name and that of his son Adalbert, to the Saxon as his overlord. By this
                    slender tie the crown of Italy was joined to that of Germany; and the formal
                    right of the elected king of Germany to be considered king of Italy and emperor
                    may be held to have accrued from this epoch.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">The German Emperors.</hi></p>
                <p>Berengar gained nothing by his act of obedience to Otto. The great Italian
                    nobles, in their turn, appealed to Germany. Otto entered Lombardy in 961,
                    deposed Berengar, assumed the crown in St Ambrogio at Milan, and in 962 was
                    proclaimed emperor by John XII. at Rome. Henceforward Italy changed masters
                    according as one or other of the German families assumed supremacy beyond the
                    Alps. It is one of the strongest instances furnished by history of the
                    fascination exercised by an idea that the Italians themselves should have grown
                    to glory in this dependence of their nation upon Caesars who had nothing but a
                    name in common with the Roman Imperator of the past.</p>
                <p>The first thing we have to notice in this revolution which placed Otto the Great
                    upon the imperial throne is that the Italian kingdom, founded by the Lombards,
                    recognized by the Franks, and recently claimed by eminent Italian feudatories,
                    virtually ceased to exist. It was merged in the German kingdom; and, since for
                    the German princes Germany was of necessity their first care, Italy from this
                    time forward began to be left more and more to herself. The central authority of
                    Pavia had always been weak; the regno had proved insufficient to combine the
                    nation. But now even that shadow of union disappeared, and the Italians were
                    abandoned to the slowly working influences which tended to divide them into
                    separate states. The most brilliant period of their chequered history, the
                    period which includes the rise of communes, the exchange of municipal liberty
                    for despotism, and the gradual discrimination of the five great powers (Milan,
                    Venice, Florence, the Papacy, and the kingdom of Naples), now begins. Among the
                    centrifugal forces which determined the future of the Italian race must be
                    reckoned, first and foremost, the new spirit of municipal independence. We have
                    seen how the cities enclosed themselves with walls, and how the bishops defined
                    their authority against that of the counts. Otto encouraged this revolution by
                    placing the enclosures of the chief burghs beyond the jurisdiction of the
                    counts. Within those precincts the bishops and the citizens were independent of
                    all feudal masters but the emperor. He further broke the power of the great
                    vassals by redivisions of their feuds, and by the creation of new marches which
                    he assigned to his German followers. In this way, owing to the dislocation of
                    the ancient aristocracy, to the enlarged jurisdiction of a power so democratic
                    as the episcopate, and to the increased privileges of the burghs, feudalism
                    received a powerful check in Italy. The Italian people, that people which gave
                    to the world the commerce and the arts of Florence, was not indeed as yet
                    apparent. But the conditions under which it could arise, casting from itself all
                    foreign and feudal trammels, recognizing its true past in ancient Rome, and
                    reconstructing a civility out of the ruins of those glorious memories, were now
                    at last granted. The nobles from this time forward retired into the country and
                    the mountains, fortified themselves in strong places outside the cities, and
                    gave their best attention to fostering the rural population. Within the cities
                    and upon the open lands the Italians, in this and the next century, doubled,
                    trebled, and quadrupled their numbers. A race was formed strong enough to keep
                    the empire itself in check, strong enough, except for its own internecine
                    contests, to have formed a nation equal to its happier neighbours.</p>
                <p>The recent scandals of the papacy induced Otto to deprive the Romans of their
                    right to elect popes. But when he died in 973, his son Otto II. (married to
                    Theophano of the imperial Byzantine house) and his grandson, Otto HL, who
                    descended into Italy in 996, found that the affairs of Rome and of the southern
                    provinces were more than even their imperial powers could cope with. The faction
                    of the counts of Tusculum raised its head from time to time in the Eternal City,
                    and Rome still claimed to be a commonwealth. Otto III.’s untimely death in 1002
                    introduced new discords. Rome fell once more into the hands of her nobles. The
                    Lombards chose Ardoin, marquis of Ivrea, for king, and Pavia supported his
                    claims against those of Henry of Bavaria, who had been elected in Germany. Milan
                    sided with Henry; and this is perhaps the first eminent instance of cities being
                    reckoned powerful allies in the Italian disputes of sovereigns. It is also the
                    first instance of that bitter feud between the two great capitals of Lombardy, a
                    feud rooted in ancient antipathies between the Roman population of Mediolanum
                    and the Lombard garrison of Alboin’s successors, which proved so disastrous to
                    the national cause. Ardoin retired to a monastery, where he died in 1015. Henry
                    nearly destroyed Pavia, was crowned in Rome, and died in 1024. After this event
                    <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit13newyrich/page/n489/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0913-0489-0470"/> Heribert, the archbishop of Milan, invited
                    Conrad, the Franconian king of Germany, into Italy, and crowned him with the
                    iron crown of the kingdom.</p>
                <p>The intervention of this man, Heribert, compels us to turn a closer glance upon
                    the cities of North Italy. It is here, at the present epoch and for the next two
                    centuries, that the pith and nerve of the Italian nation must be sought; and
                    among the burghs of Lombardy, Milan, the eldest daughter of ancient Rome,
                    assumes the lead. In Milan we hear for the first time the word <hi rend="italic"
                    >Comune.</hi> In Milan the citizens first form themselves into a <hi
                    rend="italic">Parlamento.</hi> In Milan the archbishop organizes the hitherto
                    voiceless, defenceless population into a community capable of expressing its
                    needs, and an army ready to maintain its rights. To Heribert is attributed the
                    invention of the <hi rend="italic">Carroccio,</hi> which played so singular and
                    important a part in the warfare of Italian cities. A huge car drawn by oxen,
                    bearing the standard of the burgh, and carrying an altar with the host, this
                    carroccio, like the ark of the Israelites, formed a rallying point in battle,
                    and reminded the armed artisans that they had a city and a church to fight for.
                    That Heribert’s device proved effectual in raising the spirit of his burghers,
                    and consolidating them into a formidable band of warriors, is shown by the fact
                    that it was speedily adopted in all the free cities. It must not, however, be
                    supposed that at this epoch the liberties of the burghs were fully developed.
                    The mass of the people remained unrepresented in the government; and even if the
                    consuls existed in the days of Heribert, they were but humble legal officers,
                    transacting business for their constituents in the courts of the bishop and his
                    viscount. It still needed nearly a century of struggle to render the burghers
                    independent of lordship, with a fully organized commune, selfgoverned in its
                    several assemblies. While making these reservations, it is at the same time
                    right to observe that certain Italian communities were more advanced upon the
                    path of independence than others. This is specially the case with the maritime
                    ports. Not to mention Venice, which has not yet entered the Italian community,
                    and remains a Greek free city, Genoa and Pisa were rapidly rising into
                    ill-defined autonomy. Their command of fleets gave them incontestable
                    advantages, as when, for instance, Otto II. employed the Pisans in 980 against
                    the Greeks in Lower Italy, and the Pisans and Genoese together attacked the
                    Saracens of Sardinia in 1017. Still, speaking generally, the age of independence
                    for the burghs had only begun when Heribert from Milan undertook the earliest
                    organization of a force that was to become paramount in peace and war.</p>
                <p>Next to Milan, and from the point of view of general politics even more than
                    Milan, Rome now claims attention. The destinies of Italy depended upon the
                    character which the see of St Peter should assume. Even the liberties of her
                    republics in the north hung on the issue of a contest which in the 11th and 12th
                    centuries shook Europe to its furthest boundaries. So fatally were the internal
                    affairs of that magnificent but unhappy country bound up with concerns which
                    brought the forces of the civilized world into play. Her ancient prestige, her
                    geographical position, and the intellectual primacy of her most noble children
                    rendered Italy the battleground of principles that set all Christendom in
                    motion, and by the clash of which she found herself for ever afterwards divided.
                    During the reign of Conrad II., the party of the counts of Tusculum revived in
                    Rome; and Crescentius, claiming the title of consul in the imperial city, sought
                    once more to control the election of the popes. When Henry III., the son of
                    Conrad, entered Italy in 1046, he found three popes in Rome. These he abolished,
                    and, taking the appointment into his own hands, gave German bishops to the see.
                    The policy thus initiated Upon the precedent laid down by Otto the Great was a
                    remedy for pressing evils. It saved Rome from becoming a duchy in the hands of
                    the Tusculan house. But it neither raised the prestige of the papacy, nor could
                    it satisfy the Italians, who rightly regarded the Roman see as theirs. These
                    German popes were short-lived and inefficient. Their appointment, according to
                    notions which defined themselves within the church at this epoch, was
                    simoniacal; and during the long minority of Henry 1V., who succeeded his father
                    in 1056, the terrible Tuscan monk, Hildebrand of Soana, forged weapons which he
                    used with deadly effect against the presumption of the empire. The condition of
                    the church seemed desperate, unless it could be purged of crying scandals—of the
                    subjection of the papacy to the great Roman nobles, of its subordination to the
                    German emperor, and of its internal demoralization. It was Hildebrand’s policy
                    throughout three papacies, during which he controlled the counsels of the
                    Vatican, and before he himself assumed the tiara, to prepare the mind of Italy
                    and Europe for a mighty change. His programme included these three points :—(1)
                    the celibacy of the clergy; (2) the abolition of ecclesiastical appointments
                    made by the secular authority; (3) the vesting of the papal election in the
                    hands of the Roman clergy and people, presided over by the curia of cardinals.
                    How Hildebrand paved the way for these reforms during the pontificates of
                    Nicholas II. and Alexander II., how he succeeded in raising the papal office
                    from the depths of 'degradation and subjection to illimitable sway over the
                    minds of men in Europe, and how his warfare with the empire established on a
                    solid basis the still doubtful independence of the Italian burghs, renewing the
                    long neglected protectorate of the Italian race, and bequeathing to his
                    successors a national policy which had been forgotten by the popes since his
                    great predecessor Gregory II., forms a chapter in European history which must
                    now be interrupted. We have to follow the fortunes of unexpected allies, upon
                    whom in no small measure his success depended.</p>
                <p>In order to maintain some thread of continuity through the perplexed and tangled
                    vicissitudes of the Italian race, it has been necessary to disregard those
                    provinces which did not immediately contribute to the formation of its history.
                    For this reason we have left the whole of the south up to the present point
                    unnoticed. Sicily in the hands of the Mussulmans, the Theme of Lombardy
                    abandoned to the weak suzerainty of the Greek catapans, the Lombard duchy of
                    Benevento slowly falling to pieces, and the maritime republics of Naples, Gaeta,
                    and Amalfi extending their influence by commerce in the Mediterranean, were in
                    effect detached from the Italian regno, beyond the jurisdiction of Rome,
                    included in no parcel of Italy proper. But now the moment had arrived when this
                    vast group of provinces, forming the future kingdom of the Two Sicilies, was
                    about to enter definitely and decisively within the bounds of the Italian
                    community. Some Norman adventurers, on pilgrimage to St Michael’s shrine on
                    Monte Gargano, lent their swords in 1017 to the Lombard cities of Apulia against
                    the Greeks. Twelve years later we find the Normans settled at Aversa under their
                    Count Rainulf. From this station as a centre the little band of adventurers,
                    playing the Greeks off against the Lombards, and the Lombards against the
                    Greeks, spread their power in all directions, until they made themselves the
                    most considerable force in southern Italy. William of Hauteville was proclaimed
                    count of Apulia. His half-brother, Robert Wiskard or Guiscard, after defeating
                    the papal troops at Civitella in 1053, received from Leo IX. the investiture of
                    all present and future conquests in Apulia, Calabria, and Sicily, which he
                    agreed to hold as fiefs of the Holy See. Nicholas II. ratified this grant, and
                    confirmed the title of <pb break="no"

                    the mainland, the Normans, under Robert Guiscard’s brother, the great Count
                    Roger, undertook the conquest of Sicily iu 10G0. After a prolonged struggle of
                    thirty years, they wrested the whole island from the Saracens; and Roger, dying
                    in 1101, bequeathed to his son Roger a kingdom in Calabria and Sicily second to
                    none in Europe for wealth and magnificence. This while, the elder branch of the
                    Haute ville family still held the title and domains of the Apulian duchy; but in
                    1127, upon the death of his cousin Duke William, Roger united the whole of the
                    future realm. In 1130 he assumed the style of king of Sicily, inscribing upon
                    his sword the famous hexameter—</p>

                <p>This Norman conquest of the two Sicilies forms the most romantic episode in
                    mediaeval Italian history. By the consolidation of Apulia, Calabria, and Sicily
                    into a powerful kingdom, by checking the growth of the maritime republics, and
                    by recognizing the over-lordship of the papal see, the house of Hauteville
                    influenced the destinies of Italy with more effect than any of the princes who
                    had previously dealt with any portion of the peninsula. Their kingdom, though
                    Naples was from time to time separated from Sicily, never quite lost the
                    cohesion they had given it; and all the disturbances of equilibrium in Italy
                    were due in after days to papal manipulation of the rights acquired by
                    RobertGuiscard’s act of homage. The southern regno, in the hands of the popes,
                    proved an insurmountable obstacle to the unification of Italy, led to French
                    interference in Italian affairs, introduced the Spaniard, and maintained in
                    those rich southern provinces the reality of feudal sovereignty long after this
                    alien element had been eliminated from the rest of Italy.</p>
                <p>For the sake of clearness, we have anticipated the course of events by nearly a
                    century. We must now return to the date of Hildebrand’s elevation to the papacy
                    in 1073, when he chose the memorable name of Gregory VII. In the next year after
                    his election Hildebrand convened a council, and passed measures enforcing the
                    celibacy of the clergy. In 1075 he caused the investiture of ecclesiastical
                    dignitaries by secular potentates of any degree to be condemned. These two
                    reforms, striking at the most cherished privileges and most deeply-rooted
                    self-indulgences of the aristocratic caste in Europe, inflamed the bitterest
                    hostility. Henry IV., king of Germany, but not crowned emperor, convened a diet
                    in the following year at Worms, where Gregory was deposed and excommunicated.
                    The pope followed with a counter excommunication, far more formidable, releasing
                    the king’s subjects from their oaths of allegiance. War was thus declared
                    between the two chiefs of Western Christendom, that war of investitures which
                    out lasted the lives of both Gregory and Henry, and was not terminated till the
                    year 1122. The dramatic episodes of this struggle are too well known to be
                    enlarged upon. In his single-handed duel with the strength of Germany, Gregory
                    received material assistance from the Countess Matilda of Tuscany. She was the
                    last heiress of the great house of Canossa, whose fiefs stretched from Mantua
                    across Lombardy, passed the Apennines, included the Tuscan plains, and embraced
                    a portion of the duchy of Spoleto. It was in her castle of Canossa that Henry
                    IV. performed his three days’ penance in the winter of 1077; and there she made
                    the cession of her vast domains to the church. That cession, renewed after the
                    death of Gregory to his successors, conferred upon the popes indefinite rights,
                    of which they afterwards availed themselves in the consolidation of their
                    temporal power. Matilda died in the year 1115. Gregory had passed before her
                    from the scene of his contest, an exile at Salerno, whither Robert Wiskard
                    carried him in 1084 from the anarchy of rebellious Rome. With unbroken spirit,
                    though the objects of his life were unattained, though Italy and Europe had been
                    thrown into confusion, and the issue of the conflict was still doubtful, Gregory
                    expired in 1085 with these words on his lips: “I loved justice, I hated
                    iniquity, therefore in banishment I die.”</p>
                <p>The greatest of the popes thus breathed his last; but the new spirit he had
                    communicated to the papacy was not destined to expire with him. Gregory’s
                    immediate successors, Victor III., Urban II., and Paschal II., carried on his
                    struggle with Henry IV. and his imperial antipopes, encouraging the emperor’s
                    son to rebel against him, and stirring up Europe for the first crusade. When
                    Henry IV. died, his own son’s prisoner, in 1106, Henry V. crossed the Alps,
                    entered Rome, wrung the imperial coronation from Paschal II., and compelled the
                    pope to -grant his claims on the investitures. Scarcely had he returned to
                    Germany when the Lateran disavowed all that the pope had done, on the score that
                    it had been extorted by force. France sided with the church. Germany rejected
                    the bull of investiture. A new descent into Italy, a new seizure of Rome, proved
                    of no avail. The emperor’s real weakness was in Germany, where his subjects
                    openly expressed their discontent. He at last abandoned the contest which had
                    distracted Europe. By the concordat of Worms, 1122, the emperor surrendered the
                    right of investiture by ring and staff, and granted the right of election to the
                    clergy. The popes were henceforth to be chosen by the cardinals, the bishops by
                    the chapters subject to the pope’s approval. On the other hand the pope ceded to
                    the emperor the right of investiture by the sceptre. But the main issue of the
                    struggle was not in these details of ecclesiastical government; principles had
                    been at stake far deeper and more widely reaching. The respective relations of
                    pope and emperor, ill-defined in the compact between Charles the Great and Leo
                    III., were brought in question, and the two chief potentates of Christendom, no
                    longer tacitly concordant, stood against each other in irreconcilable rivalry.
                    Upon this point, though the battle seemed to be a drawn one, the popes were
                    really victors. They remained independent of the emperor, but the emperor had
                    still to seek the crown at their hands. The pretensions of Otto the Great and
                    Henry III. to make popes were gone for ever.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Age of the Communes.</hi></p>
                <p>The final gainers, hθλvever, by the war of investitures were the Italians. In the
                    first place, from this time forward, owing to the election of popes by the Roman
                    curia, the Holy See remained in the hands of Italians; and this, though it was
                    by no means an unmixed good, was a great glory to the nation. In the next place,
                    the antagonism of the popes to the emperors, which became hereditary in the Holy
                    College, forced the former to assume the protectorate of the national cause. But
                    by far the greatest profit the Italians reaped was the emancipation of their
                    burghs. During the forty-seven years’ war, when pope and emperρr were
                    respectively bidding for their alliance, and offering concessions to secure
                    their support, the communes grew in self-reliance, strength, and liberty. As the
                    bishops had helped to free them from subservience to their feudal masters, so
                    the war of investitures relieved them of dependence on their bishops. The age of
                    real autonomy, signalized by the supremacy of consuls in the cities, had
                    arrived.</p>
                <p>In the republics, as we begin to know them after the war of investitures,
                    government was carried on by officers called consuls, varying in number
                    according to custom and according to the division of the town into districts.
                    These magistrates, as we have already seen, were originally appointed to control
                    and protect the humbler classes. But, <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit13newyrich/page/n491/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0913-0491-0472"/> in proportion as the people gained more power in
                    the field the consuls rose into importance, superseded the bishops, and began to
                    represent the city in transactions with its neighbours. Popes and emperors, who
                    needed the assistance of a city, had to seek it from the consuls, and thus these
                    officers gradually converted an obscure and indefinite authority into what
                    resembles the presidency of a commonwealth. They were supported by a
                    deliberative assembly, called <hi rend="italic">credenza,</hi> chosen from the
                    more distinguished citizens. In addition to this privy council, we find a <hi
                    rend="italic">gran</hi><hi rend="italic">Consiglio,</hi> consisting of the
                    burghers who had established the right to interfere immediately in public
                    affairs, and a still larger assembly called <hi rend="italic">pαrlamento,</hi>
                    which included the whole adult population. Though the institutions of the
                    communes varied in different localities, this is the type to which they all
                    approximated. It will be perceived that the type was rather oligarchical than
                    strictly democratic. Between the parlamento and the consuls with their privy
                    council, or credenza, was interposed the gran consiglio of privileged burghers.
                    These formed the aristocracy of the town, who by their wealth and birth held its
                    affairs within their custody. There is good reason to believe that, when the
                    term <hi rend="italic">popolo</hi> occurs, it refers to this body and not to the
                    whole mass of the population. The <hi rend="italic">comune</hi> included the
                    entire city—bishop, consuls, oligarchy, councils, handicraftsmen, proletariate.
                    The <hi rend="italic">popolo</hi> was the governing or upper class. It was
                    almost inevitable in the transition from feudalism to democracy that this
                    intermediate ground should be traversed; and the peculiar Italian phrases, <hi
                    rend="italic">primo</hi><hi rend="italic">popolo,</hi><hi rend="italic">secondo
                    ρopolo, terzo</hi><hi rend="italic">ρopolo,</hi> and so forth, indicate
                    successive changes, whereby the oligarchy passed from one stage to another in
                    its progress toward absorption in democracy or tyranny.</p>
                <p>Under their consuls the Italian burghs rose to a great height of prosperity and
                    splendour. Pisa built her Duomo. Milan undertook the irrigation works which
                    enriched the soil of Lombardy for ever. Massive walls, substantial edifices,
                    commodious seaports, good roads, were the benefits conferred by this new’
                    government on Italy. It is also to be noticed that the people now began to be
                    conscious of their past. They recognized the fact that their blood was Latin as
                    distinguished from Teutonic, and that they must look to ancient Rome for those
                    memories which constitute a people’s nationality. At this epoch the study of
                    Homan law received a new impulse, and this is the real meaning of the legend
                    that Pisa, glorious through her consuls, brought the pandects in a single codex
                    from Amalfi. The very name consul, no less than the Romanizing character of the
                    best architecture of the time, points to the same revival of antiquity.</p>
                <p>The rise of the Lombard communes produced a sympathetic revolution in Rome, which
                    deserves to be mentioned in this place. A monk, named Arnold of Brescia,
                    animated with the spirit of the Milanese, stirred up the Romans to shake off the
                    temporal sway of their bishop. He attempted, in fact, upon a grand scale what
                    was being slowly and quietly effected in the northern cities. Rome, ever mindful
                    of her antique past, listened to Arnold’s preaching. A senate was established,
                    and the republic was proclaimed. The title of patrician was revived and offered
                    to Conrad, king of Italy, but not crowned emperor. Conrad refused it, and the
                    Romans conferred it upon one of their own nobles. Though these institutions
                    borrowed high-sounding titles from antiquity, they were in reality imitations of
                    the Lombard civic system. The patrician stood for the consuls. The senate,
                    composed of nobles, represented the credenza and the gran consiglio. The pope
                    was unable to check this revolution, which is now chiefly interesting as further
                    proof of the insurgence of the Latin as against the feudal elements in Italy at
                    this period.</p>
                <p>Though the communes gained so much by the war of investitures, the division of
                    the country between the pope’s and emperor’s parties was no small price to pay
                    for independence. It inflicted upon Italy the ineradicable curse of
                    party-warfare, setting city against city, house against house, and-rendering
                    concordant action for a national end impossible. No sooner had the compromise of
                    the investitures been concluded than it was manifest that the burghers of the
                    now enfranchised communes were resolved to turn their arms against each other.
                    We seek in vain an obvious motive for each separate quarrel. All we know for
                    certain is that, at this epoch, Rome attempts to ruin Tivoli, and Venice Pisa;
                    Milan fights with Cremona, Cremona with Crema, Pavia with Verona, Verona with
                    Padua, Piacenza with Parma, Modena and Reggio with Bologna, Bologna and Faenza
                    with Ravenna and Imola, Florence and Pisa with Lucca and Siena, and so on
                    through the whole list of cities. The nearer the neighbours, the more rancorous
                    and internecine is the strife; and, as in all cases where animosity is deadly
                    and no grave local causes of dispute are apparent, we are bound to conclude that
                    some deeply-seated permanent uneasiness goaded these fast growing communities
                    into rivalry. Italy was, in fact, too small for her children. As the towns
                    expanded, they perceived that they must mutually exclude each other. They fought
                    for bare existence, for primacy in commerce, for the command of seaports, for
                    the keys of mountain passes, for rivers, roads, and all the avenues of wealth
                    and plenty. The pope’s cause and the emperor’s cause were of comparatively
                    little moment to Italian burghers; and the names of Guelf and Ghibelline, which
                    before long began to be heard in every street, on every market-place, had no
                    meaning for them. These watchwords are said to have arisen in Germany during the
                    disputed succession of the empire between 1135 and 1152, when the Welfs of
                    Bavaria opposed the Swabian princes of Waiblingen origin. But in Italy, although
                    they were severally identified with the papal and imperial parties, they really
                    served as symbols for jealousies which altered in complexion from time to time
                    and place to place, expressing more than antagonistic political principles, and
                    involving differences vital enough to split the social fabric to its
                    foundation.</p>
                <p>Under the imperial rule of Lothar the Saxon (1125-1137) and Conrad the Swabian
                    (1138-1152), these civil wars increased in violence owing to the absence of
                    authority. Neither Lothar nor Conrad was strong at home; the former had no
                    influence in Italy, and the latter never entered Italy at all. But when Conrad
                    died, the electors chose his nephew Frederick, surnamed Barbarossa, who united
                    the rival honours of Welf and Waiblingen, to succeed him; and it was soon
                    obvious that the empire had a master powerful of brain and firm of will.
                    Frederick immediately determined to reassert the imperial rights in his southern
                    provinces, and to check the warfare of the burghs. When he first crossed the
                    Alps in 1154, Lombardy was, roughly speaking, divided between two parties, the
                    one headed by Pavia professing loyalty to the empire, the other headed by Milan
                    ready to oppose its claims. The municipal animosities of the last quarter of a
                    century gave substance to these factions; yet neither the imperial nor the
                    anti-imperial party had any real community of interest with Frederick. He came
                    to supersede self-government by consuls, to deprive the cities of the privilege
                    of making war on their own account, and to extort his regalian rights of forage,
                    food, and lodging for his armies. It was only the habit of interurban jealousy
                    which prevented the communes from at once combining to resist demands which
                    threatened their liberty of action, and would leave them passive at the pleasure
                    of a foreign master. The diet was opened at Roncaglia near Piacenza, where
                    Frederick listened to the <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0913-0492-0473"/> complaints of Como and Lodi against Milan, of
                    Pavia against Tortona, and of the marquis of Montferrat against Asti and Chieri.
                    The plaintiffs in each case were imperialists; and Frederick’s first action was
                    to redress their supposed grievances. He laid waste Chieri, Asti, and Tortona,
                    then took the Lombard crown at Pavia, and, reserving Milan for a future day,
                    passed southward to Rome. Outside the gates of Rome he was met by a deputation
                    from the senate he had come to supersede, who addressed him in words memorable
                    for expressing the republican spirit of new Italy face to face with autocratic
                    feudalism: “Thou wast a stranger, I have made thee a citizen;” it is Rome who
                    speaks: “Thou camest as an alien from beyond the Alps, I have conferred on thee
                    the principality.” Moved only to scorn and indignation by the rhetoric of these
                    presumptuous enthusiasts, Frederick marched into the Leonine city, and took the
                    imperial crown from the hands of Hadrian IV. In return for this compliance, the
                    emperor delivered over to the pope his troublesome rival Arnold of Brescia, who
                    was burned alive by Nicholas Breakspear, the only English successor of St Pqter.
                    The gates of Rome itself were shut against Frederick; and even on this first
                    occasion his good understanding with Hadrian began to suffer. The points of
                    dispute between them related mainly to Matilda’s bequest, and to the kingdom of
                    Sicily, which the pope had rendered independent of the empire by renewing its
                    investiture in the name of the Holy See. In truth, the papacy and the empire had
                    become irreconcilable. Each claimed illimitable authority, and neither was
                    content to abide within such limits as would have secured a mutual tolerance.
                    Having obtained his coronation, Frederick withdrew to Germany, while Milan
                    prepared herself against the storm which threatened. In the ensuing struggle
                    with the empire, that great city rose to the altitude of patriotic heroism. By
                    their sufferings no less than by their deeds of daring, her citizens showed
                    themselves to be sublime, devoted, and disinterested, winning the purest laurels
                    which give lustre to Italian story. Almost within Frederick’s presence, they
                    rebuilt Tortona, punished Pavia, Lodi, Cremona, and the marquis of Montferrat.
                    Then they fortified the Adda and Ticino, and waited for the emperor’s next
                    descent. He came in 1158 with a large army, overran Lombardy, raised his
                    imperial allies, and sat down before the walls of Milan. Famine forced the
                    burghers to partial obedience, and Frederick held a victorious diet at
                    Roncaglia. Here the jurists of Bologna appeared, armed with their new lore of
                    Roman law, and expounded Justinian’s code in the interests of the German empire.
                    It was now seen how the absolutist doctrines of autocracy developed in
                    Justinian’s age at Byzantium would bear fruits in the development of an imperial
                    idea, which was destined to be the fatal mirage of mediaeval Italy. Frederick
                    placed judges of his own appointment, with the title of podesta, in all the
                    Lombard communes; and this stretch of his authority, while it exacerbated his
                    foes, forced even his friends to join their ranks against him. The war,
                    meanwhile, dragged on. Crema yielded after an heroic siege in 1160, and was
                    abandoned to the cruelty of its fierce rival Cremona. Milan was invested in
                    1161, starved into capitulation after nine months’ resistance, and given up to
                    total destruction by the Italian imperialists of Frederick’s army. So stained
                    and tarnished with the vindictive passions of municipal rivalry was even this,
                    the one great glorious strife of Italian annals! Having ruined his rebellious
                    city, but not tamed her spirit, Frederick withdrew across the Alps. But, in the
                    interval between his second and third visit, a league was formed against him in
                    north-eastern Lombardy. Verona, Vicenza, Padua, Treviso, Venice entered into a
                    compact to defend their liberties; and when he came again in 1163 with, a
                    brilliant staff of German knights, the imperial cities refused to join his
                    standards. This was the first and ominous sign of a coming change.</p>
                <p>Meanwhile the election of Alexander III. to the papacy in 1159 added a powerful
                    ally to the republican party. Opposed by an anti-pope whom the emperor favoured,
                    Alexander found it was his truest policy to rely for support upon the
                    anti-imperialist communes. They in return gladly accepted a champion who lent
                    them the prestige and influence of the church. When Frederick once more crossed
                    the Alps in 1166, he advanced on Rome, and besieged Alexander in the Coliseum.
                    But the affairs of Lombardy left him no leisure to persecute a recalcitrant
                    pontiff. In April 1167 a new league was formed between Cremona, Bergamo,
                    Brescia, Mantua, and Ferrara. In December of the same year this league allied
                    itself with the elder Veronese league, and received the addition of Milan, Lodi,
                    Piacenza, Parma, Modena, and Bologna. The famous league of Lombard cities,
                    styled Concordia in its acts of settlement, was now established. Novara,
                    Vercelli, Como, Asti, and Tortona swelled its ranks; only Pavia and Montferrat
                    remained imperialist between the Alps and Apennines. Frederick fled for his life
                    by the Mont Cenis, and in 1168 the town of Alessandria was erected to keep Pavia
                    and the marquisate in check. In the emperor’s absence, Ravenna, Rimini, Imola,
                    and Forli joined the league, which now called itself the “Society of Venice,
                    Lombardy, the March, Romagna, and Alessandria.” For the fifth time, in 1174,
                    Frederick entered his rebellious dominions. The fortress town of Alessandria
                    stopped his progress with those mud walls contemptuously named “of straw,” while
                    the forces of the league assembled at Modena, and obliged him to raise the
                    siege. In the spring of 1176 Frederick threatened Milan. His army found itself a
                    little to the north of the town near the village of Legnano, when the troops of
                    the city, assisted only by a few allies from Piacenza, Verona, Brescia, Novara,
                    and Vercelli, met and overwhelmed it. The victory was complete. Frederick
                    escaped alone to Pavia, whence he opened negotiations with Alexander. In
                    consequence of these transactions, he was suffered to betake himself unharmed to
                    Venice. Here, as upon neutral ground, the emperor met the pope, and a truce for
                    six years was concluded with the Lombard burghs. Looking back from the
                    vantage-ground of history upon the issue of this long struggle, we are struck
                    with the small results which satisfied the Lombard communes. They had humbled
                    and utterly defeated their foreign lord. They had proved their strength in
                    combination. Yet neither the acts by which their league was ratified nor the
                    terms negotiated for them by their patron Alexander evince the smallest desire
                    of what we now understand as national independence. The name of Italy is never
                    mentioned. The supremacy of the emperor is not called in question. The
                    conception of a permanent confederation, bound together in offensive and
                    defensive alliance for common objects, has not occurred to these hard fighters
                    and stubborn asserters of their civic privileges. All they claim is municipal
                    autonomy; the right to manage their own affairs within the city wall⅛ to fight
                    their battles as they choose, and to follow their several ends unchecked. It is
                    vain to lament that, when they might have now established Italian independence
                    upon a secure basis, they chose local and municipal privileges. Their mutual
                    jealousies, combined with the prestige of the empire, and possibly with the
                    selfishness of the pope, who had secured his own position, and was not likely to
                    foster a national spirit that would have threatened the ecclesiastical
                    supremacy, deprived the Italians of the only great opportunity they ever had of
                    forming themselves into a powerful nation.</p>
                <p>When the truce expired in 1183, a permanent peace <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0913-0493-0474"/> was ratified at Constance. The intervening years
                    had been spent by the Lombards, not in consolidating their union, but in
                    attempting to secure special privileges for their several cities. Alessandria
                    della Paglia, glorious by her resistance to the emperor in 1174, had even
                    changed her name to Cesarea! The signatories of the peace of Constance were
                    divided between leaguers and imperialists. On the one side we find Vercelli,
                    Novara, Milan, Lodi, Bergamo, Brescia, Mantua, Verona, Vicenza, Padua, Treviso,
                    Bologna, Faenza, Modena, Reggio, Parma, Piacenza; on the other, Pavia, Genoa,
                    Alba, Cremona, Como, Tortona, Asti, Cesarea. Venice, who had not yet entered the
                    Italian community, is conspicuous by her absence. According to the terms of this
                    treaty, the communes were confirmed in their right of self-government by
                    consuls, and their right of warfare. The emperor retained the supreme courts of
                    appeal within the cities, and his claim for sustenance at their expense when he
                    came into Italy.</p>
                <p>The privileges confirmed to the Lombard cities by the peace of Constance were
                    extended to Tuscany, where Florence, having ruined Fiesole, had begun her career
                    of freedom and prosperity. The next great chapter in the history of Italian
                    evolution is the war of the burghs against the nobles. The consular cities were
                    everywhere surrounded by castles; and, though the feudal lords had been weakened
                    by the events of the preceding centuries, they continued to be formidable
                    enemies. It was, for instance, necessary to the well-being of the towns that
                    they should possess territory round their walls, and this had to be wrested from
                    the nobles. We cannot linger over the details of this warfare. It must suffice
                    to say that, partly by mortgaging their property to rich burghers, partly by
                    entering the service of the cities as condottieri, partly by espousing the cause
                    of one town against another, and partly by forced submission after the siege of
                    their strong places, the counts were gradually brought into connexion of
                    dependence on the communes. These, in their turn, forced the nobles to leave
                    their castles, and to reside for at least a portion of each year within the
                    walls. By these measures the counts became citizens, the rural population ceased
                    to rank as serfs, and the Italo-Roman population of the towns absorbed into
                    itself the remnants of Franks, Germans, and other foreign stocks. It would be
                    impossible to exaggerate the importance of this revolution, which ended by
                    destroying the last vestige of feudality, and prepared that common Italian
                    people which afterwards distinguished itself by the creation of European
                    culture. But, like all the vicissitudes of the Italian race, while it was a
                    decided step forward in one direction, it introduced a new source of discord.
                    The associated nobles proved ill neighbours to the peaceable citizens. They
                    fortified their houses, retained their military habits, defied the consuls, and
                    carried on feuds in the streets and squares. The war against the castles became
                    a war against the palaces; and the system of government by consuls proved
                    inefficient to control the clashing elements within the state. This led to the
                    establishment of podestàs, who represented a compromise between two radically
                    hostile parties in the city, and whose business it was to arbitrate and keep the
                    peace between them. Invariably a foreigner, elected for a year with power of
                    life and death and control of the armed force, but subject to a strict account
                    at the expiration of his office, the podestà might be compared to a dictator
                    invested with limited authority. His title was derived from that of Frederick
                    Barbarossa’s judges; but he had no dependence on the empire. The citizens chose
                    him, and voluntarily submitted to his rule. The podestà marks an essentially
                    transitional state in civic government, and his intervention paved the way for
                    despotism.</p>
                <p>The thirty years which elapsed between Frederick Barbarossa’s death in 1190 and
                    the coronation of his grandson Frederick II. in 1220 form one of the most
                    momentous epochs in Italian history. Barbarossa, perceiving the advantage that
                    would accrue to his house if he could join the crown of Sicily to that of
                    Germany, and thus deprive the popes of their allies in Lower Italy, procured the
                    marriage of his son Henry VI. to Constance, daughter of King Roger, and heiress
                    of the Hauteville dynasty. When William II., the last monarch of the Norman
                    race, died, Henry VI. claimed that kingdom in his wife’s right, and was
                    recognized in 1194, Three years afterwards he died, leaving a son, Frederick, to
                    the care of Constance, who in her turn died in 1198, bequeathing the young
                    prince, already crowned king of Germany, to the guardianship of Innocent III. It
                    was bold policy to confide Frederick to his greatest enemy and rival; but the
                    pope honourably discharged his duty, until his ward outgrew the years of
                    tutelage, and became a fair mark for ecclesiastical hostility. Frederick’s long
                    minority was occupied by Innocent’s pontificate. Among the principal events of
                    that reign must be reckoned the foundation of the two orders, Franciscan and
                    Dominican, who were destined to form a militia for the Holy See in conflict with
                    the empire and the heretics of Lombardy. A second great event was the fourth
                    crusade, undertaken in 1198, which established the naval and commercial
                    supremacy of the Italians in the Mediterranean. The Venetians, who contracted
                    for the transport of the crusaders, and whose blind doge Dandolo was first to
                    land in Constantinople, received one-half and one-fourth of the divided Greek
                    empire for their spoils. The Venetian ascendency in the Levant dates from this
                    epoch; for, though the republic had no power to occupy all the domains ceded to
                    it, Candia was taken, together with several small islands and stations on the
                    mainland. The formation of a Latin empire in the East increased the pope’s
                    prestige; while at home it was his policy to organize Countess Matilda’s
                    heritage by the formation of Guelf leagues, over which he presided. This is the
                    meaning of the three leagues, in the March, in the duchy of Spoleto, and in
                    Tuscany, which now combined the chief cities of the papal territory into allies
                    of the Holy See. From the Tuscan league Pisa, consistently Ghibelline, stood
                    aloof. Rome itself again at this epoch established a republic, with which
                    Innocent would not or could not interfere. The thirteen districts in their
                    council nominated four <hi rend="italic">caporioni,</hi> who acted in concert
                    with a <hi rend="italic">senator,</hi> appointed, like the podestà of other
                    cities, for supreme judicial functions. Meanwhile the Guelf and Ghibelline
                    factions were beginning to divide Italy into minute parcels. Not only did
                    commune range itself against commune under the two rival flags, but party rose
                    up against party within the city walls. The introduction of the factions into
                    Florence in 1215, owing to a private quarrel between the Buondelmonti, Amidei,
                    and Donati, is a celebrated instance of what was happening in every burgh.</p>
                <p>Frederick II. was left without a rival for the imperial throne in 1218 by the
                    death of Otto IV., and on the 22d of November 1220 Honorius III., Innocent’s
                    successor, crowned him in Rome. It was impossible for any section of the
                    Italians to mistake the gravity of his access to power. In his single person he
                    combined the prestige of empire with the crowns of Italy, Sicily, Sardinia,
                    Germany, and Burgundy; and in 1225, by marriage with Yolande de Brienne, he
                    added that of Jerusalem. There was no prince greater or more formidable in the
                    habitable globe. The communes, no less than the popes, felt that they must
                    prepare themselves for contest to the death with a power which threatened their
                    existence. Already in 1218 the Guelfs of Lombardy had resuscitated their old <pb

                    in a battle near Ghibello. Italy seemed to lie prostrate before the emperor, who
                    commanded her for the first time from the south as well as from the north. In
                    1227 Frederick, who had promised to lead a crusade, was excommunicated by
                    Gregory IX. because he was obliged by illness to defer his undertaking; and thus
                    the spiritual power declared war upon its rival. The Guelf towns of Lombardy
                    again raised their levies. Frederick enlisted his Saracen troops at Nocera and
                    Luceria, and appointed the terrible Ezzelino da Romano his vicar in the Marches
                    of Verona to quell their insurrection. It was 1236, however, before he was able
                    to take the field himself against the Lombards. Having established Ezzelino in
                    Verona, Vicenza, and Padua, he defeated the Milanese and their allies at
                    Cortenuova in 1237, and sent their carroccio as a trophy of his victory to Rome.
                    Gregory IX. feared lest the Guelf party would be ruined by this check. He
                    therefore made alliance with Venice and Genoa, fulminated a new excommunication
                    against Frederick, and convoked a council at Rome to ratify his ban in 1241. The
                    Genoese undertook to bring the French bishops to this council. Their fleet was
                    attacked at’ Meloria by the Pisans, and utterly defeated. The French prelates
                    went in silver chains to prison in the Ghibelline capital of Tuscany. So far
                    Frederick had been successful at all points. In 1243 a new pope, Innocent IV.,
                    was elected, who prosecuted the war with still bitterer spirit. Forced to fly to
                    France, he there, at Lyons, in 1245, convened a council, which enforced his
                    condemnation of the emperor. Frederick’s subjects were freed from their
                    allegiance, and he was declared dethroned and deprived of all rights. Five times
                    king and emperor as he was, Frederick, placed under the ban of the church, led
                    henceforth a doomed existence. The mendicant monks stirred up the populace to
                    acts of fanatical enmity. To plot against him, to attempt his life by poison or
                    the sword, was accounted virtuous. His secretary, Piero delle Vigne, conspired
                    against him. The crimes of his vicar Ezzelino, who laid whole provinces waste
                    and murdered men by thousands in his Paduan prisons, increased the horror with
                    which he was regarded. Parma revolted from him, and he spent months in 1247-8
                    vainly trying to reduce this one time faithful city. The only gleam of success
                    which shone on his ill fortune was the revolution which placed Florence in the
                    hands of the Ghibellines in 1248. Next year Bologna rose against him, defeated
                    his troops, and took his son Enzio, king of Sardinia, prisoner at Fossalta.
                    Hunted to the ground and broken-hearted, Frederick expired at the end of 1250 in
                    his Apulian castle of Fiorentino. It is difficult to judge his career with
                    fairness. The only prince who could, with any probability of success, have
                    established the German rule in Italy, his ruin proved the impossibility of that
                    long-cherished scheme. The nation had outgrown dependence upon foreigners, and
                    after his death no German emperor interfered with anything but miserable failure
                    in Italian affairs. Yet from many points of view it might be regretted that
                    Frederick was not suffered to rule Italy. By birth and breeding an Italian,
                    highly gifted and widely cultivated, liberal in his opinions, a patron of
                    literature, a founder of universities, he anticipated the spirit of the
                    Renaissance. At his court Italian started into being as a language. His laws
                    were wise. He was capable of giving to Italy a large and noble culture. But the
                    commanding greatness of his position proved his ruin. Emperor and king of
                    Sicily, he was the natural enemy of popes, who could not tolerate so
                    overwhelming a rival.</p>
                <p>After Frederick’s death, the popes carried on their war for eighteen years
                    against his descendants. The cause of his son Conrad was sustained in Lower
                    Italy by Manfred, one of Frederick’s many natural children; and, when Conrad
                    died in 1254, Manfred still acted as vicegerent for the Swabians, who were now
                    represented by a boy Conradin, Innocent IV. and Alexander IV. continued to make
                    head against the Ghibelline party. The most dramatic incident in this struggle
                    was the crusade preached against Ezzelino. This tyrant had made himself justly
                    odious; and when he was hunted to death in 1259, the triumph was less for the
                    Guelf cause than for humanity outraged by the iniquities of such a monster. The
                    battle between Guelf and Ghibelline raged with unintermitting fury. While the
                    former faction gained in Lombardy by the massacre of Ezzelino, the latter
                    revived in Tuscany after the battle of Montaperti, which in 1260 placed Florence
                    at the discretion of the Ghibellines. Manfred, now called king of Sicily, headed
                    the Ghibellines, and there was no strong counterpoise against him. In this
                    necessity Urban IV. and Clement IV. invited Charles of Anjou to enter Italy and
                    take the Guelf command. They made him senator of Rome, and vicar of Tuscany, and
                    promised him the investiture of the regno provided he stipulated that it should
                    not be held in combination with the empire. Charles accepted these terms, and
                    was welcomed by the Guelf party as their chief throughout Italy. He defeated
                    Manfred in a battle at Grandella near Benevento in 1266. Manfred was killed;
                    and, when Conradin, a lad of sixteen, descended from Germany to make good his
                    claims to the kingdom, he too was defeated at Tagliacozzo in 1267. Less lucky
                    than his uncle, Conradin escaped with his life, to die upon a scaffold at
                    Naples. His glove was carried to his cousin Constance, wife of Peter of Aragon,
                    the last of the great Norman-Swabian family. Enzio died in his prison four years
                    later. The popes had been successful; but they had purchased their bloody
                    victory at a great cost. This first invitation to French princes brought with it
                    incalculable evils.</p>
                <p>Charles of Anjou, supported by Rome, and recognized as chief in Tuscany, was by
                    far the most formidable of the Italian potentates. In his turn he now excited
                    the jealousy of the popes, who began, though cautiously, to cast their weight
                    into the Ghibelline scale. Gregory initiated the policy of establishing an
                    equilibrium between the parties, which was carried out by his successor Nicholas
                    III. Charles was forced to resign the senatorship of Rome and the signoria of
                    Lombardy and Tuscany. In 1282 he received a more decided check, when Sicily rose
                    against him in the famous rebellion of the Vespers. He lost the island, which
                    gave itself to Aragon; anti thus the kingdom of Sicily was severed from that of
                    Naples, the dynasty in the one being Spanish and Ghibelline, in the other French
                    and Guelf. Meanwhile a new emperor had been elected, the prudent Rudolf of
                    Hapsburg, who abstained from interference with Italy, and who confirmed the
                    territorial pretensions of the popes by solemn charter in 1278. Henceforth
                    Emilia, Romagna, the March of Ancona, the patrimony of St Peter, and the
                    Campagna of Rome held of the Holy See, and not of the empire. The imperial
                    chancery, without inquiring closely into the deeds furnished by the papal curia,
                    made a deed of gift, which placed the pope in the position of a temporal
                    sovereign. While Nicholas III. thus bettered the position of the church in
                    Italy, the Guelf party grew stronger than ever, through the crushing defeat of
                    the Pisans by the Genoese at Meloria in 1284. Pisa, who had ruined Amalfi, was
                    now ruined by Genoa. She never held her head so high again after this victory,
                    which sent her best and bravest citizens to die in the Ligurian dungeons. The
                    Mediterranean was left to be fought for by Genoa and Venice, while Guelf
                    Florence grew still more powerful in Tuscany. Not long after the battle of
                    Meloria Charles of Anjou died, and was succeeded by his son Charles II. of
                    Naples, who played no prominent <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0913-0495-0476"/> part in Italian affairs. The Guelf party was held
                    together with a less tight hand even in cities so consistent as Florence. Here
                    in the year 1300 new factions, subdividing the old Guelfs and Ghibellines under
                    the names of Neri and Bianchi, had acquired such force that Boniface VIII., a
                    violently Guelf pope, called in Charles of Valois to pacify the republic and
                    undertake the charge of Italian affairs. Boniface was a passionate and unwise
                    man. After quarrelling with the French king, Philip le Bel, he fell into the
                    hands of the Colonna family at Anagni, and died, either of the violence he there
                    received or of mortification, in October 1303.</p>
                <p>After the short papacy of Benedict XI. a Frenchman, Clement V., was elected, and
                    the seat of the papacy was transferred to Avignon. Thus began that Babylonian
                    exile of the popes which placed them in subjection to the French crown, and
                    ruined their prestige in Italy. Lasting seventy years, and joining on to the
                    sixty years of the Great Schism, this enfeeblement of the papal authority,
                    coinciding as it did with the practical elimination of the empire from Italian
                    affairs, gave a long period of comparative independence to the nation. Nor must
                    it be forgotten that this exile was due to the policy which induced the
                    pontiffs, in their detestation of Ghibellinism, to rely successively upon the
                    houses of Anjou and of Valois. This policy it was which justified Dante’s fierce
                    epigram—the <hi rend="italic">puttaneggiar co</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >régi.</hi></p>
                <p>The period we have briefly traversed was immortalized by Dante in an epic which
                    from one point of view might be called the poem of the Guelfs and Ghibellines.
                    From the foregoing bare narration of events it is impossible to estimate the
                    importance of these parties, or to understand their bearing on subsequent
                    Italian history. We are therefore forced to pause awhile, and probe beneath the
                    surface. The civil wars may be regarded as a continuation of the previous
                    municipal struggle, intensified by recent hostilities between the burghers and
                    the nobles. The quarrels of the church and empire lend pretexts and furnish
                    war-cries; but the real question at issue is not the supremacy of pope or
                    emperor. The conflict is a social one, between civic and feudal institutions,
                    between commercial and military interests, between progress and conservatism.
                    Guelf democracy and industry idealize the pope. The banner of the church waves
                    above the camp of those who aim at positive prosperity and republican equality.
                    Ghibelline aristocracy and immobility idealize the emperor. The prestige of the
                    empire, based upon Roman law and feudal tradition, attracts imaginative patriots
                    and systematic thinkers. The two ideals are counterposed and mutually exclusive.
                    No city calls itself either Guelf or Ghibelline till it has expelled one-half of
                    its inhabitants; for each party is resolved to constitute the state according to
                    its own conception, and the affirmation of the one programme is the negation of
                    the other. The Ghibelline honestly believes that the Guelfs will reduce society
                    to chaos. The Guelf is persuaded that the Ghibellines will annihilate freedom
                    and strangle commerce. The struggle is waged by two sets of men who equally love
                    their city, but who would fain rule it upon diametrically opposite principles,
                    and who fight to the death for its possession. This contradiction enters into
                    the minutest details of life:—armorial bearings, clothes, habits at table,
                    symbolize and accentuate the difference. Meanwhile each party forms its own
                    organization of chiefs, finance-officers, and registrars at home, and sends
                    ambassadors to foreign cities of the same complexion. A network of party policy
                    embraces and dominates the burghs of Italy, bringing the most distant centres
                    into relation, and by the very division of the country augmenting the sense of
                    nationality. The Italians learn through their discords at this epoch that they
                    form one community. The victory in the conflict practically falls to the
                    hitherto unenfranchised plebeians. The elder noble families die out or lose
                    their preponderance. In some cities, as notably in Florence after the date 1292,
                    it becomes criminal to be <hi rend="italic">scioperato,</hi> or unemployed in
                    industry. New houses rise into importance; a new commercial aristocracy is
                    formed. Burghers of all denominations are enrolled in one or other of the arts
                    or guilds, and these trading companies furnish the material from which the
                    government or signoria of the city is composed. Plebeian handicrafts assert
                    their right to be represented on an equality with learned professions and
                    wealthy corporations. The ancient classes are confounded and obliterated in a
                    population more homogeneous, more adapted for democracy and despotism.</p>
                <p>In addition to the parliament and the councils which have been already
                    enumerated, we now find a <hi rend="italic">council of the party</hi>
                    established within the city. This body tends to become a little state within the
                    state, and, by controlling the victorious majority, disposes of the government
                    as it thinks best. The consuls are merged in <hi rend="italic">ancients</hi> or
                    <hi rend="italic">priors,</hi> chosen from the arts. A new magistrate, the <hi
                    rend="italic">gonfalonier of justice,</hi> appears in some of the Guelf cities,
                    with the special duty of keeping the insolence of the nobility in check.
                    Meanwhile the podestà still subsists; but he is no longer equal to the task of
                    maintaining an equilibrium of forces. He sinks more and more into a judge, loses
                    more and more the character of dictator. His ancient place is now occupied by a
                    new functionary, no longer acting as arbiter, but concentrating the forces of
                    the triumphant party. The <hi rend="italic">captain of the people,</hi> acting
                    as head of the ascendant Guelfs or Ghibellines, undertakes the responsibility of
                    proscriptions, decides on questions of policy, forms alliances, declares war.
                    Like all officers created to meet an emergency, the limitations to his power are
                    ill-defined, and he is often little better than an autocrat.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Age of the Despots.</hi></p>
                <p>Thus the Italians, during the heat of the civil wars, were ostensibly divided
                    between partisans of the empire and partisans of the church. After the death of
                    Frederick II. their affairs were managed by Manfred and by Charles of Anjou, the
                    supreme captains of the parties, under whose orders acted the captains of the
                    people in each city. The contest being carried on by warfare, it followed that
                    these captains in the burghs were chosen on account of military skill; and,
                    since the nobles were men of arms by profession, members of ancient houses took
                    the lead again in towns where they had been absorbed into the bourgeoisie. In
                    this way, after the downfall of the Ezzelini of Romano, the Della Scala dynasty
                    arose in Verona, and the Carraresi in Padua. The Estensi made themselves lords
                    of Ferrara; the Torriani headed the Guelfs of Milan. At Ravenna we find the
                    Polenta family, at Rimini the Malatestas, at Parma the Rossi, at Piacenza the
                    Scotti, at Faenza the Manfredi. There is not a burgh of northern Italy but can
                    trace the rise of a dynastic house to the vicissitudes of this period. In
                    Tuscany, where the Guelf party was very strongly organized, and the commercial
                    constitution of Florence kept the nobility in check, the communes remained as
                    yet free from hereditary masters. Yet generals from time to time arose, the
                    Conte Ugolino della Gheradesca at Pisa, Uguccione della Faggiuola at Lucca, the
                    Conte Guido di Montefeltro at Florence, who threatened the liberties of Tuscan
                    cities with military despotism.</p>
                <p>Left to themselves by absentee emperors and exiled popes, the Italians pursued
                    their own course of development unchecked. After the commencement of the 14th
                    century, the civil wars decreased in fury, and at the same time it was perceived
                    that their effect had been to confirm <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0913-0496-0477"/> tyrants in their grasp upon free cities. Growing
                    up out of the captain of the people or signore of the commune, the tyrant
                    annihilated both parties for his own profit and for the peace of the state. He
                    used the dictatorial powers with which he was invested, to place himself above
                    the law, resuming in his person the state-machinery which had preceded him. In
                    him, for the first time, the city attained self-consciousness; the blindly
                    working forces of previous revolutions were combined in the will of a ruler. The
                    tyrant’s general policy was to favour the multitude at the expense of his own
                    caste. He won favour by these means, and completed the levelling down of
                    classes, which had been proceeding ever since the emergence of the communes.</p>
                <p>In 1309 Robert, grandson of Charles, the first Angevine sovereign, succeeded to
                    the throne of Naples, and became the leader of the Guelfs in Italy. In the next
                    year Henry VII. of Luxembourg crossed the Alps soon after his election to the
                    empire, and raised the hopes of the Ghibellines. Dante from his mountain
                    solitudes passionately called μpon him to play the part of a Messiah. But it was
                    now impossible for any German to control the “Garden of the Empire.” Italy had
                    entered on a new phase of her existence, and the great poet’s <hi rend="italic"
                    >De</hi><hi rend="italic">Monarchia</hi> represented a dream of the past which
                    could not be realized. Henry established imperial vicars in the Lombard towns,
                    confirming the tyrants, but gaining nothing for the empire in exchange for the
                    titles he conferred. After receiving the crown in Rome, he died at Buonconvento,
                    a little walled town south of Siena, on his backward journey in 1313. The
                    profits of his inroad were reaped by despots, who used the Ghibelline prestige
                    for the consolidation of their own power. It is from this epoch that the
                    supremacy of the Visconti, hitherto the unsuccessful rivals of the Guelfic
                    Torriani for the signory of Milan, dates. The Scaligers in Verona and the
                    Carraresi in Padua were strengthened; and in Tuscany Castruccio Castracane,
                    Uguccione’s successor at Lucca, became formidable. In 1325 he defeated the
                    Florentines at Alto Pascio, and carried home their carroccio as a trophy of his
                    victory over the Guelfs. Louis of Bavaria, the next emperor, made a similar
                    excursion in the year 1327, with even greater loss of imperial prestige. He
                    deposed Galeazzo Visconti on his downward journey, and offered Milan for a sum
                    of money to his son Azzo upon his return. Castruccio Castracane was nominated by
                    him duke of Lucca; and this is the first instance of a dynastic title conferred
                    upon an Italian adventurer by the emperor. Castruccio dominated Tuscany, where
                    the Guelf cause, in the weakness of King Robert, languished. But the
                    adventurer’s death in 1328 saved the stronghold of republican institutions, and
                    Florence breathed freely for a while again. Can Grande della Scala’s death in
                    the next year inflicted on the Lombard Ghibellines a loss hardly inferior to
                    that of Castruccio’s on their Tuscan allies. Equally contemptible in its
                    political results and void of historical interest was the brief visit of John of
                    Bohemia, son of Henry VII., whom the Ghibellines next invited to assume their
                    leadership. He sold a few privileges, conferred a few titles, and recrossed the
                    Alps in 1333. It is clear that at this time the fury of the civil wars was
                    spent. In spite of repeated efforts on the part of the Ghibellines, in spite of
                    King Robert’s supine incapacity, the imperialists gained no permanent advantage.
                    The Italians were tired of fighting, and the leaders of both factions looked
                    exclusively to their own interests. Each city which had been the cradle of
                    freedom thankfully accepted a master, to quench the conflagration of party
                    strife, encourage trade, and make the handicraftsmen comfortable. Even the
                    Florentines in 1342 submitted for a few months to the despotism of the duke of
                    Athens. They conferred the signory upon him for life; and, had he not mismanaged
                    matters, he might have held the city in his grasp. Italy was settling down and
                    turning her attention to home comforts, arts, and literature. Boccaccio, the
                    contented bourgeois, succeeded to Dante, the fierce aristocrat.</p>
                <p>The most marked proof of the change which came over Italy towards the middle of
                    the 14th century is furnished by the companies of adventure. It was with their
                    own militia that the burghers won freedom in the war of independence, subdued
                    the nobles, and fought the battles of the parties. But from this time forward
                    they laid down their arms, and played the game of warfare by the aid of
                    mercenaries. Ecclesiastical overlords, interfering from a distance in Italian
                    politics; prosperous republics, with plenty of money to spend but no leisure or
                    inclination for camp-life; cautious tyrants, glad of every pretext to emasculate
                    their subjects, and courting popularity by exchanging conscription for
                    taxation,—all combined to favour the new system. Mercenary troops are said to
                    have been first levied from disbanded Germans, together with Breton and English
                    adventurers, whom the Visconti and Castruccio took into their pay. They soon
                    appeared under their own captains, who hired them out to the highest bidder, or
                    marched them on marauding expeditions up and down the less protected districts.
                    The names of some of these earliest captains of adventure, Fra Moriale, Count
                    Lando, and Duke Werner, who styled himself the “Enemy of God and Mercy,” have
                    been preserved to us. As the companies grew in size and improved their
                    discipline, it was seen by the Italian nobles that this kind of service offered
                    a good career for men of spirit, who had learned the use of arms. To leave so
                    powerful and profitable a calling in the hands of foreigners seemed both
                    dangerous and uneconomical. Therefore, after the middle of the century, this
                    profession fell into the hands of natives. The first Italian who formed an
                    exclusively Italian company was Alberico da Barbiano, a nobleman of Romagna, and
                    founder of the Milanese house of Belgiojoso. In his school the great condottieri
                    Braccio da Montone and Sforza Attendolo were formed; and henceforth the battles
                    of Italy were fought by Italian generals commanding native troops. This was
                    better in some respects than if the mercenaries had been foreigners. Yet it must
                    not be forgotten that the new companies of adventure, who decided Italian
                    affairs for the next century, were in no sense patriotic. They sold themselves
                    for money, irrespective of the cause which they upheld; and, while changing
                    masters, they had no care for any interests but their own. The name condottiero,
                    derived from <hi rend="italic">condotta,</hi> a paid contract to supply so many
                    fighting men in serviceable order, sufficiently indicates the nature of the
                    business. In the hands of able captains, like Francesco Sforza or Piccinino,
                    these mercenary troops became moving despotisms, draining the country of its
                    wealth, and always eager to fasten and found tyrannies upon the provinces they
                    had been summoned to defend. Their generals substituted heavy-armed cavalry for
                    the old militia, and introduced systems of campaigning which reduced the art of
                    war to a game of skill. Battles became all but bloodless; diplomacy and tactics
                    superseded feats of arms and hard blows in pitched fields. In this way the
                    Italians lost their military vigour, and wars were waged by despots from their
                    cabinets, who pulled the strings of puppet captains in their pay. Nor were the
                    people only enfeebled for resistance to a real foe; the whole political spirit
                    of the race was demoralized. The purely selfish bond between condottieri and
                    their employers, whether princes or republics, involved intrigues and treachery,
                    checks and counterchecks, secret terror on the one hand and treasonable practice
                    on the other, which ended by making statecraft in Italy synonymous with
                    perfidy.</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit13newyrich/page/n497/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0913-0497-0478"/>
                <p>It must further be noticed that the rise of mercenaries was synchronous with a
                    change in the nature of Italian despotism. The tyrants, as we have already seen,
                    established themselves as captains of the people, vicars of the empire, vicars
                    for the church, leaders of the Guelf and Ghibelline parties. They were accepted
                    by a population eager for repose, who had merged old class distinctions in the
                    conflicts of preceding centuries. They rested in large measure on the favour of
                    the multitude, and pursued a policy of sacrificing to their interests the
                    nobles. It was natural that these self-made princes should seek to secure the
                    peace which they had promised in their cities, by freeing the people from
                    military service and disarming the aristocracy. As their tenure of power grew
                    firmer, they advanced dynastic claims, assumed titles, and took the style of
                    petty sovereigns. Their government became paternal; and, though there was no
                    limit to their cruelty when stung by terror, they used the purse rather than the
                    sword, bribery at home and treasonable intrigue abroad in preference to coercive
                    measures or open war. Thus was elaborated the type of despot which attained
                    completeness in Gian Galeazzo Visconti and Lorenzo de’ Medici. No longer a
                    tyrant of Ezzelino’s stamp, he reigned by intelligence and terrorism masked
                    beneath a smile. He substituted cunning and corruption for violence. The lesser
                    people tolerated him because he extended the power of their city and made it
                    beautiful with public buildings. The bourgeoisie, protected in their trade,
                    found it convenient to support him. The nobles, turned into courtiers, placemen,
                    diplomatists, and men of affairs, ended by preferring his authority to the
                    alternative of democratic institutions. A lethargy of well-being, broken only by
                    the pinch of taxation for war-costs, or by outbursts of frantic ferocity and
                    lust in the less calculating tyrants, descended on the population of cities
                    which had boasted of their freedom. Only Florence and Venice, at the close of
                    the period upon which we are now entering, maintained their republican
                    independence. And Venice was ruled by a close oligarchy; Florence was passing
                    from the hands of her oligarchs into the power of the Medicean merchants.</p>
                <p>Between the year 1305, when Clement V. settled at Avignon, and the year 1447,
                    when Nicholas V. re-established the papacy upon a solid basis at Rome, the
                    Italians approximated more nearly to self-government than at any other epoch of
                    their history. The conditions which have been described, of despotism, mercenary
                    warfare, and bourgeois prosperity, determined the character of this epoch, which
                    was also the period when the great achievements of the Renaissance were
                    prepared. At the end of this century and a half, five principal powers divided
                    the peninsula; and their confederated action during the next forty-five years
                    (1447-1492) secured for Italy a season of peace and brilliant prosperity. These
                    five powers were the kingdom of Naples, the duchy of Milan, the republic of
                    Florence, the republic of Venice, and the papacy. The subsequent events of
                    Italian history will be rendered most intelligible if at this point we trace the
                    development of these five constituents of Italian greatness separately.</p>
                <p>When Robert of Anjou died in 1343, he was succeeded by his grand-daughter Joan,
                    the childless wife of four successive husbands, Andrew of Hungary, Louis of
                    Taranto, James of Aragon, and Otto of Brunswick. Charles of Durazzo, the last
                    male scion of the Angevine house in Lower Italy, murdered Joan in 1382, and held
                    the kingdom for five years. Dying in 1387, he transmitted Naples to his son
                    Ladislaus, who had no children, and was followed in 1414 by his sister Joan II.
                    She too, though twice married, died without issue, having at one time adopted
                    Louis III. of Provence and his brother René, at another Alfonso V. of Aragon,
                    who inherited the crown of Sicily. After her death in February 1435, the kingdom
                    was fought for between René of Anjou and Alfonso, surnamed the Magnanimous. René
                    found supporters among the Italian princes, especially the Milanese Visconti,
                    who helped him to assert his claims with arms. During the war of succession
                    which ensued, Alfonso was taken prisoner by the Genoese fleet in August 1435,
                    and was sent a prisoner to Filippo Maria at Milan. Here he pleaded his own cause
                    so powerfully, and proved so incontestably the advantage which might ensue to
                    the Visconti from his alliance, if he held the regno, that he obtained his
                    release and recognition as king. From the end of the year 1435 Alfonso reigned
                    alone and undisturbed in Lower Italy, combining for the first time since the
                    year 1282 the crowns of Sicily and Naples. The former he held by inheritance,
                    together with that of Aragon. The latter he considered to be his by conquest.
                    Therefore, when he died in 1458, he bequeathed Naples to his natural son
                    Ferdinand, while Sicily and Aragon passed together to his brother John, and so
                    on to Ferdinand the Catholic. The twenty-three years of Alfonso’s reign were the
                    most prosperous and splendid period of South Italian history. He became an
                    Italian in taste and sympathy, entering with enthusiasm into the humanistic
                    ardour of the earlier Renaissance, encouraging men of letters at his court,
                    administering his kingdom on the principles of an enlightened despotism, and
                    lending his authority to establish that equilibrium in the peninsula upon which
                    the politicians of his age believed, not without reason, that Italian
                    independence might be secured.</p>
                <p>The last member of the Visconti family of whom we ] had occasion to speak was
                    Azzo, who bought the city in 1328 from Louis of Bavaria. His uncle Lucchino
                    succeeded, but was murdered in 1349 by a wife against whose life he had been
                    plotting. Lucchino’s brother John, archbishop of Milan, now assumed the lordship
                    of the city, and extended the power of the Visconti over Genoa and the whole of
                    North Italy, with the exception of Piedmont, Verona, Mantua, Ferrara, and
                    Venice. The greatness of the family dates from the reign of this masterful
                    prelate. He died in 1354, and his heritage was divided between three members of
                    his house, Matteo, Bernabo, and Galeazzo. In the next year Matteo, being judged
                    incompetent to rule, was assassinated by order of his brothers, who made an
                    equal partition of their subject cities,—Bernabo residing in Milan, Galeazzo in
                    Pavia. Galeazzo was the wealthiest and most magnificent Italian of his epoch. He
                    married his daughter Violante to our duke of Clarence, and his son Gian Galeazzo
                    to a daughter of King John of France. When he died in 1378, this son resolved to
                    reunite the domains of the Visconti; and, with this object in view, he plotted
                    and executed the murder of his uncle Bernabo. Gian Galeazzo thus became by one
                    stroke the most formidable of Italian despots. Immured in his castle at Pavia,
                    accumulating wealth by systematic taxation and methodical economy, he organized
                    the mercenary troops who eagerly took service under so good a paymaster; and, by
                    directing their operations from his cabinet, he threatened the whole of Italy
                    with conquest. The last scions of the Della Scala family still reigned in
                    Verona, the last Carraresi in Padua; the Estensi were powerful in Ferrara, the
                    Gonzaghi in Mantua. Gian Galeazzo, partly by force and partly by intrigue,
                    discredited these minor despots, pushed his dominion to the very verge of
                    Venice, and, having subjected Lombardy to his sway, proceeded to attack Tuscany.
                    Pisa and Perugia were threatened with extinction, and Florence dreaded the
                    advance of the Visconti arms, when the plague suddenly cut short his career of
                    treachery and conquest in the year 1402. Seven years before his death Gian
                    Galeazzo bought the title of duke of Milan and count of Pavia from <pb

                    xml:id="kp-eb0913-0498-0479"/> the emperor Wenceslaus, and there is no doubt
                    that he ⅛vas aiming at the sovereignty of Italy. But no sooner was he dead than
                    the essential weakness of an artificial state, built up by cunning and
                    perfidious policy, with the lid of bought troops, dignified by no dynastic
                    title, and jonsolidated by no sense of loyalty, became apparent. Gian Galeazzo’s
                    duchy was a masterpiece of mechanical contrivance, the creation of a scheming
                    intellect and lawless will. When the mind which had planned it was withdrawn, it
                    fell to pieces, and the very hands which had been used to build it helped to
                    scatter its fragments. The Visconti’s own generals, Facino Cane, Pandolfo
                    Malatesta, Jacopo dal Verme, Gabrino Fondulo, Ottobon Terzo, seized upon the
                    tyranny of several Lombard cities. In others the petty tyrants whom the Visconti
                    had uprooted reappeared. The Estensi recovered their grasp upon Ferrara, and the
                    Gonzaghi upon Mantua. Venice strengthened herself between the Adriatic and the
                    Alps. Florence reassumed her Tuscan hegemony. Other communes which still
                    preserved the shadow of independence, like Perugia and Bologna, began once more
                    to dream of republican freedom under their own leading families. Meanwhile Gian
                    Galeazzo had left two sons, Giovanni Maria and Filippo Maria. Giovanni, a
                    monster of cruelty and lust, was assassinated by some Milanese nobles in 1412;
                    and now Filippo set about rebuilding his father’s duchy. Herein he was aided by
                    the troops of Facino Cane, who, dying opportunely at this period, left
                    considerable wealth, a well-trained band of mercenaries, and a widow, Beatrice
                    di Tenda. Filippo married and then beheaded Beatrice after a mock trial for
                    adultery, having used her money'^and her influence in reuniting several subject
                    cities to the crown of Milan. He subsequently spent a long, suspicious, secret,
                    and incomprehensible career in the attempt to piece together Gian Galeazzo’s
                    Lombard state, and to carry out his schemes of Italian conquest. In this
                    endeavour he met with vigorous opponents. Venice and Florence, strong in the
                    strength of their resentful oligarchies, offered a determined resistance; nor
                    vzas Filippo equal in ability to his father. His infernal cunning often defeated
                    its own aims, checkmating him at the point of achievement by suggestions of
                    duplicity or terror. In the course of Filippo’s wars with Florence and Venice,
                    the greatest generals of this age were formed—Francesco Carmagnola, who was
                    beheaded between the columns at Venice in 1432; Niccolo Piccinino, who died at
                    Milan in 1444; and Francesco Sforza, who survived to seize his master’s heritage
                    in 1450. Son of Attendolo Sforza, this Francesco received the hand of Filippo’s
                    natural daughter, Bianca, as a reward for past service and a pledge of future
                    support. When the Visconti dynasty ended by the duke’s death in 1447, he
                    pretended to espouse the cause of the Milanese republic, which was then
                    reestablished; but he played his cards so subtly as to make himself, by the help
                    of Cosimo de’ Medici in Florence, duke <hi rend="italic">de facto</hi> if not
                    <hi rend="italic">de jure.</hi> Francesco Sforza was the only condottiero among
                    many aspiring to be tyrants who planted himself firmly on a throne of first-rate
                    importance. Once seated in the duchy of Milan, he displayed rare qualities as a
                    ruler; for he not only entered into the spirit of the age, which required
                    humanity and culture from a despot, but he also knew how to curb his desire for
                    territory. The conception of confederated Italy found in him a vigorous
                    supporter. Thus the limitation of the Milanese duchy under Filippo Maria
                    Visconti, and its consolidation under Francesco Sforza, were equally effectual
                    in preparing the balance of power to which Italian politics now tended.</p>
                <p>This balance could not have been established without the concurrent aid of
                    Florence. After the expulsion of the duke of Athens in 1343, and the great
                    plague of 1348, the Florentine proletariate rose up against the merchant
                    princes. This insurgence of the artisans, in a republic which had been
                    remodelled upon economical principles by Giano della Bella’s constitution of
                    1292, reached a climax in 1378, when the Ciompi rebellion placed the city for a
                    few years in the hands of the Lesser Arts. The revolution was but temporary, and
                    was rather a symptom of democratic tendencies in the state than the sign of any
                    capacity for government on the part of the working classes. The necessities of
                    war and foreign affairs soon placed Florence in the power of an oligarchy headed
                    by the great Albizzi family. They fought the battles of the republic with
                    success against the Visconti, and widely extended the Florentine domain over the
                    Tuscan cities. During their season of ascendency Pisa was enslaved, and Florence
                    gained the access to the sea. But throughout this period a powerful opposition
                    was gathering strength. It was led by the Medici, who sided with the common
                    people, and increased their political importance by the accumulation and wise
                    employment of vast ^commercial wealth. In 1433 the Albizzi and the Medici came
                    to open strife. Cosimo de’ Medici, the chief of the opposition, was exiled to
                    Venice. In the next year he returned, assumed the presidency of the democratic
                    party, and by a system of corruption and popularity-hunting, combined with the
                    patronage of arts and letters, established himself as the real but
                    unacknowledged dictator of the commonwealth. Cosimo abandoned the policy of his
                    predecessors. Instead of opposing Francesco Sforza in Milan, he lent him his
                    prestige and influence, foreseeing that the dynastic future of his own family
                    and the pacification of Italy might be secured by a balance of power in which
                    Florence should rank on equal terms with Milan and Naples.</p>
                <p>The republic of Venice differed essentially from any other state in Italy; and
                    her history was so separate that, up to this point, it would have been needless
                    to interrupt the narrative by tracing it. Venice, however, in the 14th century
                    took her place at last as an Italian power on an equality at least with the very
                    greatest. The constitution of the commonwealth had slowly matured itself through
                    a series of revolutions, which confirmed and defined a type of singular
                    stability. During the earlier days of the republic the doge had been a prince
                    elected by the people, and answerable only to the popular assemblies. In 1032 he
                    was obliged to act in concert with a senate, called <hi rend="italic"
                    >pre-gadi∖</hi> andin 1172 the grand council, which became the real sovereign of
                    the state, was formed. The several steps whereby the members of the grand
                    council succeeded in eliminating the people from a share in the government, and
                    reducing the doge to the position of their ornamental representative, cannot
                    here be described. It must suffice to say that these changes culminated in 1297,
                    w∙hen an act was passed for closing the grand council, or in other words for
                    confining it to a fixed number of privileged families, in whom the government
                    was henceforth vested by hereditary right. This ratification of the oligarchical
                    principle, together with the establishment in 1311 of the Council ρ∙f Ten,
                    completed that famous constitution which endured till the extinction of the
                    republic in 1797. Meanwhile, throughout the Middle Ages, it had been the policy
                    of Venice to refrain from conquests on the Italian mainland, and to confine her
                    energies to commerce in the East. The first entry of any moment made by the
                    Venetians into strictly Italian affairs was in 1336, when the republics of
                    Florence and St Mark allied themselves against Mastino della Scala, and the
                    latter took possession of Treviso. After this, for thirty years, between 1352
                    and 1381, Venice and Genoa contested the supremacy of the Mediterranean. Pisa’s
                    maritime power having been extinguished in the battle of Meloria (1284), the two
                    <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit13newyrich/page/n499/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0913-0499-0480"/> surviving republics had no rivals. They fought
                    their duel out upon the Bosphorus, off Sardinia, and in the Morea, with various
                    success. From the first great encounter, in 1355, Venice retired well-nigh
                    exhausted, and Genoa was so crippled that she placed herself under the
                    protection of the Visconti. The second and decisive battle was fought upon the
                    Adriatic. The Genoese fleet under Luciano Doria defeated the Venetians off Pola
                    in 1379, and sailed without opposition to Chioggia, which was stormed and taken.
                    Thus the Venetians found themselves blockaded in their own lagoons. Meanwhile a
                    fleet was raised for their relief by Carlo Zeno in the Levant, and the admiral
                    Vittore Pisani, who had been imprisoned after the defeat at Pola, was released
                    to lead their forlorn hope from the city side. The Genoese in their turn were
                    now blockaded in Chioggia, and forced by famine to surrender. The losses of men
                    and money which the war of Chioggia, as it was called, entailed, though they did
                    not immediately depress the spirit of the Genoese republic, signed her naval
                    ruin. During this second struggle to the death with Genoa, the Venetians had
                    been also at strife with the Carraresi of Padua and the Scaligers of Verona. In
                    1406, after the extinction of these princely houses they added Verona, Vicenza,
                    and Padua to the territories they claimed on <hi rend="italic">terra</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">firma.</hi> Their career of conquest, and their new policy of
                    forming Italian alliances and entering into the management of Italian affairs,
                    were confirmed by the long dogeship of Francesco Foscari (1423-1457), who must
                    rank with Alfonso, Cosimo de’ Medici, Francesco Sforza, and Nicholas V., as a
                    joint-founder of confederated Italy. When Constantinople fell in 1453, the old
                    ties between Venice and the Eastern empire were broken, and she now entered on a
                    wholly new phase of her history. Ranking as one of the five Italian powers, she
                    was also destined to defend Western Christendom against the encroachments of the
                    Turk in Europe.</p>
                <p>By their settlement in Avignon, the popes relinquished their protectorate of
                    Italian liberties, and lost their position as Italian potentates. Rienzi’s
                    revolution in Rome (1347-1354), and his establishment of a republic upon a
                    fantastic basis, half classical half feudal, proved the temper of the times;
                    while the rise of dynastic families in the cities of the church, claiming the
                    title of papal vicars, but acting in their own interests, weakened the authority
                    of the Holy See. The predatory expeditions of Bertrand du Poiet and Robert of
                    Geneva were as ineffective as the descents of the emperors; and, though the
                    cardinal Albornoz conquered Romagna and the March in 1364, the legates who
                    resided in those districts were not long able to hold them against their
                    despots. At last Gregory XI. returned to Rome; and Urban VI., elected in 1378,
                    put a final end to the Avignonian exile. Still the Great Schism, which now
                    distracted western Christendom, so enfeebled the papacy, and kept the Roman
                    pontiffs so engaged in ecclesiastical disputes, that they had neither power nor
                    leisure to occupy themselves seriously with their temporal affairs. The
                    threatening presence of the two princely houses of Orsini and Colonna, alike
                    dangerous as friends or foes, rendered Rome an unsafe residence. Even when the
                    schism was nominally terminated in 1415 by the council of Constance, the next
                    two popes held but a precarious grasp upon their Italian domains. Martin V.
                    (1417-1431) resided principally at Florence. Eugenius IV. (1431-1447) followed
                    his example. And what Martin managed to regain Eugenius lost. At the same time,
                    the change^which had now come over Italian politics, the desire on all sides for
                    a settlement, and the growing conviction that a federation was necessary, proved
                    advantageous to the popes as sovereigns. They gradually entered into the spirit
                    of their age, assumed the style of despots, and made use of the humanistic
                    movement, then at its height, to place themselves in a new relation to Italy.
                    The election of Nicholas V. in 1447 determined this revolution in the papacy,
                    and opened a period of temporal splendour, which ended with the establishment of
                    the popes as sovereigns. Thomas of Sarzana was a distinguished humanist. Humbly
                    born, he had been tutor in the house of the Albizzi, and afterwards librarian of
                    the Medici at Florence, where he imbibed the politics together with the culture
                    of the Renaissance. Soon after assuming the tiara, he found himself without a
                    rival in the church; for the schism ended by Felix V.’s resignation in 1449.
                    Nicholas fixed his residence in Rome, which he began to rebuild and to fortify,
                    determining to render the Eternal City once more a capital worthy of its high
                    place in Europe. The Romans were flattered; and, though his reign was disturbed
                    by republican conspiracy, Nicholas V. was able before his death in 1455 to
                    secure the modern status of the pontiff as a splendid patron and a wealthy
                    temporal potentate.</p>
                <p>Italy was now for a brief space independent. The humanistic movement had created
                    a common culture, a common language, and sense of common nationality. The five
                    great powers, with their satellites—dukes of Savoy and Urbino, marquises of
                    Ferrara and Mantua, republics of Bologna, Perugia, Siena—were constituted. All
                    political institutions tended toward despotism. The Medici became yearly more
                    indispensable to Florence, the Bentivogli more autocratic in Bologna, the
                    Baglioni in Perugia; and even Siena was ruled by the Petrucci. But this
                    despotism was of a mild type. The princes were Italians; they shared the common
                    enthusiasms of the nation for art, learning, literature, and science; they
                    studied how to mask their tyranny with arts agreeable to the multitude. When
                    Italy had reached this point, Constantinople was taken by the Turks. On all
                    sides it was felt that the Italian alliance must be tightened; and one of the
                    last, best acts of Nicholas V.’s pontificate was the appeal in 1453 to the five
                    great powers in federation. As regards their common opposition to the Turk, this
                    appeal led to nothing; but it marked the growth of a new Italian
                    consciousness.'</p>
                <p>Between 1453 and 1492 Italy continued to be prosperous and tranquil. Nearly all
                    wars during this period were undertaken either to check the growing power of
                    Venice or to further the ambition of the papacy. Having become despots, the
                    popes sought to establish their relatives in principalities. The word nepotism
                    acquired new significance in the reigns of Sixtus IV. and Innocent VIII. Though
                    the country was convulsed by no great struggle, these forty years witnessed a
                    truly appalling increase of political crime. To be a prince was tantamount to
                    being the mark of secret conspiracy and assassination. Among the most noteworthy
                    examples of such attempts may be mentioned the revolt of the barons against
                    Ferdinand I. of Naples (1464), the murder of Galeazzo Maria Sforza at Milan
                    (1476), and the plot of the Pazzi to destroy the Medici (1478). After Cosimo
                    de’Medici’s death in 1464, the presidency of the Florentine republic passed to
                    his son Piero, who left it in 1469 to his sons Lorenzo and Giuliano. These
                    youths assumed the style of princes, and it was against their lives that the
                    Pazzi, with the sanction of Sixtus IV., aimed their blow. Giuliano was murdered.
                    Lorenzo escaped, to tighten his grasp upon the city, which now loved him and was
                    proud of him. During the following fourteen years of his brilliant career, he
                    made himself absolute master of Florence, and so modified her institutions that
                    the Medici were henceforth necessary to the state. Apprehending the importance
                    of Italian federation, Lorenzo, by his personal tact and prudent leadership of
                    the republic, secured peace and a common intelligence between the five powers.

                    VIII., which procured his son Giovanni’s elevation to the cardinalate, and
                    involved two Medicean papacies and the future dependence of Florence upon
                    Rome.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Age of Invasions.</hi> i The year 1492 opened a new age for
                    Italy. In this year Lorenzo died, and was succeeded by his son, the vain and
                    weak Piero; France passed beneath the personal control of the inexperienced
                    Charles VIII.; the fall of Granada freed Spain from her embarrassments; Columbus
                    discovered America, destroying the commercial supremacy of Venice; last, but not
                    least, Roderigo Borgia assumed the tiara with the famous title of Alexander VI.
                    In this year the short-lived federation of the five powers was shaken, and Italy
                    was once more drawn into the vortex of European affairs. The events which led to
                    this disaster may be briefly told. After Galeazzo Maria’s assassination, his
                    crown passed to a boy, Gian Galeazzo, who was in due course married to a
                    grand-daughter of Ferdinand I. of Naples. But the government of Milan remained
                    in the hands of this youth’s uncle, Lodovico, surnamed II Moro. Lodovico
                    resolved to become duke of Milan. The king of Naples was his natural enemy, and
                    he had cause to suspect that Piero de’ Medici might abandon his alliance.
                    Feeling himself alone, with no right to the title he was bent on seizing, he had
                    recourse to Charles VIII. of France, whom he urged to make good his claim to the
                    kingdom of Naples. This claim, it may be said in passing, rested on the will of
                    King René of Anjou. After some hesitation, Charles agreed to invade Italy. He
                    crossed the Alps in 1494, passed through Lombardy, entered Tuscany, freed Pisa
                    from the yoke of Florence, witnessed the expulsion of the Medici, marched to
                    Naples, and was crowned there;—all this without striking a blow. Meanwhile
                    Lodovico procured his nephew’s death, and raised a league against the French in
                    Lombardy. Charles hurried back from Naples, and narrowly escaped destruction at
                    Fornovo in the passes of the Apennines. He made good his retreat, however, and
                    returned to France in 1495. Little remained to him of his light acquisitions;
                    but he had convulsed Italy by this invasion, destroyed her equilibrium, exposed
                    her military weakness and political disunion, and revealed her wealth to greedy
                    and more powerful nations.</p>
                <p>The princes of the house of Aragon, now represented by Frederick, a son of
                    Ferdinand I., returned to Naples. Florence made herself a republic, adopting a
                    form of constitution analogous to that of Venice. At this crisis she was ruled
                    by the monk Girolamo Savonarola, who inspired the people with a thirst for
                    freedom, preached the necessity of reformation, and placed himself in direct
                    antagonism to Rome. After a short but eventful career, the influence of which
                    was long effective, he lost his hold upon the citizens. Alexander VI. procured a
                    mock trial, and his enemies burned him upon the Piazza in 1498. In this year
                    Louis XII. succeeded Charles VIII. upon the throne of France. As duke of Orleans
                    he had certain claims to Milan through his grandmother Valentina, daughter of
                    Gian Galeazzo, the first duke. They were not valid, for the investiture of the
                    duchy had been granted only to male heirs. But they served as a sufficient
                    pretext, and in 1499 Louis entered and subdued the Milanese. Lodovico escaped to
                    Germany, returned the next year, was betrayed by his Swiss mercenaries, and sent
                    to die at Loches in France. In 1501 Louis made the blunder of calling Ferdinand
                    the Catholic to help him in the conquest of Naples. By a treaty signed at
                    Granada, the French and Spanish kings were to divide the spoil. The conquest was
                    easy; but, when it came to a partition, Ferdinand played his ally false. He made
                    himself supreme over the Two Sicilies, which he now reunited under a single
                    crown. Three years later, unlessoned by this experience, Louis signed the treaty
                    of Blois (1504), whereby he invited the emperor Maximilian to aid ħim in the
                    subjugation of Venice. No policy could have been less far-sighted; for Charles
                    V., joint heir to Austria, Burgundy, Castile, and Aragon, the future
                    overwhelming rival of France, was already born.</p>
                <p>The stage was now prepared, and all the actors who were destined to accomplish
                    the ruin of Italy trod it with their armies. Spain, France, Germany, with their
                    Swiss auxiliaries, had been summoned upon various pretexts to partake her
                    provinces. Then, too late, patriots like Machiavelli perceived the suicidal
                    self-indulgence of the past, which, by substituting mercenary troops for
                    national militias, left the Italians at the absolute discretion of their
                    neighbours. Whatever parts the Italians themselves played in the succeeding
                    quarter of a century, the game was in the hands of French, Spanish, and German
                    invaders. Meanwhile, no scheme for combination against common foes arose in the
                    peninsula. Each petty potentate strove for his own private advantage in the
                    confusion; and at this epoch the chief gains accrued to the papacy. Aided by his
                    terrible son, Cesare Borgia, Alexander VI. chastised the Roman nobles, subdued
                    Romagna and the March, threatened Tuscany, and seemed to be upon the point of
                    creating a Central Italian state in favour of his progeny, when he died suddenly
                    in 1503. His conquests reverted to the Holy See. Julius II., his bitterest enemy
                    and powerful successor, continued Alexander’s policy, but no longer in the
                    interest of his own relatives. It became the nobler ambition of Julius to
                    aggrandize the church, and to reassume the protectorate of the Italian people.
                    With this object, he secured Emilia, carried his victorious arms against
                    Ferrara, and curbed the tyranny of the Baglioni in Perugia. Julius II. played a
                    perilous game; but the stakes were high, and he fancied himself strong enough to
                    guide the tempest he evoked. Quarrelling with the Venetians in 1508, he combined
                    the forces of all Europe by the league of Cambray against them; and, when he had
                    succeeded in his first purpose of humbling them even to the dust, he turned
                    round in 1510, uttered his famous resolve to expel the barbarians from Italy,
                    and pitted the Spaniards against the French. It was with the Swiss that he hoped
                    to effect this revolution; but the Swiss, now interfering for the first time as
                    principals in Italian affairs, were incapable of more than adding to the already
                    maddening distractions of the people. Formed for mercenary warfare, they proved
                    a perilous instrument in the hands of those who used them, and were hardly less
                    injurious to their friends than to their foes. In 1512 the battle of Ravenna
                    between the French troops and the allies of Julius,—Spaniards, Venetians, and
                    Swiss,—was fought. Gaston de Foix bought a doubtful victory dearly with his
                    death; and the allies, though beaten on the banks of the Ronco, immediately
                    afterwards expelled the French from Lombardy. Yet Julius II. had failed, as
                    might have been foreseen. He only exchanged one set of foreign masters for
                    another, and taught a new barbarian race how pleasant were the plains of Italy.
                    As a <hi rend="superscript"> v</hi> consequence of the battle of Ravenna, the
                    Medici returned in 1512 to Florence.</p>
                <p>When Leo X. was elected in 1513, Rome and Florence rejoiced; but Italy had no
                    repose. Louis XII. had lost the game, and the Spaniards were triumphant. But new
                    actors appeared upon the scene, and the same old struggle was resumed with
                    fiercer energy. By the victory of Marignano in 1515 Francis I., having now
                    succeeded to the throne of France, regained the Milanese, and broke the power of
                    the Swiss, who held it for Massimiliano Sforza, the titular duke. Leo for a
                    while relied on Francis; for the vast <hi rend="smallcaps">do</hi> wer of

                    xml:id="kp-eb0913-0501-0482"/> in 1519, as in 1516 he had succeeded to the
                    crowns of Spain and Lower Italy, threatened the whole of Europe. It was Leo’s
                    nature, however, to be inconstant. In 1521 he changed sides, allied himself to
                    Charles, and died after hearing that the imperial troops had again expelled the
                    French from Milan. During the next four years the Franco-Spanish war dragged on
                    in Lombardy until the decisive battle of Pavia in 1525, when Francis was taken
                    prisoner, and Italy lay open to the Spanish armies. Meanwhile Leo X. had been
                    followed by Adrian VI., and Adrian by Clement VII., of the house of Medici, who
                    had long ruled Florence. In the reign of this pope Francis was released from his
                    prison in Madrid (1526), and Clement hoped that he might still be used in the
                    Italian interest as a counterpoise to Charles. It is impossible in this place to
                    follow the tangled intrigues of that period. The year 1527 was signalized by the
                    famous sack of Rome. An army of mixed German and Spanish troops, pretending to
                    act for the emperor, but which may rather be regarded as a vast marauding party,
                    entered Italy under their leader Frundsberg. After his death, the Constable de
                    Bourbon took command of them; they marched slowly down, aided by the marquis of
                    Ferrara, and unopposed by the duke of Urbino, reached Rome, and took it by
                    assault. The constable was killed in the first onslaught; Clement was imprisoned
                    in the castle of St Angelo; Rome was abandoned to the rage of 30,000 ruffians.
                    As an immediate result of this catastrophe, Florence shook off the Medici, and
                    established a republic. But Clement, having made peace with the emperor, turned
                    the remnants of the army which had sacked Rome against his native city. After a
                    desperate resistance, Florence fell in 1530. Alessandro de’ Medici was placed
                    there with the title of duke of Cività di Penna; and, on his murder in 1537,
                    Cosimo de’ Medici, of the younger branch of the ruling' house, was made duke.
                    Acting as lieutenant for the Spaniards, he subsequently (1555) subdued Siena,
                    and bequeathed to his descendants the grand-duchy of Tuscany.</p>

                <p>It was high time, after the sack of Rome in 1527, that Charles V. should
                    undertake Italian affairs. The country was exposed to anarchy, of which this had
                    been the last and most disgraceful example. The Turks were threatening Western
                    Europe, and Luther was inflaming Germany. By the treaty of Barcelona in 1529 the
                    pope and emperor made terms. By that of Cambray in the same year France
                    relinquished Italy to Spain. Charles then entered the port of Genoa, and on the
                    5th of November met Clement VΠ. at Bologna. He there received the imperial
                    crown, and summoned the Italian princes for a settlement of all disputed claims.
                    Francesco Sforza, the last and childless heir of the ducal house, was left in
                    Milan till his death, which happened in 1535. The republic of Venice was
                    respected in her liberties and Lombard territories. The Este family received a
                    confirmation of their duchy of Modena and Reggio, and were invested in their
                    fief of Ferrara by the pope. The marquisate of Mantua was made a duchy; and
                    Florence was secured, as we have seen, to the Medici. The great gainer by this
                    settlement was the papacy, which held the most substantial Italian province,
                    together with a prestige that raised it far above all rivalry. The rest of
                    Italy, however parcelled, henceforth became but a dependence upon Spain. Charles
                    V., it must be remembered, achieved his conquest and confirmed his authority far
                    less as emperor than as the heir of Castile and Aragon. A Spanish viceroy in
                    Milan and another in Naples, supported by Rome and by the minor princes who
                    followed the policy dictated to them from Madrid, were sufficient to preserve
                    the whole peninsula in a state of somnolent inglorious servitude.</p>
                <p>From 1530 until 1796, that is, for a period of nearly three centuries, the
                    Italians had no history of their own. Their annals are filled with records of
                    dynastic changes and redistributions of territory, consequent upon treaties
                    signed by foreign powers, in the settlement of quarrels which no wise concerned
                    the people. Italy only too often became the theatre of desolating and
                    distracting wars. But these wars were fought for the most part by alien armies;
                    the points at issue were decided beyond the Alps; the gains accrued to royal
                    families whose names were unpronounceable by southern tongues. The affairs of
                    Europe during the years when Hapsburg and Bourbon fought their domestic battles
                    with the blood of noble races may teach grave lessons to all thoughtful men of
                    our days, but none bitterer, none fraught with more insulting recollections,
                    than to the Italian people, who w∙ere haggled over like dumb driven cattle in
                    the mart of chaffering kings. We cannot wholly acquit the Italians of their
                    share of blame. When they might have won national independence, after their
                    warfare with the Swabian emperors, they let the golden opportunity slip.
                    Pampered with commercial prosperity, eaten to the core with inter-urban
                    rivalries, they submitted to despots, renounced the use of arms, and offered
                    themselves, in the hour of need, defenceless and disunited to the shock of
                    puissant nations. That they had created modern civilization for Europe availed
                    them nothing. Italy, intellectually first among the peoples, was now politically
                    and practically last; and nothing to her historian is more heart-rending than to
                    watch the gradual extinction of her spirit in this age of slavery.</p>
                <p>In 1534 Alessandro Farnese, who owed his elevation to his sister Giulia, one of
                    Alexander VI.’s mistresses, took the tiara with the title of Paul III. It was
                    his ambition to create a duchy for his family; and with this object he gave
                    Parma and Piacenza to his son Pier Luigi. After much wrangling between the
                    French and Spanish parties, the duchy was confirmed in 1586 to Ottaviano Farnese
                    and his son Alessandro, better known as Philip H.’s general, the prince of
                    Parma. Alessandro’s descendants reigned in Parma and Piacenza till the year
                    1731. Paul III.’s pontificate was further marked by important changes in the
                    church, all of which confirmed the spiritual autocracy of Rome. In 1540 this
                    pope approved of Loyola’s foundation, and secured the powerful militia of the
                    Jesuit order. The Inquisition was established with almost unlimited powers in
                    Italy, and the press was placed under its jurisdiction. Thus free thought
                    received a check, by which not only ecclesiastical but political tyrants knew
                    how to profit. Henceforth it was impossible to publish or to utter a word which
                    might offend the despots of church or state; and the Italians had to amuse their
                    leisure with the polite triflings of academics. In 1545 a council was opened at
                    Trent for the reformation of church discipline and the promulgation of orthodox
                    doctrine. The decrees of this council defined Roman Catholicism against the
                    Reformation; and, while failing to regenerate morality, they enforced a
                    hypocritical observance of public decency. Italy to outer view put forth
                    blossoms of hectic and hysterical piety, though at the core her clergy and her
                    aristocracy were more corrupt than ever.</p>
                <p>In 1556 Philip II., by the abdication of his father Charles V., became king of
                    Spain. He already wore the crown of the Two Sicilies, and ruled the duchy of
                    Milan. In the next year Ferdinand, brother of Charles, was elected emperor. The
                    French, meanwhile, had not entirely abandoned their claims on Italy. Gian Pietro
                    Caraffa, who was made pope in 1555 with the name of Paul IV., endeavoured to
                    revive the ancient papal policy of leaning upon France. He encouraged the duke
                    of Guise to undertake the conquest of Naples, as Charles of Anjou had been <pb
                    break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit13newyrich/page/n502/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0913-0502-0483"/> summoned by his predecessors. But such schemes
                    were now obsolete and anachronistic. They led to a languid lingering Italian
                    campaign, which was settled far beyond the Alps by Philip’s victories over the
                    French at St Quentin and Gravelines. The peace of Câteau Caιnbresis, signed in
                    1559, left the Spanish monarch undisputed lord of Italy. Of free commonwealths
                    there now survived only Venice, which, together with Spain, achieved for Europe
                    the victory of Lepanto in 1573; Genoa, which, after the ineffectual Fieschi
                    revolution in 1547, abode beneath the rule of the great Doria family, and held a
                    feeble sway in Corsica; and the two insignificant republics of Lucca and San
                    Marino.</p>
                <p>The future hope of Italy, however, was growing in a remote and hitherto neglected
                    corner. A clause in the treaty of Câteau Cambresis recognized the right of
                    Emmanuele Filiberto, duke of Savoy, to Piedmont. He owed this recognition, as
                    Alessandro owed his duchy of Parma, to the fact that he was one of Philip’s
                    bravest generals. Yet Emmanuele Filiberto represented the oldest and not the
                    least illustrious reigning house in Europe, and his descendants were destined to
                    achieve for Italy the independence which no other power or prince had given her
                    since the fall of ancient Rome. It is therefore needful at this point to trace
                    the history cf the counts of Savoy from the date of their first emergence on the
                    stage of Italian politics.</p>
                <p>In the 10th century the founders of the house of Savoy were masters over Burgundy
                    and Western Lombardy. Their provinces stretched beyond what is now called Savoy
                    on the west and north, and southward touched the Mediterranean at Savona. In the
                    course of the next two centuries the family divided. Its elder branch ruled
                    Savoy and the northern shores of Lake Geneva. The younger line held Piedmont
                    with the city of Turin for capital. The former were frequently at war with the
                    dauphins of Vienne and the house of Hapsburg, seeking to extend their domains in
                    the direction of Switzerland and Provence. The latter proved but ill neighbours
                    to the marquises of Montferrat and Saluzzo. When the first league of the Swiss
                    was formed, the counts of Savoy were vigorously driven back within their
                    northern borders. At the same time the powers of France repelled them from
                    Provence. Entrenched within their mountains, they now looked towards Italy for
                    expansion. This southward growth of a state which had hitherto been undefined
                    between its cisalpine and transalpine provinces was further determined by the
                    union of the two branches of the family in the person of Amadeus Λ <hi
                    rend="superscript"> r</hi> III. Succeeding to the honours of the elder line in
                    1391, he joined Piedmont to Savoy in 1418, and received the title of duke from
                    the emperor Sigismund. During his lifetime he annexed Saluzzo, took Chivasso
                    from Montferrat, and received Vercelli from Filippo Maria Visconti. Nice had
                    already joined itself to Savoy in 1388. The duchy of Savoy, checked in its
                    development upon the further side of the Alpine barrier, gained in solidity and
                    extent upon the south, and took rank definitely from this time forward as a
                    considerable Italian power. Amadeus was one of the most remarkable personages of
                    his day. Having built up the fortunes of his house by diplomatic ability in an
                    age of policy and intrigue, he abdicated in 1434, and went into cloistral
                    retirement at Ripaille. Hence he emerged in 1440 to receive the papal tiara from
                    the council of Basel. He took the name of Felix V., but resigned in 1449,
                    leaving Nicholas V. sole pope. When he died in 1451, he had reigned for
                    sixty-one years as count, duke, prior of a hermit convent, anti-pope, and dean
                    of the Holy College. The immediate successors of Amadeus VIII. undid a great
                    deal of his work. They entered into unprofitable warfare with Geneva, Freiburg,
                    Bern, and Vaud, and were still further shorn of territory and prestige upon the
                    side of Switzerland. The French invaded Savoy, and their Lombard domains became
                    the theatre of the Franco-Spanish wars. When Emmanuele Filiberto succeeded to
                    his father Charles III. in 1553, he was a duke without a duchy. But the princes
                    of the house of Savoy were a race of warriors; and what Emmanuele Filiberto lost
                    as sovereign he regained as captain of adventure in the service of his cousin
                    Philip II. The treaty of Câteau Cambresis in 1559, and the evacuation of the
                    Piedmontese cities held by French and Spanish troops in 1574, restored his
                    state. By removing the capital from Chambéry to Turin, he completed the
                    transformation of the dukes of Savoy from Burgundian into Italian sovereigns.
                    They still owned Savoy beyond the Alps, the plains of Bresse, and the maritime
                    province of Nice.</p>
                <p>Emmanuele Filiberto was succeeded by his son Carlo Emmanuele I., who married
                    Catherine, a daughter of Philip II. He seized the first opportunity of annexing
                    Saluzzo, which had been lost to Savoy in the last two reigns, and renewed the
                    disastrous policy of his grandfather Charles III. by invading Geneva and
                    threatening Provence. Henry IV. of France forced him in 1601 to relinquish
                    Bresse and his Burgundian possessions. In return he was allowed to keep Saluzzo.
                    All hopes of conquest on the transalpine side were now quenched; but the keys of
                    Italy had been given to the dukes of Savoy; and their attention was still
                    further concentrated upon Lombard conquests. Carlo Emmanuele now attempted the
                    acquisition of Montferrat, which was soon to become vacant by the death of
                    Francesco Gonzaga, who held it together with Mantua. In order to secure this
                    territory, he went to war with Philip III. of Spain, and allied himself with
                    Venice and the Grisons to expel the Spaniards from the Valtelline. When the male
                    line of the Gonzaga family expired in 1627, Charles, duke of Nevers, claimed
                    Mantua and Montferrat in right of his wife, the only daughter of the last duke.
                    Carlo Emmanuele was now checkmated by France, as he had formerly been by Spain.
                    The total gains of all his strenuous endeavours amounted to the acquisition of a
                    few places on the borders of Montferrat.</p>
                <p>Not only the Gonzagas, but several other ancient ducal families, died out about
                    the date which we have reached. The legitimate line of the Estensi ended in 1597
                    by the death of Alfonso II., the last duke of Ferrara. He left his domains to a
                    natural relative, Cesare d’Este, who would in earlier days have inherited
                    without dispute, for bastardy had been no bar on more than one occasion in the
                    Este pedigree. L <hi rend="superscript"> τ</hi> rban VIII., however, put in a
                    claim to Ferrara, which, it will be remembered, had been recognized a papal fief
                    in 1530. Cesare d’Este had to content himself with Modena and Reggio, where his
                    descendants reigned as dukes till 1794. Linder the same pontiff, the Holy See
                    absorbed the duchy of Urbino on the death of Francesco Maria II., the last
                    representative of Montefeltro and Della Rovere. The popes were now masters of a
                    fine and compact territory, embracing no inconsiderable portion of Countess
                    Matilda’s legacy, in addition to Pippin’s donation and the patrimony of St
                    Peter. Meanwhile Spanish fanaticism, the suppression of the Huguenots in France,
                    and the Catholic policy of Austria combined to strengthen their authority as
                    pontiffs. Urban’s predecessor, Paul V., advanced so far as to extend his
                    spiritual jurisdiction over Venice, which, up to the date of his election
                    (1605), had resisted all encroachments of the Holy See. Venice offered the
                    single instance in Italy of a national church. The republic managed the tithes,
                    and the clergy acknowledged no chief above their own patriarch. Paul V. now
                    forced the Venetians to admit his ecclesiastical supremacy; but they refused to
                    readmit the Jesuits, who had been expelled in 1606. This, if we do not count the
                    proclamation of <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0913-0503-0484"/> James I. of England (1604), was the earliest
                    instance of the order’s banishment from a state where it had proved disloyal to
                    the commonwealth.</p>
                <p>Venice rapidly declined throughout the 17th century. The loss of trade consequent
                    upon the closing of Egypt and the Levant, together with the discovery of America
                    and the sea-route to the Indies, had dried up her chief source of wealth.
                    Prolonged warfare with the Ottomans, who forced her to abandon Candia in 1669,
                    as they had robbed her of Cyprus in 1570, still further crippled her resources.
                    Yet she kept the Adriatic free of pirates, notably by suppressing the
                    sea-robbers called Uscocchi (1601—1617), maintained herself in the Ionian
                    Islands, and in 1684 added one more to the series of victorious episodes which
                    render her annals so romantic. In that year Francesco Morosini, upon whose tomb
                    we still may read the title Peloponnesiacus, wrested the whole of the Morea from
                    the Turks. But after his death in 1715 the republic relaxed her hold upon his
                    conquests. The Venetian nobles abandoned themselves to indolence and vice. Many
                    of them fell into the slough of pauperism, and were saved from starvation by
                    public doles. Though the signory still made a brave show upon occasions of
                    parade, it was clear that the state was rotten to the core, and sinking into the
                    decrepitude of dotage. The Spanish monarchy at the same epoch dwindled with
                    apparently less reason. Philip’s Austrian successors reduced it to the rank of a
                    secondary European power. This decline of vigour was felt, with the customary
                    effects of discord and bad government, in Lower Italy. The revolt of Masaniello
                    in Naples (1647), followed by rebellions at Palermo and Messina, which placed
                    Sicily for a while in the hands of Louis XIV. (1676—1678), were symptoms of
                    progressive anarchy. The population, ground down by preposterous taxes, ill-used
                    as only the subjects of Spaniards, Turks, or Bourbons are handled, rose in blind
                    exasperation against their oppressors. It is impossible to attach political
                    importance to these revolutions; nor did they bring the people any appreciable
                    good. The destinies of Italy'were decided in the cabinets and on the
                    battlefields of Northern Europe. A Bourbon at Versailles, a Hapsburg at Vienna,
                    or a thick-lipped Lorrainer, with a stroke of his pen, wrote off province
                    against province, regarding not the populations who had bled for him or thrown
                    themselves upon his mercy.</p>
                <p>This inglorious and passive chapter of Italian history is continued to the date
                    of the French Revolution with the records of three dynastic wars, the war of the
                    Spanish succession, the war of the Polish succession, the war of the Austrian
                    succession, followed by three European treaties, which brought them respectively
                    to diplomatic terminations. Italy, handled .nd rehandled, settled and resettled,
                    upon each of these occasions, changed masters without caring or knowing what
                    befel the principals in any one of the disputes. Humiliating to human nature in
                    general as are the annals of the 18th century campaigns in Europe, there is no
                    point of view from which they appear in a light so tragi-comic as from that
                    afforded by Italian history. The system of setting nations by the ears with the
                    view of settling the quarrels of a few reigning houses was reduced to absurdity
                    when the people, as in these cases, came to be partitioned and exchanged without
                    the assertion or negation of a single principle affecting their interests or
                    rousing their emotions.</p>
                <p>In 1700 Charles II. died, and with him ended the Austrian family in Spain. Louis
                    XIV. claimed the throne for Philip, duke of Anjou. Charles, archduke of Austria,
                    opposed him. The dispute was fought out in Flanders; but Lombardy felt the
                    shock, as usual, of the French and Austrian dynasties. The French armies were
                    more than once defeated by Prince Eugene of Savoy, who drove them out of Italy
                    in 1707. Therefore, in the peace of Utrecht (1713), the services of the house of
                    Savoy had to be duly recognized. Vittorio Amedeo II. received Sicily with the
                    title of king. Montferrat and Alessandria were added to his northern provinces,
                    and his state was recognized as independent. Charles of Austria, now emperor,
                    took Milan, Mantua, Naples, and Sardinia for his portion of the Italian spoil
                    Philip founded the Bourbon line of Spanish kings, renouncing in Italy all that
                    his Hapsburg predecessors had gained. Discontented with this diminution of the
                    Spanish heritage, Philip V. married Elisabetta Farnese, heiress to the last duke
                    of Parma, in 1714. He hoped to secure this duchy for his son, Don Carlos; and
                    Elisabetta further brought with her a claim to the grand-duchy of Tuscany, which
                    would soon become vacant by the death of Gian Gastone de’ Medici. After this
                    marriage Philip broke the peace of Europe by invading Sardinia. The Quadruple
                    Alliance was formed, and the new king of Sicily was punished for his supposed
                    adherence to Philip V. by the forced exchange of Sicily for the island of
                    Sardinia. It was thus that in 1720 the house of Savoy assumed the regal title
                    which it bore until the declaration of the Italian kingdom in this century.
                    Vittorio Amedeo H.’s reign was of great importance in the history of his state.
                    Though a despot, as all monarchs were obliged to be at that date, he reigned
                    with prudence, probity, and zeal for the welfare of his subjects. He took public
                    education out of the hands of the Jesuits, which, for the future development of
                    manliness in his dominions, was a measure of incalculable value. The duchy of
                    Savoy in his days became a kingdom, and Sardinia, though it seemed a poor
                    exchange for Sicily, was a far less perilous possession than the larger and
                    wealthier island would have been. In 1730 Vittorio Amedeo abdicated in favour of
                    his son Carlo Emmanuele III. Repenting of this step, he subsequently attempted
                    to regain Turin, but was imprisoned in the castle of Rivoli, where he ended his
                    days in 1732.</p>
                <p>The war of the Polish succession which now disturbed Europe is only important in
                    Italian history because the treaty of Vienna in 1738 settled the disputed
                    affairs of the duchies of Parma and Tuscany. The duke Antonio Farnese died in
                    1731; the grand-duke Gian Gastone de’ Medici died in 1737. In the duchy of Parma
                    Don Carlos had already been proclaimed. But he was now transferred to the Two
                    Sicilies, while Francis of Lorraine, the husband of Maria Theresa, took Tuscany
                    and Parma. Milan and Mantua remained in the hands of the Austrians. On this
                    occasion Carlo Emmanuele acquired Tortona and Novara.</p>
                <p>Worse complications ensued for the Italians when the emperor Charles VI., father
                    of Maria Theresa, died in 1740. The three branches of the Bourbon house, ruling
                    in France, Spain, and the Sicilies, joined with Prussia, Bavaria, and the
                    kingdom of Sardinia to despoil Maria Theresa of her heritage. Lombardy was made
                    the seat of war; and here the king of Sardinia acted as in some sense the
                    arbiter of the situation. After war broke out, he changed sides and supported
                    the Hapsburg-Lorraine party. At first, in 1745, the Sardinians were defeated by
                    the French and Spanish troops. But Francis of Lorraine, elected emperor in that
                    year, sent an army to the king’s support, which in 1746 obtained a signal
                    victory over the Bourbons at Piacenza. Carlo Emmanuele now threatened Genoa. The
                    Austrian soldiers already held the town. But the citizens expelled them, and the
                    republic kept her independence. In 1748 the treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle, which put
                    an end to the war of the Austrian succession, once more redivided Italy. Parma,
                    Piacenza, and Guastalla were formed into a duchy for Don Philip, brother of
                    Charles III. of the Two Sicilies, and son of Philip V. of Spain. Charles III.
                    was confirmed in his kingdom of the <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0913-0506-0485"/> Two Sicilies. The Austrians kept Milan and
                    Tuscany. The duchy of Modena was placed under the protection of the French. So
                    was Genoa, which in 1755, after Paoli’s insurrection against the misgovernment
                    of the republic, ceded her old domain of Corsica to France.</p>
                <p>From the date of this settlement until 1792, Italy enjoyed a period of repose and
                    internal amelioration under her numerous paternal despots. It became the fashion
                    during these forty-four years of peace to encourage the industrial population
                    and to experimentalize in economical reforms. The emperor Francis I. ruled the
                    grand-duchy of Tuscany by lieutenants until his death in 1765, when it was
                    given, as an independent state, to his third son, Peteι∙ Leopold. The reign of
                    this duke was long remembered as a period of internal prosperity, wise
                    legislation, and important public enterprise. Leopold, among other useful works,
                    drained the Val di Chiana, and restored those fertile upland plains to
                    agriculture. In 1790 he succeeded to the empire, and left Tuscany to his son
                    Ferdinand. The kingdom of Sardinia was administered upon similar principles,,
                    but with less of geniality. Carlo Emmanuele made his will law, and erased the
                    remnants of free institutions from his state. At the same time he wisely
                    followed his father’s policy with regard to education and the church. This is
                    perhaps the best that can be said of a king who incarnated the stolid absolutism
                    of the period. From this date, however, we are able to trace the revival of
                    independent thought among the Italians. The European ferment of ideas which
                    preceded the French Revolution expressed itself in men like Alfieri, the fierce
                    denouncer of tyrants, Beccaria, the philosopher of criminal jurisprudence,
                    Volta, the physicist, and numerous political economists of Tuscany. Moved partly
                    by external influences and partly by a slow internal reawakening, the people was
                    preparing for the efforts of the present century. The papacy, during this
                    period, had to reconsider the question of the Jesuits, who made themselves
                    universally odious, not only in Italy, but also in France and Spain. In the
                    pontificate of Clement XIII. they ruled the Vatican, and almost succeeded in
                    embroiling the pope with the concerted Bourbon potentates of Europe. His
                    successor, Clement XIV., suppressed the order altogether by a brief of 1773. For
                    the divisions of Italy at this time see Plate VI.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Achievement of Independence.</hi></p>
                <p>The malarious tranquillity of Italy beneath her Austrian and Bourbon despots was
                    rudely shaken by the French Revolution. This is not the place to describe
                    Napoleon’s campaign of 1796. But the treaty of Campo Formio, which resettled
                    Italy in 1797, has to be described. Northern and Central Italy was redivided
                    into four republics, —the Cisalpine, with its capital in Milan; the Ligurian,
                    with Genoa for capital; the Cispadane, with Bologna; the Tiberine, with Rome.
                    Venice (where the last doge, Luigi Manini, had dissolved the republic of St Mark
                    amid the execrations of the populace in the month of May) was flung, together
                    with her territory between the Adige and the Adriatic, as a compensation for
                    other losses, to the Austrian empire. In the next year, 1798, Lower Italy became
                    the Parthenopaean republic, with Naples for its capital. . Carlo Emmanuele III.,
                    now king of Sardinia, resigned his dominions. Pius VI. fled from Rome, and died
                    in France in 1/99. The whole of the old order of the peninsula was thus
                    destroyed at a blow. Yet the people, at first, gained little but an exchange of
                    masters, increased taxes, and a participation in the doubtful glories of the
                    French republic. While Bonaparte was absent in Egypt, his recent settlement of
                    Italian affairs was upset, and the French were everywhere driven out of the
                    peninsula by force of arms. He returned, and Marengo (1800) made him once more
                    master of Italy. Four years later, having proclaimed himself emperor, he took
                    the Lombard crown in St Ambrogio at Milan. Italy now ranked as his kingdom, and
                    a new settlement of her provinces had to be effected. The pope was left in Rome,
                    and Ferdinand in Naples. Tuscany was rechristened the kingdom of Etruria, and
                    given to the Bourbons. The Ligurian and Cisalpine republics were placed under
                    the viceroy Eugene Beauharnais. After Austerlitz, Venice was added to this North
                    Italian kingdom; and in 1806 Bonaparte made the Bourbons yield Naples to his
                    brother Joseph. When Joseph went in 1808 to Madrid, Joachim Murat succeeded him
                    as king in Naples. Sicily remained in the hands of Ferdinand. In 1809 Pius VII.
                    was deposed, and sent to France, and Rome was declared a part of the French
                    empire. The gingerbread kingdom of Etruria was abolished, and Bonaparte’s
                    sister, Eliza, wife of a Colonel Bacciocchi, was made duchess of Tuscany, with
                    the titles of duchess of Lucca and princess of Piombino. Ephemeral as were
                    Bonaparte’s successive divisions and redivisions of Italy into provinces for his
                    generals and relatives, they exercised no little influence. From the period of
                    the French rule we may date a new sense of nationality among Italians, generated
                    by the military service of recruits drawn together from all districts in
                    Napoleon’s armies, by the temporary obliteration of most ancient boundaries, by
                    the dethronement of alien and unloved princes, by the equal administration of
                    one code of laws, and by the spirit of the revolution which animated all French
                    institutions. Italy began to feel herself a nation, and though it was long
                    before Europe suffered her to win national rights, the demand for them, which in
                    our own days became too imperious to be resisted, was created in her people at
                    this epoch.</p>
                <p>The congress of Vienna in 1815 took down from the theatre of Italy all
                    Bonaparte’s decorations, and set up the old scenery in very nearly the old
                    places. Vittorio Emmanuele I. received back his kingdom of Sardinia, with the
                    addition of Genoa. Venice and Milan were formed into the province of
                    Lombardo-Venezia for Francis II., emperor of Austria. The old duchy of Parma was
                    given for her lifetime to Maria Louisa, who, though the wife of Bonaparte, was
                    still an Austrian princess. Upon her death it was to be restored to its former
                    Bourbon princes, who received in the meanwhile Lucca as an equivalent. The
                    Austrian Ferdinand III. was once again grand-duke of Tuscany, with the reversion
                    of Lucca after Maria Louisa’s decease. Francis, son of the Austrian archduke
                    Ferdinand and Beatrice d’Este, became duke of Modena, with the reversion of
                    Lunigiana on the same event. Pius VII. got back all the states of the church,
                    and on his re-entry into Rome restored the Jesuits, who had prove their
                    indispensability to tyrants. The Bourbon Ferdinand I. again joined Naples to his
                    crown of Sicily. We have been careful to label these Ferdinands and Francises
                    with their respective names of Austrian or Bourbon, in order that the partition
                    of Italy between the two dynasties, and the large preponderance of Austrian over
                    Bourbon influence, might be apparent. One significant detail has been omitted.
                    The congress of Vienna recognized the independent republic of San Marino. On the
                    top of a little mountain at the outskirts of the Apennines which overlook the
                    sea by Rimini, sat Liberty, the queen of a few hundred citizens, surveying the
                    muddy ocean of Franco-Spanish, Italo-Teutonic despotism which drowned Italy
                    through all her length and breadth.</p>
                <p>The Italian sovereigns, on returning to their respective states, proved that
                    exile and the revolution had terrorized them into more determined tyranny. The
                    civil and political reforms which had been instituted at the end of the last
                    century were abandoned. The Jesuits were restored<pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0913-0507-0486"/>; many suppressed monasteries were re-established;
                    and the mortmain laws were repealed. Elementary education was narrowed in its
                    limits, and thrown into the hands of the clergy. Professors suspected of liberal
                    views were expelled from the universities, and the press was placed under the
                    most rigid supervision. All persons who had taken part in the Napoleonic
                    governments, or who were known to entertain patriotic opinions, found themselves
                    harassed, watched, spied upon, and reported. The cities swarmed with police
                    agents and informers. The passport system was made more stringent, and men were
                    frequently refused even a few days’ leave of absence from their homes. The Code
                    Napoléon was withdrawn from those provinces which had formed part of the Italian
                    kingdom, while, in the papal states, the administration was placed again in the
                    hands of ecclesiastics.</p>
                <p>This political and spiritual reign of terror, which had for its object the
                    crushing of Italian liberalism, was sanctioned and supported by Austria. Each
                    petty potentate bound himself to receive orders from Vienna, and, in return for
                    this obedience, the emperor guaranteed him in the possession of his throne. The
                    Lombardo-Venetian kingdom, powerfully defended and connected with Austria by
                    land and sea, became one huge fortress, garrisoned with armed men, in perpetual
                    menace of the country. Under these conditions the Italians were half maddened,
                    and thousands of otherwise quiet citizens, either in the hope of finding redress
                    and protection, or only from a feeling of revenge, joined secret revolutionary
                    societies; for it must not be supposed that the revolution had left the Italians
                    as passive as it found them. A new spirit was astir, which was not likely to be
                    checked by the arrangements of the European congress—the spirit of national
                    independence. During the convulsions caused by Napoleon’s conquest of Italy, the
                    allied powers had themselves fostered this spirit, in order to oppose French
                    rule. The Austrians, the English, and Murat, in turn, had publicly invited the
                    Italians to fight for their national independence. And now the people, who
                    relied upon these proclamations and expected the fidfilment of so many promises,
                    found themselves by the consent of Europe delivered over, tied and gagged, to a
                    foreign oppressor. To take but one example: Ferdinand, when he quitted Naples in
                    May 1815, addressed a proclamation to his subjects, solemnly engaging to respect
                    the laws that should in his absence be decreed by a constitution. In June he
                    pledged himself at Vienna to introduce into his kingdom no institutions
                    irreconcilable witlr those which Austria might establish in her own
                    dependencies. Accordingly in 1816 he put an end to the Sicilian constitution of
                    1812.</p>
                <p>Tyranny was met by conspiracy; and in a short while, the Carbonari societies,
                    with Sanfedisti and many other revolutionary associations, had extended their
                    organization through the length and breadth of the peninsula. The discontent of
                    the Italians smouldered for five years; but in 1820 it broke into open flame. On
                    the 1st of January in that year the Spaniards proclaimed their constitution of
                    the Cortes, which was modelled on the type furnished by the earlier French
                    Revolution. Moved by this example, the royal army mutinied at Naples in July,
                    and a few days afterwards Palermo rushed to arms. Ferdinand was so surprised by
                    the sudden outbreak of this revolt that he hastily granted the constitution,
                    named his son Francis vicar-general of his kingdom, and betook himself to
                    Austria. The Austrians marched 80,000 men into Lombardy, and Great Britain and
                    France sent their fleets down to the Bay of Naples. At a congress held in the
                    spring of 1821 at Laybach, the allied powers authorized Austria to crush the
                    revolution in Lower Italy. Austrian troops entered Naples on the 23d of March;
                    and, when Ferdinand followed them, he had nothing to do but to execute
                    vengeance, by mock trials, on his insurgent subjects.</p>
                <p>While these events were taking place, another military insurrection broke out in
                    Piedmont, where the Spanish constitution was proclaimed. The king felt himself
                    bound by the congress of Laybach, and refused to make any concessions.
                    Therefore, on the 13th of March, he abdicated; and in the absence of his brother
                    and heir, Carlo Felice, his distant cousin, Carlo Alberto, prince of Carignano,
                    was appointed regent. Carlo Alberto represented a branch of the reigning house
                    which had been separated nearly two centuries from the throne. Educated, during
                    the French occupation, more like a private citizen than like a prince, he grew
                    up with liberal inclinations, and there is no doubt that his concessions to the
                    insurrectionists in Piedmont at this moment were actuated by sympathy rather
                    than by any vulgar desire to gain power. When, however, Carlo Felice returned
                    and declared that his brother’s abdication had been forced and therefore
                    illegal, Carlo Alberto’s sense of loyalty to the dynasty overcame his liberal
                    instincts. He submitted to the new king’s authority, and the old regime was
                    re-established in Piedmont on as absolute a basis as before.</p>
                <p>These movements were followed by state trials and executions, and the terrorism
                    of the tyrannies augmented. Silvio Pellico, at the close of an inefficient
                    disturbance at Milan, was sent to life-imprisonment at Spielberg. In the papal
                    states Leo XII. adopted a coercive policy still more grinding and humiliating.
                    For nine years the despots and the conspirators confronted each other, until the
                    July revolution of Paris in 1830 gave new hope and energy to the latter. On this
                    occasion the conflagration burst out at Modena, where the duke Francesco IV. had
                    been for some time past in secret negotiation with the patriotic party headed by
                    Ciro Menotti. It appears that the secret object of this autocrat was to employ
                    the revolution against his neighbours, and to make himself sovereign of Upper
                    Italy by the help of the conspirators. But when the revolution declared itself,
                    and spread to Parma, Bologna, and the Romagna, Francesco turned upon his friend
                    Menotti, and succeeded in putting him to death. It took but little time or
                    trouble to check this revolt, which was unsupported by armed force. Austrian
                    troops moved into Emilia and Romagna, restored the old order, and marched on to
                    Rome, which they occupied. Louis Philippe, now king of the French, being jealous
                    of the Austrians at Rome, occupied Ancona for the French in 1832; but the cause
                    of Italian liberty received no support from the bourgeois king, who strove to
                    keep on good terms with established authorities.</p>
                <p>From 1831 until 1846 Italy remained discontentedly and uneasily tranquil. The
                    infamous misgovernment of Rome and Naples continued; and in Lower Italy numerous
                    petty insurrections, caused by the misery of the people, and the cholera which
                    raged in 1837, were easily suppressed. Yet it was clear to all competent
                    observers that this state of things could not last. The Italian sovereigns were
                    seated over a volcano, which vibrated to the least stir in its neighbour,
                    France, and which was slowly accumulating explosive material. Among the most
                    powerful instruments now invented by the party of independence must be reckoned
                    the scientific congress. This body, ostensibly formed for the study of science,
                    assembled every year in some Italian city. Its meetings really served to
                    propagate liberal opinions and to establish relations between the patriots of
                    different districts. Meanwhile the great men who were destined to achieve the
                    future union of Italy had appeared upon the stage, and were busy through this
                    period with their pen and voice. Giuseppe Mazzini, born in 1808 at Genoa, made
                    himself the recognized head of a party called by the name of Young Italy. It was
                    his aim <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit13newyrich/page/n508/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0913-0508-0487"/> to organize the forces of the revolution, and to
                    establish the one and indivisible republic in Europa Though he strove in the
                    cause of Italy, his scheme for the regeneration of society far exceeded the
                    limits of that country. He declared war upon established order in its ancient
                    forms all over the world, and was willing to use conspiracy, if not
                    assassination, in order to achieve his ends. Thus, though the spirit infused
                    into the Italians by Mazzini’s splendid eloquence aroused the people to a sense
                    of their high destinies and duties, though he was the first to believe firmly
                    that Italy could and would be one free nation, yet the means he sanctioned for
                    securing this result, and the policy which was inseparable from his opinions,
                    proved obstacles to statesmen of more practical and sober views. It was the
                    misfortune of Italy at this epoch that she had not only to fight for
                    independence, but also to decide upon the form of government which the nation
                    should elect when it was constituted. All right-thinking and patriotic men
                    agreed in their desire to free the country from foreign rule, and to establish
                    national self-government. But should they aim at a republic or a constitutional
                    monarchy·? Should they be satisfied with the hegemony of Piedmont? Should they
                    attempt a confederation, and if so, how should the papacy take rank, and should
                    the petty sovereigns be regarded as sufficiently Italian to hold their thrones?
                    These and many other hypothetical problems distracted the Italian patriots. It
                    was impossible for them, in the circumstances, first to form the nation and then
                    to decide upon its government; for the methods to be employed in fighting for
                    independence already implied some political principle. Mazzini’s manipulation of
                    conspiracy, for instance, was revolutionary and republican; while those who
                    adhered to constitutional order, and relied upon the arms of Piedmont, had
                    virtually voted for Sardinian hegemony. The unanimous desire for independence
                    existed in a vague and nebulous condition. It needed to be condensed into
                    workable hypotheses; but this process could not be carried on without the growth
                    of sects perilous to common action.</p>
                <p>The party of Young Italy, championed by Mazzini, was the first to detach itself,
                    and to control the blindly working forces of the Carbonari movement by a settled
                    plan of action. It was the programme of Young Italy to establish a republic by
                    the aid of volunteers recruited from all parts of the peninsula. When Carlo
                    Alberto came to the throne, Mazzini addressed him a letter, as equal unto equal,
                    calling upon the king to defy Austria and rely upon God and the people. Because
                    Carlo Alberto (who, in spite of his fervent patriotism and genuine liberality of
                    soul, was a man of mixed opinions, scrupulous in his sense of constitutional
                    obligation, melancholy by temperament, and superstitiously religious), found
                    himself unwilling or unable to take this step, the Mazzinisti denounced him as a
                    traitor to 1821 and a retrogressive autocrat. In his exile at Geneva, Mazzini
                    now organized an armed attempt on Savoy. He collected a few hundred refugees of
                    all nations, and crossed the frontier in 1833. But this feeble attack produced
                    no result beyond convincing Carlo Alberto that he could not trust the
                    republicans. Subsequent attempts on the king’s life roused a new sense of
                    loyalty in Piedmont, and defined a counter-body of opinion to Mazzini’s. The
                    patriots of a more practical type, who may be called moderate liberals, began,
                    in one form or another, to aim at achieving the independence of Italy
                    constitutionally by the help of the Sardinian kingdom. What rank Sardinia would
                    take in the new Italy remained an open question. The publication of Vincenzo
                    Gioberti’s treatise, <hi rend="italic">Il Primato morale e civile degli
                    Italiani,</hi> in 1843, considerably aided the growth of definite opinion. His
                    utopia was a confederation of Italian powers, under the spiritual presidency of
                    the papacy, and with the army of Piedmont for sword and shield. This book had an
                    immense success. It made timid thinkers feel that they could join the liberals
                    without sacrificing their religious or constitutional opinions. At the same date
                    Cesare Balbo’s <hi rend="italic">Sp)eranze eV Italia</hi> exercised a somewhat
                    similar influence, through its sound and unsubversive principles. In its pages
                    Balbo made one shrewd guess, that the Eastern Question would decide Italian
                    independence. Massimo d’Azeglio, who also was a Piedmontese; the poet Giusti,
                    the Baron Ricasoli, and the Marchese Gino Capponi in Tuscany; together with
                    Alessandro Manzoni at Milan, and many other writers scattered through the
                    provinces of Italy, gave their weight to the formation of this moderate liberal
                    party. These men united in condemning the extreme democracy of the Mazzinisti,
                    and did not believe that Italy could be regenerated by merely manipulating the
                    insurrectionary force of the revolution. On political and religious questions
                    they were much divided in detail, suffering in this respect from the weakness
                    inherent in liberalism. Yet we are already justified in regarding this party as
                    a sufficient counterpoise to the republicans; and the man who was destined to
                    give it coherence, and to win the great prize of Italian independence by
                    consolidating and working out its principles in practice, was already there. The
                    count Camillo Benso di Cavour had been born in 1810, two years later than
                    Mazzini. He had not yet entered upon his ministerial career, but was writing
                    articles for the <hi rend="italic">Risorgimento,</hi> which at Turin opposed the
                    Mazzinistic journal <hi rend="italic">Concordia,</hi> and was devoting himself
                    to political and economical studies. It is impossible to speak of Mazzini and
                    Cavour without remembering the third great regenerator of Italy, Giuseppe
                    Garibaldi. At this date he was in exile; but a few years later he returned, and
                    began his career of popular deliverance in Lombardy. Mazzini, the prophet,
                    Garibaldi, the knight-errant, and Cavour, the statesman, of Italian
                    independence, were all natives of the kingdom of Sardinia. But their several
                    positions in it were so different as to account in no small measure for the very
                    divergent parts they played in the coming drama. Mazzini was a native of Genoa,
                    which ill tolerated the enforced rule of Turin. Garibaldi came from Nice, and
                    was a child of the people. Cavour was born in the midst of that stiff
                    aristocratical society of old Piedmont which has been described so vividly by
                    D’Azeglio in his <hi rend="italic">Ricordi.</hi> The Piedmontese nobles had the
                    virtues and the defects of English country squires in the last century. Loyal,
                    truthful, brave, hard-headed, tough in resistance, obstinately prejudiced, they
                    made excellent soldiers, and were devoted servants of the crown. Moreover, they
                    hid beneath their stolid exterior greater political capacity than the more
                    genial and brilliant inhabitants of Southern and Central Italy. Cavour came of
                    this race, and understood it. But he was a man of exceptional quality. He had
                    the genius of statesmanship,—a practical sense of what could be done, combined
                    with rare dexterity in doing it, fine diplomatic and parliamentary tact, and
                    noble courage in the hour of need. Without the enthusiasm, amounting to the
                    passion of a new religion, which Mazzini inspired, without Garibaldi’s brilliant
                    achievements, and the idolatry excited by this pure-hearted hero in the breasts
                    of all who fought with him and felt his sacred fire, there is little doubt that
                    Cavour would not have found the creation of United Italy possible. But if Cavour
                    had not been there to win the confidence, support, and sympathy of Europe, if he
                    had not been recognized by the body of the nation as a man whose work was solid
                    and whose sense was just in all emergencies, Mazzini’s efforts would have run to
                    waste in questionable insurrections, and Garibaldi’s feats of arms must have
                    added but one chapter more to the history of unproductive patriotism. While,
                    therefore, we <pb break="no"

                    men in the liberation of their country, and while we willingly ignore their
                    differences and disputes, it is Cavourwhom we must honour with the title of the
                    Maker of United Italy.</p>
                <p>From this digression, which was necessary in order to make the next acts in the
                    drama clear, we now return to the year 1846. Misrule had reached its climax in
                    Rome, and the people were well-nigh maddened, when Gregory XVI. died, and Pius
                    IX. was elected in his stead. It seemed as though an age of gold had dawned; for
                    the greatest of all miracles had happened. The new pope declared himself a
                    liberal, proclaimed a general amnesty to political offenders, and in due course
                    granted a national guard, and began to form a constitution. The Neo-Guelfic
                    school of Gioberti believed that their master’s utopia was about to be realized.
                    Italy went wild with joy and demonstrations. The pope’s example proved
                    contagious. Constitutions were granted in Tuscany, Piedmont, and Rome in 1847.
                    The duke of Lucca fled, and his domain was joined to Tuscany. Only Austria and
                    Naples declared that their states needed no reforms. On the 2d of January 1848 a
                    liberal demonstration at Milan served the Austrians for pretext to massacre
                    defenceless persons in the streets. These Milanese victims were hailed as
                    martyrs all over Italy, and funeral ceremonies, partaking of the same patriotic
                    character as the rejoicings of the previous year, kept up the popular agitation.
                    On the 12th of January Palermo rose against King Ferdinand II., and Naples
                    followed her example on the 27th. The king was forced in February to grant the
                    constitution of 1812, to which his subjects were so ardently attached.</p>
                <p>While Italy was thus engaged in making terms with her own sovereigns, the French
                    revolution broke out. Louis Philippe fled to England, and the republic was
                    declared. This altered affairs in Italy, and threw a temporary power into the
                    hands of the Mazzinisti. Sicily pronounced herself independent of the Bourbons,
                    and called the duke of Genoa to the throne. In Naples, the moderate liberal
                    government, of which Poerio had been a member, yielded to a more radical
                    administration. The patriots and the king’s troops came to blows, ending in
                    Ferdinand’s victory and the remodelling of the constitution. Lombardy rose in
                    insurrection. The Austrians were expelled from Milan, and the governor of Venice
                    capitulated. Provisional republican governments were formed, at Milan under the
                    presidency of Casati, at Venice under that of Daniele Manin. Impelled by the
                    overwhelming enthusiasm which prevailed in Upper Italy, Carlo Alberto declared
                    war on Austria in March. On the 8th of April he pushed his troops beyond the
                    Mincio; while Piacenza, Parma, Modena, and the Lombardo-Venetian kingdom voted
                    their union to Sardinia by universal suffrage. But the Austrian general,
                    Radetzky, though he lost a battle at Goito, and was forced to witness the
                    capitulation of Peschiera in May, Lad not given up the game. The pope’s troops
                    were established at Vicenza to support the Sardinians. These Radetzky compelled
                    to surrender in June; he then attacked Carlo Alberto’s army, who were engaged in
                    the investment of Mantua. A complete victory upon the 25th of July at Custozza
                    enabled Radetzky to re-enter Milan. Carlo Alberto had to retire beyond the
                    Ticino and to beg for an armistice. News of this Austrian victory reached
                    Naples, and gave Ferdinand the heart to quell the Sicilian revolt. On the 30th
                    August Messina was bombarded, and such atrocities were perpetrated in the
                    miserable city that the admirals of the French and English fleetshad to
                    interfere and extort an armistice from the conquerors. In the meanwhile, affairs
                    had begun to change in Rome. The pope, frightened at the revolution which had
                    already outrun his control, pronounced against the Austrian war and Italian
                    alliance. This roused republican hostility. His minister, the excellent Count
                    Pellegrini Rossi, was murdered in November, and anarchy seemed to threaten the
                    city. Pius escaped in disguise to Gaeta, where he was received by Ferdinand,
                    whom not long since he had denounced as a rogue. From Gaeta he opened the new
                    year, 1849, with a threat of excommunication to his subjects. The Romans were so
                    irritated that the moderate liberal party had to yield to the ultra-radicals;
                    and on the 9th of February Rome was declared a republic. The government was
                    entrusted to three dictators, of whom Mazzini was the head. Tuscany, meanwhile,
                    had lost her grand-duke. After opening parliament in January with a declaration
                    that he intended to prosecute the war against Austria, he escaped in February on
                    the English war-steamer “Bulldog” to Gaeta. A provisional government was
                    established in Florence, and Mazzini did his best to render Tuscany a part of
                    the new Roman republic. At this epoch two important personages appeared upon the
                    scene—Gino Capponi, who led the moderate liberals, and Urbano Rattazzi, who
                    headed the democratic party. The Florentines were not at bottom out of sympathy
                    with their duke. Therefore they rejected Mazzini’s overtures, and recalled
                    Leopold upon the understanding that he would respect their free institutions.
                    Still at Gaeta, the grand-duke mistrusted these advances, begged for Austrian
                    troops, and, when they had arrived, reentered Tuscany and suppressed the
                    constitution. Such acts of perfidy as these, repeatedly committed by all the
                    petty sovereigns of Italy with the exception of the house of Savoy, forced the
                    people to abandon the theory of federation under existing governments, and to
                    look for their salvation to Piedmont.</p>
                <p>This growing confidence in the Sardinian monarchy was not shaken by the
                    disastrous campaign of March 1849, which baptized the cause of Italian
                    independence with the best blood of Piedmont, gave it a royal martyr, and
                    pledged the dynasty of Savoy to a progressive policy from which it never
                    afterwards for a single moment deviated. Pushed by the ultra-radicals, and
                    burning with the purest zeal to liberate Italy, Carlo Alberto took the field
                    again in March 1849 against the Austrians. On the 24th, after some preliminary
                    movements, proving a want of good generalship and discipline in the Piedmontese
                    army, Radetzky obtained a complete victory at Novara. The king of Sardinia
                    abdicated on the field, in favour of his son, the duke of Savoy, Vittorio
                    Emmanuele II. Carlo Alberto, who had lived through times so troublous and
                    perplexing, who had exposed himself to misunderstanding and misinterpretation,
                    but in whom the devotion to Italy had become a religion, now took refuge at
                    Oporto, where he died, broken-hearted, after a few months of illness. The pathos
                    of this death checked the snarling of discordant parties; and, when the king’s
                    body was brought home to be buried on the heights of the Superga, the heart of
                    Italy recognized his worth. Carlo Alberto, though still anathematized by the
                    republican faction, became the saint of Italy. Hundreds of pilgrims flocked to
                    his tomb. The loyalty of his subjects redoubled · and it was felt that, by
                    serving Italy, they would glorify his memory. More than ever, by the disasters
                    of Novara, were the dynasty and aristocracy and people of Sardinia pledged to
                    that national policy which Carlo Alberto’s son triumphantly accomplished. In the
                    cottage homes of Piedmont and Lombardy travellers may still behold the old
                    king’s agony depicted side by side with the portraits of Cavour and Garibaldi
                    and Vittorio Emmanuele.</p>
                <p>The intrigues of which Gaeta had been a centre provoked a crusade of the Catholic
                    powers against republican and anti-papal Rome. A French expedition, under
                    General Oudinot, landed at Civita Vecchia on the 25th of April, and on the 29th
                    reached the walls of the city. The Neapolitan <pb break="no"

                    hills. Spaniards arrived at Fiumicino, and Austrians entered the Legations. The
                    French professed to come as friends · but the triumvirs of the Roman republic
                    refused them entrance, and General Oudinot established his camp on the
                    Janiculan. Garibaldi, who was guarding the frontier of the Abruzzi,returned and
                    defeated the Neapolitans at Palestrina on the 11th of May. Still his assistance
                    did not suffice to avert the French attack, and on July 2, after a siege of four
                    weeks, the city capitulated. Mazzini and Garibaldi made good their escape. The
                    French troops entered and held Rome for the pope. It was not until April 1850,
                    however, that Pius IX. ventured to return. When he arrived in his capital, he
                    began the reactionary reign, supported by his French garrison and Jesuit
                    advisers, which only ended with the semi-forcible entry of the Italians in
                    1870.</p>
                <p>With the fall of Rome the hopes of the revolutionary party ended. Austrian troops
                    replaced their ducal puppets in Parma, Modena, and Tuscany. King Ferdinand,
                    rightly now named Bomba, terrorized his subjects into silence ⅜&gt;y the aid of
                    Swiss mercenaries, artillery, and dungeons too loathsome to be described. Only
                    Venice still held out, blockaded in the Adriatic and bombarded from the land,
                    through all the horrors of famine, conflagration, and cholera, until the month
                    of August. Few episodes in the history of that noble city are more glorious than
                    this last desperate and patient struggle; and few names upon her muster-roll of
                    heroes are equally illustrious with that of the lion-hearted and blameless
                    Daniele Manin.</p>
                <p>In the disastrous year 1849 it seemed as though tlιe <hi rend="superscript">
                    f</hi> fate of Italy was sealed. The republicans had done their <hi
                    rend="superscript"> l</hi> best and failed at Milan, Rome, and Venice. The power
                    of Piedmont was broken at Novara. And yet we have good cause to say that the
                    miseries of this epoch wrought the future salvation of the race. The former vain
                    trust in the Italian sentiment of petty courts, the Neo-Guelfic mysticism of
                    Gioberti’s party, the utopian confidence in papal liberalism, the vague schemes
                    of confederation which had assumed many visionary forms, were all dissipated for
                    ever. To rightly thinking men it became clear that the regeneration of Italy
                    must be entrusted to Piedmont. When Vittorio Emmanuele entered Turin in silence
                    after Novara, with a demoralized army and a ruined exchequer, the spirit of his
                    people was cast down, but not extinguished. They had assumed responsibility, and
                    were not going to abandon it. “The house of Savoy cannot retreat” became the
                    watchword of the throne. D’Azeglio’s <hi rend="italic">Hous</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">recommencerons</hi> expressed the determination of the ruling <hi
                    rend="subscript"> &gt;</hi> classes. It is true that at this crisis they had to
                    combat the hostility and bitter jealousy of the republicans. Mazzini’s party
                    stirred up Genoa to revolution, and La Marmora received the ignoble task of
                    restoring that intractable city to a sense of duty. “Better Italy enslaved than
                    delivered over to the son of the traitor Carlo Alberto,” exclaimed the prophet
                    of democracy, whom no reverses could persuade that in such politics as those of
                    Italy the half is better than the whole. But Mazzini was no longer a power of
                    the first magnitude. The work which he had done for Italy was solid and abiding.
                    Still he had failed to carry the bulk of the nation with him. Men of more sober
                    aspirations saw that to aim at national independence and European reconstruction
                    at one leap was utopian. Italy must first be made; and the only power capable of
                    calling her into existence was Piedmont, still free and puissant among a crowd
                    of feeble and anarchical despotisms. The experience of ’49 proved that the
                    armies of Piedmont, in the hour of need, could rely on volunteers of pith and
                    nerve, in cities so downtrodden even as were Rome and Venice; for it must not be
                    forgotten that the republicans who sustained both sieges were members of the
                    bourgeoisie and proletariate. This consolidation of opinion after the events of
                    1849 was proved by Gioberti’s recantation of his earlier mysticism. In 1851 he
                    published a new treatise the <hi rend="italic">Pinnovamento,</hi> which
                    distinctly indicated Piedmont as the substantial basis of Italian independence.
                    Daniele Manin, now an exile in Paris, declared his adhesion to the same
                    doctrine. The constitutional party was further strengthened by the adhesion of
                    the leading republicans, Pallavicino and La Farina; and in 1857 the main point
                    of unaminity was secured by the formation of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Società</hi><hi rend="italic">Nazion ale,</hi> which kept sectarian jealousies
                    in the background. Garibaldi, at this time less republican than he afterwards
                    became, was himself a president of this political association. Henceforward the
                    genuine Mazzinisti formed a permanent minority. They could do little more than
                    to impede without perplexing or baffling the policy of the Piedmontese
                    statesmen, who felt themselves to be supported by the instincts of the race at
                    large.</p>
                <p>Vittorio Emmanuele began his reign with Massimo d’Azeglio for minister. He
                    steadily refused all Austrian advances, though enforced by his own wife and
                    mother, both of whom were Austrian archduchesses, The house of Savoy had pledged
                    itself to Italy, and the house had never broken faith. The first cares of the
                    new ministry were devoted to internal reforms, to the organization of the army
                    by La Marmora, and to financial measures. In 1850 they passed the so-called
                    Siccardi law, which abolished ecclesiastical courts. This was followed by a law
                    of civil marriage; and in 1854 the ecclesiastical reforms were completed by
                    Rattazzi’s bill for restricting religious corporations and placing church
                    property under state control. The necessity of these measures is demonstrated by
                    the fact that the little kingdom of Sardinia counted 41 bishops, 1417 canonries,
                    about 18,000 persons vowed to a monastic life, and one ecclesiastic to every 214
                    inhabitants. Their importance will be understood when we reflect that these laws
                    were extended to Italy after the union.</p>
                <p>Meanwhile Cavour had joined the government in 1850, as minister of commerce. Not
                    least among his great qualities was a thorough understanding of parliamentary
                    tactics; and, though his first attempts at public speaking were unsuccessful, he
                    soon remedied this defect. Mastery of facts and moral force gave weight to his
                    eloquence far above rhetoric. Meanwhile his study of English politics, and
                    admiration for men like Pitt and Peel, developed what in him was an innate
                    instinct for parliamentary leadership. This sound sense of the conditions of
                    representative government induced him to form a coalition with Rattazzi, the
                    leader of the democrats, in 1852. D’Azeglio and the king were frightened by so
                    bold a step. But Cavour’s preponderance in the chambers was irresistible; and in
                    November 1853 he superseded D’Azeglio as prime minister. From this date the
                    fortunes of Italy were in his hands, and Cavour became one of the foremost men
                    in Europe. It was by his advice that the Sardinian troops under General La
                    Marmora took part with France and England in the Crimean war, where they
                    distinguished themselves in the battle of the Tchernaya. The nation by this step
                    secured powerful allies, forced itself upon the notice of Europe, and accustomed
                    its army to service on a grand scale. At the congress of Paris in 1856 Cavour
                    represented Sardinia, and laid the grievances of Italy before the allied powers.
                    Both France and England remonstrated, but vainly, with Ferdinand II. for his
                    misgovernment.</p>
                <p>Cavour had travelled both in England and France, and had observed that, though
                    the English sympathized with Italy and were horrified by what they heard of
                    Neapolitan atrocities, he was not likely to get more than moral support and
                    non-interference from Great Britain. Yet he could <pb break="no"

                    one of the great powers against Austria. He therefore determined to rely on
                    Louis Napoleon Bonaparte, who had expressed his willingness to afford
                    substantial assistance at the proper moment. Between the years 1856 and 1859 it
                    was Cavour’s one endeavour to maintain the French emperor in this resolve, and
                    at the same time to drive the Austrians into a seasonable declaration of
                    war.</p>
                <p>The situation was delicate and dangerous in the extreme; and in January 1858 the
                    minister’s combinations were seriously imperilled by Felice Orsini’s attempt on
                    Napoleon’s life. It was only by passing a bill which defined the crime of
                    political assassination that he regained the emperor’s confidence. Later in the
                    year, Cavour met Napoleon at Plombières, where the preliminaries to a
                    Franco-Italian alliance for war against Austria were settled.</p>
                <p>The cabinet of Vienna, harassed by repeated memorials on the subject of their
                    tyranny in Lombardy, complained to Europe that Piedmont was a standing menace to
                    Italian peace, withdrew its minister from Turin, and demanded the disarmament of
                    the Sardinian kingdom. Louis Napoleon now prepared himself for war. On the 1st
                    of January 1859 Vittorio Emmanuele opened parliament with a speech which
                    declared the coming struggle: “We are not insensible to the cry of suffering
                    that rises to us from so many parts of Italy.” The words <hi rend="italic">Grido
                    di</hi><hi rend="italic">dolore</hi> were understood to be the watchword of the
                    war. In the early summer of 1859 the French crossed the Alps. The puppets of
                    Parma, Tuscany, and Modena fled, as usual, before the gathering storm,—this time
                    never to return. The battles of Magenta (June 4) and Solferino (June24) opened
                    Lombardy to the French and Sardinian troops, as far as the Quadrilateral of
                    fortresses protecting Venice. There Louis Napoleon sheathed his sword. He met
                    the emperor Francis Joseph at Villa Franca, and, without consulting his allies,
                    agreed to an armistice. At Plombières he had declared that he meant to free
                    Italy from the Alps to the Adriatic. But now he agreed upon the Mincio as the
                    future boundary between Sardinia and Austria. Venice was not to be liberated.
                    Terrible was the disappointment of the Piedmontese, who had made vast sacrifices
                    for this campaign, and who felt that their king had been insulted. Yet Louis
                    Napoleon was incapable of more. He knew himself to be no general, and he had
                    good reason to be certain that, if he pushed Austria too far, Prussia would take
                    up arms and carry war to France upon the Rhine. Moreover, the gain to Italy
                    proved greater than at first appeared. Tuscany, Modena, Parma, and Romagna
                    declared their determination to join the kingdom. In March 1860 the annexation
                    of Central Italy to Sardinia was effected, and approved by the French emperor.
                    It now appeared that, according to a hitherto secret understanding with Cavour,
                    Louis Napoleon was to take Savoy and Nice as the price of his assistance. This
                    sacrifice of their ancient home, the cradle of their dynasty, the house of Savoy
                    made to the Italian cause. But it was long before the Italians forgave Cavour.
                    He had to bear reproaches from all quarters, especially from Garibaldi, who was
                    never tired of repeating, “That man has made me a foreigner in my own
                    house.”</p>
                <p>The same month which witnessed the annexation of Central Italy saw the outburst
                    of a revolution in the south. Bomba was dead; but his son Francis II., by
                    continued acts of cruelty to state prisoners, and by cowardly oppression of his
                    subjects, had merited the nickname of Bombino. Refugees from Naples spread the
                    tale of Bourbon tyranny all over Europe. Even London trembled with rage at
                    Poerio’s sufferings. The insurrection broke out at Palermo, Messina, and
                    Catania. Garibaldi determined to support it. On the 5th of May he set out from
                    Genoa with his volunteers, the famous Mille, each of whom became for Italy a
                    hero. Cavour knew of the expedition and secretly favoured it, though he openly
                    expressed the regret of the Sardinian Government to Europe. It was his policy to
                    wait and see what happened, trusting that the gain of the venture would accrue
                    to the new kingdom. Garibaldi landed at Marsala, and proclaimed himself dictator
                    in the name of Vittorio Emmanuele, king of Italy. The conquest of Sicily was the
                    matter of a few days. In August the general crossed to Spart ivento, defeated
                    the royal army, drove Francis II. to Gaeta, and entered Naples on the 7th of
                    September. There Mazzini joined him, and the difficulties of the situation began
                    to disclose themselves. Garibaldi had no capacity for administration; yet he was
                    unwilling to resign his dictatorship. He had proclaimed Vittorio Emmanuele; yet
                    he lent an ear to the republicans, who hated Piedmont. Moreover, he hardly
                    concealed his intention of marching on Rome. Had he taken this step, success
                    would have involved reactionary interference on the part of Europe, while
                    failure might have involved the loss of Lower Italy. Meanwhile the natives of
                    the Two Sicilies were slow to accept annexation. They dispensed with the
                    Bourbons gladly; but they were ready to fulfil the prophecy of Bomba, that
                    “whosoever turned the Bourbons out would have enough to do in Lower Italy for
                    the next century.” Anarchy began to reign, and the Bourbon party lifted up its
                    head again at Gaeta. In these circumstances, Cavour, after ascertaining that he
                    had the sanction of Napoleon, resolved on sending troops into the papal states.
                    This seemed the only means of preventing Garibaldi’s march on Rome, and securing
                    his acquisitions for United Italy. General Cialdini accordingly occupied Urbino
                    and Perugia, defeated the pope’s general, Lamoricière, at Castelfidardo, joined
                    Garibaldi, and helped him to gain a victory over the Bourbon troops on the
                    Volturno. On the 2d of October Cavour defined the situation for the parliament
                    at Turin: “Garibaldi wishes to perpetuate the revolution; we wish to terminate
                    it.” Soon after this, Vittorio Emmanuele himself entered the Abruzzi. Garibaldi,
                    with the loyalty which never deserted him, resigned his dictatorship, and
                    returned to Caprera. In November Cavour was able to write to Berlin: “We are
                    Italy; we work in her name; but at the same time it is our policy to moderate
                    the national movement and maintain the monarchical principle.”</p>
                <p>In February 1861 Gaeta fell, after a resistance ennobled by the courage of
                    Francesco’s German consort. The kingdom was annexed by plebiscite, and Vittorio
                    Emmanuele was proclaimed king of Italy at Turin. Europe tacitly assented to
                    Italian independence. Only Rome and Venice now remained to be liberated. The
                    difficulties under which new Italy laboured were enormously increased by the
                    annexation of the Two Sicilies. Ever since the Norman Conquest they had formed a
                    province apart. Temperament, custom, and tradition separated the inhabitants, as
                    far as it was possible, from the sober people of the north. The national
                    parliament had to contend with brigandage encouraged by the clergy, with
                    deeply-rooted antipathies of race, with the discontent of disbanded officials,
                    and with the multitudinous obstacles which a demoralized society offers to
                    strict government. Upper Italy alone was educated for political existence.
                    Elsewhere the bad government of centuries had made the people permanently
                    hostile to the state, while corruption rendered them untrustworthy as agents.
                    Therefore the business of the country had to be conducted by the Piedmontese.
                    Yet this important fact was neglected in the composition of the parliament,
                    where a due preponderance had not been secured for the colleges of Northern
                    Italy. It was impossible not to own that the work of’ emancipation and
                    annexation had progressed too quickly. To add <pb break="no"

                    statesman at this juncture. On the 5th of June 1861, Cavour died with the words
                    “A free church in a free state” upon his lips. The last months of his life had
                    been given to planning the peaceable acquisition of Rome by treaty with the pope
                    and Louis Napoleon.</p>
                <p>What remains of Italian history between 1861 and 1870 may be briefly told.
                    Ricasoli formed a conservative Government after Cavour’s death, and Rattazzi led
                    the opposition. Garibaldi, who vowed never to rest till Rome and Venice had been
                    liberated, headed the party of action. In 1862 he raised a volunteer army and
                    invaded Sicily. Louis Napoleon regarded this as a menace to Rome, and ordered
                    Rattazzi, who was now in power, to check his progress. Cialdini marched to
                    Reggio, where the royal troops were defeated by the volunteers on the 28th of
                    September 1862. Next day Garibaldi was attacked and beaten at Aspromonte by
                    General Pallavicini. He retired, wounded, to Caprera, whence he published his
                    defence. The blame was seen to lie with Rattazzi, who had thought to follow
                    Cavour’s policy of masterly inaction without first settling with France. The
                    sympathy of Europe with Italy was so great after this disaster that in September
                    1864 Louis Napoleon agreed to a gradual withdrawal of French troops from Rome,
                    provided Italy respected what remained of the pope’s temporal power. By the same
                    convention Florence became the capital. This was a good step in advance towards
                    the annexation of Rome. In 1866 the Austro-Prussian war gave a new opportunity
                    to the Italians. They entered into alliance with Prussia, and marched an army
                    across the Mincio. The defeats of Custozza, Monte Suello, and Lissa deprived the
                    Italian troops of any claim to military or naval glory in this war. But the
                    Prussian victory of Königgratz secured the main objects for which they fought.
                    Venice, with the Quadrilateral, was joined to the Italian kingdom, while Austria
                    kept her Istrian and Dalmatian provinces.</p>
                <p>In accordance with the September convention, Louis Napoleon withdrew his garrison
                    from Rome in 1866. This event inflamed the party of action. Mazzini called upon
                    the people to seize the Eternal City; and Garibaldi in 1867 declared his resolve
                    to take Rome or die. Rattazzi, who was again in power, once more attempted the
                    policy which had failed him in 1862. He ignored the obligation which bound
                    Vittorio Emmanuele to defend the papal frontiers, and he hoped that France would
                    tolerate a volunteer invasion. He was mistaken. Louis Napoleon interfered, and
                    the Italian cabinet was forced to discountenance the further proceedings of the
                    volunteers. Disturbances occurred in Rome, and Garibaldi gained a victory at
                    Monte Rotonda Meanwhile the king appealed to the Italians to preserve his
                    honour, and the emperor sent a new garrison to Rome. Garibaldi’s volunteers
                    surrendered at Montana, on the 4th of November, to the French and papal troops;
                    and, while the general was retiring to Caprera, he was arrested by order of the
                    Italian Government at Figline. But the end was now not distant.</p>
                <p>When the victory of Sedan overthrew the French empire in September 1870, Jules
                    Favre declared the September convention to be at an end; Vittorio Emmanuele was
                    released from his obligations, and on the 20th he entered Rome, which now became
                    his capital. Pius IX. was allowed to retain the Vatican with its dependencies,
                    the church of Sta Maria Maggiore, and Castel Gandolfo on the Alban hill. The
                    state voted him a munificent income, and he was left in peace to play the part
                    of a persecuted prisoner. Thus ended the emancipation of Italy; nor did the
                    events of the following ten years alter the situation created by the king’s
                    occupation of Rome in 1870. Vittorio Emmanuele died and was succeeded by his son
                    Umberto in 1878. Pius IX. died the same year, and was succeeded by Leo XIII. The
                    history of Italy during this period has been confined to internal affairs.</p>

                <p>PART III.—LANGUAGE.</p>
                <p>The Italian language is the language of culture in the whole of the present
                    kingdom of Italy, in some parts of Switzerland (the canton of Ticino and part of
                    the Grisons), in some parts of the Austrian territory (the districts of Trent
                    and Gυrz, Istria along with Trieste, and the Dalmatian coast), and in the
                    islands of Corsica and Malta. In the Ionian Islands, likewise, in the maritime
                    cities of the Levant, in Egypt, and more particularly in Tunis, this literary
                    language is extensively maintained through the numerous Italian colonies and the
                    ancient traditions of trade.</p>
                <p>The Italian language has its native seat and living source in Middle Italy, or
                    more precisely Tuscany and indeed Florence. For real linguistic unity is far
                    from existing in Italy: in some respects the variety is less in others more
                    observable than in other countries which equally boast a political and literary
                    unity. Thus, for example, Italy affords no linguistic contrast so violent as
                    that presented by Great Britain with its English dialects alongside of the
                    Celtic dialects of Ireland, Scotland, and Wales, or by France with the French
                    dialects alongside of the Celtic dialects of Brittany, not to speak of the
                    Basque of the Pyrenees and other heterogeneous elements. The presence of not a
                    few Slavs stretching into the district of Udine (Friuli), of Albanian, Greek,
                    and Slav settlers in the southern provinces, with the Catalans of Alghero
                    (Sardinia), a few Germans at Monte Rosa, and a remnant or two of other
                    comparatively modern immigrations is not sufficient to produce any such strong
                    contrast in the conditions of the national speech. But, on the other hand, the
                    Neo-Latin dialects which live on side by side in Italy differ from each other
                    much more markedly than, for example, the English dialects or the Spanish; and
                    it must be added that, in Upper Italy especially, the familiar use <pb
                    break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit13newyrich/page/n513/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0913-0513-0492"/> of the dialects is tenaciously retained even by
                    the most cultivated classes of the population.</p>
                <p>In the present rapid sketch of the forms of speech which occur in modern Italy,
                    before considering the Tuscan or Italian <hi rend="italic">par excellence,</hi>
                    the language which has come to be the noble organ of modern national culture, it
                    will be convenient to discuss (A) dialects connected in a greater or less degree
                    with Neo-Latin systems that are not peculiar to Italy; (B) dialects which are
                    detached from the true and proper Italian system, but form no integral part of
                    any foreign Neo-Latin system; and (C) dialects which diverge more or less from
                    the true Italian and Tuscan type, but which at the same time can be conjoined
                    with the Tuscan as forming part of a special system of Neo-Latin dialects.</p>

                    areas at the extreme north-west of the kingdom of Italy. The system stretches
                    from the borders of Savoy and Valais into the upper basin of the Dora Baltea and
                    into the head-valleys of the Oreo, of the northern Stura, and of the Dora
                    Riparia. As this portion is cut off by the Alps from the rest of the system, the
                    type is badly preserved; in the valleys of the Stura and the Dora Riparia,
                    indeed, it is passing away and everywhere yielding to the Piedmontese.—The most
                    salient characteristic of the Franco-Provençal is the phonetic phenomenon by
                    which the Latin <hi rend="italic">a,</hi> whether as an accented or as an
                    unaccented final, is reduced to a thin vowel <hi rend="italic">(e, i)</hi> when
                    it follows a sound which is or has been palatal, but on the contrary is kept
                    intact when it follows a sound of another sort. The following are examples from
                    the Italian versant of these Alps: — <hi rend="smallcaps">Aosta</hi><hi

                    the imperfect subjunctive (amaram, amarem, alongside of habueram, haberem),
                    having in Franco-Provençal as well as in Provençal and in the continental

                    between the Stura and the Dora Riparia), which, according to the regular course

                <p>Further south, but still in the same western extremity of Piedmont, phenomena
                    continuous with those of the Maritime Alps supply the means of passing from the
                    Franco-Provençal to the Provençal proper, precisely as the same transition takes
                    place beyond the Cottian Alps in Dauphiné almost in the same latitude. On the
                    Italian side of the Cottian and the Maritime Alps the Franco-Provençal and the
                    Provençal are connected with each other by the continuity of the phenomenon c (a
                    pure explosive) from the Latin c before α. At <hi rend="smallcaps">Ol</hi><hi
                    rend="superscript smallcaps"> t</hi><hi rend="smallcaps">lx</hi> (sources of the

                    occurs the important Franco-Provençal phenomenon of the surd interdental
                    (English <hi rend="italic">th</hi> in <hi rend="italic">thief)</hi> instead of
                    the surd sibilant (for example ⅛⅛i = Fr. ici). At the same time α^w = avuto,
                    takes us to the Provençal. At <hi rend="smallcaps">Fenes-γrella</hi> (upper
                    basin of the Clusone): <hi rend="italic">agü,</hi><hi rend="italic">vengii,</hi>

                    >los</hi><hi rend="italic">buônos,</hi> le buone, where even the diphthong is
                    Provençal.</p>
                <p>2. <hi rend="italic">Ladin Dialects.—</hi> The purest of the Ladin dialects occur
                    on the northern versant of the Alps in the Grisons (Switzerland), and they form
                    the western section of the system. To this section also belongs both politically
                    and in the matter of dialect the valley of Münster (Monastero); it sends its
                    waters to the Adige, and might indeed consequently be geographically considered
                    Italian, but it slopes towards the north. In the central section of the Ladin
                    zone there are two other valleys which likewise drain into tributaries of the
                    Adige, but are also turned towards the north,—the valleys of the Gardena and the
                    Gadera, in which occurs the purest Ladin now extant in the central section. The
                    valleys of Münster, the Gardena, and the Gadera may thus be regarded as
                    inter-Alpine, and the question may be left open whether or not they should be
                    included even geographically in Italy. There remain, however, within what are
                    strictly Italian limits, the valleys of the Noce, the A visio, the Cordevole,
                    and the Boite, and the upper basin of the Piave (Comelico), in which are
                    preserved Ladin dialects, more or less pure, belonging to the central section of
                    the Ladin zone or belt. To Italy belongs, further, the whole eastern section of
                    the zone composed of the Friulian territories. It is by far the most populous,
                    containing about 500,000 inhabitants. The Friulian region is bounded on the
                    north by the Carnic Alps, south by the Adriatic, and west by the eastern rim of
                    the upper basin of the Piave and the Livenza; while on the east it stretches
                    into the eastern versant of the basin of the Isonzo. —The Ladin element is
                    further found in greater or less degree throughout an altogether Cis-Alpine
                    “amphizone,” and more particularly in the head valley of the Ticino and the head
                    valley of the Mera on the Lombardy versant, and in the Val Fiorentina and
                    central Cadore on the Venetian versant. The valleys of Bormio present a special
                    and conspicuous phase of Ladino-Lombard connexions, and the Ladin element is
                    clearly observable in the most ancient examples of the dialects of the Venetian
                    estuary (JrcΛ., i. 448-4/3).— The main characteristics by which the Ladin type
                    is determined may be summarized as follows :—(1) the guttural of the formulae c
                    + α and <hi rend="italic">g + a</hi> passes into a palatal; (2) the <hi
                    rend="italic">l</hi> of the formulae <hi rend="italic">pl, cl, kx.,</hi> is
                    preserved; (3) the <hi rend="italic">s</hi> of the ancient terminationsis
                    preserved; (4) the accented <hi rend="italic">e</hi> in position breaks into a
                    diphthong; (5) the accented <hi rend="italic">o</hi> in position breaks into a
                    diphthong; (6) the form of the diphthong which comes from short accented <hi
                    rend="italic">o</hi> or from the <hi rend="italic">o</hi> of position is <hi
                    rend="italic">ue</hi> (whence <hi rend="italic">ue,</hi> ö); (7) long accented

                    xml:id="kp-eb0913-0514-0493"/> 1. Here first of all is the extensive system of
                    the dialects usually called <hi rend="italic">Gallo-Italian,</hi> although that
                    designation cannot be considered sufficiently distinctive, since it would be
                    equally applicable to the Franco-Provençal (A. 1) and the Ladin (A. 2). The
                    system is subdivided into four great groups,—(a) the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Ligurian,</hi> (δ) the <hi rend="italic">Piedmontese,</hi> (c) the <hi
                    rend="italic">Lombard,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">(d)</hi> the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Emilian,—</hi> the names furnishing on the whole sufficient indication of the
                    localization and limits.— These groups, considered more particularly in their
                    more pronounced varieties, differ greatly from each other; and, in regard to the
                    Ligurian, it was even denied until very recently that it belongs to this system
                    at all (see <hi rend="italic">Arch.,</hi> ii. 111 <hi rend="italic">sqq.).—</hi>
                    Characteristic of the Piedmontese, the Lombard, and the Emilian is the continual
                    elision of the unaccented final vowels except <hi rend="italic">a (e.g.,</hi>
                    Turinese <hi rend="italic">öj,</hi> oculo; Milanese <hi rend="italic">vgç,</hi>
                    voce; Faenzan <hi rend="italic">red,</hi> rete), but the Ligurian does not keep
                    them company <hi rend="italic">(e.g.,</hi> Genovese <hi rend="italic"
                    >o&lt;j&lt;Ju,</hi> oculo; <hi rend="italic">vρze,</hi> voce). In the
                    Piedmontese and Emilian there is further a tendency to eliminate the protonic
                    vowels—a tendency much more pronounced in the second of these groups than in the
                    first <hi rend="italic">(e.g.,</hi> Pied, <hi rend="italic">dné,</hi> danaro;
                    <hi rend="italic">viin,</hi> vicino; Faenzan <hi rend="italic">fnocc,</hi>
                    finocchio; <hi rend="italic">dspraziori).</hi> This phenomenon involves in large
                    measure that of the prothesis of a; as, <hi rend="italic">e.g.,</hi> in Turinese
                    and Faenzan <hi rend="italic">armor,</hi> rumore; Faenzan <hi rend="italic"
                    >alvé,</hi> levare; &amp;c. <hi rend="italic">U</hi> for the long accented Latin
                    w and ö for the short accented Latin <hi rend="italic">o</hi> (and even within
                    certain limits the Latin ό of position) are common to the Piedmontese, the
                    Ligurian, and the Lombard: <hi rend="italic">e.g.,</hi> Turinese and Milanese,
                    <hi rend="italic">dur,</hi> and Genovese <hi rend="italic">diiu,</hi> duro;
                    Turinese and Genovese, <hi rend="italic">move,</hi> and Milanese <hi
                    rend="italic">möo,</hi> movere; Piedmontese <hi rend="italic">dörm,</hi> dorm6;
                    Milanese, <hi rend="italic">volta,</hi> volta. <hi rend="italic">Ei</hi> for the
                    long accented Latin <hi rend="italic">e</hi> and for the short accented Latin
                    <hi rend="italic">i</hi> is common to the Piedmontese and the Ligurian, and even
                    extends over a large part of Emilia: <hi rend="italic">e.g.,</hi> Turinese and
                    Genovese, <hi rend="italic">avéi,</hi> habere, Bolognese, <hi rend="italic"
                    >avéir;</hi> Turinese and Genovese, <hi rend="italic">beive,</hi> bibere,
                    Bolognese, <hi rend="italic">beir.</hi> In Emilia <hi rend="italic">ci</hi>
                    occurs also in the formulae <hi rend="italic">én,</hi><hi rend="italic">ent,
                    emp; e.g.,</hi> Bolognese and Modenese <hi rend="italic">bein, sρla-</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">méiht.</hi> The system shows a repugnance throughout to <hi
                    rend="italic">ie</hi> for the short accented Latin <hi rend="italic">e</hi> (as
                    it occurs in Italian <hi rend="italic">piede,</hi> &amp;c. ); in other words,
                    this diphthong has died out, but in various fashions: Piedmontese and Lombard
                    deç, dieci; Genovese <hi rend="italic">dele;</hi> Faenzan <hi rend="italic"
                    >diρ.</hi> The greater part of the phenomena indicated above have “Gallic”
                    counterparts too evident to require to be specially pointed out. One of the most
                    important traces of Gallic or Celtic reaction is the reduction of the Latin
                    accented <hi rend="italic">a</hi> into <hi rend="italic">e (a,</hi> &amp;c. ),
                    of which phenomenon, however, no certain indications have as yet been found in
                    the Ligurian group. On the other hand it remains, in the case of very many of
                    the Piedmontese dialects, in the <hi rend="italic">é</hi> of the infinitives of
                    the first conjugation: <hi rend="italic">porté,</hi> portare, &amp;c.; and
                    numerous vestiges of it are still found in Lombardy <hi rend="italic"
                    >(e.g.,</hi> in Bassa Brianza: <hi rend="italic">and£,</hi> andato; <hi
                    rend="italic">guard;!,</hi> guardato; <hi rend="italic">sae,</hi> sale; see <hi
                    rend="italic">Arch.</hi> i. 296-298, 536). Emilia also preserves it in very
                    extensive use: Modenese <hi rend="italic">ander,</hi> andare; <hi rend="italic"
                    >arivéda,</hi> arrivata; <hi rend="italic">pcρ,</hi> pace; Faenzan <hi
                    rend="italic">parlé,</hi> pariare and pariato; <hi rend="italic">parléda,</hi>
                    pariata; <hi rend="italic">chcs,</hi> caso; &amp;c. The phenomenon, in company
                    with other Gallo-Italian and more specially Emilian characteristics, extends to
                    the valley of the Metauro, and even passes to the opposite side of the
                    Apennines, spreading on both banks of the head stream of the Tiber and through
                    the valley of the Chiane: hence the types <hi rend="italic">artrovér,</hi>
                    ritrovare, <hi rend="italic">portéto,</hi> portato, &amp;c., of the Perιιgian
                    and Aretine dialects (see <hi rend="italic">infra</hi> C. 3, δ). In the
                    phenomenon of <hi rend="italic">d</hi> passing into <hi rend="italic">e</hi> (as
                    indeed, the Gallo-Italic evolution of other Latin vowels) special distinctions
                    would require to be drawn between bases in which <hi rend="italic">a</hi> (not
                    standing in position) precedes a non-nasal consonant <hi rend="italic">(e.g.,
                    amdto),</hi> and those which have <hi rend="italic">a</hi> before a nasal: and
                    in the latter case there would be a non-positional subdivision (e. <hi
                    rend="italic">g., fame, pane)</hi> and a positional one <hi rend="italic">(e.g.,
                    qudnto,</hi><hi rend="italic">amândo,</hi><hi rend="italic">edmpo);</hi> see <hi
                    rend="italic">Arch.</hi> i. 293 <hi rend="italic">sqq.</hi> This leads us to the
                    nasals, a category of sounds comprising other Gallo-Italic characteristics.
                    There occurs more or less widely, throughout all the sections of the system, and
                    in different gradations, that “velar” nasal in the end of a syllable <hi
                    rend="italic">(pah, man·, cdhta,</hi><hi rend="italic">moût)</hi> which may be
                    weakened into a simple nasalizing of a vowel <hi rend="italic">(pd,</hi>
                    &amp;c.) or even grow completely inaudible (Bergaτnese <hi rend="italic"
                    >pa,</hi> pane; <hi rend="italic">padrιi,</hi> padrone; <hi rend="italic"
                    >tep,</hi> tempo; <hi rend="italic">met,</hi> mente; <hi rend="italic">mut,</hi>
                    monte; <hi rend="italic">pût,</hi> ponte; <hi rend="italic">ριica,</hi> punta,
                    <hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> “puncta”), where Celtic and especially Irish
                    analogies and even the frequent use of <hi rend="italic">t</hi> for <hi
                    rend="italic">nt,</hi> &amp;c., in ancient Umbrian orthography occur to the
                    mind. Then λve have the faucal <hi rend="italic">n</hi> by which the Ligurian
                    and the Piedmontese <hi rend="italic">Cana, luma,</hi> &amp;c. ) are connected
                    with the group which we call Franco-Provençal (A. 1).— We pass on to the
                    “Gallic” resolution of the nexus <hi rend="italic">ct (e.g., facto,</hi> fajto,
                    fajtjo, <hi rend="italic">fait, fac; teclo,</hi> tejto, tejtjo, <hi
                    rend="italic">teil,</hi><hi rend="italic">tec)</hi> which invariably occurs in
                    the Piedmontese, the Ligurian, and the Lombard: Pied, <hi rend="italic"
                    >fail,</hi> Lig. <hi rend="italic">fajtu,</hi><hi rend="italic">faetu,</hi>
                    Lombard <hi rend="italic">fac</hi>; Pied, <hi rend="italic">téit,</hi> Lig. <hi
                    rend="italic">téitu,</hi> Lorn, <hi rend="italic">tec·,</hi> &amp;c. Here it is
                    to be observed that besides the Celtic analogy the Umbrian also helps us <hi
                    rend="italic">(adveitu =</hi> ad-vecto; &amp;c.); and it is further most
                    noteworthy that the Celtic and Umbrian analogies lead us to that fusion of the
                    <hi rend="italic">ct</hi> series with the <hi rend="italic">pt</hi> series
                    (Irish <hi rend="italic">secht,</hi> Welsh <hi rend="italic">scith,</hi> septem;
                    Umbrian, <hi rend="italic">screhto, screihtor,</hi> scriptum, scripti) by which
                    is explained the <hi rend="italic">serve,</hi> scripto, of the ancient Milanese,
                    <hi rend="italic">scric 'dra,</hi> scriptura, of the modern; just as also
                    Provençal has <hi rend="italic">escrich</hi> (i.e., <hi rend="italic"
                    >escric).—</hi> The Piedmontese and Ligurian come close to each other, more
                    especially by the regular dropping of the <hi rend="italic">d</hi> both primary
                    and secondary, a phenomenon common in French (as Piedmontese and Ligurian <hi
                    rend="italic">rle,</hi> ridere; Piedmontese <hi rend="italic">pué,</hi> potare;
                    Genoese <hi rend="italic">naeghe</hi><hi rend="italic">=</hi> nâighe, nâtiche,
                    &amp;c.). The Lombard type, or more correctly the type which has become the
                    dominant one in Lombardy <hi rend="italic">(Arch.,</hi> i. 305-6, 310-11), is
                    more sparing in this respect; and still more so is the Emilian. In the
                    Piedmontese is also found that other purely Gallic resolution of the guttural
                    between two vowels by which we have the types <hi rend="italic">brdja,

                    braca, manica.—Among the phonetic phenomena peculiar to the Ligurian is a
                    continual reduction of <hi rend="italic">l</hi> into <hi rend="italic">r</hi>
                    and the subsequent dropping of this <hi rend="italic">r</hi> between vowels and
                    at the end of words in the modern Genoese; just as happens also with the primary
                    r: thus <hi rend="italic">dû</hi> = dunir≈ dolore, &amp;c. Characteristic of the
                    Ligurian, but not without analogies in Upper Italy even <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Arch.,</hi> ii. 157-8), is the resolution of^y', <hi rend="italic">bj,fj</hi>
                    intoc, <hi rend="italic">j, S: cii,</hi> pin, plus; <hi rend="italic"
                    >rdjja,</hi> rabbia, rabies; M, fiore. Finally, the sounds 5 and 5 have a very
                    wide range in Ligurian <hi rend="italic">(Arch.,</hi> ii. 158-59). The reduction
                    of s into <hi rend="italic">h</hi> occurs in the Bergamo dialects: <hi
                    rend="italic">hira,</hi> sera; <hi rend="italic">groh,</hi> grosso; <hi
                    rend="italic">cahtél,</hi> castello (see also B. 2).—A general phenomenon in
                    Gallo-Italic phonetics which also comes to have an inflexional importance is
                    that by which the unaccented final <hi rend="italic">i</hi> has an-influence on
                    the accented vowel. This enters into a series of phenomena which even extends
                    into southern Italy; but in the Gallo-Italic there are particular resolutions
                    which agree well with the general connexions of this system. The following
                    plural forms may be quoted: Genoese <hi rend="italic">bôin,</hi> from <hi
                    rend="italic">bon-i; tr6in</hi> from <hi rend="italic">tron-i,</hi> tuoni;
                    Milanese <hi rend="italic">quist,</hi> from <hi rend="italic">quist-i</hi>
                    (sing, <hi rend="italic">quest),</hi> questi; <hi rend="italic">mis</hi> from
                    <hi rend="italic">mes-i,</hi> mesi (sing, <hi rend="italic">mes)</hi>; Bolognese
                    <hi rend="italic">rin,</hi> from <hi rend="italic">rcn-i,</hi> regni (sing, <hi
                    rend="italic">ren); cf. Arch.,</hi> i. 540-41.—Among morphological peculiarities
                    the first place may be given to the Bolognese <hi rend="italic">sipa
                    (scppa),</hi> because, thanks to Dante and others, it has acquired great
                    literary celebrity. It really signifies “sia” (sim, sit), and is an analogical
                    form fashioned on <hi rend="italic">aepa,</hi> a legitimate continuation of the
                    corresponding forms of the other auxiliary (habeam, habeat), which is still
                    heard in <hi rend="italic">clime</hi><hi rend="italic">aepa</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">purt£, ch</hi> ’ <hi rend="italic">lu</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >aepa</hi><hi rend="italic">p&gt;urtf,</hi> ch’io abbia portato, ch’egli abbia
                    portato. Next may be noted the third person singular in <hi rend="italic"
                    >-p</hi> of the perfect of <hi rend="italic">esse</hi> and of the first
                    conjugation in the Forli dialect <hi rend="italic">(fop,</hi> fu; <hi
                    rend="italic">mandip,</hi> mando; &amp;c). This also must be analogical, and due
                    to a legitimate <hi rend="italic">ep,</hi> ebbe <hi rend="italic">(see
                    Arch.,</hi> ii. 401, and compare <hi rend="italic">fobbe,</hi> fu, in the
                    dialect of Camerino, in the province of Macerata, as well as the Spanish analogy
                    of <hi rend="italic">tuve estuve</hi> formed after <hi rend="italic">hübe).</hi>
                    Lastly, in the domain of syntax, may be added the tendency to repeat the pronoun
                    <hi rend="italic">(e.g., ti te edntet</hi> of the Milanese, which really is <hi
                    rend="italic">tu tu</hi><hi rend="italic">cdntas-tu,</hi> equivalent merely to
                    “cantas”), a tendency at work in the Emilian and Lombard, but more particularly
                    pronounced in the Piedmontese. With this the corresponding tendency of the
                    Celtic languages has been more than once and with justice compared; here it may
                    be added that the Milanese <hi rend="italic">nun,</hi> apparently a simple form
                    for “noi,” is really a compound or reduplication in the manner of the <hi
                    rend="italic">ni-ni,</hi> its exact counterpart in the Celtic tongues. —The
                    literary documents of this system go back as far as the end of the 13th century
                    in the Milanese poems of Fra Bonvicino da Riva and the <hi rend="italic">Rime
                    Genovcsi (Arch.,</hi> ii. 161-312).</p>
                <p>2. <hi rend="italic">Sardinian Dialects.—</hi> These are three—the Logudoreseor
                    central, the Campidanese or southern, and the Gallurese or northern. The third
                    certainly indicates a Sardinian basis, but is strangely disturbed by the
                    intrusion of other elements, among which the Southern Corsican (Sartene) is by
                    far the most copious. The other two are homogeneous, and have great affinity
                    with each other; the Logudorese comes more particularly under consideration
                    here.—The pure Sardinian vocalism has this peculiarity that each accented vowel
                    of the Latin appears to be retained without alteration. Consequently there are
                    no diphthongs representing simple Latin vowels; nor does the rule hold good
                    which is true for so great a proportion of the Romance languages that the
                    representatives of the <hi rend="italic">é</hi> and the Ï on the one hand and
                    those of the <hi rend="italic">ύ</hi> and the ½ on the other are normally
                    coincident. Hence <hi rend="italic">plenu (e); deghe,</hi> decem (e); <hi
                    rend="italic">binu,</hi> vino <hi rend="italic">(i)∙,pilu</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >(ï); flore (ô); roda,</hi> rota <hi rend="italic">(S); duru (ü); nughc,</hi>
                    nuce <hi rend="italic">(ü).</hi> The unaccented vowels keep their ground well,
                    as has already been seen in the case of the finals by the examples adduced.—Thes
                    and <hi rend="italic">t</hi> of the ancient termination are preserved, though
                    not constantly: <hi rend="italic">trcs* onus,</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >passades</hi><hi rend="italic">annos, plantas,</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >fafhes,</hi> facis, <hi rend="italic">tenemus·,</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >mulghet,</hi><hi rend="italic">rnitt-ghent. —</hi> The formulae <hi
                    rend="italic">ce,</hi><hi rend="italic">ci,</hi><hi rend="italic">ge, gi</hi>
                    may be represented by <hi rend="italic">ehe</hi><hi rend="italic">(ke),</hi>
                    &amp;c.; but this appearance of special antiquity is really illusory (see <hi
                    rend="italic">Arch.,</hi> ii. 143-4). The nexus <hi rend="italic">cl,</hi>
                    &amp;c., may be maintained in thebeginning of words <hi rend="italic">(claru,
                    plus);</hi> but if they are in the body of the word they usually undergo
                    resolutions which, closely related though they be to those of Italian, sometimes
                    bring about very singular results <hi rend="italic">(e.g. ulare,</hi> which by
                    the intermediate forms <hi rend="italic">uscare, usjare</hi> leads back to <hi
                    rend="italic">usclare — ustlarc —</hi><hi rend="italic">ustulare).</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">NA</hi> is the representative of <hi rend="italic">nj
                    (testim6niu</hi> &amp;c.); and <hi rend="italic">lj</hi> is reduced to <hi
                    rend="italic">i</hi> alone <hi rend="italic">(e.g.,</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >mé&amp;us,</hi> melius; Campidanese <hi rend="italic">mellus).</hi> For <hi
                    rend="italic">ll</hi> a frequent substitute is <hi rend="italic">(Id·,
                    massiclcla,</hi> maxilla, &amp;c. Quite characteristic is the continual
                    labialization of the formulae <hi rend="italic">qua, gua, cu, gu,</hi> &amp;c.;
                    <hi rend="italic">e.g., ebba,</hi> equa; <hi rend="italic">sambenc,</hi>
                    sanguine (see <hi rend="italic">Arch.,</hi> ii. 143). The dropping of the
                    primary <hi rend="italic">d (roere,</hi> rodere, &amp;c.) but not of the
                    secondary <hi rend="italic">(finidu, sanidade, madum)</hi> is frequent.
                    Characteristic also is the Logudorese prothesis of <hi rend="italic">i</hi>
                    before <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit13newyrich/page/n515/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0913-0515-0494"/> the initial s followed by a consonant <hi
                    rend="italic">(iscamnu, istella., ispada),</hi> like the prothesis of <hi
                    rend="italic">e</hi> in Spain and in France (see <hi rend="italic">Arch.,</hi>
                    iii. 447 <hi rend="italic">sqq.).</hi> —In the order of the present discussion
                    it is in connexion with this territory that we are for the first time led to
                    consider those phonetic changes in words of which the cause is merely
                    syntactical or transitory, and chiefly those passing accidents which occur to
                    the initial consonant through the historically legitimate or the merely
                    analogical action of the final sound that precedes it. The general explanation
                    of such phenomena reduces itself to this that, given the intimate syntactic
                    relation of two words, the initial consonant of the second retains or modifies
                    its character as it would retain or modify it if the two words were one. The
                    Celtic languages are especially distinguished by this peculiarity; and among the
                    dialects of Upper Italy the Bergamasc oilers a clear example. This dialect is
                    accustomed to drop the <hi rend="italic">v,</hi> whether primary or secondary,
                    between vowels in the individual vocables <hi rend="italic">(cad,</hi> cavare;
                    <hi rend="italic">fda,</hi> fava, &amp;c.), but to preserve it if it is preceded
                    by a consonant <hi rend="italic">(serva,</hi> &amp;c.).—And similarly in
                    syntactic combination we have, for example, <hi rend="italic">de i,</hi> di
                    vino; but <hi rend="italic">ol vi,</hi> il vino. Insular, southern, and central
                    Italy furnish a large number of such phenomena; for Sardinia we shall simply
                    cite a single class, which is at once obvious and easily explained, viz., that
                    represented by <hi rend="italic">su</hi><hi rend="italic">oe,</hi> il bove,
                    alongside of <hi rend="italic">sos</hi><hi rend="italic">boes,</hi> i buoi (c∕.
                    <hi rend="italic">Here,</hi> bibere; <hi rend="italic">erba).—</hi> The article
                    is derived from <hi rend="italic">ipse</hi> instead of from <hi rend="italic"
                    >ille:</hi><hi rend="italic">su</hi><hi rend="italic">sos,</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >sa sas,</hi> —again a geographical anticipation of Spain, which in the Catalan
                    of the Balearic islands still preserves the article from <hi rend="italic"
                    >ipse.—</hi> A special connexion with Spain exists besides in the <hi
                    rend="italic">nomine</hi> type of inflexion, which is constant among the
                    Sardinians (Spanish <hi rend="italic">nomne,</hi> &amp;c., whence <hi
                    rend="italic">nombre,</hi> &amp;c. ), <hi rend="italic">nomen, no-nιene,
                    rdmine,</hi> aeramine, <hi rend="italic">legιιmene,</hi> &amp;c. (see <hi
                    rend="italic">Arch.,</hi> ii. 429 <hi rend="italic">sqq.).—</hi> Especially
                    noteworthy in the conjugation of the verb is the paradigm <hi rend="italic"
                    >cautère, cautères,</hi> &amp;c., <hi rend="italic">timbre,</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">timbres,</hi> &amp;c., precisely in the sense of the imperfect
                    subjunctive <hi rend="italic">(cf.</hi> A. 1; <hi rend="italic">cf.</hi> C. 3
                    δ). Next comes the analogical and almost corrupt diffusion of the <hi
                    rend="italic">-si</hi> of the ancient strong perfects (such <hi rend="italic"
                    >a&amp;posi,</hi><hi rend="italic">rosi),</hi> by which <hi rend="italic"
                    >cantesi, timesi</hi> (cantavi, timui), <hi rend="italic">dolfesi,</hi> dolui,
                    are reached. Proof of the use and even the abuse of the strong perfects is
                    afforded, however, by the participles and the infinitives of the category to
                    which belong the following examples: <hi rend="italic">ténnidu,</hi> tenuto; <hi
                    rend="italic">pàrfidu,,</hi> pareo; <hi rend="italic">bdlfidtι,</hi> valso; <hi
                    rend="italic">ténnere-,</hi><hi rend="italic">bdlere,</hi> &amp;c. <hi
                    rend="italic">(Arch.,</hi> ii. 432-33). The future, finally, shows the
                    unagglutinated periphrasis: <hi rend="italic">hapo a mandigare</hi> (ho a
                    mangiarc = manger-ό); as indeed the unagglutinated forms of the future and the
                    conditional occur in ancient vernacular texts of other Italian districts.—There
                    are documents of the Sardinian dialect going back as far as the middle of the
                    12th century.</p>

                <p>1. <hi rend="italic">Venetian.—</hi> Between “Venetian” and “Venetie” several
                    distinctions must be drawn <hi rend="italic">(Arch.,</hi> i. 391 <hi
                    rend="italic">sqq.).</hi> At the present day the population of the Venetian
                    cities is ‘^Venetian” in language, but the country districts are in various ways
                    Venetie.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>On this point
                    see the chapter, “La teιτa forma veneta considerata in ispecie ne' suoi rapport:
                    con la sezione centrale della zona ladina,” in <hi rend="italic">Arch.,</hi> i.
                    406-47.</p></note> The ancient language of Venice itself and of its estuary was
                    not a little different from that of the present time; and the Ladin vein was
                    particularly evident (see A. 2). A more purely Italian vein —the historical
                    explanation of which presents an attractive problem—has ultimately gained the
                    mastery and determined the “Venetian” type which has since diffused itself so
                    vigorously.— In the Venetian, then, we do not find the most distinctive
                    characteristics of the dialects of Upper Italy comprised under the denomination
                    Gallo-Italic (see B. 1),—neither the <hi rend="italic">ii</hi> nor the <hi
                    rend="italic">(i,</hi> nor the velar and faucal nasals, nor the Gallic
                    resolution of the <hi rend="italic">ct,</hi> nor the frequent elision of
                    unaccented vowels, nor the great redundancy of pronouns. On the contrary, the
                    pure Italian diphthong of &lt;5 <hi rend="italic">(e.g., cu6r)</hi> is heard,
                    and the diphthong of <hi rend="italic">ê</hi> is in full currency <hi
                    rend="italic">(diéze,</hi> dieci, &amp;c.). Nevertheless the Venetian approaches
                    the type of Northern Italy, or diverges notably from that of Central Italy, by
                    the following phonetic phenomena :—the ready elision of primary or secondary <hi
                    rend="italic">cl</hi><hi rend="italic">(eruo,</hi> crudo; <hi rend="italic"
                    >séa,</hi> seta, &amp;c. ); the regular <hi rend="superscript"> -</hi> reduction
                    of the surd into the sonant guttural <hi rend="italic">(e.g., cuogo,</hi> Ital.
                    cuoco, coquus); the pure <hi rend="italic">c</hi> in the resolution of <hi
                    rend="italic">cl (e.g., cave,</hi> clave; <hi rend="italic">oréca,</hi>
                    auricula); the <hi rend="italic">i</hi> for <hi rend="italic">éj (éôvene,</hi> I
                    tai. giovane); ç for <hi rend="italic">S</hi> and c <hi rend="italic"
                    >(péçe,</hi> Ital. pesce; <hi rend="italic">çiél,</hi> Ital. cielo). <hi
                    rend="italic">Lj</hi> preceded by any vowel, primary or secondary, except <hi

                    >faméja,</hi> familia. No Italian dialect is more averse than the Venetian to
                    the doubling of consonants.—In the morphology the use of the 3d singular for the
                    3d plural also, and the analogical participle in <hi rend="italic">eslo</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">(taécsto,</hi> I tai. taciuto, &amp;c.; see <hi rend="italic"
                    >Arch.,</hi> iv. 393 <hi rend="italic">sqq.)</hi> are particularly noteworthy. A
                    curious double relic of Ladin influence is the interrogative type represented by
                    the example <hi rend="italic">crédis-tu,</hi> credis tu,—where apart from the
                    interrogation <hi rend="italic">ti crcdi</hi> would be used.—The texts of the
                    Venetian vernacular take us back to the first half of the 13th century. To the
                    beginning of the 14th belongs the <hi rend="italic">Τrattato “de</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">regimine rec</hi><hi rend="italic">toris"</hi> of Fra Paolino,
                    also in the Venetian dialect. For other ancient sources relating to Venice, the
                    estuary of Venice, Verona, and Padua, see <hi rend="italic">Arch.,</hi> i. 448,
                    465, 421-22; iii. 245-47.</p>
                <p>2. <hi rend="italic">Corsican.—</hi> If the “Venetian,” in spite of its peculiar
                    “Italianity,” has naturally special points of contact with the other dialects of
                    Upper Italy (B. 1), the Corsican in like manner, particularly in its southern
                    varieties, has special points of contact with Sardinian proper (B. 2). Thus for
                    example, in <hi rend="italic">boglio</hi><hi rend="italic">leche</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">lu</hi><hi rend="italic">bunnetnι</hi> (voglio lasciar la
                    gonnella) from a song of Fiumorban Corsican there is a phonetic phenomenon <hi
                    rend="italic">(ba</hi> from <hi rend="italic">gu)</hi> which reveals a connexion
                    with Sardinian proper, as well as a morphological phenomenon which implies the
                    same relation, since <hi rend="italic">lechc</hi> must be a verb of the first
                    conjugation <hi rend="italic">(lagdr e</hi> in Upper Italy; see, for example,
                    <hi rend="italic">Arch.,</hi> i. 546) conformed to the analogy of strong verbs
                    as found in Sardinian in the case of <hi rend="italic">ndrrcre,</hi> narrare,
                    or, for a verb of the fourth conjugation, in Corsican rêne, Sardinian <hi
                    rend="italic">bénnere</hi> =venire.—In general, it is in the southern section of
                    the island, which, geographically even, is farthest removed from Tuscany, that
                    the most characteristic forms of speech are found. The unaccented vowels are
                    undisturbed; but w for the Tuscan o is common to almost all the island,—an
                    insular phenomenon <hi rend="italic">par excellence</hi> which connects Corsica
                    with Sardiniaancl with Sicily, and indeed with Liguria also. So also <hi
                    rend="italic">-i</hi> for the Tuscan <hi rend="italic">-e (latti,</hi> latte;
                    <hi rend="italic">li cateni,</hi> le catene), which prevails chiefly in the
                    southern section, is also found in Southern Sardinian, and is common to Sicily.
                    It is needless to add that this tendency to <hi rend="italic">u</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">i</hi> manifests itself, more or less decidedly, also within the
                    words. Corsican, too, avoids the diphthongs of ti and <hi rend="italic">ti (ρe,
                    cri; cori,foraf,</hi> but, unlike Sardinian, it treats t and ⅛ in the Italian
                    fashion: <hi rend="italic">beju,</hi> bibo; <hi rend="italic">peveru,</hi>
                    piper; <hi rend="italic">pesci; noci,</hi> nuces.—It is one of its
                    characteristics to reduce <hi rend="italic">a</hi> to <hi rend="italic">e</hi>
                    in the formula <hi rend="italic">ar</hi> + a consonant <hi rend="italic"
                    >(chérnc, bérba,</hi> &amp;c.), which should be compared particularly with the
                    Emilian examples of the same phenomenon <hi rend="italic">(Arch.,</hi> ii. 133,
                    144-50). But the gerund in <hi rend="italic">-endu</hi> of the first conjugation
                    <hi rend="italic">(turnemlu, lagrimendu,</hi> &amp;c.) must on the contrary be
                    considered as a phenomenon of analogy, as it is especially recognized in the
                    Sardinian dialects, to all of which it is common (see <hi rend="italic"
                    >Arch.,</hi> ii. 133). And the same is most probably the case with forms of the
                    present participle <hi rend="italic">}ikemerchente,</hi> mercante, in spite of
                    <hi rend="italic">enzi</hi> and <hi rend="italic">innenzi</hi> (anzi, innanzi),
                    in which latter forms there may probably be traced the effect of the Neo-Latin
                    <hi rend="italic">i</hi> which availed to reduce the <hi rend="italic">t</hi> of
                    the Latin <hi rend="italic">ante</hi>; alongside of them we find also <hi
                    rend="italic">anzi</hi> and <hi rend="italic">nantu.</hi> —In Southern Corsican
                    <hi rend="italic">dr</hi> for <hi rend="italic">ll</hi> is conspicuous—a
                    phenomenon which also connects Corsica with Sardinia, Sicily, and a good part of
                    Southern Italy (see C. 2; <hi rend="italic">and Arch.</hi> ii. 135, &amp;c). An
                    acute observer (Falcucci) has asserted that even the phenomena of <hi
                    rend="italic">rn</hi> and <hi rend="italic">nd</hi> both changing into <hi
                    rend="italic">nn</hi> are found in certain veins of Southern Corsican; but he
                    has given no examples. The former of these would connect Corsican with Sardinian
                    <hi rend="italic">(coτnι,</hi> cornu; <hi rend="italic">carre,</hi> carne,
                    &amp;c.); the latter more especially with Sicily, &amp;c., though it is not
                    unknown even in Sardinia <hi rend="italic">(Arch.,</hi> ii.142, 143).—As to
                    phonetic phenomena connected with syntax, already noticed in B. 2, space admits
                    the following examples only: Cors, <hi rend="italic">na vella,</hi> una bella,
                    <hi rend="italic">e bella</hi><hi rend="italic">(cbbélla,</hi> et bella); <hi
                    rend="italic">lujallu,</hi> lo gallo, <hi rend="italic">gran ghiallu∙, cf.
                    Arch.,</hi> ii. 136 (135, 150). As Tomrnaseo has already noted, <hi
                    rend="italic">-one</hi> is for the Corsicans not less than for the French a
                    termination of diminution: <hi rend="italic">e.g., fratedronu,</hi>
                    fratellino.—In the first person of the conditional the <hi rend="italic">b</hi>
                    is maintained <hi rend="italic">(e.g., farebc,</hi> farei), as even at Rome and
                    elsewhere. Lastly, the series of Corsican verbs of the derivative ordeι∙ which
                    run alongside of the Italian series of the original order, and may be
                    represented by the example <hi rend="italic">dissiρcghja,</hi> dissipa
                    (Falcucci), is to be compared with the Sicilian series represented by <hi
                    rend="italic">cuadiari,</hi> riε-caldare, <hi rend="italic">curρidri,</hi>
                    colpire <hi rend="italic">(Arch.,</hi> ii. 151).</p>
                <p>3. <hi rend="italic">Dialects of Sicily and of the Neapolitan Provinces.—</hi>
                    Here the territories on both sides of the Strait of Messina will first be
                    treated together, chiefly with the view of noting their common linguistic
                    peculiarities.—Characteristic then of these parts, as compared with Upper Italy
                    and even with Sardinia, is, generally speaking, the tenacity of the explosive
                    elements of the Latin bases, <hi rend="italic">(cf. Arch.,</hi> ii. 154,
                    &amp;c.). Not that these consonants are constantly preserved uninjured; their
                    degradations, and especially the Neapolitan degradation of the surd into the
                    sonant, are even more frequent than is shown by the dialect as written, but
                    their disappearance is comparatively rather rare; and even the degradations,
                    whether regard be had to the conjunctures in which they occur or to their
                    specific quality, are very different from those of the dialects of Upper Italy.
                    Thus, the <hi rend="italic">t</hi> between vowels ordinarily remains intact in
                    Sicilian and Neapolitan <hi rend="italic">(e.g.,</hi> Sicil. <hi rend="italic"
                    >sita,</hi> Neap, <hi rend="italic">seta,</hi> seta, where in the dialects of
                    Upper Italy we should have <hi rend="italic">scda, scaj∙,</hi> and in the
                    Neapolitan dialects it is reduced to <hi rend="italic">d</hi> when it is
                    preceded by <hi rend="italic">n</hi> or <hi rend="italic">r (e.g., viende,</hi>
                    vento), which is precisely a collocation in which the <hi rend="italic">t</hi>
                    would be maintained intact in Upper Italy. The <hi rend="italic">d,</hi> on the
                    other hand, is not resolved by elision, but by its reduction tor <hi
                    rend="italic">(e.g.,</hi> Sicil. <hi rend="italic">virire,</hi> Neap, dialects
                    <hi rend="italic">verb,</hi> vedere), a phenomenon which has been frequently
                    compared, perhaps with too little caution, with the <hi rend="italic">d</hi>
                    passing into?·« (d)in the Umbrian inscriptions. The Neapolitan reduction of <hi
                    rend="italic">nt</hi> into <hi rend="italic">ml</hi> has its analogies in the
                    reduction of <hi rend="italic">no (nk)</hi> into <hi rend="italic">ng,</hi> and
                    of <hi rend="italic">mp</hi> into <hi rend="italic">mb,</hi> which is also a
                    feature of the Neapolitan dialects, and in that of <hi rend="italic">ns</hi>
                    into <hi rend="italic">n£;</hi> and here and there <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit13newyrich/page/n516/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0913-0516-0495"/> we even find a reduction of <hi rend="italic"
                    >nf</hi> into <hi rend="italic">mb (nf, nr, nb, mb),</hi> both in Sicilian and
                    Neapolitan <hi rend="italic">(e.g.,</hi> at Casteltemιini in Sicily ’ <hi
                    rend="italic">rnbiemu,</hi> inferno, and in the Abrιιzzi <hi rend="italic"
                    >cumbonn', 'mbonn',</hi> confondere, in-fondere). Here we find ourselves in a
                    series of phenomena to which it may seem that some special contributions were
                    furnished by Oscan and Umbrian <hi rend="italic">(nt, mp, no</hi> into <hi
                    rend="italic">nd,</hi> &amp;c.), but for which more secure and general, and so
                    to say “isothermal,” analogies are found in modern Greek and Albanian. The
                    Sicilian does not appear to fit in here as far as the formulae <hi rend="italic"
                    >nt</hi> and <hi rend="italic">mρ</hi> are concerned; it rather agrees with the
                    Neapolitan through <hi rend="italic">rt</hi> passing into <hi rend="italic"
                    >rd</hi>; and it may even be said to go counter to this tendency by reducing <hi
                    rend="italic">nj</hi> to <hi rend="italic">nc (e.g., punciri,</hi> pungere).
                    Nay, even in the passing of the sonant into the surd, the Neapolitan dialects
                    would yield special and important contributions (nor is even the Sicilian
                    limited to the case just specified), among which we will only mention the change
                    of <hi rend="italic">d</hi> between vowels into iin the last syllable of
                    proparoxytones <hi rend="italic">(e.g., ummetv,</hi> umido). From these series
                    of sonants changing into surds comes a peculiar feature of the southern
                    dialects.—A pretty common characteristic is the regular progressive assimilation
                    by which <hi rend="italic">nd</hi> is reduced to <hi rend="italic">nn, mb</hi>
                    to <hi rend="italic">mm,</hi> and even <hi rend="italic">nv</hi> also to <hi
                    rend="italic">mm (nν, nb, mb, mm), e.g.,</hi> Sicil. <hi rend="italic"
                    >iinniri,</hi> Neap, <hi rend="italic">Sénnere,</hi> scendere; Sicil. <hi
                    rend="italic">chiummu,</hi> Neap, <hi rend="italic">chiumme,</hi> piombo; Sicil.
                    and Neap, <hi rend="italic">'mmidia,</hi> invidia. As belonging to this class of
                    phenomena the Palaeo-Italic analogy <hi rend="italic">(nd</hi> into <hi
                    rend="italic">nn, n),</hi> of which the Umbrian furnishes special evidence,
                    readily suggests itself.—Another important common characteristic is the
                    reduction of <hi rend="italic">p&gt;j, bj, fj,</hi> to <hi rend="italic">c (kj),
                    j, S (&lt;f.</hi> the Genoese; B. 1), whence, <hi rend="italic">c.g.,</hi>
                    Sicil. <hi rend="italic">chianu,</hi> Neap, <hi rend="italic">chiane,</hi> piano
                    (piano, pljano, pjano); Sicil. <hi rend="italic">sicca,</hi> Neap, <hi

                    Neap. <hi rend="italic">Sore,</hi> fiore.—Further is to be noted the tendency to
                    the sibilation of <hi rend="italic">ce,</hi><hi rend="italic">ci</hi> for which
                    Sicil. <hi rend="italic">jazzu,</hi> ghiaccio, and Neap. <hi rend="italic"
                    >lizele,</hi> lecito, may serve as examples <hi rend="italic">(Arch.</hi>, ii.
                    149),—a tendency more particularly betrayed in Upper Italy.—There is a common
                    inclination also to elide the initial unaccented palatal vowel, and to prefix
                    <hi rend="italic">a,</hi> especially before <hi rend="italic">r</hi> (this
                    second tendency is found likewise in Southern Sardinian, &amp;c.; <hi
                    rend="italic">see Arch.,</hi> ii. 138); <hi rend="italic">e.g.,</hi> Sicil. <hi
                    rend="italic">’nténniri,</hi> Neap, <hi rend="italic">’ndénuere,</hi> intendere;
                    Sicil. <hi rend="italic">arricamAri,</hi> Neap, <hi rend="italic"
                    >arragamure,</hi> ricamare (see <hi rend="italic">Arch.,</hi> ii. 150).—In
                    complete contrast to the tendency to get rid of double consonants which has been
                    particularly noted in Venetian (0. 1), wehere come to the great division of
                    Italy where the tendency grows strong to gemination (or the doubling of
                    consonants); and the Neapolitan in this respect goes farther than the Sicilian
                    <hi rend="italic">(c.g.,</hi> Sicil. <hi rend="italic">doppu,</hi> dopo; <hi
                    rend="italic">'nsemmula,</hi> insieme, in-simul; Neap, <hi rend="italic"

                    rend="italic">débbole).</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi> As to the phonetic
                    phenomena connected with the syntax (see B. 2), it is sufficient to cite such
                    Sicilian examples as <hi rend="italic">ni&amp;una ronna,</hi> nesuna donna,
                    alongside of <hi rend="italic">c'</hi><hi rend="italic">é</hi><hi rend="italic"

                <p>We now proceed to the special consideration, first, of the Sicilian and,

                    vocalism is conspicuously etymological. Though differing in colour from the

                    contact. The dominant variety ignores the diphthongs of <hi rend="italic">é</hi>

                    correspond to the open c and <hi rend="italic">o</hi> of the Tuscan. And if in
                    some cases the Sicilian appears to be exceptional <hi rend="italic"
                    >(stidda,</hi> stella; <hi rend="italic">vinniri,</hi> vendere; <hi
                    rend="italic">furma,</hi> &amp;c.), it usually corresponds even in this with the
                    Tuscan, where also we find the same apparent exception of the closed instead of
                    the open vowel <hi rend="italic">(stella, vendere,</hi><hi rend="italic"

                    >lj</hi> into <hi rend="italic">ghj (c.g., figghiu,</hi> figlio) and of <hi

                    vernacular group of the two Further Calabria4) may be fairly considered as a
                    continuation of the Sicilian type, as is seen from the following examples :— <hi

                    treccia (here thed of the nexus nd, however, is not subject to the assimilation
                    which is common to Sicilian and Neapolitan in general: <hi rend="italic">e.g.,
                    quandu, cangendu,</hi> piangendo). Even the Λ <hi rend="italic">iorS≈fj,</hi> as
                    in <hi rend="italic">hurt</hi> (Sicil. <hi rend="italic">Suri,</hi> fiore),
                    which is characteristic in Calabrian, has its forerunners in the island (see <hi
                    rend="italic">Arch.,</hi> ii. 456). Along the coast of the extreme south of
                    Italy, when once we have passed the interruptions caused by the Basilisco type
                    (so called from the Basilicata), the Sicilian vocalism again presents itself in
                    the Otrantine, especially in the seaboard of Capo di Leuca. In the Lecce variety
                    of the Otrantine the vocalism which has just been described as Sicilian also
                    keeps its ground in the main <hi rend="italic">(cf.</hi> Morosi, <hi
                    rend="italic">Arch.,</hi> iv.): <hi rend="italic">sira,</hi> sera; <hi

                    phenomenon of <hi rend="italic">lj</hi> into <hi rend="italic">ghj
                    (figghiu,</hi> figlio, &amp;c.) is well marked in Terra d’Otranto and also in
                    Terra di Bari, and even extends through the Capitanata and the Basilicata <hi
                    rend="italic">(cf.</hi> D’Ovidio, <hi rend="italic">Arch.,</hi> iv. 159-60). As
                    strongly marked in the Terra d’Otranto is the insular phenomenon of <hi
                    rend="italic">ll</hi> into dd <hi rend="italic">(clr),</hi> which is also very
                    widely distributed through the Neapolitan territories on the eastern side of the
                    Apennines, sending outshoots even to the Abruzzo. But in Terra d’Otranto we are
                    already in the midst of the diphthongs of <hi rend="italic">é</hi> and of o,
                    both non-positional and positional, the development or permanence of which is
                    determined by the quality of the unaccented final vowel,—as generally happens in
                    the dialects of the south. The diphthongal product of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >t&gt;,</hi> and hence also of the <hi rend="italic">6</hi> of position, is here
                    <hi rend="italic">uc.</hi> The following are examples from the Lecce variety of
                    the dialect: <hi rend="italic">core,</hi> pl. <hi rend="italic">cueri; metu,
                    mieti, mete,</hi> mieto, mieti, miete (Lat. metere); <hi rend="italic">sentm,

                    the fundamental reduction which belongs to the Gallic (not to speak of the
                    Spanish) regions, and stretches through the Terra di Bari, where there are other
                    diphthongs curiously suggestive of the Gallic: <hi rend="italic">e.g.,</hi> at
                    Bitonto alongside of <hi rend="italic">lueche,</hi> luogo, <hi rend="italic"
                    >mienne,</hi> sonno, we have the <hi rend="italic">oi</hi> and the <hi
                    rend="italic">ai</hi> from <hi rend="italic">i</hi> or <hi rend="italic">e</hi>
                    of the previous phase <hi rend="italic">(vecoine,</hi> vicino), and the αtt from
                    <hi rend="italic">o</hi> of the previous phase <hi rend="italic">(anaure.,</hi>
                    onore), besides a diphthongal disturbance of the Here also occurs the change of
                    <hi rend="italic">A</hi> into an <hi rend="italic">e</hi> more or less pure
                    (thus, at Cisternino, <hi rend="italic">scunsulête,</hi> sconsolata; at Canosa
                    di Puglia, <hi rend="italic">arniête,</hi> arrivata; <hi rend="italic"
                    >n-ghèpe,</hi> “in capa,” that is, in capo); to which may be added the continual
                    weakening or elision of the unaccented vowels not only at the end but in the
                    body of the word (thus, at Bitonto, <hi rend="italic">vendett, spranz).</hi> A
                    similar type meets us as we cross into Capitanata (Cerignola: <hi rend="italic"
                    >facAive,</hi> facera; <hi rend="italic">affêise,</hi> offese; <hi rend="italic"
                    >sfazidnne,</hi> soddisfazione; <hi rend="italic">n'-ghêipe,</hi> in capo; <hi

                    arrabbiato); such forms being apparently the outposts of the Abruzzan, which,
                    however, is only reached through the Molise—a district not very populous even
                    now, and still more thinly peopled in bygone days—whose prevailing forms of
                    speech in some measure interrupt the historical continuity of the dialects of
                    the Adriatic versant, presenting, as it were, an irruption from the other side
                    of the Apennines. In the head valley of the Molise, at Agnone, the legitimate
                    precursors of the Abruzzan vernaculars reappear <hi rend="italic">(fatoica,</hi>

                    dependent on the <hi rend="italic">i</hi> formerly heard in the end of the word;
                    <hi rend="italic">cf. maltrattata, sperava,</hi> &amp;c. ). The following are
                    pure Abruzzan examples. (1) From Bucchianico (Abruzzo Citeriore): <hi

                    is seen that the reduction of the <hi rend="italic">A</hi> depends on the
                    quality of the final unaccented vowel, and that it is not produced exclusively
                    by <hi rend="italic">i,</hi> which would give rise to a further reduction: <hi
                    rend="italic">scillarite,</hi> scellerati; <hi rend="italic">umpire,</hi>
                    impâri). (2) From Pratola Peligna (Abruzzo Ulteriore II.): <hi rend="italic"

                    >vennecA,</hi> vendi-care). It almost appears that a continuity with Emilian
                    ought to be established across the Marches (where another irruption of greater
                    “Italianity” has taken place: a third of more dubious origin has been indicated
                    for Venice, C. 1); see <hi rend="italic">Arch.,</hi> ii. 445. A negative
                    characteristic for Abruzzan is theabseuce of <hi rend="italic">c≈pj</hi> and of

                    reduction,—the ancient formulae sometimes occurring intact (as in the Bergamasc

                    reached.—For the rest, when the condition and connexions of the vowel system
                    still retained by so large a proportion of the dialects of the eastern versant
                    of the Neapolitan Apennines, and the difference which exists in regard to the
                    preservation of the unaccented vowels between the Ligurian and the Gallo-Italic
                    forms of speech on the other versant of the northern Apennines, are considered,
                    one cannot fail to see how much justice there is in the longitudinal oj
                    Apenninian partition of the Italian dialects indicated by Dante. ^- But, to
                    continue, in the Basilicata, which drains into the Gulf of Taranto, and may be
                    said to lie within the Apennines, not only is the elision of final unaccented
                    vowels a prevailing characteristic; there are also frequent elisions of the
                    unaccented vowels within the word. Thus at Matera: <hi rend="italic">sintenn
                    lafemn chessa c6s,</hi> sen-tendo la femina questa cosa; <hi rend="italic"

                    even if we return to the Mediterranean versant and, leaving the Sicilian type of
                    the Calabrias, retrace our steps till we pass into the Neapolitan pure and
                    simple, we find that even in Naples the unaccented final vowels behave badly,
                    the labial turning to <hi rend="italic">} (bflle,</hi> bello) and even the <hi
                    rend="italic">a (bella)</hi> being greatly weakened. And here <pb break="no"

                    mention: while Latin was accustomed, to drop the <hi rend="italic">u</hi> of its
                    nominative only in presence of <hi rend="italic">r (gencr</hi> from *gener-u-s,

                    &amp;c. ), Oscan and. Umbrian go much further: Oscan, hurz=*hort-u-s, Lat.

                    emptus, &amp;c. In Umbrian inscriptions we find <hi rend="italic">u</hi>
                    alternating with the <hi rend="italic">a</hi> of the nom. sing. fem. and plur.
                    neut. In complete contrast with the Sicilian vocalism is the Neapolitan e for
                    unaccented and particularly final <hi rend="italic">i</hi> of the Latin and
                    Neo-Latin or Italian phases <hi rend="italic">(e.g., viene,</hi> vieni; <hi
                    rend="italic">cf. infra},</hi> to say nothing further of the regular
                    diphthongization, within certain limits, of accented <hi rend="italic">e</hi> or

                    insertions of vowels to obviate certain collocations: hence <hi rend="italic"

                    difference of termination. Thus <hi rend="italic">cosetore,</hi> cucitore, pl.

                <p>Passing now to a cursory mention of purely morphological phenomena, we begin with
                    that form which is referred to the Latin pluperfect (see A. 1, B. 2), but which
                    here too performs the functions of the conditional. Examples from the living
                    dialects of (1) Calabria Citeriore are∕αcerw, farei (Castrovillari); <hi
                    rend="italic">tute</hi><hi rend="italic">lacollerre,</hi> tu te Γacolleresti
                    (Cosenza); <hi rend="italic">l'accettéra,</hi> Γaccetterebbe (Grimaldi); and
                    from those of (2) the Abruzzi, <hi rend="italic">vulér’,</hi> vorrei (Castelli);
                    <hi rend="italic">dere,</hi> darei (Atessa); <hi rend="italic">candére,</hi>
                    canterei. For the dialects of the Abruzzi, we can check our observations by
                    examples from the oldest chronicle of Aquila, as <hi rend="italic">non</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">habéra</hi><hi rend="italic">lassato,</hi> non avrebbe lasciato
                    (str. 180). There are some interesting remains (more or less corrupted both in
                    form and usage) of ancient consonantal terminations which have not yet been
                    sufficiently studied: s’ <hi rend="italic">incaricaviti,</hi> s’ incaricava,
                    -abat (Basilicata, Senise); <hi rend="italic">ebbiti,</hi> ebbe <hi

                    >arrivaudi,</hi> arrivb <hi rend="italic">(fb. ).</hi> The last example also
                    gives the <hi rend="italic">-an</hi> of the 3d pers. sing, perf. of the first
                    conjugation, which still occurs in Sicily and between the horns of the
                    Neapolitan mainland. In the Abruzzi (and in the Ascolan district) the 3d person
                    of the plural is in process of disappearing (the <hi rend="italic">-no</hi>
                    having fallen away and the preceding vowel being obscured), and its function is
                    assumed by the 3d person singular; <hi rend="italic">cf.</hi> C. L The
                    explanation of the Neapolitan forms <hi rend="italic">songhe,</hi> io sono, essi

                    sto, as also of the enclitic of the 2d person plural which exists, <hi

                    <hi rend="italic">avisiere,</hi> aveste, has been correctly given more than
                    once. It may be remarked in conclusion that this Neo-Latin region keeps company
                    with the Roumanian in maintaining in large use the <hi rend="italic">-ora</hi>
                    derived from the ancient neuter plurals of the type <hi rend="italic"
                    >tempora·.</hi> Sicil. <hi rend="italic">j6cura,</hi> giuochi; Calabr. <hi
                    rend="italic">nidura,</hi> Abruzz. <hi rend="italic">nidere,</hi> nidi. As for
                    literary documents, if mere fragments and dubious instances are left out of
                    account, Sicilian poetry goes back as far as to the first half of the 13th
                    century, to which century also the chronicles written in Sicilian extend; but
                    either the copies which we possess are not contemporary or the paleographic key
                    of the readings preserved, to us is wanting. In the library of Naples, some MSS.
                    of the 14th century contain poetical translations of which the dialect would
                    seem to belong to the Mediterranean versant of the southern provinces. The old
                    rhymed chronicle of Aquila, which has been referred to more than once above,
                    belongs to the 14th century.</p>

                    particularly characteristic of Rome, is a phenomenon common to the Aquilan
                    dialect. Similar facts might be adduced in abundance. And it is to be noted that
                    the features common to Umbro-Roman and the Neapolitan dialects must have been
                    more numerous in the past, as this was the region where the Tuscan current met
                    the southern, and by reason of its superior culture gradually gained the
                    ascendency.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>There is
                    therefore nothing surprising in the fact that, for example, the chronicle of

                    Gallo-Italic type have already been indicated (B. 2). In what relates to
                    morphology, the <hi rend="italic">-orno</hi> of the 3d pers. plur. of the
                    perfect of the first conjugation has been pointed out as an essential
                    peculiarity of the Umbro-Roman territory; but even this it shares with the
                    Aquila vernaculars, which, moreover, extend it to the other paradigms: <hi

                    region should also belong a “Confession,” half Latin half vernacular, dating

                <p>D. <hi rend="italic">Tuscan, and the literary language of the Italians.</hi></p>
                <p>We have now only to deal with the Tuscan territory. It is bounded on the W. by
                    the sea. To the north it terminates with the Apennines; for Romagna Toscana, the
                    strip of country on the Adriatic versant which belongs to it administratively,
                    is assigned to Emilia as regards dialect. In the north-west also the Emilian
                    presses on the Tuscan, extending as it does down the Mediterranean slope of the
                    Apennines in Lunigiana and Garfagnana. Intrusions which may be called Emilian
                    have also beeιj noted to the west of the Apennines in the district where the
                    Arno and the Tiber take their rise (Aretine dialects); and it has been seen how
                    thence to the sea the Umbrian and Roman dialects surround the Tuscan. Such are
                    the narrow limits of the “promised land” of the language which has succeeded and
                    was worthy to succeed Latin in the history of Italian culture and
                    civilization,—the land which comprises Florence, Siena, Lucca, and Pisa.—The
                    Tuscan type may be best described by the negative method. There do not exist in
                    it, on the one hand, any of those phenomena by which the other dialectal types
                    of Italy mainly differ from the Latin base (such as <hi rend="italic">ü</hi> =
                    ⅞; frequent elision of unaccented vowels; <hi rend="italic">ba=gua-, $=fl;
                    nn</hi><hi rend="italic">=</hi><hi rend="italic">nd,</hi> &amp;c.); nor, on the
                    other hand, is there any series of alterations of the Latin base peculiar to the
                    Tuscan. This twofold negative description may further serve for the Tuscan or
                    literary Italian as contrasted with all the other Neo-Latin languages; indeed,
                    even -where the Tuscan has a tendency to alterations common to other types of
                    the family, it shows itself more sober and self-denying,—as may be seen in the
                    reduction of the <hi rend="italic">t</hi> between vowels into <hi rend="italic"
                    >d</hi> or of <hi rend="italic">c (ff)</hi> between vowels into <hi
                    rend="italic">g,</hi> which in Italian affects only a small part of the lexical
                    series, while in Provençal or Spanish it may be said to pervade the whole <hi
                    rend="italic">(e.g.,</hi> Prov. and Span, <hi rend="italic">mudar,</hi> Ital.
                    <hi rend="italic">mutare</hi>; Prov. <hi rend="italic">segur,</hi> Span, <hi
                    rend="italic">seguro,</hi> Ital. <hi rend="italic">sicurd).</hi> It may
                    consequently be affirmed without any partiality that, in respect to historical
                    nobility, the Italian not only holds the first rank among Neo-Latin languages,
                    but almost constitutes an intermediate grade between the ancient or Latin and
                    the modern or Romance.—What has just been said about the Tuscan, as compared
                    with the other dialectal types of Italy, does not, however, preclude the fact
                    that in the various Tuscan veins, and especially in the plebeian forms of
                    speech, there occur particular instances of phonetic decay; but these must of
                    necessity be ignored in <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0913-0518-0497"/> so brief a sketch as the present. We shall
                    confine ourselves to noting—what has a wide territorial diffusion— the reduction
                    of <hi rend="italic">c (f)</hi> between vowels to a mere breathing <hi
                    rend="italic">(p.g., fuoho,</hi> fuoco, but <hi rend="italic">porco),</hi> or
                    even its complete elision; the same phenomenon occurs also between word and word
                    (e.&lt;∕., <hi rend="italic">la hasa,</hi> but <hi rend="italic">in</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">casa),</hi> thus illustrating anew that syntactic class of
                    phonetic alterations, either qualitative or quantitative, conspicuous in this
                    region also, which has been already discussed for insular and southern Italy (B.
                    2; C. 2, 3), and could be exemplified for the Roman region as well (C. 4). As
                    regards one or two individual phenomena, it must also be confessed that the
                    Tuscan or literary Italian is not so well preserved as some other Neo-Latin
                    tongues. Thus, French always keeps in the beginning of words the Latin formulae
                    <hi rend="italic">cl, pl, fl (clef,</hi><hi rend="italic">plaisir,</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">flcur,</hi> in contrast with the Italian <hi rend="italic">chiave,
                    p&gt;iacere,</hi><hi rend="italic">flore)',</hi> but the Italian makes up for
                    this by the greater vigour with which it is wont to resolve the same formula
                    within the words, and by the greater symmetry thus produced between the two
                    series (in opposition to the Frencjι <hi rend="italic">clef,</hi> clave, we
                    have, for example, the French <hi rend="italic">ceil,</hi> oclo; whereas, in the
                    Italian, <hi rend="italic">chiave</hi> and <hi rend="italic">occhio</hi>
                    correspond to each other). The Italian as well as the Roumanian has lost the
                    ancient sibilant at the end (-s of the plurals, of the nominative singular, of
                    the 2d persons, &amp;c.) which throughout the rest of the Romance area has been
                    preserved more or less tenaciously; and consequently it stands lower than old
                    Provençal and old French, as far as true declension or, more precisely, the
                    functional distinction between the forms of the <hi rend="italic">casus
                    rectus</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">casus</hi><hi rend="italic">obliquus</hi>
                    is concerned. But even in this respect the superiority of French and Provençal
                    has proved merely transitory, and in their modern condition all the Neo-Latin
                    forms of speech are generally surpassed by Italian even as regards the pure
                    grammatical consistency of the noun. In conjugation Tuscan has lost that tense
                    which for the sake of brevity we shall continue to call the pluperfect
                    indicative; though it still survives outside of Italy and in other dialectal
                    types of Italy itself (C. 3 <hi rend="italic">b; cf.</hi> B. 2). It has also
                    lost the <hi rend="italic">futurum exactum,</hi> or perfect subjunctive, which
                    is found in Spanish and Roumanian. But no one would on that account maintain
                    that the Italian conjugation is less truly Latin than the Spanish, the
                    Roumanian, or that of any other Neo-Latin language. It is, on the contrary, by
                    far the most distinctively Latin as regards the tradition both of form and
                    function, although many effects of the principle of analogy are to be observed,
                    sometimes common to Italian with the other Neo-Latin languages, and sometimes
                    peculiar to itself.</p>
                <p>Those who find it hard to believe in the ethnological explanation of linguistic
                    varieties ought to be convinced by any example so clear as that which Italy
                    presents in the difference between the Tuscan or purely Italian type on the one
                    side and the Gallo-Italic on the other. The names in this instance correspond
                    exactly to the facts of the case. For the Gallo-Italic on either side of the
                    Alps is evidently nothing else than a modification—varying in degree, but always
                    very great — of the vulgar Latin, due to the reaction of the language or rather
                    the oral tendencies of the Celts who succumbed to the Roman civilization. In
                    other words, the case is one of new ethnic individualities arising from the
                    fusion of two national entities, one of which, numerically more or less weak, is
                    so far victorious that its speech is adopted, while the other succeeds in
                    adapting that speech to its own habits of utterance. Genuine Italian, on the
                    other hand, is not the result of the combination or conflict of the vulgar Latin
                    with other tongues, but is the pure development of this alone. In other words,
                    the case is that of an ancient national fusion in which vulgar Latin itself
                    originated. Here that is native which in the other case was intrusive.—This
                    greater purity of constitution gives the language a persistency which approaches
                    permanent stability. There is no Old Italian to oppose to Modern Italian in the
                    same sense as we have an Old French to oppose to a Modern French. It is true
                    that in the old French writers, and even in the writers who used the dialects of
                    Upper Italy, there was a tendency to bring back the popular forms to their
                    ancient dignity; and it is true also that the Tuscan or literary Italian has
                    suffered from the changes of centuries; but nevertheless it remains undoubted
                    that in the former cases we have to deal with general transformations between
                    old and new, while in the latter it is evident that the language of Dante
                    continues to be the Italian of modern speech and literature. This character of
                    invariability has thus been in direct proportion to the purity of its Latin
                    origin, while, on the contrary, where popular Latin has been adopted by peoples
                    of foreign speech, the elaboration which it has undergone along the lines of
                    their oral tendencies becomes always the greater the farther we get away from
                    the point at which the Latin reached them,—in proportion, that is, to the time
                    and space through which it has been transmitted in these foreign mouths.<note

                    tendencies of the aboriginal races on whom it has been imposed. Thus the Pali
                    presents the ancient Aryan organism in a condition analogous to that of the

                <p>As for the primitive seat of the literary language of Italy, not only must it be
                    regarded as confined within the limits of that narrower Tuscany already
                    described; strictly speaking, it must be identified with the city of Florence
                    alone. Leaving out of account, therefore, a small number of words borrowed from
                    other Italian dialects, as a certain number have naturally been borrowed from
                    foreign tongues, it may be said that all that was not Tuscan was eliminated from
                    the literary form of speech. If we go back to the time of Dante we find,
                    throughout almost all the dialects of the mainland with the exception of Tuscan,
                    the change of vowels between singular and plural seen in <hi rend="italic"
                    >paese, ρaisi; quello, quilli;</hi><hi rend="italic">amore,</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">amuri</hi> (see B. 1; C. 3 <hi rend="italic">b)</hi>; but the
                    literary language knows nothing at all of such a phenomenon, because it was
                    unknown to the Tuscan region. But in Tuscan itself there were differences
                    between Florentine and non-Florentine; in Florentine, <hi rend="italic"
                    >e.g.,</hi> it was and is usual to say <hi rend="italic">dipignere</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">ρugnere,</hi> while the nonFlorentine had it <hi rend="italic"
                    >dipegnere</hi> and <hi rend="italic">pognere</hi> (Lat <hi rend="italic"
                    >pingere, pungere).</hi> Now, it is precisely the Florentine forms which alone
                    have currency in the literary language.</p>
                <p>In the ancient compositions in the vulgar tongue, especially in poetry,
                    non-Tuscan authors on the one hand accommodated their own dialect to the analogy
                    of that which they felt to be the purest representative of the language of
                    ancient Roman culture, while the Tuscan authors in their turn did not refuse to
                    adopt the forms which had received the rights of citizenship from the literary
                    celebrities of other parts of Italy. It was this state of matters which gave
                    rise, in past times, to the numerous disputes about the true fatherland and
                    origin of the literary language of the Italians. But these have been deprived of
                    all right to exist by the scientific investigation of the history of that
                    language. If the older Italian poetry assumed or maintained forms alien to
                    Tuscan speech, these forms were after, wards gradually eliminated, and the field
                    was left to those which were purely Tuscan and indeed purely Florentine. And
                    thus it remains absolutely true that, so far as phonetics, morphology,
                    rudimental syntax, and in short the whole character and material of words and
                    sentences are concerned, there is no literary language of Europe that is more
                    <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit13newyrich/page/n519/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0913-0519-0498"/> thoroughly characterized by homogeneity and
                    oneness, as if it had come forth in a single cast from the furnace, than the
                    Italian.</p>
                <p>But on the other hand it remains equally true that, so far as concerns a living
                    confidence and uniformity in the use and style of the literary language—that is,
                    of this Tuscan or Florentine material called to nourish the civilization and
                    culture of all the Italians—the case is not a little altered, and the Italian
                    nation appears to enjoy less fortunate conditions than other nations of Europe.
                    Modern Italy had no glowing centre for the life of the whole nation into which
                    and out of which the collective thought and language could be poured in
                    ceaseless current for all and by all. Florence has not been Paris. Territorial
                    contiguity and the little difference of the local dialect facilitated in the
                    modern Rome the elevation of the language of conversation to a level with the
                    literary language that came from Tuscany. A form of speech was thus produced
                    which, though certainly destitute of the grace and the abundant flexibility of
                    the Florentine, gives a good idea of what the dialect of a city becomes when it
                    makes itself the language of a nation that is ripening its civilization in many
                    and dissimilar centres. In such a case the dialect loses its slang and petty
                    localisms, and at the same time also somewhat of its freshness; but it learns to
                    express with more conscious sobriety and with more assured dignity the thought
                    and the feeling of the various peoples which are fused in one national life. But
                    what took place readily in Rome could not with equal ease happen in districts
                    whose dialects were far removed from the Tuscan. In Piedmont, for example, or in
                    Lombardy, the language of conversation did not correspond with the language of
                    books, and the latter accordingly became artificial and laboured. Poetry was
                    least affected by these unfortunate conditions <hi rend="italic">; for</hi>
                    poetry may work well with a multiform language, where the need and the stimulus
                    of the author’s individuality assert themselves more strongly. But prose
                    suffered immensely, and the Italians had good cause to envy the spontaneity and
                    confidence of foreign literatures—of the French more particularly. In this
                    reasonable envy lay the justification and the strength of the Manzoni school,
                    which aimed at that absolute naturalness of the literary language, that absolute
                    identity between the language of conversation and that of books, which the bulk
                    of the Italians could reach and maintain only by naturalizing themselves in the
                    living speech of modern Florence. The revolt of Manzoni against artificiality
                    and mannerism in language and st} le was worthy of his genius, and has been
                    largely fruitful. But the historical difference between the case of France (with
                    the colloquial language of Paris) and that of Italy (with the colloquial
                    language of Florence) implies more than one difficulty of principle; in the
                    latter case there is sought to be produced by deliberate effort of the <hi
                    rend="italic">literati</hi> what in the former has been and remains the
                    necessary and spontaneous product of the entire civilization. Manzoni’s theories
                    too easily lent themselves to deplorable exaggerations; men fell into a new
                    artificiality, a manner of writing which might be called vulgar and almost
                    slangy. The remedy for this must lie in the regulating power of the labour of
                    the now regenerate Italian intellect,—a labour ever growing wider in its scope,
                    more assiduous, and more thoroughly united.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Literature. —</hi> Fernow in the third volume of his <hi
                    rend="italic">Römische Studien</hi> (Zurich, 1806-8) gave a good survey of the
                    dialects of Italy. The dawn of rigorously scientific methods had not then
                    appeared; but Fernow’s view is wide and genial. Similar praise is due to
                    Biondelli ’ s work <hi rend="italic">Sai dialetti gallo-italici</hi> (Milan,
                    1853), which, however, is still ignorant of Diez. Fuchs, between Fernow and
                    Biondelli, had made himself so far acquainted with the new methods; but his
                    exploration <hi rend="italic">(fibber die</hi><hi rend="italic">sogenannten

                    successful. Nor can the rapid survey of the Italian dialects given by Diez be
                    ranked among the happiest portions of his great masterpiece. Among the followers
                    of Diez who distinguished themselves in this department the first outside of
                    Italy were certainly Mussafia, a cautious and clear continuator of the master,
                    and the singularly acute Schuchardt. Next came the <hi rend="italic">Archivio

                    >(Arch.,</hi> iii. 285-419) and Caix, <hi rend="italic">Originidella

                    (Florence, 1880), which resolves itself into an accurate historical examination
                    of the dialectal forms that occur in the old poetry.—For almost a quarter of a
                    century a matchless investigator, Giovanni Flechia, has devoted assiduous, keen,
                    and genial labour to the history and description both of the dialects and of the
                    literary language (see <hi rend="italic">Arch.,</hi> ii. 396, iii.
                    176).—Biondelli’s book is of no small service also for the numerous translations
                    which it contains of the Prodigal Son into Lombard, Piedmontese, and Emilian
                    dialects. A dialogue translated into the vernaculars of all parts of Italy will
                    be found in Zuccagni Orlandini’s <hi rend="italic">Raccolta di dialetti italiani

                    division is abundantly represented in a series of versions of a short novel of

                <p>1. <hi rend="italic">Origins.—</hi> There is one characteristic fact that
                    distinguishes the Italy of the Middle Ages with regard to its intellectual
                    conditions, and that is the tenacity with which the Latin tradition clung to
                    life. At the end of the 5th century the northern conquerors invaded Italy. The
                    Roman world crumbled to pieces. A new kingdom arose at Ravenna under Theodoric,
                    and there learning was not extinguished. The liberal arts flourished, the very
                    Gothic kings surrounded themselves with masters of rhetoric and of grammar. The
                    names of Cassiodorus, of Boetius, of Symmachus, are enough to show how Latin
                    thought maintained its power amidst the political effacement of the Roman
                    empire. And this thought held its ground throughout the subsequent ages and
                    events. Thus, while elsewhere all culture had died out, there still remained in
                    Italy some schools of laymen,<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    some really extraordinary men were educated in them, such as Ennodiπs, a poet
                    more pagan than Christian, Arator, Fortunatus, Venantιus, Jovannicius, Felix the
                    grammarian, Peter of Pisa, Paulinus of Aquileia, and many others, in all of whom
                    we notice a contrast between the barbarous age they lived in and their
                    aspiration towards a culture that should reunite them to the classical
                    literature of Rome. The Italians never had much love for theological studies,
                    and those who were addicted to them preferred Paris to Italy. It was something
                    more practical, more positive, that had attraction for the Italians, and
                    especially the study of Roman law. This zeal for the study of jurisprudence
                    furthered the establishment of the mediaeval universities of Bologna, Padua,
                    Vicenza, Naples, Salerno, Modena, and Parma; and these, in their turn, helped to
                    spread culture, and to prepare the ground in which the new vernacular literature
                    was afterwards to be developed. The tenacity of classical traditions, the
                    affection for the memories of Rome, the preoccupation with political interests,
                    particularly shown in the wars of the Lombard communes against the empire of thr
                    Hohenstaufens, a spirit more naturally inclined to practice <pb break="no"

                    on the fate of Italian literature. Italy was wanting in that combination of
                    conditions from which the spontaneous life of a people springs. This was chiefly
                    owing to the fact that the history of the Italians never underwent
                    interruption,— no foreign nation having come in to change them and make them
                    young again. That childlike state of mind and heart, which in other Latin races,
                    as well as in the Germanic, was such a deep source of poetic inspiration, was
                    almost utterly wanting in the Italians, who were always much drawn to history
                    and very little to nature; so, while legends, tales, epic poems, satires, were
                    appearing and spreading on all sides, Italy was either quite a stranger to this
                    movement, of took a peculiar part in it. We know, for example, what the Trojan
                    traditions were in the Middle Ages; and we should have thought that in Italy—in
                    the country of Rome, retaining the memory of Aeneas and Virgil—they would have
                    been specially developed, for it was from Virgil that the mediaeval sympathy for
                    the conquered of Troy was derived. In fact, however, it was not so. A strange
                    book made its appearance in Europe, no one quite knows when, the <hi
                    rend="italic">Historia</hi><hi rend="italic">de</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >excidio</hi><hi rend="italic">Trojae,</hi> which purported to have been written
                    by a certain Dares the Phrygian, an eye-witness of the Trojan war. In the Middle
                    Ages this book was the basis of many literary labours. Benoit de Sainte-More
                    composed an interminable French poem founded on it, which afterwards in its turn
                    became a source for other poets to draw from, such as Herbort of Fritzlar and
                    Conrad of Würzburg. Now for the curious phenomenon displayed by Italy. Whilst
                    Benoit de Sainte-More wrote his poem in French, taking his material from a Latin
                    history, whilst the two German writers, from a French source, made an almost
                    original work in their own language,—an Italian, on the other hand, taking
                    Benoit for his model, composed in Latin the <hi rend="italic">Historia
                    destructionis</hi><hi rend="italic">Trojae</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> and this
                    Italian was Guido delie Colonne of Messina, one of the vernacular poets of the
                    Sicilian school, who must accordingly have known well how to use his own
                    language. Guido was an imitator of the Provençals; he understood French, and yet
                    wrote his own book in Latin, nay, changed the romance of the Troubadour into
                    serious history. Much the same thing occurred with the other great legends. That
                    of Alexander the Great gave rise to many French, German, and Spanish poems,—in
                    Italy, only to the Latin distichs of Qualichino of Arezzo. The whole of Europe
                    was full of the legend of Arthur. The Italians contented themselves with
                    translating and with abridging the French romances, without adding anything of
                    their own. The Italian writer could neither appropriate the legend nor colour it
                    with his own tints. Even religious legend, so widely spread in the Middle Ages,
                    and springing up so naturally as it did from the heart of that society, only put
                    out a few roots in Italy. Jacopo di Voragine, white collecting his lives of the
                    saints, remained only an historian, a man of learning, almost a critic who
                    seemed doubtful about the things he related. Italy had none of those books in
                    which the Middle Age, whether in its ascetic or its chivalrous character, is so
                    strangely depicted. The intellectual life of Italy showed itself in an
                    altogether special, positive, almost scientific form, in the study of Roman law,
                    in the chronicles of Farfa, of Marsicano, and of many others, in translations
                    from Aristotle, in the precepts of the school of Salerno, in the travels of
                    Marco Polo,—in short, in a long series of facts which seem to detach themselves
                    from the surroundings of the Middle Age, and to be united on the one side with
                    classical Rome and on the other with the Renaissance.</p>
                <p>The necessary consequence of all this was that the Latin language was most
                    tenacious in Italy, and that the elaboration of the new vulgar tongue was very
                    slow,—being in fact preceded by two periods of Italian literature in foreign
                    languages. That is to say, there were many Italians who wrote Provençal poems,
                    such as the Marchese Alberto Malaspina (12th century), Maestro Ferrari of
                    Ferrara, Cigala of Genoa,· Zorzi of Venice, Sordello of Mantua, Buvarello of
                    Bologna, Nicoletto of Turin, and others, who sang of love and of war, who
                    haunted the courts, or lived in the midst of the people, accustoming them to new
                    sounds and new harmonies. At the same time there was other poetry of an epic
                    kind, written in a mixed language, of which French was the basis, but in which
                    forms and words belonging to the Italian dialects were continually mingling. We
                    find in it hybrid words exhibiting a treatment of sounds according to the rules
                    of both languages,—French words with Italian terminations, a system of
                    vocalization within the words approaching the Italo-Latin usage,—in short,
                    something belonging at once to both tongues, as it were an attempt at
                    interpenetration, at fusion. Such were the <hi rend="italic">Chanson</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">de Geste,</hi><hi rend="italic">Macaire,</hi> the <hi
                    rend="italic">Entree</hi><hi rend="italic">en Espagne</hi> written by Niccola of
                    Padua, the <hi rend="italic">Prise de Pampeluηe,</hi> and some others. All this
                    preceded the appearance of a purely Italian literature.</p>
                <p>In the Franco-Italian poems there was, as it were, a clashing, a struggle between
                    the two languages, the French, however, gaining the upper hand. This supremacy
                    became gradually less and less. As the struggle continued between French and
                    Italian, the former by degrees lost as much as the latter gained. ' The
                    hybridism recurred, but it no longer predominated. In the <hi rend="italic">Bovo
                    TAntona</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">Rainardo e Leseηgriηo</hi> the Venetian
                    dialect makes itself clearly felt, although the language is influenced by French
                    forms. Thus these writings, which Ascoli has called “miste” (mixed), immediately
                    preceded the appearance of purely Italian works.</p>
                <p>It is now an established historical fact that there existed no writing in Italian
                    before the 13th century. It was in: the course of that century, and especially
                    from 1250 ’ onwards, that the new literature largely unfolded and developed
                    itself. This development was simultaneous in the whole peninsula, only there was
                    a difference in the subject-matter of the art. In the north, the poems of
                    Giacominoof Verona and Bonvecino of Riva were specially religious, and were
                    intended to be recited to the people. They were written in a dialect partaking
                    of the Milanese and the Venetian; and in their style they strongly bore the mark
                    of the influence of French narrative poetry. They may be considered as belonging
                    to the popular kind of poetry, taking the word, however, in a broad sense.
                    Perhaps this sort of composition was encouraged by the old custom in the north
                    of Italy of listening in the piazzas and on the highways to the songs of the
                    jongleurs. To the very same crowds who had been delighted with the stories of
                    romance, and who had listened to the story of the wickedness of <hi
                    rend="italic">Macaire</hi> and the misfortunes of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Blanciflor,</hi> another jongleur would sing of the terrors of the <hi
                    rend="italic">Babiloniα</hi><hi rend="italic">Infernale</hi> and the blessedness
                    of the <hi rend="italic">Gerιιsalemme celeste,</hi> and the singers of religious

                    >de Geste.</hi></p>
                <p>In the south of Italy, on the other hand, the love-song prevailed, of which we
                    have an interesting specimen in the <hi rend="italic">Contrasta</hi> attributed
                    to Ciullo d’Alcamo, about which modern Italian critics have much exercised
                    themselves. This “contraste” (dispute) between a man and a woman in Sicilian
                    dialect certainly must not be considered as the most ancient or as the only
                    southern poem of a popular kind. It belongs without doubt to the time of the
                    emperor Frederick II., and is important as a proof that there existed a popular
                    poetry independent of literary poetry. The <hi rend="italic">Contrasta</hi> of
                    Ciullo d’Alcamo is the most remarkable relic of a kind -of poetry that has
                    perished or which perhaps <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0913-0521-0500"/> was smothered by the ancient Sicilian literature.
                    Its distinguishing point was its possessing all the opposite qualities to the
                    poetry of the rhymers of what we shall call the Sicilian school. Vigorous in the
                    expression of feelings, it seems to come fro&lt;n a real sentiment. The
                    conceits, which are sometimes most bold and very coarse, show that it proceeded
                    from the lowest grades of society. Everything is original in Ciullo’s <hi
                    rend="italic">Contrasto.</hi> Conventionality has no place in it. It is marked
                    by the sensuality characteristic of the people of the South.</p>
                <p>The reverse of all this happened in the Siculo-Provençal school, at the head of
                    which was Frederick II. Imitation was the fundamental characteristic of this
                    school, to which belonged Enzio, king of Sardinia, Pier delle Vigne,
                    Inghilfredi, Guido and Odo delle Colonne, Jacopo d’Aquino, Rugieri Pugliese,
                    Giacomo da Lentino, Arrigo Testa, and others. These rhymers never moved a step
                    beyond the ideas of chivalry; they had no originality; they did not sing of what
                    they felt in their heart; they abhorred the true and the real. They only aimed
                    at copying as closely as they could the poetry of the Provençal
                    troubadours.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>See

                    there were many reasons for this,—first, because the chivalrous spirit, from
                    which the poetry of the troubadours was derived, was now old and on its
                    deathbed; next, because the Provençal art itself, which the Sicilians took as
                    their model, was in its decadence. It may seem strange, but it is true, that
                    when the emperor Frederick II., a philosopher, a statesman, a very original
                    legislator, took to writing poetry, he could only copy and amuse himself with
                    absolute puerilities. His art, like that of all the other poets of his court,
                    was wholly conventional, mechanical, affected. It was completely wanting in what
                    constitutes poetry,—ideality, feeling, sentiment, inspiration. The Italians have
                    had great disputes among themselves about the original form of the poems of the
                    Sicilian school, that is to say, whether they were written in Sicilian dialect,
                    or in that language which Dante called “volgare, illustre, aulico, cortigiano”;
                    and the question is not yet settled. But now the critics of most authority hold
                    that the primitive form of these poems was the Sicilian dialect, modified for
                    literary purposes with the help of Provençal and Latin; the theory of the
                    “lingua illustre” has been almost entirely rejected, since we cannot say on what
                    rules it could have been founded, when literature was in its infancy, trying its
                    feet, and lisping its first words. The Sicilian certainly, in accordance with, a
                    tendency common to all dialects, in passing from the spoken to the written form,
                    must have gained in dignity; but this was not enough to create the so-called
                    “lingua illustre,” which was upheld by Perticari and others on grounds rather
                    political than literary.</p>
                <p>In the 13th century a mighty religious movement took place in Italy, of which the
                    rise of the two great orders of Saint Francis and Saint Dominic was at once the
                    cause and the effect. Around Francis of Assisi a legend has grown up in which
                    naturally the imaginative element prevails. Yet from some points in it we seem
                    to be able to infer that its hero had a strong feeling for nature, and a heart
                    open to the most lively impressions. Many poems are attributed to him. The
                    legend relates that in the eighteenth year of his penance, when almost rapt in
                    ecstasy, he dictated the <hi rend="italic">Cantico</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >del</hi><hi rend="italic">Sole.</hi> Even if this hymn be really his, it cannot
                    be considered as a poetical work, being written in a kind of prose simply marked
                    by assonances. As for the other poems, which for a long time were believed to be
                    by Saint Francis, their spuriousness is now generally recognized. The true poet
                    who represented in all its strength and breadth the religious feeling that had
                    made special progress in Umbria was Jacopo dei Benedetti of Todi, known as
                    Jacopone. The story is that sorrow at the sudden death of his wife had
                    disordered his mind, and that, having sold all he possessed and given it to the
                    poor, he covered himself with rags, and took pleasure in being laughed at, and
                    followed by a crowd of people who mocked him and called after him “Jacopone,
                    Jacopone.” We do not know whether this be true. What we do know is that a
                    vehement passion must have stirred his heart and maintained a despotic hold over
                    him, the passion of divine love. Under its influence Jacopone went on raving for
                    years and years, subjecting himself to the severest sufferings, and giving vent
                    to his religious intoxication in his poems. There is no art in him, there is not
                    the slightest indication of deliberate effort; there is only feeling, a feeling
                    that absorbed him, fascinated him, penetrated him through and through. His
                    poetry was all inside him, and burst out, not so much in words as in sighs, in
                    groans, in cries that often seem really to come from a monomaniac. But Jacopone
                    was a mystic, who from his hermit’s cell looked out into the world and specially
                    watched the papacy, scourging with his words Celestine V. and Boniface VIII. He
                    was put in prison and laden with chains, but his spirit lifted itself up to God,
                    and that was enough for him. The same feeling that prompted him to pour out in
                    song ecstasies of divine love, and to despise and trample on himself, moved him
                    to reprove those who forsook the heavenly road, whether they were popes,
                    prelates, or monks. In Jacopone there was a strong originality, and in the
                    period of the origins of Italian literature he was one of the most
                    characteristic writers.</p>
                <p>The religious movement in Umbria was followed by another literary phenomenon,
                    that of the religious drama. In 1258 an old hermit, Raniero Fasani, leaving the
                    cavern in which he had lived for many years, suddenly appeared at Perugia. These
                    were very sad times for Italy. The quarrels in the cities, the factions of the
                    Ghibellines and the Guelphs, the interdicts and excommunications issued by the
                    popes, the reprisals of the imperial party, the cruelty and tyranny of the
                    nobles, the plagues and famines, kept the people in constant agitation, and
                    spread abroad mysterious fears. The commotion was increased in Perugia by
                    Fasani, who represented himself as sent by God to disclose mysterious visions,
                    and to announce to the world terrible visitations. Under the influence of fear
                    there were formed “Compagnie di Disciplinant!,” who, for a penance, scourged
                    themselves till they drew blood, and sang “Laudi” in dialogue in their
                    confraternities. These “Laudi,” closely connected with the liturgy, were the
                    first example of the drama in the vulgar tongue of Italy. They were written in
                    the Umbrian dialect, in verses of eight syllables, and of course they have not
                    any artistic value. Their development, however, was rapid. As early as the end
                    of the same 13th century we have the <hi rend="italic">Devozioηi del</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Giovedï</hi><hi rend="italic">e Venerdl Santo,</hi> which have
                    some dramatic elements in them, though they are still connected with the
                    liturgical office. Then we have the representation <hi rend="italic">di</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">un</hi><hi rend="italic">Monaco</hi><hi rend="italic">ehe</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">ando al servizio di Dio</hi> (“of a monk who entered the service
                    of God”), in which there is already an approach to the definite form which this
                    kind of literary work assumed in the following centuries.</p>
                <p>In the 13th century Tuscany was peculiarly circumstanced both as regards its
                    literary condition and its political life. The Tuscans spoke a dialect which
                    most closely resembled the mother-tongue, Latin,—one which afterwards became
                    almost exclusively the language of literature, and which was already regarded at
                    the end of the 13 th century as surpassing the others; “Lingua Tusca magis apta
                    est <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit13newyrich/page/n522/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0913-0522-0501"/> ad literam sive literaturam”: thus writes Antonio
                    da Tempo of Padua, born about 1275. Being very little or not at all affected by
                    the Germanic invasion, Tuscany was never subjected to the feudal system. It had
                    fierce internal struggles, but they did not weaken its life; on the contrary,
                    they rather gave it fresh vigour and strengthened it, and (especially after the
                    final fall of the Hohenstaufens at the battle of Benevento in 1266) made it the
                    first province of Italy. From 1266 onwards Florence was in a position to begin
                    that movement of political reform which in 1282 resulted in the appointment of
                    the Priori delle Arti, and the establishment of the Arti Minori. This was
                    afterwards copied by Siena with the Magistrato dei Nove, by Lucca, by Pistoia,
                    and by other Guelph cities in Tuscany with similar popular institutions. In this
                    way the guilds had taken the government into their hands, and it was a time of
                    both social and political prosperity. It was no wonder that literature also rose
                    to an unlooked-for height. In Tuscany, too, there was some popular love poetry;
                    there was a school of imitators of the Sicilians, their chief being Dante of
                    Majano; but its literary originality took another line—that of humorous and
                    satirical poetry. The entirely democratic form of government created a style of
                    poetry which stood in the strongest antithesis to the mediaeval mystic and
                    chivalrous style. Devout invocation of God or of a lady came from the cloister
                    and the castle; in the streets of the cities everything that had gone before was
                    treated with ridicule or biting sarcasm. Folgore of San Gimignano laughs when in
                    his sonnets he tells a party of Sienese youths what are the occupations of every
                    month in the year, or when he teaches a party of Florentine lads the pleasures
                    of every day in the week. Cene della Chitarra laughs when he parodies Folgore’s
                    sonnets. The sonnets of Rustico di Filippo are half fun and half satire;
                    laughing and crying, joking and satire, are all to be found in Cecco Angiolieri
                    of Siena, the oldest “humorist" we know, a far-off precursor of Rabelais, of
                    Montaigne, of Jean Paul Richter, of Sydney Smith. But another kind of poetry
                    also began in Tuscany. Guittone d’Arezzo made art quit chivalrous for national
                    motives, Provençal forms for Latin. He attempted political poetry, and, although
                    his work is full of the strangest obscurities, he prepared the way for the
                    Bolognese school. In the 13th century Bologna was the city of science, and
                    philosophical poetry appeared there. Guido Guinicelli was the poet after the new
                    fashion of the art. In him the ideas of chivalry are changed and enlarged; he
                    sings of love and together with it of the nobility of the mind. The reigning
                    thought in Guinicelli’s <hi rend="italic">Canzoni</hi> is nothing external to
                    his own subjectivity. His speculative mind, accustomed to wandering in the field
                    of philosophy, transfuses its lucubrations into his art. Guinicelli’s poetry has
                    some of the faults of the school of Guittone d’Arezzo: he reasons too much; he
                    is wanting in imagination; his poetry is a product of the intellect rather than
                    of the fancy and the heart. Nevertheless he marks a great development in the
                    history of Italian art, especially because of his close connexion with Dante’s
                    lyric poetry.</p>
                <p>But before we come to Dante, certain other facts, not, however, unconnected with
                    his history, must be noticed. In the 13th century there were several poems in
                    the allegorical style. One of these is by Brunetto Latini, who, it is well
                    known, was attached by ties of strong affection to Alighieri. His <hi
                    rend="italic">Tesoretto</hi> is a short poem, in sevensyllable verses, rhyming
                    in couplets, in which the author professes to be lost in a wilderness and to
                    meet with a lady, who is Nature, from whom he receives much instruction. λV e
                    see here the vision, the allegory, the instruction with a moral object,—three
                    elements which we shall find again in the <hi rend="italic">Divina</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Commedia.</hi> Francesco da Barberiuo, a learned lawyer who was
                    secretary to bishops, a judge, a notary, wrote two little allegorical poems,—the
                    <hi rend="italic">Documenti</hi><hi rend="italic">T</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Amore</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Del Reggimeηto e dei</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Costumi</hi><hi rend="italic">delle</hi><hi rend="italic">Donne.</hi> Like the
                    <hi rend="italic">Tesoretto,</hi> these poems are of no value as works of art,
                    but are, on the other hand, of importance in the history of manners. A fourth
                    allegorical work was the <hi rend="italic">Intelligenza,</hi> by some attributed
                    to Dino Compagni, but probably not his, and only a version of French poems.</p>
                <p>While the production of Italian poetry in the 13th century was abundant and
                    varied, that of prose was scanty. The oldest specimen dates from 1231, and
                    consists of short notices of entries and expenses by Mattasalà di Spinello dei
                    Lambertini of Siena. In 1253 and 1260 there are some commercial letters of other
                    Sienese. But there is no sign of literary prose. Before we come to any, we meet
                    with a phenomenon like that we noticed in regard to poetry. Here again we find a
                    period of Italian literature in-French. Halfway on in the century a certain
                    Aldobrando or Aldobrandino (it is not known whether he was of Florence or of
                    Siena) wrote a book for Beatrice of Savoy, countess of Provence, called <hi
                    rend="italic">Le</hi><hi rend="italic">Regime</hi><hi rend="italic">du
                    Corps.</hi> In 1267 Martino da Canale wrote in the same “langue d <hi
                    rend="superscript"> ,</hi> oιl"a chronicle of Venice. Rusticiano of Pisa, who
                    was for a long while at the court of Edward I. of England, composed many
                    chivalrous romances, derived from the Arthurian cycle, and subsequently wrote
                    the travels of Marco Polo, which may perhaps have been dictated by the great
                    traveller himself. And finally Brunetto Latini wrote his <hi rend="italic"
                    >Tesoro</hi> in French.</p>
                <p>Next in order to the original compositions in the langue d’oïl come the
                    translations or adaptations from the same. There are some moral narratives taken
                    from religious legends; a romance of Julius Caesar; some short histories of
                    ancient knights; the <hi rend="italic">Tavola Rotonda</hi>; translations of the
                    <hi rend="italic">Viaggi</hi> of Marco Polo and of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Tesoro</hi> of Latini. At the same time there appeared translations from Latin
                    of moral and ascetic works, of histories, and of treatises on rhetoric and
                    oratory. Up to very recent times it was still possible to reckon as the most
                    ancient works in Italian prose the <hi rend="italic">Cronaca</hi> of Matteo
                    Spinello da Giovenazzo, and the <hi rend="italic">Cronaca</hi> of Ricordano
                    Malespini. But now both of them have been shown to be forgeries of a much later
                    time. Therefore the oldest prose writing is a scientific book —the <hi
                    rend="italic">Composizione del</hi><hi rend="italic">Mondo</hi> by Ristoro
                    d’Arezzo, who lived about the middle of the 13th century. This work is a copious
                    treatise on astronomy and geography. Ristoro was superior to the other writers
                    of the time on these subjects, because he seems to have been a careful observer
                    of natural phenomena, and consequently many of the things he relates were the
                    result of his personal investigations. There is also another short treatise, <hi
                    rend="italic">De</hi><hi rend="italic">Regimine Rectoris,</hi> by Fra Paolino, a
                    Minorite friar of Venice, who was probably bishop of Pozzuoli, and who also
                    wrote a Latin chronicle. His treatise stands in close relation to that of Egidio
                    Colonna, <hi rend="italic">De</hi><hi rend="italic">Regimine</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Priηcipum.</hi> It is written in the Venetian dialect.</p>
                <p>The 13th century was very rich in tales. There is a collection called the <hi
                    rend="italic">Cento</hi><hi rend="italic">Novelle</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Aniiche</hi> which contains stories drawn from Oriental, Greek, and Trojan
                    traditions, from ancient and mediaeval history, from the legends of Brittany,
                    Provence, and Italy, and from the Bible, from the local tradition of Italy as
                    well as from histories of animals and old mythology. This book has a distant
                    resemblance to the Spanish collection known as <hi rend="italic">El Conde
                    Lucanor.</hi> The peculiarity of the Italian book is that the stories are very
                    short, and that they seem to be mere outlines to be filled in by the narrator as
                    he goes along. Other prose novels were inserted by Francesco Barberino in his
                    work <hi rend="italic">Del Reggimento e dei Costumi</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >delle</hi><hi rend="italic">Donne,</hi> but they are of much less importance
                    than the others. On the whole the Italian novels of the 13th century have little
                    originality, and are only a faint reflexion of the very rich <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0913-0523-0502"/> legendary literature of France. Some attention
                    should be paid to the <hi rend="italic">Lettere</hi> of Fra Guittone d’Arezzo,
                    who wrote many poems and also some letters in prose, the subjects of which are
                    moral and religious. Love of antiquity, of the traditions of Rome and of its
                    language, was so strong in Guittone that he tried to write Italian in a Latin
                    style, and it turned out obscure, involved, and altogether barbarous. He took as
                    his special model Seneca, and hence his prose assumed a bombastic style, which,
                    according to his views, was very artistic, but which in fact was alien to the
                    true spirit of art, and resulted in the extravagant and grotesque.</p>
                <p>2. <hi rend="italic">The Spontaneous Development of Italian Literature.—</hi> In
                    the year 1282, the year in which the new Florentine constitution of the “Arti
                    Minori” was completed, a period of literature began that does not belong to the
                    age of first beginnings, but to that of development. With the school of Lapo
                    Gianni, of Guido Cavalcanti, of Cino da Pistoia, and Dante Alighieri, lyric
                    poetry became exclusively Tuscan. The whole novelty and poetic power of this
                    school, which really was the beginning of Italian art, consist in what Dante
                    expresses so happily—</p>
                <p>‘ ‘ Quando</p>
                <p>Amore spira, noto, ed a cjuel modo Ch’ei detta dentro, vo significando—”</p>
                <p>that is to say, in a power of expressing the feelings of the soul in the way in
                    which love inspires them, in an appropriate and graceful manner, fitting form to
                    matter, and by art fusing one with the other. The Tuscan lyric poetry, the first
                    true Italian art, is pre-eminent in this artistic fusion, in the spontaneous and
                    at the same time deliberate action of the mind. In Lapo Gianni the new style is
                    not free from some admixture of the old associations of the Siculo-Provenςal
                    school. He wavered as it were between two manners. The empty and involved
                    phraseology of the Sicilians is absent, but the poet does not always rid himself
                    of their influence. Sometimes, however, he draws freely from his own heart, and
                    then the subtleties and obscurities disappear, and his verse becomes clear,
                    flowing, and elegant.</p>
                <p>Guido Cavalcanti was a learned man with a high conception of his art. He felt the
                    value of it, and adapted his learning to it. Cavalcanti was already a good deal
                    out of sympathy with the mediaeval spirit; he reflected deeply on his own work,
                    and from this reflexion he derived his poetical conception. His poems may be
                    divided into two classes,—those which portray the philosopher, “il sottilis-simo
                    dialettico,” as Lorenzo the Magnificent called him, and those which are more
                    directly the product of his poetic nature imbued with mysticism and metaphysics.
                    To the first set belongs the famous poem <hi rend="italic">Sulla</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Natura</hi><hi rend="italic">&lt;T</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Amore,</hi> which in fact is a treatise on amorous metaphysics, and was
                    annotated later in a learned way by the most renowned Platonic philosophers of
                    the loth century, such as Marsilius Ficinus and others. In other poems of
                    Cavalcanti’s besides this, we see a tendency to subtilize and to stifle the
                    poetic-imagery under a dead weight of philosophy. But there are many of his
                    sonnets in which the truth of the images and the elegance and simplicity of the
                    style are admirable, and make us feel that we are in quite a new period of art.
                    This is particularly felt in Cavalcanti’s <hi rend="italic">Ballate,</hi> for in
                    them he pours himself out ingenuously and without affectation, but with an
                    invariable and profound consciousness of his art. Far above all the others for
                    the reality of the sorrow and the love displayed, for the melancholy longing
                    expressed for the distant home, for the calm and solemn yearning of his heart
                    for the lady of his love, for a deep subjectivity which is never troubled by
                    metaphysical subtleties, is the ballata composed by Cavalcanti when he was
                    banished from Florence with the party of the Bianchi in 1300, and took refuge at
                    Sarzana.</p>
                <p>The third poet among the followers of the new school was Cino da Pistoia, of the
                    family of the Sinibuldi (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Cino da Pistoia).</hi> His
                    love poems are so sweet, so mellow, and so musical that they are only surpassed
                    by Dante. The pains of love are described by him with vigorous touches; it is
                    easy to see that they are not feigned but real. The psychology of love and of
                    sorrow nearly reaches perfection.</p>
                <p>As the author of the <hi rend="italic">Vita Nuova,</hi> Dante also belongs to the
                    same lyric school. This is a little book of poetry and prose, which tells the
                    story of his love for Beatrice, who is pretty generally held to be the daughter
                    of Folco Portinari. In the lyrics of the <hi rend="italic">Vita Huova</hi> (so
                    called by its author to indicate that his first meeting with Beatrice was the
                    beginning for him of a life entirely different from that he had hitherto led)
                    there is a high idealization of love. It seems as if there were in it nothing
                    earthly or human, and that the poet had his eyes constantly fixed on heaven,
                    while singing of his lady. Everything is supersensual, aerial, heavenly, and the
                    real Beatrice is always gradually melting more and more into the symbolical
                    one—passingout of her human nature and into the divine. The life of Dante
                    covered a period of fifty-six years (1265-1321). In 1289 he fought at Campaldino
                    against the Ghibellines of Arezzo. In 1300 he was probably one of the
                    ambassadors from the Guelphs to Pope Boniface VIII. He was afterwards elected a
                    prior, and it is believed that he took part in the measure for banishing the
                    heads of the factions of the Bianchi and Neri which began that same year in
                    Florence. The Neri betook themselves to Boniface, accusing their adversaries of
                    an understanding with the Ghibellines. For the purpose of meeting these
                    accusations, Dante went to Boniface, but in the meanwhile the latter sent
                    Charles of Valois as a peacemaker, with secret injunctions to crush the Bianchi.
                    Charles fulfilled this part of his mission with zeal. One of the proscribed was
                    Dante, on the charge of illicit gains and of extortion during his priorate.
                    Henceforth the poet’s life was a perpetual pilgrimage from one Italian town to
                    another. He was also at Paris in 130'3. He hoped great things from the descent
                    of Henry VII. of Luxembourg into Italy, and wrote to the people and princes to
                    announce the coming of the day of redemption. He had hopes, too, of Uguccione
                    della Faggiuola, leader of the Pisans against Florence (1315). But all his hopes
                    proved vain, and he took refuge with Can Grande della Scala at Verona (1316),
                    moving on later to Busone di Raffaelli at Gubbio (1318), to Vagano della Torre
                    at Udine (1319), and to Guido Novello da Polenta at Ravenna (1320), where he
                    died the next year.</p>
                <p>It appears that Dante began the <hi rend="italic">Convito</hi> in his youth, that
                    he continued it in his exile, and never completed it. He named the book the <hi
                    rend="italic">Convito,</hi> to signify that a banquet of wisdom was served up in
                    it. He meant to comment on fourteen of his songs, and the commentary was to be
                    the promised serving up of the banquet. But he only composed four out of the
                    fourteen treatises. As has been said by one of Dante’s chief admirers in modern
                    Italy, “it is a book of much learning, but the symbolism kills the poetry, and
                    the quotations stifle the real knowledge.” The <hi rend="italic">Convito</hi> is
                    very valuable’ as giving a notion of the mind of Dante and of his scholastic
                    education. On the other hand, his treatise <hi rend="italic">De</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Monarchia</hi> shows us his political conception. It was probably
                    written in 1310, when the coming of Henry VII. revived such hopes in him. He
                    meant to prove in it that a universal monarchy is necessary to the well-being of
                    the world, that the Roman people had a right to claim the exercise of this
                    office, that the authority of a monarch comes straight from God and not from his
                    vicar, the pope. The <hi rend="italic">De</hi><hi rend="italic">Monarchia</hi>
                    is written in scholastic <pb break="no"

                    work of Dante’s, also written in Latin, is the <hi rend="italic">De</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Vulgari Eloquio.</hi> It seems that it was to have consisted of
                    four books, but only two were written. His work is a defence of the “volgare
                    illustre” (the noble vulgar tongue) against the Italian dialects. Modern
                    criticism regards it as very superficial.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                <p>The work which made Dante immortal, and raised him above all the other men of
                    genius in Italy, was his <hi rend="italic">Divina</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Commedia.</hi> The author himself called it a “comedy,” as he says in his
                    letter to Can Grande della Scala, for two reasons,—because it has, like
                    comedies, a sad beginning and a cheerful ending, and because it is written in a
                    “middle” style, treating alike of lofty and of lowly things. Alighieri is the
                    protagonist of the great drama. He represents himself as lost in a forest, in a
                    night at the end of March and in the first days of April 1300, when he was
                    thirty-five years old. At first he is much alarmed, but afterwards he is cheered
                    when, at dawn, he finds himself at the foot of a hill. He wishes to ascend it,
                    but three wild beasts prevent his doing so,—a panther, a lion, and ⅜ she-wolf.
                    When he flees back in haste to the forest, Virgil appears to him, and tells him
                    that he is sent by Beatrice, at the command of the “Gentle Lady” (Mary) and of
                    St Lucy. He tells him that, in order to escape from the she-wolf, he must go
                    through hell and purgatory with him, and afterwards Beatrice herself will lead
                    him up to heaven. Dante’s Inferno takes the shape of a deep valley, reaching
                    down in constantly narrowing circles from the surface of our hemisphere, in the
                    midst of which stands the mount of Jerusalem, to the centre of the earth. This
                    valley, or inverted cone, is cut by nine circles, where the souls of the damned
                    are tortured; they are divided into three principal classes, viz., the
                    incontinent, the violent, and the fraudulent. The valley is shut in at its
                    entrance by the river Acheron, and afterwards crossed by the Stygian marsh, and
                    the rivers Phlegethon and Cocytus. The two poets pass through the ninth part of
                    each circle, talking to some of the shades they meet, and at last they come to
                    Lucifer, stationed in the centre of the earth. “Grappling at his hair,” they
                    pass the centre of gravity, and begin to ascend a narrow way which brings them
                    to the other hemisphere, They reach a little island, whence rises a very high
                    mountain, which is purgatory. It also is divided into nine circles: in the first
                    two are the souls of those who deferred their repentance till the hour of death;
                    in the others the shades are cleansing themselves from the seven deadly sins.
                    Cato of Utica guards this place. The two poets ascend the mountain, going always
                    to the right hand. On the summit they find the earthly paradise, which is the
                    exact antipodes to the mountain of Jerusalem. Here appear a long train of
                    venerable persons, who precede a chariot drawn by griffins. Beatrice makes her
                    appearance, and with her Dante takes his flight through the nine heavens, where
                    he sees the souls of the blessed according to the order of their desert. At the
                    tenth heaven, the Empyrean, he sees them again all together, arranged in the
                    shape of a gleaming rose round a most dazzling centre, which is God. Here the
                    poet contemplates the mysteries of the Trinity and of the manhood of Christ.
                    Then the vision comes to an end.</p>
                <p>An allegorical meaning is hidden under the literal one of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Commedia.</hi> Dante, travelling through the invisible worlds, is a symbol of
                    mankind aiming at the double object of temporal and eternal happiness. By the
                    forest in which the poet loses himself is meant the civil and religious
                    confusion of society, deprived of its two guides, the emperor and the pope. The
                    mountain illuminated by the sun is universal monarchy. The three beasts are the
                    three vices and the three powers which offered th? greatest obstacles to Dante’s
                    designs: envy is Florence, light, fickle, and divided by the Bianchi and Neri;
                    pride is the house of France; avarice is the papal court; Virgil repre sents
                    reason and the empire. Beatrice is the symbol of the supernatural aid without
                    which man cannot attain the supreme end, which is God.</p>
                <p>But the merit of the poem does not lie in the allegory, which still connects it
                    with mediaeval literature. What is new in it is the individual art of the poet,
                    the classic art transfused for the first time into a Romance form. Dante is
                    above all a great artist. Whether he describes nature, analyses passions, curses
                    the vices, or sings hymns to the virtues, he is always wonderful for the
                    grandeur and delicacy of his art. Out of the rude mediaeval vision he has made
                    the greatest work of art of modern times. He took the materials for his poem
                    from theology, from philosophy, from history, from mythology,—but more
                    especially from his own passions, from hatred and love; and he has breathed the
                    breath of genius into all these materials. Under the pen of the poet, the dead
                    come to life again; they become men again, and speak the language of their time,
                    of their passions. Farinata degli Uberti, Boniface VIII., Count Ugolino,
                    Manfred, Sordello, Hugh Capet, St Thomas Aquinas, Cacciaguida, St Benedict, St
                    Peter, are all so many objective creations; they stand before us in all the life
                    of their characters, their feelings, their habits.</p>
                <p>Yet this world of fancy in which the poet moves is not only made living by the
                    power of his genius, but it is changed by his consciousness. The real chastizer
                    of the sins, the rewarder of the virtues, is Dante himself. The personal
                    interest which he brings to bear on the historical representation of the three
                    worlds is what most interests us and stirs us. Dante remakes history after his
                    own passions. Thus the <hi rend="italic">Divina</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Commedia</hi> can fairly be called, not only the most life-like drama of the
                    thoughts and feelings that moved men at that time, but also the most clear and
                    spontaneous reflexion of the individual feelings of the poet, from the
                    indignation of the citizen and the exile to the faith of the believer and the
                    ardour of the philosopher. The <hi rend="italic">Divina</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Commedia</hi> fixed and clearly defined the destiny of Italian literature, to
                    give artistic lustre, and hence immortality, to all the forms of literature
                    which the Middle Ages had produced. Dante begins the great era of the
                    Renaissance.</p>
                <p>Two facts characterize the literary life of Petrarch (1304-1374),—classical
                    research and the new human feeling introduced into his lyric poetry. Nor are
                    these two facts separate; rather is the one the result of the other. The
                    Petrarch who travelled about unearthing the works of the great Latin writers
                    helps us to understand the Petrarch who, having completely detached himself from
                    the Middle Ages, loved a real lady with a human love, and celebrated her in her
                    life and after her death in poems full of studied elegance. Petrarch was the
                    first humanist, and he was at the same time the first lyric poet of the modern
                    school. His career was long and tempestuous. He lived for many years at Avignon,
                    cursing the corruption of the papal court; he travelled through nearly the whole
                    of Europe; he corresponded with emperors and popes; he was considered the first
                    man of letters of his time; he had honours and riches; and he always bore about
                    within him discontent, melancholy, and incapacity for satisfaction, —three
                    characteristics of the modern man.</p>
                <p>He wrote many Latin works, the most important of which are the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Epistolae</hi> and the poem entitled <hi rend="italic">Africa.</hi> He was the
                    first to have a style of his own, and to attempt to revive the art of the Latin
                    authors. He specially studied <pb break="no"

                    there was a sort of affinity between their characters. The <hi rend="italic"
                    >Ep)istolae</hi> are of very great importance for the study of Petrarch’s life
                    and mind, as well as for the history of his times. <hi rend="italic">Africa</hi>
                    is a long poem in hexameters on the campaigns of Scipio, which in places shows
                    the gleam of genius. In the <hi rend="italic">Itinerarium Syriacum,</hi> and in
                    another work that is now lost,<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    first geographer of modern times.</p>
                <p>It is not very certain who was the lady loved by Petrarch. There are some reasons
                    for believing that she was called Laura De Noves, and was the wife of Ugo de
                    Sade, but this is very far from being proved. It appears anyhow that the lady
                    lived at Avignon.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Canzoniere</hi> is divided into three parts,—the first
                    containing the poems written during Laura’s lifetime, the second the poems
                    written after her death, the third the <hi rend="italic">Trionfi.</hi> The one
                    and only subject of these poems is love; but the treatment is full of variety in
                    conception, in imagery, and in sentiment, derived from the most varied
                    impressions of nature. Petrarch’s love is real and deep, and to this is due the
                    merit of his lyric verse, which is quite different, not only from that of the
                    Provençal troubadours and of the Italian poets before him, but also from the
                    lyrics of Dante. Petrarch is a psychological poet, who dives down into his own
                    soul, examines all his feelings, and knows how to render them with an art of
                    exquisite sweetness. The lyrics of Petrarch are no longer transcendental like
                    Dante’s, but on the contrary keep entirely within human limits. In struggles, in
                    doubts, in fears, in disappointments, in griefs, in joys, in fact in everything,
                    the poet finds material for his poetry. The second part of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Canzoniere</hi> is the more passionate. The <hi rend="italic">Trionfi</hi> are
                    inferior; it is clear that in them Petrarch tried to imitate the <hi
                    rend="italic">Divina</hi><hi rend="italic">Commedia,</hi> but never came near
                    it.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Canzoniere</hi> includes also a few political poems,—a
                    canzone to Italy, one supposed to be addressed to Cola di Rienzi, and several
                    sonnets against the court of Avignon. These are remarkable for their vigour of
                    feeling, and also for showing that Petrarch had formed the idea of <hi
                    rend="italic">Italiaηitd</hi> better even than Alighieri. The Italy which he
                    wooed was different from any conceived by the men of the Middle Ages, and in
                    this also he was a precursor of modern times and of modern aspirations. Petrarch
                    had no decided political idea. He exalted Cola di Rienzi, invoked the emperor
                    Charles IV., praised the Visconti; in fact, his politics were affected more by
                    impressions than by principles; but above all this reigned constantly the love
                    of Italy, his ancient and glorious country, which in his mind is reunited with
                    Rome, the great city of his heroes Cicero and Scipio.</p>
                <p>Boccaccio (1313-1375) had the same enthusiastic love of antiquity and the same
                    worship for the new Italian literature as Petrarch. He was the first, with the
                    help of a Greek born in Calabria, to put together a Latin translation of the <hi
                    rend="italic">Iliad</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">Odyssey.</hi> His vast
                    classical learning was shown specially in the work <hi rend="italic">De</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Genealogia Deorum,</hi> in which he enumerates the gods according
                    to genealogical trees constructed on the authority of the various authors who
                    wrote about the pagan divinities. This work marked an era in studies preparatory
                    to the revival of classical learning. And at the same time it opened the way for
                    the modern criticism, because Boccaccio in his researches and in his own
                    judgment was always independent of the authors whom he most esteemed. The <hi
                    rend="italic">Genealogia Deorum</hi> is, as Heeren said, an encyclopaedia of
                    mythological knowledge; and it was the precursor of the great humanistic
                    movement which was developed in the 15th century. Boccaccio was also the first
                    historian of women in his <hi rend="italic">De Claris</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Mulieribus,</hi> and the first to undertake to tell the story of the great
                    unfortunate in his <hi rend="italic">De</hi><hi rend="italic">Casibus Virorum
                    Illustrium.</hi> He continued and perfected former geographical investigations
                    in his interesting book <hi rend="italic">De</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Montibus,</hi><hi rend="italic">Silvis,</hi><hi rend="italic">Fontibus,</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Lacubus,</hi><hi rend="italic">Fluminibus, Stagnis, et
                    Paludibus,</hi><hi rend="italic">et de</hi><hi rend="italic">Nominibus</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Maris,</hi> for which he made use of Vibius Sequester, but which
                    contains also many new and valuable observations. He also wrote in Latin several
                    eclogues, some letters, and other minor compositions. Of his Italian works his
                    lyrics do not come anywhere near to the perfection of Petrarch’s. His sonnets,
                    mostly about love, are quite mediocre. His narrative poetry is better. Although
                    now he can no longer claim the distinction long conceded to him of having
                    invented the octave stanza (which afterwards became the metre of the poems of
                    Boiardo, of Ariosto, and of Tasso), yet he was certainly the first to use it in
                    a work of some length and written with artistic skill, such as is his <hi
                    rend="italic">Teseide.</hi> This is a poem in twelve books, and the subject is
                    the love of two Theban youths, Arcita and Palemone, for Emilia, one of the
                    Amazons. We find in it great luxury of description, inflated speeches, much
                    erudition, but little poetry. However, the <hi rend="italic">Teseide</hi> is the
                    oldest Italian romantic poem. The <hi rend="italic">Filostrato</hi> relates the
                    loves of Troiolo and Griseida (Troilus and Cressida). It may be that Boccaccio
                    knew the French poem of the Trojan war by Benoit de Sainte-More; but the
                    interest of the Italian work lies in the analysis of the passion of love, which
                    is treated with a masterly hand. The <hi rend="italic">Ninfale Fiesolano</hi>
                    tells the love story of the nymph Mesola and the shepherd Africo. The <hi
                    rend="italic">Amorosa</hi><hi rend="italic">Visione,</hi> a poem in triplets,
                    doubtless owed its origin to the <hi rend="italic">Dwina Commedia.</hi> The <hi
                    rend="italic">Ameto</hi> is a mixture of prose and poetry, and is the first
                    Italian pastoral romance.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Filocopo</hi> takes the earliest place among prose
                    romances. In it Boccaccio tells in a laborious style, and in the most prolix
                    way, the loves of Florio and Biancafiore. Probably for this work he drew
                    materials from a popular source or from a Byzantine romance, which Leonzio
                    Pilato may have mentioned to him. In the <hi rend="italic">Filocσpo</hi> there
                    is a remarkable exuberance in the mythological part, which damages the romance
                    as an artistic work, but which contributes to the history of Boccaccio’s mind.
                    The <hi rend="italic">Fiammetta</hi> is another romance, about the loves of
                    Boccaccio and Maria d’Aquino, a supposed natural daughter of King Robert, whom
                    he always called by this name of Fiammetta.</p>
                <p>The Italian work which principally made Boccaccio famous was the <hi
                    rend="italic">Decamerone,</hi> a collection of a hundred novels, related by a
                    party of men and women, who had retired to a villa near Florence to escape from
                    the plague in 1348. Novel-writing, so abundant in the preceding centuries,
                    especially in France, now for the first time assumed an artistic shape. The
                    style of Boccaccio tends to the imitation of Latin, but in him prose first took
                    the form of elaborated art. The rudeness of the old <hi rend="italic"
                    >fabliaux</hi> gives place to the careful and conscientious work of a mind that
                    has a feeling for what is beautiful, that has studied the classic authors, and
                    that strives to imitate them as much as possible. Over and above this, in the
                    <hi rend="italic">Decamerone,</hi> Boccaccio is a delineator of character and an
                    observer of passions. In this lies his novelty. Much has been written about the
                    sources of the novels of the <hi rend="italic">Decamerone.</hi> Probably
                    Boccaccio made use both of written and of oral sources. Popular tradition must
                    have furnished him with the materials of many stories, as, for example, that of
                    Griselda.</p>
                <p>Unlike Petrarch, who was always discontented, preoccupied, wearied with life,
                    disturbed by disappointments, we find Boccaccio calm, serene, satisfied with
                    himself and with his surroundings. Notwithstanding these fundamental<pb
                    break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit13newyrich/page/n526/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0913-0526-0505"/> differences in their characters, the two great
                    authors were old and warm friends. But their affection for Dante was not equal.
                    Petrarch, who says that he saw him once in his childhood, did not preserve a
                    pleasant recollection of him, and it would be useless to deny that he was
                    jealous of his renown. The <hi rend="italic">Divina</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Commedia</hi> was sent him by Boccaccio, when he was an old man, and he
                    confessed that he never read it. On the other hand, Boccaccio felt for Dante
                    something more than love—enthusiasm. He wrote a biography of him, of which the
                    accuracy is now unfairly depreciated by some critics, and he gave public
                    critical lectures on the poem in Santa Maria del Fiore at Florence.</p>
                <p>Fazio degli Uberti and Federigo Frezzi were imitators of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Divina</hi><hi rend="italic">Commedia,</hi> but only in its external form. The
                    former wrote the <hi rend="italic">Dittamondο,</hi> a long poem, in which the
                    author supposes that he was taken by the geographer Solinus into different parts
                    of the world, and that his guide related the history of them. The legends of the
                    rise of the different Italian cities have some importance historically. Frezzi,
                    bishop of his native town Foligno, wrote the <hi rend="italic">Quadriregio,</hi>
                    a poem of the four kingdoms—Love, Satan, the Vices, and the Virtues. This poem
                    has many points of resemblance with the <hi rend="italic">Divina</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Commedia.</hi> Frezzi pictures the condition of man who rises from
                    a state of vice to one of virtue, and describes hell, the limbo, purgatory, and
                    heaven. The poet has Pallas for a companion.</p>
                <p>Ser Giovanni Fiorentino wrote, under the title of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Pecorone,</hi> a collection of tales, which are supposed to have been related
                    by a monk and a nun in the parlour of the monastery of Forli. He closely
                    imitated Boccaccio, and drew on Villani’s chronicle for his historical stories.
                    Franco Sacchetti wrote tales too, for the most part on subjects taken from
                    Florentine history. His book gives a life-like picture of Florentine society at
                    the end of the 14th century. The subjects are almost always improper; but it is
                    evident that Sacchetti collected all these anecdotes in order to draw from them
                    his own conclusions and moral reflexions, which are to be found at the end of
                    every story. From this point of view Sacchetti’s work comes near to the <hi
                    rend="italic">Moral isationes</hi> of the Middle Ages. A third novelist was
                    Giovanni Sercambi of Lucca, who after 1374 wrote a book, in imitation of
                    Boccaccio, about a party of people who were supposed to fly from a plague and to
                    go travelling about in different Italian cities, stopping here and there telling
                    stories.</p>
                <p>It has already been said that the chronicles formerly believed to have been of
                    the 13th century are now regarded as forgeries of later times. At the end of the
                    13th century, however, we find a chronicle by Dino Compagni, which,
                    notwithstanding the unfavourable opinion of it entertained especially by some
                    German writers, is in all probability authentic. Little is known about the life
                    of Compagni. Noble by birth, he was democratic in feeling, and was a supporter
                    of the new ordinances of Giano della Bella. As prior and gonfalonier of justice
                    he always had the public welfare at heart. When Charles of Valois, the nominee
                    of Boniface VIII., was expected in Florence, Compagni, foreseeing the evils of
                    civil discord, assembled a number of citizens in the church of San Giovanni, and
                    tried to quiet their excited spirits. His chronicle relates the events that came
                    under his own notice from 1280 to 1312. It bears the stamp of a strong
                    subjectivity. The narrative is constantly personal. It often rises to the finest
                    dramatic style. A strong patriotic feeling and an exalted desire for what is
                    right pervade the book. Compagni is more an historian than a chronicler, because
                    he looks for the reasons of events, and makes profound reflexions on them.
                    According to our judgment he is one of the most important authorities for that
                    period of Florentine history, notwithstanding the not insignificant mistakes in
                    fact which are to be found in his writings. On the contrary, Giovanni Villani,
                    born in 1300, was more of a chronicler than an historian. He relates the events
                    up to 1347. The journeys that he made in Italy and France, and the information
                    thus acquired, account for the fact that his chronicle, called by him <hi
                    rend="italic">Istorie Florentine,</hi> comprises events that occurred all over
                    Europe. What specially distinguishes the work of Villani is that he speaks at
                    length, not only of events in politics and war, but also of the stipends of
                    public officials, of the sums of money used for paying soldiers and for public
                    festivals, and of many other things of which the knowledge is very valuable.
                    With such an abundance of information it is not to be wondered at that Villani’s
                    narrative is often encumbered with fables and errors, particularly when he
                    speaks of things that happened before his own time. Matteo was the brother of
                    Giovanni Villani, and continued the chronicle up to 1363. It was again continued
                    by Filippo-Villani. Gino Capponi, author of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Commentari</hi><hi rend="italic">delV Acquisto di Pisa</hi> and of the
                    narration of the <hi rend="italic">Tumulto dei Ciompi,</hi> belonged to both the
                    14th and the 15th centuries.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Divina</hi><hi rend="italic">Commedia</hi> is ascetic in
                    its conception, and in a good many points of its execution. To a large extent
                    similar is the genius of Petrarch; yet neither Petrarch nor Dante could be
                    classified among the pure ascetics of their time. But many other writers come
                    under this head. St Catherine of Siena’s mysticism was political. She was a
                    really extraordinary woman, who aspired to bring back the Church of Rome to
                    evangelical virtue, and who has left a collection of letters written in a high
                    and lofty tone to all kinds of people, including popes. She joins hands on the
                    one side with Jacopone of Todi, on the other with Savonarola. Hers is the
                    strongest, clearest, most exalted religious utterance that made itself heard in
                    Italy in the 14th century. It is not to be thought that precise ideas of
                    reformation entered into her head, but the want of a great moral reform was felt
                    in her heart. And she spoke indeed <hi rend="italic">ex</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >abundantia</hi><hi rend="italic">cordis.</hi> Anyhow the daughter of Jacopo
                    Benincasa must take her place among those who from afar off prepared the way for
                    the religious movement which took effect, especially in Germany and England, in
                    the 16th century.</p>
                <p>Another Sienese, Giovanni Colombini, founder of the order of Jesuati, preached
                    poverty by precept and example, going back to the religious idea of St Francis
                    of Assisi. His letters are among the most remarkable in the category of ascetic
                    works in the 14th century. Passavanti, in his <hi rend="italic">Sp)ecchio della
                    vera Penitenza,</hi> attached instruction to narrative. Cavalca translated from
                    the Latin the <hi rend="italic">Vite dei</hi><hi rend="italic">Santi Padri.</hi>
                    Rivalta left behind him many sermons, and Franco Sacchetti (the famous novelist)
                    many discourses. On the whole, there is no doubt that one of the most important
                    productions of the Italian spirit of the 14th century was the religious
                    literature.</p>
                <p>In direct antithesis with this is a kind of literature which has a strong popular
                    element. Humorous poetry, the poetry of laughter and jest, which as we saw was
                    largely developed in the 13th century, was carried on in the 14th by Bindo
                    Bonichi, Arrigo di Castruccio, Cecco Nuccoli, Andrea Orgagna, Filippo de’ Bardi,
                    Adriano de’ Rossi, Antonid Pucci, and other lesser writers. Orgagna was
                    specially comic; Bonichi was comic with a satirical and moral purpose. Antonio
                    Pucci was superior to all of them for the variety of his production. He put into
                    triplets the chronicle of Giovanni Villani <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Ceηtiloquio)</hi><hi rend="italic subscript"> t</hi> and wrote many historical
                    poems called <hi rend="italic">Serventesi,</hi> many comic poems, and not a few
                    epico-popular compositions on various subjects. A little poem of his in seven
                    cantos treats of the war between the Florentines and the Pisans from 1362 to
                    1365. Other poems drawn from a legendary source celebrate the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Reina d</hi><hi rend="italic superscript"> ,</hi><hi rend="italic">Oriente,
                    Apollonio</hi><hi rend="italic">di Tiro,</hi> the <hi rend="italic">Bel
                    Gherardino.</hi> &amp;c. These poems, meant to be recited to the <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit13newyrich/page/n527/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0913-0527-0506"/> people, are the remote ancestors of the romantic
                    epic, which was developed in the 16th century, and the first representatives of
                    which were Boiardo and Ariosto.</p>
                <p>Many poets of the 14th century have left us political works. Of these Fazio degli
                    Uberti, the author of <hi rend="italic">Ditta-mondo,</hi> who wrote a <hi
                    rend="italic">Serventese</hi> to the lords and people of Italy, a poem on Rome,
                    a fierce invective against Charles IV. of Luxemburg, deserves notice, and
                    Francesco di Van-nozzo, Frate Stoppa, and Matteo Frescobaldi. It may be said in
                    general that following the example of Petrarch many writers devoted themselves
                    to patriotic poetry. From this period also dates that literary phenomenon known
                    under the name of Petrarchism. The Petrarchists, or those who sang of love,
                    imitating Petrarch’s manner, were found already in the 14th century. But others
                    treated the same subject with more originality, in a manner that might be called
                    semi-popular. Such were the <hi rend="italic">Ballate</hi> of Ser Giovanni
                    Fiorentino, of Franco Sacchetti, of Niccolo Soldanieri, of Guido and Bindo
                    Donati. Ballate were poems sung to dancing, and we have very many songs for
                    music of the 14th century. We have already stated that Antonio Pucci versified
                    Villani’s <hi rend="italic">Chronicle.</hi> This instance of versified history
                    is not unique, and it is evidently connected with the precisely similar
                    phenomenon offered by the “vulgar Latin” literature. It is enough to notice a
                    chronicle of Arezzo in terza rima by Gorello de’ Sinigardi, and the history,
                    also in terza rima, of the journey of Pope Alexander III. to Venice by Pier de’
                    Natali. Besides this, every kind of subject, whether history, tragedy, or
                    husbandry, was treated in verse. Neri di Landocio wrote a life of St Catherine;
                    Jacopo Gradenigo put the gospels into triplets; Paganino Bonafede in the <hi
                    rend="italic">Tesoro</hi><hi rend="italic">dei Rustici</hi> gave many precepts
                    in agriculture, beginning that kind of Géorgie poetry which was fully developed
                    later by Alamanni in his <hi rend="italic">Coltivazione,</hi> by Girolamo
                    Baruffaldi in the <hi rend="italic">Cαnapajo,</hi> by Rucellai in the <hi
                    rend="italic">Api</hi><hi rend="italic subscript"> l</hi> by Bartolommeo Lorenzi
                    in the <hi rend="italic">Coltivazione dei Monti,</hi> by Giambattista Spolverini
                    in the <hi rend="italic">Coltivazioηe del Riso,</hi> &lt;tc.</p>
                <p>There cannot have been an entire absence of dramatic literature in Italy in the
                    14th century, but traces of it are wanting, although we find them again in great
                    abundance in the 15th century. The 14th century had, however, one drama unique
                    of its kind. In the sixty years (1250 to 1310) which ran from the death of the
                    emperor Frederick II. to the expedition of Henry VII., no emperor had come into
                    Italy. In the north of Italy, Ezzelino da Romano, with the title of imperial
                    vicar, had taken possession of almost the whole of the March of Treviso, and
                    threatened Lombardy. The popes proclaimed a crusade against him, and, crushed by
                    it, the Ezzelini fell. Padua then began to breathe again, and took to extending
                    its dominion. There was living at Padua Albertino Mussato, born in 1261, a year
                    after the catastrophe of the Ezzelini; he grew up among the survivors of a
                    generation that hated the name of the tyrant. After having written in Latin a
                    history, of Henry VII., he devoted himself to a dramatic work on Ezzelino, and
                    wrote it also in Latin. The <hi rend="italic">Hccerinus,</hi> which was probably
                    never represented on the stage, has been by some critics compared to the great
                    tragic works of Greece. It would probably be nearer the truth to say that it has
                    nothing in common with the works of Aeschylus; but certainly the dramatic
                    strength, the delineation of certain situations, and the narration of certain
                    events arc very original. Mussato’s work stands alone in the history of Italian
                    dramatic literature. Perhaps this would not have been the case if he had written
                    it in Italian.</p>
                <p>In the last years of the 14th century we find the struggle that was soon to break
                    out between the indigenous literary tradition and the reviving classicism
                    already alive in spirit. As representatives of this struggle, of this
                    antagonism, we may consider Luigi Marsilio and Coluccio Salutati, both learned
                    men who spoke and wrote Latin, who aspired to be humanists, but who meanwhile
                    also loved Dante, Petrarch, and Boccaccio, and felt and celebrated in their
                    writings the beauty of Italian literature.</p>
                <p>3. <hi rend="italic">The Renaissance.—</hi> A great intellectual movement, which
                    had been gathering for a long time, made itself felt in Italy in the 15th
                    century. A number of men arose, all learned, laborious, indefatigable, and all
                    intent on one great work. Such were Niccolo Niccoli, Giannozzo Manetti, Palla
                    Strozzi, Leonardo Bruni, Francesco Filelfo, Poggio Bracciolini, Carlo d’Arezzo,
                    Lorenzo Valla. Manetti buried himself in his books, slept only for a few hours
                    in the night, never went out of doors, and spent his time in translating from
                    Greek, studying Hebrew, and commenting on Aristotle. Palla Strozzi sent into
                    Greece at his own expense to search for ancient books, and had Plutarch and
                    Plato brought for him. Poggio Bracciolini went to the council of Constance, and
                    found in a monastery in the dust-hole Cicero’s <hi rend="italic">Orations.</hi>
                    He copied Quintilian with his own hand, discovered Lucretius, Plautus, Pliny,
                    and many other Latin authors. Guarino went through the East in search of
                    codices. Giovanni Λurispa returned to Venice with many hundreds of manuscripts.
                    What was the passion that excited all these men? What did they search after?
                    What did they look to? These Italians were but handing on the solemn tradition
                    which, although partly latent, was the informing principle of Italian mediaeval
                    history, and now at length came out triumphant. This tradition was that same
                    tenacious and sacred memory of Rome, that same worship of its language and
                    institutions, which at one time had retarded the development of Italian
                    literature, and now grafted the old Latin branch of ancient classicism on the
                    flourishing stock of Italian literature. All this is but the continuation of a
                    phenomenon that has existed for ages. It is the thought of Rome that always
                    dominates Italians, the thought that keeps appearing from Boetius to Dante
                    Alighieri, from Arnold of Brescia to Cola di Rienzi, which gathers strength with
                    Petrarch and Boccaccio, and finally becomes triumphant in literature and
                    life,—in life, because the modern spirit is fed on the works of the ancients.
                    Men come to have a more just idea of nature: the world is no longer cursed or
                    despised; truth and beauty join hands; man is born again; and human reason
                    resumes its rights. Everything, the individual and society, are changed under
                    the influence of new facts.</p>
                <p>First of all there was formed a human individuality, which was wanting in the
                    Middle Ages. As Burckhardt has said, the man was changed into the individual. He
                    began to feel and assert his own personality, which was constantly attaining a
                    fuller realization. As a consequence of this, the idea of fame and the desire
                    for it arose. A really cultured class was formed, in the modern meaning of the
                    word, and the conception was arrived at (completely unknown in former times)
                    that the worth of a man did not depend at all on his birth but on his personal
                    qualities. Poggio in his dialogue <hi rend="italic">De Nol&gt;ilitate</hi>
                    declares that he entirely agreed with his interlocutors Niccol5 Niccoli and
                    Lorenzo de’ Medici in the opinion that there is no other nobility but that of
                    personal merit. External life was growing more refined in all particulars; the
                    man of society was created; rules for civilized life were made; there was ⅝n
                    increasing desire for sumptuous and artistic entertainments. The mediaeval idea
                    of existence was turned upside down: men who had hitherto turned their thoughts
                    exclusively to heavenly things, and believed exclusively in the divine right,
                    now began to think of beautifying their earthly existence, of making it happy
                    and gay, and returned to a belief in their human rights. This was a great <pb

                    xml:id="kp-eb0913-0528-0507"/> advance, but one which carried with it the seeds
                    of many dangers. The conception of morality became gradually weaker. The “fay ce
                    que vouldras” of Rabelais became the first principle of life. Religious feeling
                    was blunted, was weakened, was changed, became pagan again. Finally the Italian
                    of the Renaissance, in his qualities and his passions, became the most
                    remarkable representative of the heights and depths, of the virtues and faults,
                    of humanity. Corruption was associated with all that is most ideal in life; a
                    profound scepticism took hold of people’s minds; indifference to good and evil
                    reached its highest point.</p>
                <p>Besides this, a great literary danger was hanging over Italy. Humanism threatened
                    to submerge its youthful national literature. There were authors who laboriously
                    tried to give Italian Latin forms, to do again, after Dante’s time, what
                    Guittone d’Arezzo had so unhappily done in the 13th century. Provincial dialects
                    tried to reassert themselves in literature. The great authors of the 14th
                    century, Dante, Petrarch, Boccaccio, were by many people forgotten or
                    despised.</p>
                <p>It was Florence that saved literature by reconciling, the classical models to
                    modern feeling, Florence that succeeded in assimilating classical forms to the
                    “vulgar” art. Still gathering vigour and elegance from classicism, still drawing
                    from the ancient fountains all that they could supply of good and useful, it was
                    able to preserve its real life, to keep its national traditions, and to guide
                    literature along the way that had been opened to it by the writers of the
                    preceding century. At Florence the most celebrated humanists wrote also in the
                    vulgar tongue, and commented on Dante and Petrarch, and defended them from their
                    enemies. Leon Battista Alberti, the learned Greek and Latin scholar, wrote in
                    the vernacular, and Vespasiano da Bisticci, whilst he was constantly absorbed in
                    Greek and Latin manuscripts, wrote the <hi rend="italic">Vite di Comini</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Illustri,</hi> valuable for their historical contents, and
                    rivalling the best works of the 14th century in their candour and simplicity.
                    Andrea da Barberino wrote the beautiful prose of the <hi rend="italic">Real·i
                    di</hi><hi rend="italic">Francia,</hi> giving a colouring of “romanità” to the
                    chivalrous romances. Belcari and Benivieni carry us back to the mystic idealism
                    of earlier times.</p>
                <p>But it is in Lorenzo de’ Medici that the influence of Florence on the Renaissance
                    is particularly seen. In forming an opinion of him many people are led away by
                    political preconceptions. Even as a statesman, Lorenzo h as a conspicuous place
                    in the history of his time, and in our day it will not be deemed reasonable to
                    expect that in the age of lordships and principalities he alone should stand out
                    from his time, and not feel the influence of the general condition of Italy.
                    With this, however, we have nothing to do. We have to consider Lorenzo de’
                    Medici as a man of letters; and as such he is one about whom tradition and
                    reality best agree. His mind was formed by the ancients: he attended the class
                    of the Greek Argyropulos, sat at Platonic banquets, took pains to collect
                    codices, sculptures, vases, pictures, gems, and drawings to ornament the gardens
                    of San Marco and to form the library afterwards called by his name. In the
                    saloons of his Florentine palace, in his villas at Careggi, Fiesole, and Ambra,
                    stood the wonderful chests painted by Dello with stories from Ovid, the Hercules
                    of Pollajuolo, the Pallas of Botticelli, the works of Filippino and Verrocchio.
                    Lorenzo de’ Medici lived entirely in the classical world; and yet if we read his
                    poems we only see the man of his time, the admirer of Dante and of the old
                    Tuscan poets, wdιo takes inspiration from the popular muse, and wdιo succeeds in
                    giving to his poetry the colours of the most pronounced realism, as well as of
                    the loftiest idealism,—who passes from the Platonic sonnet to the impassioned
                    triplets of the <hi rend="italic">A mom di</hi><hi rend="italic">Venere,</hi>
                    from the grandiosity of the <hi rend="italic">Salve</hi> to <hi rend="italic"
                    >Neηcia</hi> and to <hi rend="italic">Beoni,</hi> from the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Canto Camascialesco</hi> to the <hi rend="italic">Lauda.</hi> The feeling of
                    nature is strong in him,—at one time sweet and melancholy, at another vigorous
                    and deep, as if an echo of the feelings, the sorrows, the ambitions of that
                    deeply agitated life. He liked to look into his own heart with a severe eye, but
                    he was also able to pour himself out with tumultuous fulness. He described with
                    the art of a sculptor; he satirized, laughed, prayed, sighed, always elegant,
                    always a Florentine, but a Florentine who read Anacreon, Ovid, and Tibullus, who
                    wished to enjoy life,but also to taste of the refinements of art.</p>
                <p>Next to Lorenzo comes Poliziano, who also united, and with greater art, the
                    ancient and the modern, the popular and the classical style. In his <hi
                    rend="italic">Rispetti</hi> and in his <hi rend="italic">Ballate</hi> the
                    freshness of imagery and the plasticity of form are inimitable. He, a great
                    Greek scholar, wrote Italian verses with dazzling colours; the purest elegance
                    of the Greek sources pervaded his art in all its varieties, in the <hi
                    rend="italic">Orfeo</hi> as well as the <hi rend="italic">Stanze</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">per la Ciostra.</hi></p>
                <p>As a consequence of the intellectual movement towards the Renaissance, there
                    arose in Italy in the 15th century three academies, those of Florence, of
                    Naples, and of Rome. The Florentine academy was founded by Cosmo I. de’ Medici.
                    Having heard the praises of Platonic philosophy sung byGemistus Pletho, who in
                    1439 was at the council of Florence, he took such a liking for those opinions
                    that he soon made a plan for a literary congress which was especially to discuss
                    them. Marsilius Ficinus has described the occupations and the entertainments of
                    these academicians. Here, he said, the young men learnt, by way of pastime,
                    precepts of conduct and the practice of eloquence; here grown-up men studied the
                    government of the republic and the family; here the aged consoled themselves
                    with the belief in a future world. The academy was divided into three classes
                    :—that of patrons, who were members of the Medici family; that of hearers, among
                    whom sat the most famous men of that age, such as Pico della Mirandola, Angelo
                    Poliziano, Leon Battista Alberti; that of disciples, who were youths anxious to
                    distinguish themselves in philosophical pursuits. It is known that the Platonic
                    academy endeavoured to promote, with regard to art, a second and a more exalted
                    revival of antiquity. The Roman academy was founded by Giulio Pomponio Leto,
                    with the object of promoting the discovery and the investigation of ancient
                    monuments and books. It was a sort of religion of classicism, mixed with
                    learning and philosophy. Platina, the celebrated author of the lives of the
                    first hundred popes, belonged to it. At Naples, the academy known as· the
                    Pontaniana was instituted. The founder of it was Antonio Beccadelli, surnamed II
                    Panormita, and after his death the head was II Pontano, who gave his name to it,
                    and whose mind animated it.</p>
                <p>Romantic poems were the product of the moral scepticism and the artistic taste of
                    the 15th century. Italy never had any true epic poetry in its period of literary
                    birth. Still less could it have any in the Renaissance. It had, however, many
                    poems called <hi rend="italic">Cantam,</hi> because they contained stories that
                    were sung to the people; and besides there were romantic poems, such as the <hi
                    rend="italic">Buovo d</hi> ’ <hi rend="italic">Aηtoηa,</hi> the <hi
                    rend="italic">Regina Ancroja,</hi> and others. But the first to introduce
                    elegance and a new life into this style was Luigi Pulci, who grew up in the
                    house of the Medici, and who wrote the <hi rend="italic">Morgante Maggiore</hi>
                    at the request of Lucrezia Tornabuoni, mother of Lorenzo the Magnificent. The
                    material of the <hi rend="italic">Morgante</hi> is almost completely taken from
                    an obscure chivalrous poem of the 15th century recently discovered by Professor
                    Pio Rajna. On this foundation Pulci erected a structure of his own, often
                    turning the subject into ridicule, burlesquing the characters, introducing many
                    digressions, now capricious, now scientific, now theological. Pulci’s merit
                    consists in having been the first to <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit13newyrich/page/n529/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0913-0529-0508"/> raise the romantic epic which had been for two
                    centuries in the hands of story-tellers into a work of art, and in having united
                    the serious and the comic, thus happily depicting the manners and feelings of
                    the time. With a more serious intention Matteo Boiardo, count of Scandiano,
                    wrote his <hi rend="italic">Orlando innamorato,</hi> in which he seems to have
                    aspired to embrace the whole range of Carlovingian legends; but he did not
                    complete his task. We find here too a large vein of humour and burlesque. Still
                    the Ferrarese poet is drawn to the world of romance by a profound sympathy for
                    chivalrous manners and feelings,—that is to say, for love, courtesy, valour, and
                    generosity. A third romantic poem of the 15th century was the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Marnbriaηo</hi> by Francesco Bello (Cieco of Ferrara). He drew from the
                    Carlovingian cycle, from the romances of the Round Table, from classical
                    antiquity. He was a poet of no common genius, and of ready imagination. He
                    showed the influence of Boiardo, especially in something of the fantastic which
                    he introduced into his work.</p>
                <p>The development of the drama in the 15th century was very great. This kind of
                    semi-popular literature was born in Florence, and attached itself to certain
                    popular festivities that were usually held in honour of St John the Baptist,
                    patron saint of the city. The <hi rend="italic">Sacra Pappresentaziane</hi> is
                    in substance nothing more than the development of the mediaeval <hi
                    rend="italic">Mistero</hi> (“mystery-play”). Although it belonged to popular
                    poetry, some of its authors were literary men of much renown. It is enough to
                    notice Lorenzo de’ Medici, who wrote <hi rend="italic">San Giovanni e
                    Paolo,</hi> and Feo Belcari, author of the <hi rend="italic">San Panunzio,</hi>
                    the <hi rend="italic">Abramo ed Isac,</hi> &amp;c. From the 15th century, some
                    element of the comic-profane found its way into the <hi rend="italic">Sacra
                    Pappresentaziane.</hi> From its Biblical and legendary conventionalism Poliziano
                    emancipated himself in his <hi rend="italic">Orfeo,</hi> which, although in its
                    exterior form belonging to the sacred representations, yet substantially
                    detaches itself from them in its contents and in the artistic element
                    introduced.</p>
                <p>From Petrarch onwards the eclogue was a kind of literature that much pleased the
                    Italians. In it, however, the pastoral element is only apparent, for there is
                    nothing really rural in it. Such is the <hi rend="italic">Arcadia</hi> of Jacopo
                    Sannazzaro of Naples, author of a wearisome Latin poem <hi rend="italic"
                    >De</hi><hi rend="italic">Partu</hi><hi rend="italic">Virginis,</hi> and of some
                    piscatorial eclogues. The <hi rend="italic">Arcadia</hi> is divided into ten
                    eclogues, in which the festivities, the games, the sacrifices, the manners of a
                    colony of shepherds are described. They are written in elegant verses, but it
                    would be vain to look in them for the remotest feeling of country life. On the
                    other hand, even in this style, Lorenzo de’ Medici was. superior. His <hi
                    rend="italic">Nencia da Barberνno,</hi> as a modern writer says, is as it were
                    the new and clear reproduction of the popular songs of the environs of Florence,
                    melted into one majestic wave of octave stanzas. Lorenzo threw himself into the
                    spirit of the bare realism of country life. There is a marked contrast between
                    this work and the conventional bucolic of Sannazzaro and other writers. A rival
                    of the Medici in this style, but always inferior to him, was Luigi Pulci in his
                    <hi rend="italic">Beca da Dicomano.</hi></p>
                <p>The lyric love poetry of this century was unimportant. In its stead we see a
                    completely new style arise, the <hi rend="italic">Canto Carηascialesco.</hi>
                    These were a kind of choral songs, which were accompanied with symbolical
                    masquerades, common in Florence at the carnival. They were written in a metre
                    like that of the ballate; and for the most part they were put into the mouth of
                    a party of workmen and tradesmen, who, with not very chaste allusions, sang the
                    praises of their art. These triumphs and masquerades were directed by Lorenzo
                    himself. At eventide there set out into the city large companies on horseback,
                    playing and singing these songs. There are some by Lorenzo himself, which
                    surpass all the others in their mastery of art. That entitled <hi rend="italic"
                    >Bacco ed Arianna</hi> is the most famous.</p>
                <p>Girolamo Savonarola arose to fight against the literary and social movement of
                    the Renaissance. He was a Ferrarese friar, born in 1452, and he came to Florence
                    in 1489. Some have tried to make out that Savonarola was an apostle of liberty,
                    others that he v <hi rend="superscript"> r</hi> as a precursor of the
                    Reformation. In truth, however, he was neither the one nor the other. In his
                    struggle with Lorenzo de’ Medici, he directed his attack against the promoter of
                    classical studies, the patron of pagan literature, rather than against the
                    political tyrant. Animated by mystic zeal, he took the line of a prophet,
                    preaching against reading voluptuous authors, against the tyranny of the Medici,
                    and calling for popular government. This, however, was not done from a desire
                    for civil liberty, but because Savonarola saw in Lorenzo and his court the
                    greatest obstacle to that return to Catholic doctrine which was his heart’s
                    desire; while he thought this return would be easily accomplished if, on the
                    fall of the Medici, the Florentine republic should come into the hands of his
                    supporters. There may be more justice in looking on Savonarola as the forerunner
                    of the Reformation. If he was so, it was more than he intended. The friar of
                    Ferrara never thought of attacking the papal dogma, and always maintained that
                    he washed to remain within the church of Rome. He had none of the great
                    aspirations of Luther. He only repeated the complaints and the exhortations of
                    St Catherine of Siena; he desired a reform of manners, entirely of manners, not
                    of doctrine. He prepared the ground for the German and English religious
                    movement of the 16th century, but unconsciously. In the history of Italian
                    civilization he represents retrogression, that is to say, the cancelling of the
                    great fact of the Renaissance, and return to-mediaeval ideas. His attempt to put
                    himself in opposition to his time, to arrest the course of events, to bring the
                    people back to the faith of the past, the belief that all the social evils came
                    from a Medici and a Borgia, his not seeing the historical reality as it was, his
                    aspiring to found a republic with Jesus Christ for its king,—all these things
                    show that Savonarola was more of a fanatic than a thinker. Nor has he any great
                    merit as a writer. He wrote Italian sermons, hymns (laudi), ascetic and
                    political treatises, but they are roughly executed, and only important as
                    throwing light on the history of his ideas. The religious poems of Girolamo
                    Benivieni are better than his, and are drawn from the same inspirations. In
                    these lyrics, sometimes sweet, always warm with religious feeling, Benivieni and
                    with him Feo Belcari carry us back to the literature of the 14th century.</p>
                <p>History had neither many nor very good students in the 15th century. Its revival
                    belonged to the following age. It was mostly written in Latin. Leonardo Bruni of
                    Arezzo wrote the history of Florence, Gioviano Pontano that of Naples, in Latin.
                    Bernardino Corio wrote the history of Milan in Italian, but in a rude way.</p>
                <p>Leonardo da Vinci wrote a treatise on painting, Leon Battista Alberti one on
                    sculpture and architecture. But the names of these two men are important, not so
                    much as authors of these treatises, but as being embodiments of another
                    characteristic of the age of the Renaissance,·— versatility of genius, power of
                    application along many and varied lines, and of being excellent in all. ·
                    Leonardo was an architect, a poet, a painter, an hydraulic engineer, and a
                    distinguished mathematician. Alberti was a musician, studied jurisprudence, was
                    an architect and a draughtsman, and had great fame in literature. He had a deep
                    feeling for nature, an almost unique faculty of assimilating all that he saw and
                    heard. Leonardo and Alberti are representatives and almost a compendium in
                    themselves of all that intellectual vigour of the Renaissance age, which in the
                    <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit13newyrich/page/n530/mode/1up"

                    individual parts, making way for what has by some been called the golden age of
                    Italian literature.</p>
                <p>4. <hi rend="italic">Development of the .Renaissance.—</hi> The fundamental
                    characteristic of the literary epoch following that of the Renaissance is that
                    it perfected itself in every kind of art, in particular uniting the essentially
                    Italian character of its language with classicism of style. This period lasted
                    from about 1494 to about 1560; and, strange to say, this very period of greater
                    fruitfulness and literary greatness began from the year 1494, which with Charles
                    VIII.’s descent into Italy marked the beginning of its political decadence and
                    of foreign domination over it. But this is not hard to explain. All the most
                    famous men of the first half of the 16th had been educated in the preceding
                    century. Pietro Pomponazzo was born in 1462, Marcello Virgilio Adriani in 1464,
                    Castiglione in 1468, Machiavelli in 1469, Bembo in 1470, Michelangelo Buonarroti
                    and Ariosto in 1474, Nardi in 1476, Trissino in 1478, Guicciardini in 1482. Thus
                    it is easy to understand how the literary activity which showed itself from the
                    end of the 15th century to the middle of the following one was the product of
                    the political and social conditions of the age in which these minds were formed,
                    not of that in which their powers were displayed.</p>
                <p>Niccolo Machiavelli and Francesco Guicciardini were the chief originators of the
                    science of history. Machiavelli’s principal works are the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Istorie Florentine,</hi> the <hi rend="italic">Discorsi sulla</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">prima</hi><hi rend="italic">Deca di Tito Livio,</hi> the <hi
                    rend="italic">Arte della Guerra,</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">Principe.</hi>
                    His merit consists in having been the creator of the experimental science of
                    politics,—in having observed facts, studied histories, and drawn consequences
                    from them. His history is sometimes inexact in facts; it is rather a political
                    than an historical work. The peculiarity of Machiavelli’s genius lay, as has
                    been said, in his artistic feeling for the treatment and discussion of politics
                    in and for themselves, without regard to an immediate end,—in his power of
                    abstracting himself from the partial appearances of the transitory present, in
                    order more thoroughly to possess himself of the eternal and inborn kingdom, and
                    to bring it into subjection to himself. His <hi rend="italic">Principe</hi> has
                    been the subject of the severest accusations. But now, especially since
                    Macaulay’s essay, it is clear to every one that this book was only the result of
                    the civil and moral conditions of Italy, as it still is the faithful portrait of
                    them.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Hitherto there has
                    been no complete and objective study on Machiavelli, although very much has been
                    written about him. This want, it is hoped, will be supplied when Signor Villari
                    has completed his work, of which only the first volume has as yet appeared, <hi

                    rend="italic">documenti,</hi> Florence, 1877.</p></note></p>
                <p>Next to Machiavelli both as an historian and a statesman, comes Francesco
                    Guicciardini. He taught law for many years at Florence; then, having devoted
                    himself to politics, he was always in the service of the Medici. Leo X. made him
                    governor of Modena, Reggio, and Parma. Clement VII. gave him the appointment of
                    president of the Romagna, and afterwards that of lieutenant-general of the army
                    against Charles V., and finally that of governor of Bologna. He worked for the
                    return of the Medici to Florence, defending Duke Alexander from the accusations
                    of the exiles and supporting the election of Cosmo I. Guicciardini was very
                    observant, and endeavoured to reduce his observations to a science. His <hi
                    rend="italic">Storia</hi><hi rend="italic">d'Italia,</hi> which extends from the
                    death of Lorenzo de’ Medici to 1534, is full of political wisdom, is skilfully
                    arranged in its parts, gives a lively picture of the character of the persons it
                    treats of, and is written in a grand style. He shows a profound knowledge of the
                    human heart, and depicts with truth the temperaments, the capabilities, and the
                    habits of the different European nations. Going back to the causes of events, he
                    looked for the explanation of the divergent interests of princes and of their
                    reciprocal jealousies. The fact of his having witnessed many of the events he
                    related, and having taken part in them, adds authority to his words. The
                    political reflexions are always deep: in the <hi rend="italic">Pensieri,</hi> as
                    Capponi<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi

                    self-examination a quintessence, as it were, of the things observed and done by
                    him,—thus endeavouring to form a political doctrine as adequate as possible in
                    all its parts. Machiavelli and Guicciardini may be considered, not only as
                    distinguished historians, but as originators of the science of history founded
                    on observation.</p>
                <p>Inferior to them, but still always worthy of note, were Jacopo Nardi (a just and
                    faithful historian and a virtuous man, who defended the rights of Florence
                    against the Medici before Charles V.), Benedetto Varchi, Giambattista Adriani,
                    Bernardo Segni; and, outside Tuscany, Camillo Porzio, who related the <hi
                    rend="italic">Congiura de</hi> ’ <hi rend="italic">Baroni</hi> and the history
                    of Italy from 1547 to 1552, Angelo di Costanza, Pietro Bembo, Paolo Paruta, and
                    others.</p>
                <p>Ariosto’s <hi rend="italic">Orlando</hi><hi rend="italic">Furioso</hi> was a
                    continuation of Boiardo’s <hi rend="italic">Innam</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >orato.</hi> His characteristic is that he assimilated the romance of chivalry
                    to the style and models of classicism. Ariosto was an artist only for the love
                    of his art; his sole aim was to make a romance that should please the generation
                    in which he lived. His <hi rend="italic">Orlando</hi> has no grave and serious
                    purpose; on the contrary it creates a fantastic world, in which thé poet
                    rambles, indulging his caprice, and sometimes smiling at his own work. His great
                    desire is to depict everything with the greatest possible perfection; the
                    cultivation of style is what occupies him most. In his hands, the style becomes
                    wonderfully plastic to every conception, whether high or low, serious or
                    sportive. The octave stanza reached in him the highest perfection of grace,
                    variety, and harmony.</p>
                <p>Meanwhile, side by side with the romantic, there was an attempt at the historical
                    epic. Gian Giorgio Trissino of Vicenza composed a poem called <hi rend="italic"
                    >Italia</hi><hi rend="italic">liberata</hi><hi rend="italic">dai Goti.</hi> Full
                    of learning and of the rules of the ancients, he formed himself on the latter,
                    in order to sing of the campaigns of Belisarius; he said that he had forced
                    himself to observe all the rules of Aristotle, and that he had imitated Homer.
                    In this again, we see one of the products of the Renaissance; and, although
                    Trissino’s work is poor in invention and without any original poetical
                    colouring, yet it helps one to understand better what were the conditions of
                    mind in the 16th century.</p>
                <p>Lyric poetry was certainly not one of the kinds that rose to any great height in
                    the 16th century. Originality was entirely wanting, since it seemed in that
                    century as if nothing better could be done than to copy Petrarch. Still, even in
                    this style there were some vigorous poets. Monsignore Giovanni Guidiccioni of
                    Lucca (1500-1541) showed that he had a generous heart. In fine sonnets he gave
                    expression to his grief for the sad state to which his country was reduced.
                    Francesco Molza of Modena (1489- 1544), learned in Greek, Latin, and Hebrew,
                    wrote in a graceful style and with spirit. Giovanni della Casa (1503- 1556) and
                    Pietro Bembo (1470-1547), although Petrarchists, were elegant. Even Michelangelo
                    Buonarroti was at times a Petrarchist, but his poems bear the stamp of his
                    extraordinary and original genius. And a good many ladies are to be placed near
                    these poets, such as Vittoria Colonna (loved by Michelangelo), Veronica Gambara,
                    Tullia d’Aragona, Giulia Gonzaga, poetesses of great delicacy, and. superior in
                    genius to many literary men of their time.</p>
                <p>The 16th century had not a few tragedies, but they are <pb break="no"

                    religious indifference of the Italians, the lack of strong passions and vigorous
                    characters. The first to occupy the tragic stage was Trissino with his <hi
                    rend="italic">Sofonisba,</hi> following the rules of the art most scrupulously,
                    but written in sickly verses, and without warmth of feeling. The <hi
                    rend="italic">Oreste</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">Ros-muηda</hi> of Giovanni
                    Rucellai were no better, nor Luigi Alamanni’s <hi rend="italic">Antigone.</hi>
                    Sperone Speroni in his <hi rend="italic">Canace</hi> and Giraldi Cintio in his
                    <hi rend="italic">Orbecche</hi> tried to become innovators in tragic literature,
                    but they only succeeded in making it grotesque. Decidedly superior to these was
                    the <hi rend="italic">Torris-mondo</hi> of Torquato Tasso, specially remarkable
                    for the choruses, which sometimes remind one of the chorus of the Greek
                    tragedies.</p>
                <p>The Italian comedy of the 16th century was almost entirely modelled on the Latin
                    comedy. They were almost always alike in the plot, in the characters of the old
                    man, of the servant, of the waiting-maid; and the argument was often the same.
                    Thus the <hi rend="italic">Lucidi</hi> of Agnolo Firenzuola, and the <hi
                    rend="italic">Vecchio Amoroso</hi> of Donato Giannotti were modelled on comedies
                    by Plautus, as were the <hi rend="italic">Sporta</hi> by Gelli, the <hi
                    rend="italic">Marito</hi> by Dolce, and others. There appear to be only three
                    writers who should be distinguished among the many who wrote
                    comedies,—Machiavelli, Ariosto, and Giovan Maria Cecchi. In his <hi
                    rend="italic">Mandragora</hi> Machiavelli, unlike all the others, composed a
                    comedy of character, creating types which seem living even now, because they
                    were copied from reality seen with a finely observant eye. Ariosto, on the other
                    hand, was distinguished for his picture of the habits of his time, and
                    especially of those of the Ferrarese nobles, rather than for the objective
                    delineation of character. Lastly, Cecchi left in his comedies a treasure of
                    spoken language, which nowadays enables us in a wonderful way to make ourselves
                    acquainted with that age. The notorious Pietro Aretino might also be included in
                    the list of the best writers of comedy.</p>
                <p>The 15th century was not without humorous poetry; Antonio Camnielli, surnamed the
                    Pistoian, is specially deserving of notice, because of his “pungent <hi
                    rend="italic">bonhomie?</hi> as Sainte-Beuve called it. But it was Francesco
                    Berni who carried this kind of literature to perfection in the 16th century.
                    From him the style has been called “bernesque” poetry. In the “Berneschi” we
                    find nearly the same phenomenon that we already noticed with regard to <hi
                    rend="italic">Orlando</hi><hi rend="italic">Furioso.</hi> It was art for art’s
                    sake that inspired and moved Berni to write, as well as Anton Francesco Grazzini
                    called Il Lasca, and other lesser writers. It may be said that there is nothing
                    in their poetry; and it is true that they specially delight in praising low and
                    disgusting things and in jeering at what is noble and serious. Bernesque poetry
                    is the clearest refl exion of that religious and moral scepticism which was one
                    of the characteristics of Italian social life in the 16th century, and which
                    showed itself more or less in all the works of that period, that scepticism
                    which stopped the religious Reformation in Italy, and which in its turn was an
                    effect of historical conditions. The Berneschi, and especially Berni himself,
                    sometimes assumed a satirical tone. But theirs could not be called true satire.
                    Pure satirists, on the other hand, were Antonio Vinciguerra, a Venetian,
                    Lodovico Alamanni, and Ariosto, the last superior to the others for the Attic
                    elegance of his style, and for a certain frankness, passing into malice, which
                    is particularly interesting when the poet talks of himself.</p>
                <p>In the 16th century there were not a few didactic works. In his poem of the <hi
                    rend="italic">Api</hi> Giovanni Rucellai approaches to the perfection of Virgil.
                    His style is clear and light, and he adds interest to his book by frequent
                    allusions to the events of the time. But of the didactic works that which
                    surpasses all the others in importance is Baldassare Castiglione’s <hi
                    rend="italic">Cortigiano,</hi> in which he imagines a discussion in the palace
                    of the dukes of Urbino between knights and ladies as to what are the gifts
                    required in a perfect courtier. This book is valuable as an illustration of the
                    intellectual and moral state of the highest Italian society in the first half of
                    the 16th century.</p>
                <p>Of the novelists of the 16th century, the two most important were Anton Francesco
                    Grazzini and Matteo Bandello,—the former as playful and bizarre as the latter is
                    grave and solemn. As part of the history of the times, we must not forget that
                    Bandello was a Dominican friar and a bishop, but that notwithstanding his novels
                    were very loose in subject, and that he often holds up the ecclesiastics of his
                    time to ridicule.</p>
                <p>At a time when admiration for qualities of style, the desire for classical
                    elegance, was so strong as in the 16th century, much attention was naturally
                    paid to translating Latin and Greek authors. Among the very numerous
                    translations of the time those of the <hi rend="italic">Aeneid</hi> and of the
                    <hi rend="italic">Pastorals</hi> of Longus the Sophist by Annibal Caro are still
                    famous; as are also the translations of Ovid’s <hi rend="italic"
                    >Metamorphoses</hi> by Giovanni Andrea dell’ Anguillare, of Apuleius’s <hi
                    rend="italic">Golden</hi> Ass by Firenzuola, and of Plutarch’s <hi rend="italic"
                    >Lives</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Moralia</hi> by Marcello Adriani.</p>
                <p>The historians of Italian literature are even now in doubt whether Tasso should
                    be placed in the period of the highest development of the Renaissance, or
                    whether he should form a period by himself, intermediate between that and the
                    one following. Certainly he was profoundly out of harmony with the century in
                    which he lived. His religious faith, the seriousness of his character, the deep
                    melancholy settled in his heart, his continued aspiration after an ideal
                    perfection, all place him as it were outside the literary epoch represented by
                    Machiavelli, by Ariosto, by Berni. As Carducci has well said, Tasso “is the
                    legitimate heir of Dante Alighieri: he believes, and reasons on his faith by
                    philosophy; he loves, and comments on his love in a learned style; he is an
                    artist, and writes dialogues of scholastic speculation that would fain be
                    Platonic.” He was only eighteen years old when, in 1562,he tried his hand at
                    epic poetry, and wrote <hi rend="italic">Rinaldo,</hi> in which he said that he
                    had tried to reconcile the Aristotelian rules with the variety of Ariosto. He
                    afterwards wrote the <hi rend="italic">Aminta,</hi> a pastoral drama of
                    exquisite grace. But the work to which he had long turned his thoughts was an
                    heroic poem, and that absorbed all his powers. He himself explains what his
                    intention was in the three <hi rend="italic">Discorsi</hi> written whilst he was
                    composing the <hi rend="italic">Gerusalemme:</hi> he would choose a great and
                    wonderful subject, not so ancient as to have lost all interest, nor so recent as
                    to prevent the poet from embellishing it with invented circumstances; he meant
                    to treat it rigorously according to the rules of the unity of action observed in
                    Greek and Latin poems, but with a far greater variety and splendour of episodes,
                    so that in this point it should not fall short of the romantic poem; and
                    finally, he would write it in a lofty and ornate style. This is what Tasso has
                    done in the <hi rend="italic">Gerusalemme</hi><hi rend="italic">Liberata,</hi>
                    the subject of which is the liberation of the sepulchre of Jesus Christ in the
                    11th century by Godfrey of Bouillon. The poet does not follow faithfully all the
                    historical facts, but sets before us the principal causes of them, bringing in
                    the supernatural agency of God and Satan. The <hi rend="italic">Gerusalemme</hi>
                    is the best heroic poem that Italy can show. It approaches to classical
                    perfection. Its episodes above all are most beautiful. There is profound feeling
                    in it, and everything reflects the melancholy soul of the poet. As regards the
                    style, however, although Tasso studiously endeavoured to keep close to the
                    classical models, one cannot help noticing that he makes excessive use of
                    metaphor, of antithesis, of far fetched conceits; and it is <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit13newyrich/page/n532/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0913-0532-0511"/> specially from this point of view that some
                    historians have placed Tasso in the literary period generally known under the
                    name of “Secentismo,” and that others, more moderate in their criticism, have
                    said that he prepared the way for it.</p>
                <p>5. <hi rend="italic">Period of Decadence.—</hi> From about 1559 began a period of
                    decadence in Italian literature. The Spanish rule oppressed and corrupted the
                    peninsula. The minds of men were day by day gradually losing their force; every
                    high aspiration was quenched. No love of country could any longer be felt when
                    the country was enslaved to a stranger. The suspicious rulers fettered all
                    freedom of thought and word; they tortured Campanella, burned Bruno, made every
                    effort to extinguish all high sentiment, all desire for good. Cesare Balbo says,
                    “if the happiness of the masses consists in peace without industry, if the
                    nobility’s consists in titles without power, if princes are satisfied by
                    acquiescence in their rule without real independence, without sovereignty, if
                    literary men and artists are content to write, paint, and build with the
                    approbation of their contemporaries, but to the contempt of posterity, if a
                    whole nation is happy in ease without dignity and the tranquil progress of
                    corruption,—then no period ever was so happy for Italy as the hundred and forty
                    years from the treaty of Cateau Cambresis to the war of the Spanish succession.”
                    This period is known in the history of Italian literature as the Secentismo. Its
                    writers, devoid of sentiment, of passion, of thoughts, resorted to exaggeration;
                    they tried to produce effect with every kind of affectation, with bombast, with
                    the strangest metaphors, in fact, with what in art is called mannerism,
                    “barocchism.” The utter poverty of the matter tried to cloak itself under
                    exuberance of forms. It seemed as if the writers vied with one another as to who
                    could best burden his art with useless metaphors, with phrases, with
                    big-sounding words, with affectations, with hyperbole, with oddities, with
                    everything that could fix attention on the outer form and draw it off from the
                    substantial element of thought.</p>
                <p>At the head of the school of the “Secentisti” comes Giovan Battista Marini of
                    Naples, born in 1569, especially known by a poem called <hi rend="italic"
                    >H</hi><hi rend="italic">Adone.</hi> His aim was to excite wonder by novelties;
                    hence the most extravagant metaphors, the most forced antitheses, the most
                    far-fetched conceits, are to be found in his book. It was especially by
                    antitheses that he thought he could produce the greatest effect. Sometimes he
                    strings them together one after the other, so that they fill up whole stanzas
                    without a break. Achillini of Bologna followed in Marini’s steps. He had less
                    genius, however, and hence his peculiarities were more extravagant, becoming
                    indeed absolutely ridiculous. In general, we may say that all the poets of the
                    17th century were more or less infected with “Marinism.” Thus Alessandro Guidi,
                    although he does not attain to the exaggeration of his master, is emptily
                    bombastic, inflated, turgid, while Fulvio Testi is artificial and affected. Yet
                    Guidi as well as Testi felt the influence of another poet, Gabriello Chiabrera,
                    born at Savona in 1552. In him the Secentismo took another character. Enamoured
                    as he said he was of the Greeks, he made new metres, especially in imitation of
                    Pindar, treating of religious, moral, historical, and amatory subjects. It is
                    easy to understand that a Pindaric style of poetry in the 17th century in Italy
                    could not but end in being altogether artificial, without anything of those
                    qualities which constitute the greatness of the Greek poet. Chiabrera, though
                    elegant enough in form, proves empty of matter, and, in his vain attempt to hide
                    this vacuity, has recourse to poetical ornaments of every kind. These again, in
                    their turn, become in him a fresh defect. Nevertheless, Chiabrera’s school, in
                    the decadence of the 17th century, marks an improvement; and sometimes he showed
                    that he had lyrical capacities, which in better literary surroundings would have
                    brought forth excellent fruit. When he sings, for example, of the victories of
                    the Tuscan galleys against the Turks and the pirates of the Mediterranean, he
                    rises to grand imagery, and seems quite another poet.</p>
                <p>Filicaia the Florentine has a certain lyric <hi rend="italic">elan,</hi>
                    particularly in the songs about Vienna besieged by the Turks, which seems to
                    raise him more than the others above the vices of the time; but even in him we
                    see clearly the rhetorical artifice and the falseness of the conceits. And in
                    general all the lyric poetry of the 17th century may be said to have had the
                    same defects, but in different degrees, —defects which may be summed up as
                    absence of feeling and exaggeration of form. There was no faith; there was no
                    love; and thus art became an exercise, a pastime, a luxury, for a servile and
                    corrupt people.</p>
                <p>The belief then arose that it would be sufficient to change the form in order to
                    restore literature, in forgetfulness that every reform must be the effect of a
                    change in social and moral conditions. Weary of the bombastic style of the 17th
                    century, full of conceits and antithesis, men said— let us follow an entirely
                    different line, let us fight the turgid style with simplicity. In 1690 the
                    “Academy of Arcadia” was instituted. Its founders were Giovan Maria Crescimbeni
                    and Gian Vincenzo Gravina. The Arcadia was so called because its chief aim and
                    intention were to imitate in literature the simplicity of the ancient shepherds,
                    who were fabulously supposed to have lived in Arcadia in the golden age. As the
                    “Secentisti” erred by an overweening desire for novelty, which made them always
                    go beyond the truth, so the Arcadians proposed to themselves to return to the
                    fields of truth, always singing of subjects of pastoral simplicity. This was
                    obviously nothing else than the substitution of a new artifice for the old one;
                    and they fell from bombast into effeminacy, from the hyperbolical into the
                    petty, from the turgid into the over-refined. The Arcadia was a reaction against
                    Secentismo, but a reaction which, reversing the movement of that earlier epoch,
                    only succeeded in impoverishing still further and completely withering up the
                    literature. The poems of the “Arcadians” fill many volumes, and are made up of
                    sonnets, madrigals, canzonets, and blank verse. The one who most distinguished
                    himself among the sonneteers was Felice Zappi. Among the authors of songs Paolo
                    Rolli was illustrious. Innocenzo Frugoni was more famous than all the others, a
                    man of fruitful imagination but of shallow intellect, whose wordy verses nobody
                    now reads.</p>
                <p>Whilst the political and social conditions in Italy in the 17th century were such
                    as to make it appear that every light of intelligence, all spirit of liberty,
                    was extinguished, there appeared in the peninsula, by that law of reaction which
                    in great part governs human events, some strong and independent thinkers, such
                    as Bernardino Telesio, Giordano Bruno, Tommaso Campanella, Lucilio Vanini, who
                    turned philosophical inquiry into fresh channels, and opened the way for the
                    scientific conquests of Galileo Galilei, the great contemporary of Descartes in
                    France and of Bacon in England. Galileo was not only a great man of science, but
                    also occupied a conspicuous place in the history of letters. A devoted student
                    of Ariosto, he seemed to transfuse into his prose the qualities of that great
                    poet,—a clear and frank freedom of expression, a wonderful art of knowing how to
                    say everything with precision and ease, and at the same time with elegance.
                    Galileo’s prose is in perfect antithesis to the poetry of his time. Perhaps it
                    is the best prose that Italy has ever had; it is clear, goes straight to the
                    point, is without rhetorical ornaments and without vulgar slips, artistic
                    without appearing to be so.</p>

                    in satire and in particular in that of Salvator Rosa and Alessandro Tassoni.
                    Salvator Rosa, born in 1615, near Naples, was a painter, a musician, and a poet.
                    As a poet he showed that he felt the sad condition of his country, showed that
                    he mourned over it, and gave vent to his feeling (as another satire-writer,
                    Giuseppe Giusti, said) in <hi rend="italic">generosi</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >rabbuffi.</hi> His exhortation to Italian poets to turn their thoughts to the
                    miseries of their country as a subject for their song —their country languishing
                    under the tyrant’s hands— certain passages where he deplores the effeminacy of
                    Italian habits, a strong apostrophe against Rome, make Salvator Rosa a precursor
                    of the patriotic literature which inaugurated the revival of the 18th century.
                    Tassoni, a man really quite exceptional in this century, was superior to Rosa.
                    He showed independent judgment in the midst of universal servility, and his <hi
                    rend="italic">Secchia Rapita</hi> proved that he was an eminent writer. This is
                    an heroic comic poem, which is at the same time an epic and a personal satire.
                    He was bold enough to attack the Spaniards in his <hi rend="italic"
                    >Fil·ippiche,</hi> in which he urged Duke Carlo Emanuele of Savoy to persist in
                    the war against them.</p>
                <p>6. <hi rend="italic">The Revival in the</hi> 18z7i <hi rend="italic"
                    >Century.—</hi> Having for the most part freed itself from the Spanish dominion
                    in the 18th century, the political condition of Italy began to improve.
                    Promoters of this improvement, which was shown in many civil reforms, were
                    Joseph II., Leopold I., and Charles I. The work of these princes was copied from
                    the philosophers, who in their turn felt the influence of a general movement of
                    ideas, which was quietly working in many parts of Europe, and which came to a
                    head in the French encyclopedists.</p>
                <p>Giambattista Vico was a token of the awakening of historical consciousness in
                    Italy. In his <hi rend="italic">Scienza Nuova</hi> he applied himself to the
                    investigation of the laws governing the progress of the human race, and
                    according to which events are developed. From the psychological study of man he
                    endeavoured to infer the “comune natura delle nazioni,” <hi rend="italic"
                    >i.e.,</hi> the universal laws of history, or the laws by which civilizations
                    rise, flourish, and fall.</p>
                <p>From the same scientific spirit which animated the philosophical investigation of
                    Vico, there was born a different kind of investigation, that of the sources of
                    Italian civil and literary history. Lodovico Antonio Muratori, after having
                    collected in one entire body <hi rend="italic">(Rerum Italicarum
                    Scriptores)</hi> the chronicles, the biographies, the letters, and the diaries
                    of Italian history from 500 to 1500, after having discussed the most obscure
                    historical questions in the <hi rend="italic">Antiquitates Italicae
                    Medii</hi><hi rend="italic">Aevi,</hi> wrote the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Annali</hi><hi rend="italic">cι Dalia,</hi> minutely narrating facts derived
                    from authentic sources. Muratori’s associates in his historical researches were
                    Scipione Maffei of Verona and Apostolo Zeno of Venice. In his <hi rend="italic"
                    >Verona</hi><hi rend="italic">illustrata</hi> the former left, not only a
                    treasure of learning, but an excellent specimen of historical monograph. The
                    latter added much to the erudition of literary history, both in his <hi
                    rend="italic">Dissertazioni Vossiane</hi> and in his notes to the <hi
                    rend="italic">Biblioteca delΓ Eloquenza Italiana</hi> of Monsignore Giusto
                    Fontanini. Girolamo Tiraboschi and the Count Giovanni Maria Mazzuchelli of
                    Brescia devoted themselves to literary history. The latter meant to give in his
                    <hi rend="italic">Scrittori T Italia,</hi> not only the biography of all the
                    writers, but an account of their works. Only six volumes were printed,
                    containing the letters A and B; but the immense materials collected by him are
                    in the Vatican library, and it is to be hoped that some day they may be arranged
                    and published.</p>
                <p>While the new spirit of the times led men to the investigation of historical
                    sources, it also led them to inquire into the mechanism of economical and social
                    laws. Francesco Galiani wrote on currency; Gaetano Filangieri wrote a <hi
                    rend="italic">Scienza della Legislazione.</hi> Cesare Beccaria, in his treatise
                    <hi rend="italic">Dei Delitti e</hi><hi rend="italic">delle</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Pene,</hi> made a contribution to the reform of the penal system
                    and promoted the abolition of torture.</p>
                <p>The man in whom above all others the literary revival of the 18th century was
                    most conspicuously embodied was Giuseppe Parini. He was born in a Lombard
                    village in 1729, was mostly educated at Milan, and as a youth was known among
                    the Arcadian poets by the name of Darisbo Elidonio. Even as an Arcadian,
                    however, Parini showed signs of departing from the common type. In a collection
                    of poems that he published at twenty-three years of age, under the name of
                    Ripano Eupilino, there are some pastoral sonnets in which the poet shows that he
                    had the faculty of taking his scenes from real life, and also some satirical
                    pieces in which he exhibits a spirit of somewhat rude opposition to his own
                    times. These poems are perhaps based on reminiscences of Berni, but at any rate
                    they indicate a resolute determination to assail boldly all the literary
                    conventionalities that surrounded the author. This, however, was only the
                    beginning of the battle. Parini lived in times of great social prostration. The
                    nobles and the rich, all given up to ease and to silly gallantry, consumed their
                    lives in ridiculous trifles or in shameless self-indulgence, wasting themselves
                    on immoral “Cicisbeismo,” and offering the most miserable spectacle of
                    feebleness of mind and character. It was against this social condition that
                    Parini’s muse was directed. Already, improving on the poems of his youth, he had
                    proved himself an innovator in his lyrics, rejecting at once Petrarchism,
                    Secentismo, and Arcadia, the three maladies that had weakened Italian art in the
                    centuries preceding his own, and choosing subjects taken from real life, such as
                    might help in the instruction of his contemporaries. In the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Odi</hi> the satirical note is already heard. But it came out more strongly in
                    the poem <hi rend="italic">Del</hi><hi rend="italic">Giorno,</hi> in which he
                    imagines himself to be teaching a young Milanese patrician all the habits and
                    ways of gallant life; he shows up all its ridiculous frivolities, and with
                    delicate irony unmasks the futilities of aristocratic habits. Dividing the day
                    into four parts, the Mattino, the Mezzogiorno, the Vespero, the Notte, by means
                    of each of these he describes the trifles of which they were made up, and the
                    book thus assumes a social and historical value of the highest importance.
                    Parini, satirizing his time, fell back upon truth, and finally made art serve
                    the purpose of civil morality. As an artist, going straight back to classical
                    forms, aspiring to imitate Virgil and Dante, he opened the way to the fine
                    school that we shall soon see rise, that of Alfieri, Foscolo, and Monti. As a
                    work of art, the <hi rend="italic">Giorno</hi> is wonderful for the Socratic
                    skill with which that delicate irony is constantly kept up by which he seems to
                    praise what he effectually blames. The verse has new harmonies; sometimes it is
                    a little hard and broken, not by accident, but as a protest against the Arcadian
                    monotony. Generally it flows majestically, but without that Frugonian droning
                    that deafens the ears and leaves the heart cold.</p>
                <p>Gasparo Gozzi’s satire was less elevated, but directed towards the same end as
                    Parini’s. In his <hi rend="italic">Osservatore,</hi> something like Addison’s
                    <hi rend="italic">Spectator,</hi> in his <hi rend="italic">Gazzetta Veneta,</hi>
                    in the <hi rend="italic">Mondo</hi><hi rend="italic">Morale,</hi> by means of
                    allegories and novelties he hit the vices with a delicate touch, and inculcated
                    a practical moral with much good sense. Gozzi’s satire has some slight
                    resemblance in style to Lucian’s. It is smooth and light, but withal it does not
                    go less straight to its aim, which is to point out the defects of society and to
                    correct them. Gozzi’s prose is very graceful and lively. It only errs by its
                    overweening affectation of imitating the writers of the 14th century. Another
                    satirical writer of the first half of the 18th century was Giuseppe Baretti of
                    Turin. In a journal called the <hi rend="italic">Frusta Letteraria</hi> he took
                    to lashing <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit13newyrich/page/n534/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0913-0534-0513"/> without mercy the works which were then being
                    published in Italy. He had learnt much by travelling; and especially his long
                    stay in England had contributed to give an independent character to his mind,
                    and made him judge of men and things with much good sense. It is true that his
                    judgments are not always right, but the <hi rend="italic">Frusta Letteraria</hi>
                    was the first book of independent criticism, directed particularly against the
                    Arcadians and the pedants.</p>
                <p>Everything tended to improvement, and the character of the reform was to throw
                    off the conventional, the false, the artificial, and to return to truth. The
                    drama felt this influence of the times. Apostolo Zeno and Metastasio (the
                    Arcadian name for Pietro Trapassi, a native of Rome) had endeavoured to make
                    “melodrama and reason compatible.” The latter in particular succeeded in giving
                    fresh expression to the affections, a natural turn to the dialogue, and some
                    interest to the plot; and if he had not fallen into constant unnatural
                    over-refinement and unseasonable mawkishness, and into frequent anachronisms, he
                    might have been considered as the first dramatic reformer of the 18th century.
                    That honour belongs to Carlo Goldoni, a Venetian. He found comedy either
                    entirely devoted to classical imitation, or given up to extravagance, to <hi
                    rend="italic">coups de</hi><hi rend="italic">théâtre,</hi> to the most
                    boisterous succession of unlikely situations, or else treated by comic actors
                    who recited impromptu on a given subject, of which they followed the outline. In
                    this old popular form of comedy, with the masks of pantaloon, of the doctor, of
                    harlequin, of Brighella, &amp;c., Goldoni found the strongest obstacles to his
                    reform. But at last he conquered, creating the comedy of character. No doubt
                    Molière’s example helped him in this. Goldoni’s characters are always true, but
                    often a little superficial. He studied nature, but he did not plunge into
                    psychological depths. In most of his creations, the external rather than the
                    internal part is depicted. In this respect he is much inferior to Molière. But
                    on the other hand he surpasses him in the liveliness of the dialogue, and in the
                    facility with which he finds his dramatic situations. Goldoni wrote much, in
                    fact too much (more than one hundred and fifty comedies), and had no time to
                    correct, to polish, to perfect his works, which are all rough cast. But for a
                    comedy of character we must go straight from Machiavelli’s <hi rend="italic"
                    >Mandragora</hi> to him. Goldoni’s dramatic aptitude is curiously illustrated by
                    the fact that he took nearly all his types from Venetian society, and yet
                    managed to give them an inexhaustible variety. A good many of his comedies were
                    written in Venetian dialect, and these are perhaps the best.</p>
                <p>The ideas that were making their way in French society in the 18th century, and
                    afterwards brought about the Revolution of 1789, gave a special direction to
                    Italian literature of the second half of the 18th century. Love of ideal
                    liberty, desire for equality, hatred of tyranny, created in Italy a literature
                    which aimed at national objects, seeking to improve the condition of the country
                    by freeing it from the double yoke of political and religious despotism. But all
                    this was associated with another tendency. The Italians who aspired to a
                    political redemption believed that it was inseparable from an intellectual
                    revival, and it seemed to them that this could only be effected by a reunion
                    with ancient classicism,—in other words, by putting themselves in more direct
                    communication with ancient Greek and Latin writers. This was a repetition of
                    what had occurred in the first half of the 15th century. The 17th century might
                    in fact be considered as a new Italian Middle Age without the hardness of that
                    iron time, but corrupted, enervated, overrun by Spaniards and French, an age in
                    which previous civilization was cancelled. A reaction was necessary against that
                    period of history, and a construction on its ruins of a new country and a new
                    civilization. There had already been forerunners of this movement; at the head
                    of them the revered Parini. Now the work must be completed, and the necessary
                    force must once more be sought for in the ancient literature of the two classic
                    nations. Patriotism and classicism then were the two principles that inspired
                    the literature which began with Alfieri. He worshipped the Greek and Roman idea
                    of popular liberty in arms against the tyrant. He took the subjects of his
                    tragedies almost invariably from the history of these nations, made continual
                    apostrophes against the despots, made his ancient characters talk like
                    revolutionists of his time; he did not trouble himself with, nor think about,
                    the truth of the characters; it was enough for him that his hero was Roman in
                    name, that there was a tyrant to be killed, that liberty should triumph in the
                    end. But even this did not satisfy Alfieri. Before his time and all about him
                    there was the Arcadian-school, with its foolish verbosity, its empty abundance
                    of epithets, its nauseous pastoralizing on subjects of no civil importance. It
                    was necessary to arm the patriotic muse also against all this. If the Arcadians,
                    not excluding the hated Metastasio, diluted their poetry with languishing
                    tenderness, if they poured themselves out in so many words, if they made such
                    set phrases, it behoved the others to do just the contrary, to be brief,
                    concise, strong, bitter, to aim at the sublime as opposed to the lowly and
                    pastoral. Having said this, we have told the good and evil of Alfieri. He
                    desired a political reform by means of letters: he saved literature from
                    Arcàdian vacuities, leading it towards a national end; he armed himself with
                    patriotism and classicism in order to drive the profaners out of the temple of
                    art. But in substance he was rather a patriot than an artist. In any case the
                    results of the new literary movement were copious.</p>
                <p>Ugo Foscolo was an eager patriot, who carried into life the heat of the most
                    unbridled passion, and into his art a rather rhetorical manner, but always one
                    inspired by classical models. His life was a most exciting one: he was a soldier
                    with General Massena, a professor of eloquence at the university of Pavia, an
                    exile after 1815. Three strong passions were always united in him—a passion for
                    Italy, for art, and for beautiful women. Foscolo was born at Zante, and took
                    pride in being a Greek. He translated some books of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Iliad,</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">Coma Berenices</hi> of Catullus. He
                    studied classical authors widely, and in his original works the reflexion of
                    them is perceptible. The <hi rend="italic">Lettere di Jacopo</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Ortis,</hi> inspired by Goethe’s <hi rend="italic">Werther,</hi>
                    are a love story with a mixture of patriotism; they contain a violent protest
                    against the treaty of Campo Formio, and an outburst from Foscolo’s own heart
                    about an unhappy love-affair of his. His passions were sudden and violent; they
                    came to an end as abruptly as they began; they were whirlwinds that were over in
                    a quarter of an hour. To one of these passions <hi rend="italic">Ortis</hi> owed
                    its origin, and it is perhaps the best, the most sincere, of all his writings.
                    Even in it he is sometimes pompous and rhetorical, but much less so than he is,
                    for example, in the lectures <hi rend="italic">DeW</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Origine</hi><hi rend="italic">e dell</hi> ’ <hi rend="italic">Uffιcio della
                    Letteratura.</hi> On the whole, Foscolo’s prose is turgid and affected, and
                    reflects the character of the man who always tried to pose, even before himself,
                    in dramatic attitudes. This was indeed the defect of the Napoleonic epoch; there
                    was a horror of anything common, simple, natural; everything must be after the
                    model of the hero who made all the world gaze with wonder at him; everything
                    must assume some heroic shape. In Foscolo this tendency was excessive; and it
                    not seldom happened that, in wishing to play the hero, the exceptional man, the
                    little Napoleon of ladies’ drawing-rooms, he became false and bad, false in his
                    art, bad in his life. The <hi rend="italic">Sepolcri,</hi> which is his best
                    poem, was prompted by high <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit13newyrich/page/n535/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0913-0535-0514"/> feeling, and the mastery of versification shows
                    wonderful art. Perhaps it is to this mastery more than to anything else that the
                    admiration the <hi rend="italic">Sepolcri</hi> excites is due. There are most
                    obscure p ιssages in it, as to the meaning of which it would seem as if even the
                    author himself had not formed a clear idea. He left incomplete three hymns to
                    the Graces, in which he sang of beauty as the source of courtesy, of all high
                    qualities, and of happiness. Here again what most excites our admiration is the
                    harmonious and easy versification, Among his prose works a high place belongs to
                    his translation of the <hi rend="italic">Sentimental Journey</hi> of Sterne, a
                    writer by whom one can easily understand how Foscolo should have been deeply
                    affected. He went as an exile to England, and died there. He wrote for English
                    readers some <hi rend="italic">Essays</hi> on Petrarch and on the texts of the
                    <hi rend="italic">Decamerone</hi> and of Dante, which are remarkable for the
                    time at which they were written, and which may be said to have initiated a new
                    kind of literary criticism in Italy. Foscolo is still greatly admired, and not
                    without reason. His writings stimulate the love of fatherland, and the men that
                    made the revolution of 1848 were largely brought up on them. Still, his fame
                    both as a man and as an artist is now on the decline.</p>
                <p>If in Foscolo patriotism and classicism were united, and formed almost one
                    passion, so much cannot be said of Vincenzo Monti, in whom the artist was
                    absolutely predominant. Yet we must be careful: .Monti was a patriot too, but in
                    his own way. He had no one deep feeling that ruled him, or rather the mobility
                    of his feelings is his characteristic; but each of these was a new form of
                    patriotism, that took the place of an old one. He saw danger to his country in
                    the French Revolution, and wrote the <hi rend="italic">Pellegrino
                    Aρostolico,</hi> the <hi rend="italic">Bassvilliana,</hi> and the <hi
                    rend="italic">Feroniade∙,</hi> Napoleon’s victories caused him to write the <hi
                    rend="italic">Prometeo</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">Musagonia</hi>; in his <hi
                    rend="italic">Fanatisme)</hi> and his <hi rend="italic">Superstizione</hi> he
                    attacked the papacy; afterwards he sang the praises of tho Austrians. Thus every
                    great event made him change his mind, with a readiness which might seem
                    incredible, but is yet most easily explained. Monti was above everything an
                    artist; art was his real, his only passion; everything else in him was liable to
                    change, that alone was persistent. Fancy was his tyrant, and under its rule he
                    had no time to reason and to see the miserable aspect of his political
                    tergiversation. It was an overbearing deity that moved him, and at its dictation
                    he wrote. Pius VI., Napoleon, Francis II., were to him but passing shadows, to
                    which he hardly gives the attention of an hour; that which endures, which is
                    eternal to him, is art alone. It were unjust to accuse Monti of baseness. If we
                    say that nature in giving him one only faculty had made the poet rich and the
                    man poor, we shall speak the truth. But the poet was indeed rich. Knowing little
                    Greek, he succeeded in making a translation of the <hi rend="italic">Iliad</hi>
                    which is remarkable for its Homeric feeling, and in his <hi rend="italic"
                    >Bassvilliana</hi> he is on a level with Dante. In fine, in him classical poetry
                    seemed to revive in all its florid grandeur.</p>
                <p>Monti was born in 1754, Foscolo in 1778; four years later still was born another
                    poet of the same school, Giambattista Niccolini. In literature he was'a
                    classicist; in politics he was a Ghibelline, a rare exception in Guelph
                    Florence, his birthplace. In translating or, if the expression is preferred,
                    imitating Aeschylus, as well as in writing the <hi rend="italic">Discorsi sulla
                    Tragedia Greca,</hi> and on the <hi rend="italic">Sublime e Michelangelo,</hi>
                    Niccolini displayed his passionate devotion to ancient literature. In his
                    tragedies he set himself free from the excessive rigidity of Altieri, and partly
                    approached the English and German tragic authors. He nearly always chose
                    political subjects, striving to keep alive in his compatriots the love of
                    liberty. Such are <hi rend="italic">Nabucco, Antonio Foscarini, Giovanni da
                    Procida, Lodovico</hi><hi rend="italic">il</hi><hi rend="italic">Moro,</hi>
                    &amp;c. He assailed papal Rome in <hi rend="italic">Arnaldo da Brescia,</hi> a
                    long tragic piece, not suited for acting, and epic rather than dramatic.
                    Niccolini’s tragedies show a rich lyric vein rather than dramatic genius. At any
                    rate he has the merit of having vindicated liberal ideas, and of having opened a
                    new path to Italian tragedy.</p>
                <p>The literary period we are dealing with had three writers who are examples of the
                    direction taken by historical study. It seems strange that, after the learned
                    school begun by Muratori, there should have been a backward movement here, but
                    it is clear that this retrogression was due to the influence of classicism and
                    patriotism, which, if they revived poetry, could not but spoil history. Carlo
                    Botta, born in 1766, was a spectator of French spoliation in Italy and of the
                    overbearing rule of Napoleon. Hence, excited by indignation, he wrote a <hi
                    rend="italic">History of Italy from</hi> 1789 <hi rend="italic">to</hi> 1814;
                    and later on he continued Guicciardini’s <hi rend="italic">History</hi> up to
                    1789. He wrote after the manner of the Latin authors, trying to imitate Livy,
                    putting together long and sonorous periods in a style that aimed at being like
                    Boccaccio’s, caring little about that which constitutes the critical material of
                    history, only intent on declaiming his academic prose for his country’s benefit.
                    Botta wanted to be classical in a style that could no longer be so, and hence he
                    failed completely to attain his literary goal. His fame is only that of a man of
                    a noble and patriotic heart. Not so bad as the two histories of Italy is that of
                    the <hi rend="italic">Guerra dell' lndipendenza Americana.</hi></p>
                <p>Close to Botta comes Pietro Colletta, a Neapolitan born nine years after him. He
                    also in his <hi rend="italic">Stoma del Beame di Napoli dal</hi> 1734 <hi
                    rend="italic">αl</hi> 1825 had the idea of defending the independence and
                    liberty of Italy in a style borrowed from Tacitus; and he succeeded rather
                    better than Botta. He has a rapid, brief, nervous style, which makes his book
                    attractive reading. But it is said that Pietro Giordani and Gino Capponi
                    corrected it for him. Lazzaro Papi of Lucca, author of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Commentam</hi><hi rend="italic">della Rivoluzione Francese dal</hi> 1789 <hi
                    rend="italic">al</hi> 1814, was not altogether unlike Botta and Colletta. He
                    also was an historian in the classical style, and treats his subject with
                    patriotic feeling; but as an artist he perhaps excels the other two.</p>
                <p>At first sight it seems unnatural that, whilst the most burning political
                    passions were raging, and whilst the most brilliant men of genius in the new
                    classical and patriotic school were at the height of their influence, a question
                    should have arisen about “purism” of language. Yet the phenomenon can be easily
                    accounted for. Purism is another form of classicism and patriotism. In the
                    second half of the 18th century the Italian language was specially full of
                    French expressions. There was great indifference about fitness, still more about
                    elegance of style. Prose then was to be restored for the sake of national
                    dignity, and it was believed that this could not be done except by going back to
                    the writers of the 14th century, to the “aurei trecentisti,” as they were
                    called, or else to the classics of Italian literature. One of the promoters of
                    the new school was Antonio Cesari of Verona, who republished ancient authors,
                    and brought out a new edition, with additions, of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Vocabolamo della Crusca.</hi> He wrote a dissertation <hi rend="italic"
                    >Sopra</hi><hi rend="italic">lo</hi><hi rend="italic">stato</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">presente</hi><hi rend="italic">della Lingua Italiana,</hi> and
                    endeavoured to establish the supremacy of Tuscan and of the three great writers
                    Dante, Petrarch, Boccaccio. And in accordance with that principle he wrote
                    several books, taking pains to copy the “trecentisti” as closely as possible.
                    But patriotism in Italy has always had something municipal in it; so to this
                    Tuscan supremacy, proclaimed and upheld by Cesari, there was opposed a Lombard
                    school, which would know nothing of Tuscan, and with Dante’s <hi rend="italic"
                    >De</hi><hi rend="italic">Vulgari Eloquio</hi> returned to the idea of the
                    “lingua illustre.” This was an old question, largely and bitterly argued in the
                    Cinquecento (16th century) by Varchi, <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit13newyrich/page/n536/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0913-0536-0515"/> Muzio, Castelvetro, Speroni, and others. Now the
                    question came up again quite fresh, as if no one had ever discussed it before.
                    At the head of the Lombard school were Monti and his son-in-law Count Giulio
                    Perticari. This gave Monti an occasion to write <hi rend="italic"
                    >Proposta</hi><hi rend="italic">di αlcune Corre-zioni ed Aggiuηte al Vocabolarw
                    della Crusca,</hi> in which he attacked the Tuscanisnι of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Crusca,</hi> but in a graceful and easy style, such in fact as to form a prose
                    that is one of the most beautiful in Italian literature. Perticari on the other
                    hand, with a very inferior intellect, narrowed and exasperated the question in
                    two treatises <hi rend="italic">Degli Scrittori del Trecento</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">Dell’</hi><hi rend="italic">Amor</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Patrio</hi><hi rend="italic">di Dante,</hi> in which, often disguising or
                    altering the facts, he only makes confusion where there was none. Meantime,
                    however, the impulse was given. The dispute about language took its place beside
                    literary and political disputes, and all Italy took part in it,—Basilio Puoti at
                    Naples, Paolo Costa in the Romagna, Marc’ Antonio Parenti at Modena, Salvatore
                    Betti at Rome, Giovanni Gherardini in Lombardy, Luigi Fornaciari at Lucca,
                    Vincenzo Nairnucci at Florence.</p>
                <p>A patriot, a classicist, and a purist all at once was Pietro Giordani, born in
                    1774; he was almost a compendium of the literary movement of the time. His whole
                    life was a battle fought for liberty. Most learned in Greek and Latin authors,
                    and in the Italian trecentisti, he only left a few writings behind him, but they
                    were carefully elaborated in point of style, and his prose was in his time
                    considered wonderful. Now it is looked on as too majestic, too much laboured in
                    phrases and conceits, too far from nature, too artificial. Giordani closes the
                    literary epoch of the classicists.</p>
                <p>7. <hi rend="italic">Contemporary Period.—</hi> At this point the contemporary
                    period of literature begins. It has been said that the first impulse was given
                    to it by the romantic school, which had as its organ the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Conciliatore</hi> established in 1818 at Milan, and on the staff of which were
                    Silvio Pellico, Lodovico di Breme, Giovile Scalvini, Tommaso Grossi, Giovanni
                    Berchet, Samuele Biava, and lastly Alessandro Manzoni. It need not be denied
                    that all these men were influenced by the ideas that, especially in Germany, at
                    the beginning of the 19th century constituted the movement called Romanticism.
                    Nevertheless in Italy the course of literary reform took another direction.
                    There is no doubt that the real head of the reform, or at least its most
                    distinguished man, was Alessandro Manzoni. He formulated in a letter of his the
                    objects of the new school, saying that it aspired to try and discover and
                    express “il vero storico” and “il vero morale,” not only as an end, but as the
                    widest and eternal source of the beautiful. And it is precisely realism in art
                    that characterizes Italian literature from Manzoni onwards. The <hi
                    rend="italic">Promessi Sposi</hi> is the one of his works that has made him
                    immortal. No doubt the idea of the historical novel came to him from Sir Walter
                    Scott, but he succeeded in something more than an historical novel in the narrow
                    meaning of that word; he created an eminently realistic work of art. The romance
                    disappears; no one cares for the plot, which moreover is of very little
                    consequence. The attention is entirely fixed on the powerful objective creation
                    of the characters. From the greatest to the least they have a wonderful
                    verisimilitude; they are living persons standing before us, not with the
                    qualities of one time more than another, but with the human qualities of all
                    time. Manzoni is able to unfold a character in all particulars, to display it in
                    all its aspects, to follow it through its different phases. He is able also to
                    seize one moment, and from that moment to make us guess all the rest. Don
                    Abbondio and Renzo are as perfect as Azzeccagarbugli and II Sarto. Manzoni dives
                    down into the innermost recesses of the human heart, and draws thence the most
                    subtle psychological reality. In this his greatness lies, which was recognized
                    first by his companion in genius, Goethe. With the exception of the <hi
                    rend="italic">Promessi Sposi,</hi> his works are important for the history of
                    the author’s mind, not for the history of literature. Some of them are rather in
                    contrast to that masterpiece. It is chiefly the <hi rend="italic">Inηi
                    Sac</hi><hi rend="italic">∣</hi><hi rend="italic">i</hi> and the two tragedies
                    that explain why Manzoni became the head of the school of Romanticism. It is not
                    to be denied that even as a poet he had gleams of genius, especially where he
                    describes human affections, as in some stanzas of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Irini</hi> and in the chorus of the <hi rend="italic">Adelchi.</hi> But it is
                    the <hi rend="italic">Promessi Sposi</hi> alone that places him at the head of
                    the Italian literature of the 19th century, on account of the artistic realism
                    prevailing in it. But Manzoni shared this glory with another writer, Giacomo
                    Leopardi. It may seem absurd, but still it is the case, that the mystic, the
                    religious Manzoni, has his place side by side with the poet of atheism and
                    despair: they are indissolubly bound together for all time by an artistic
                    intention, identical although realized by different means. Leopardi was born
                    thirteen years after Manzoni at Recanati, of a patrician family, bigoted and
                    avaricious, and he almost entirely educated himself. His body was deformed, and
                    he was of a sickly habit, so that in the years that bring cheerfulness and
                    laughter to youths and children he shut himself up in his father’s library and
                    studied. He became so familiar with Greek authors that he used afterwards to say
                    that the Greek mode of thought was more clear and living to his mind than the
                    Latin or even the Italian. Solitude, sickness, domestic tyranny, prepared him
                    for profound melancholy. From this he passed into complete religious scepticism.
                    He sought rest in art, and first wrote a <hi rend="italic">Canzone all'
                    Italia</hi> and another for the monument of Dante Alighieri (1818), both full of
                    classical and patriotic feeling. They show that for the time, though only for
                    the time, he was of the school of Alfieri, Foscolo, and the others we have
                    spoken of. His love of classicism always continued, but he changed its subject.
                    He passed on into the poetry of sentiment and nature, describing with an
                    unsurpassable realism what he felt and saw. The <hi rend="italic"
                    >Passero</hi><hi rend="italic">solitario,</hi> the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Quiete</hi><hi rend="italic">dopo la Tempesta,</hi> the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Sabato</hi><hi rend="italic">del Villaggio,</hi> are pictures in which
                    objective realism reaches its highest ideality; whilst beside them there are the
                    <hi rend="italic">Ultimo Canto di Saffo,</hi> the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Picordanze,</hi> the <hi rend="italic">Genestra,</hi> and other poems, in which
                    is poured out all the sorrow that weighs on the unhappy man to whom nature has
                    denied every joy and every happiness. Everything is terrible and grand in these
                    poems, which are the most agonizing cry in modern literature, uttered with a
                    solemn quietness that at once elevates and terrifies us. The poetry of despair
                    never had a more powerful or a more sorrowful voice than this. In this Leopardi
                    surpasses even Byron and Shelley. But, besides being the greatest poet of nature
                    and of sorrow, he was also an excellent prose writer. In his <hi rend="italic"
                    >Operette</hi><hi rend="italic">Morali</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi> dialogues
                    and discourses marked by a cold and bitter smile at human destinies which
                    freezes the reader—the clearness of style, the simplicity of language, and the
                    depth of conception are such that perhaps he is not only the first poet since
                    Dante, but also the most perfect writer of prose that Italian literature has
                    had.</p>
                <p>As realism in art gained ground, the positive method in criticism kept pace with
                    it. From the manner of Botta and Colletta history returned to its spirit of
                    learned research, as is shown in such works as the <hi rend="italic">Archivio
                    Storico Italiano,</hi> established at Florence by Giampietro Vieusseux, the <hi

                    learned scholars, there was also in the first half of the 19th century a
                    patriotic literature. To a close observer it will appear that historical
                    learning itself was inspired by the love of Italy. It is well known what

                    >Antologia.</hi> Florence was in those days the asylum of all the Italian
                    exiles, and these exiles met and shook hands in Vieusseux’s rooms, where there
                    was more literary than political talk, but where one thought and one only
                    animated all minds, the thought of Italy.</p>
                <p>The literary movement which preceded and was contemporary with the political
                    revolution of 1848 may be said to be represented by four writers,— Giuseppe
                    Giusti, Francesco Domenico Guerrazzi, Vincenzo Gioberti, and Cesare Balbo.
                    Giusti wrote epigrammatic satires in popular language. In incisive phrase he
                    scourged the enemies of Italy; his manner seemed very original, but it really
                    was partly imitated from Beranger. He was a telling political writer, but a
                    mediocre poet,—too much a poet of occasion. Few of his verses will survive as
                    works of art. Guerrazzi had a great reputation and great influence; he was the
                    author of historical novels written with a political object, such as the <hi
                    rend="italic">Assedio di Firenze,</hi> the <hi rend="italic">Battaglia di
                    Benevento,</hi> &amp;c. Read with feverish avidity before 1848, these books of
                    his are now almost forgotten. They struck the·imagination then by their style,
                    which is partly affected and partly spasmodic. They seemed to be sublime, but
                    were little less than ridiculous. Gioberti had a noble heart and a great mind;
                    his philosophical works are already as good as dead, but the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Primato morale e civile degli Italiani</hi> will last as an important document
                    of the times. It is a book false in substance, but inspired by lofty sentiments,
                    and it is written in an easy and eloquent style, although sometimes a little
                    verbose. The <hi rend="italic">Gesuita</hi><hi rend="italic">moderno</hi> will
                    live as the most tremendous indictment ever written against the Jesuits.
                    Gioberti was a powerful polemical writer; and in polemics he showed his most
                    original and characteristic qualities. Balbo was an earnest student of history,
                    and made history useful for politics. Like Gioberti in his first period, Balbo
                    was zealous for the civil papacy, and for a federation of the Italian states
                    presided over by it. His <hi rend="italic">Sommario della</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Storia</hi><hi rend="italic">TItalia</hi> is the best epitome that exists of
                    the intricate history of Italy. In the <hi rend="italic">Pensieri sullα</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Storia</hi><hi rend="italic">d</hi><hi rend="italic superscript">
                    ,</hi><hi rend="italic">Italia</hi> he touched on important subjects, which
                    still await treatment. He did not do himself justice in the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Meditazioni Storiche,</hi> a work on the philosophy of history, for which he
                    had not the necessary qualifications.</p>
                <p>It is not advisable to speak of living authors. We shall only notice the fact
                    that the political revival in Italy seems to have brought forth good fruit also
                    in the fields of literature. It appears that the literary bent of the present
                    day is towards historical research. Of the poets, only one, Giosuè Carducci, has
                    as yet acquired a reputation that seems certain to last.</p>
