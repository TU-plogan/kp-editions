                    the East. A poor but beautiful Athenian orphan, she speedily added the
                    confidence to the love of her feeble husband, and at his death in 780 was left
                    by him sole guardian of the empire, and of their young son Constantine VI.
                    Seizing the supreme power in the name of the latter, Irene’s first endeavours
                    were to revive the orthodox image-worship, which she had secretly cherished,
                    although compelled solemnly to abjure it in the life-time of her iconoclastic
                    father-in-law and husband. In 784 she obtained the elevation of Tarasius, a
                    partisan of her own, to the patriarchate; and, at first suffering the laws
                    against image-worshippers to fall into disuse, she assembled a council of clergy
                    at Nicaea in 787 to discuss the whole question anew. An attempt to hold the
                    council at Constantinople in the preceding year had been frustrated by the
                    iconoclastic zeal of the soldiers. Under the auspices of a ruler whose wishes
                    were so clearly known, the decision of this second council of Nice could take
                    only one direction, and the Iconoclasts were hurled from their supremacy (vol.
                    xii. p. 713). So long as Constantine remained a child, Irene was able to combine
                    his interests and her own, and to rule wisely and faithfully; but as the prince
                    approached maturity he began to grow restive under her autocratic sway. An
                    attempt to free himself by force was met and crushed by the empress, who in her
                    first indignation demanded that the oath of fidelity should thenceforward be
                    taken to her name alone. The discontent which this occasioned swelled in 790
                    into open resistance, and the soldiers, headed by the Armenian guard, formally
                    proclaimed Constantine VI. as the sole ruler. A hollow semblance of friendship
                    was maintained between Constantine and Irene, whose title of empress he
                    confirmed in 792; but the court, the army, and the capital were divided between
                    rival factions, and that which supported the mother against her son grew daily
                    in number and strength. Constantine perceived his danger too late to avert it;
                    and when he saw the conspiracy ripe for action he could only flee for aid to the
                    provinces. But even there he was surrounded by those who were already too deeply
                    implicated in treason to refuse to complete their perfidy. Seized by his
                    attendants on the Asiatic shore of the <pb break="no"

                    to the palace at · Constantinople; and there, by the orders of his inhuman
                    mother, in the very porphyry chamber where he first saw the light, his eyes were
                    stabbed out by fierce blows of a murderous dagger. An eclipse of the sun and an
                    obscurity of seventeen days were attributed by the common superstition to the
                    horror of heaven at this crime. Irene, having thus removed her rival, reigned in
                    prosperity and splendour for five years. She is said to have endeavoured to
                    negotiate a marriage between herself and Charlemagne; but according to the Greek
                    writers, who alone mention it, the scheme was frustrated by Aetius, one of her
                    favourites. In 802 the patricians, upon whom she had lavished every honour and
                    favour, conspired against her, and placed the avaricious Nicephorus on the
                    throne. The haughty and unscrupulous princess, “who never lost sight of
                    political power in the height of her religious zeal,” who, hailed by the church
                    as a second Helena, the mother of another great Constantine, had revealed
                    herself to the world as a second Athaliah, was forced in her exile in Lesbos to
                    support herself by the daily toil of her distaff. She died the following year.
                    Her religious zeal has given her a place among the saints of the Greek
                    Church.</p>
