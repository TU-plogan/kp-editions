                <p><label type="entry">INSANITY</label><hi> INSANITY</hi> is a generic term applied
                    to certain morbid mental conditions produced by defect or disease of the brain.
                    The synonyms in more or less frequent use are mental disease, alienation,
                    derangement or aberration, madness, unsoundness of mind. There are many diseases
                    of the general system productive of disturbance of the mental faculties which,
                    either on account of their transient nature, from their being associated with
                    the course of a particular disease, or from their slight intensity, are not
                    included under the head of insanity proper. From a strictly scientific point of
                    view it cannot be doubted that the fever patient in his delirium, or the
                    drunkard in his excitement or stupor, is insane—that, the brain of either being
                    under the influence of a morbific agent or of a poison, the mental faculties are
                    deranged; yet such derangements are regarded as functional disturbances, <hi
                    rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> disturbances produced by agencies which experience
                    tells will, in the majority of cases, pass off within a given period without
                    permanent results on the tissues of the organ, The comprehensive scientific view
                    of the position is, that all diseases of the nervous system, whether primary or
                    secondary, congenital or acquired, should, in the words of Griesinger, be
                    regarded as one inseparable whole, of which the so-called mental diseases
                    comprise only a moderate proportion. However important it may be for the
                    physician to keep this principle before him, it may be freely admitted that it
                    cannot be carried out fully in practice, and that social considerations compel
                    the medical profession and the public at large to draw an arbitrary line between
                    such functional diseases of' the nervous system as hysteria, hypochondriasis,
                    and delirium on the one hand, and such conditions as mania, melancholia, and
                    dementia on the other.</p>
                <p>All attempts at a short definition of the term insanity have proved
                    unsatisfactory; perhaps the nearest approach to accuracy is attained by the
                    rough statement that it is <hi rend="italic">a chronic disease of the brain
                    inducing chronic disordered mental symptoms—</hi> the term disease being used in
                    its widest acceptation. But even this definition is at once too comprehensive,
                    as under it might be included certain of the functional disturbances alluded to,
                    and too exclusive, as it does not comprehend certain rare transitory forms.
                    Still, taken over all, this may be accepted as the least defective short
                    definition; and moreover it possesses the great practical advantage of keeping
                    before the student the primary fact that insanity is the result of disease of
                    the brain, that it is not a mere immaterial disorder of the intellect. In the
                    earliest epochs of medicine the corporeal character of insanity was generally
                    admitted, and it was not until the superstitious ignorance of the Middle Ages
                    had obliterated the scientific, though by no means always accurate, deductions
                    of the early writers that any theory of its purely psychical character arose. At
                    the present day it is unnecessary to combat such a theory, as it is universally
                    accepted that the brain is the organ through which mental phenomena are
                    manifested, and therefore that it is impossible to conceive of the existence of
                    an insane mind in a healthy brain. On this basis insanity may be defined as
                    consisting in <hi rend="italic">morbid conditions of the brain, the results of
                    defective formation or altered nutrition of its substance induced by local or
                    general morbid processes, and characterized especially by non-develoρment,
                    obliteration, impairment, or perversion of one or more of its psychical
                    functions.</hi> Thus insanity is not a simple condition; it comprises a large
                    number of diseased states of the brain, which have been gathered under one
                    popular term on account of mental defect or aberration being the predominant
                    symptom.</p>
                <p>The insanities are sharply divided into two great classes —the Congenital and the
                    Acquired. Under the head of Congenital Insanity fall to be considered all cases
                    in which, from whatever cause, brain development has been arrested, with
                    consequent impotentiality of development of the mental faculties; under that of
                    Acquired Insanity all those in which the brain has been born healthy, but has
                    suffered from morbid processes affecting it primarily, or from diseased states
                    of the general system implicating it secondarily. In studying the causation of
                    these two great classes, it will be found that certain remote influences exist
                    which are believed to be commonly predisposing; these will be considered as
                    such, leaving the proximate or exciting causes until each class with its genera
                    comes under review.</p>
                <p>In most treatises on the subject will be found discussed the bearing which
                    civilization, nationality, occupation, education, &lt;fcc., have, or are
                    supposed to have, on the production of insanity. Such discussions are generally
                    <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit13newyrich/page/n105/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0913-0105-0096"/> eminently unsatisfactory, founded as they are on
                    common observation, broad generalizations, and very imperfect statistics. As
                    they are for the most part negative in result, at the best almost entirely
                    irrelevant to the present purpose, it is proposed merely to shortly summarize
                    the general outcome of what has been arrived at by those authorities who have
                    sought to assess the value to be attached to the influence exercised by such
                    factors, without entering in any detail on the theories involved. (1) <hi
                    rend="italic">Civilization.—</hi> Although insanity is by no means unknown
                    amongst savage races, there can be no reasonable doubt that it is much more
                    frequently developed in civilized communities; also that, as the former come
                    under the influence of civilization, the percentage of lunacy is increased. This
                    is in consonance with the observation of disease of whatever nature, and is
                    dependent in the case of insanity on the wear and tear of nerve tissue involved
                    in the struggle for existence, the physically depressing effects of pauperism,
                    and on the abuse of alcoholic stimulants; each of which morbid factors falls to
                    be considered separately as a proximate cause. (2) <hi rend="italic"
                    >Nationality.—</hi> In the face of the imperfect social statistics afforded by
                    most European and American nations, and in their total absence or
                    inaccessibility amongst the rest of mankind, it is impossible to adduce any
                    trustworthy statement under this head. (3) <hi rend="italic">Occupation.—</hi>
                    There is nothing to prove that insanity is in any way connected with the
                    prosecution of any trade or profession <hi rend="italic">per se.</hi> Even if
                    statistics existed (which they do not) showing the proportion of lunatics
                    belonging to different occupations to the 1000 of the population, it is obvious
                    that no accurate deduction <hi rend="italic">quoad</hi> the influence of
                    occupation could be drawn. (4) <hi rend="italic">Education.—</hi> There is no
                    evidence to show that education has any influence over either the production or
                    the prevention of insanity. The general result of discussions on the above
                    subjects has been the production of a series of arithmetical statements, which
                    have either a misleading bearing or no bearing at all on the question. In the
                    study of insanity statistics are of slight value from the scientific point of
                    view, and are only valuable in its financial aspects.</p>
                <p>Of much greater importance is the question of hereditary predisposition to
                    nervous disease. There is a general and warrantable position taken up by the
                    medical profession, founded on the observation of ages, that a constitutional
                    condition may be generated in a family, which, although it may never manifest
                    itself in a concrete form of disease, may materially influence development, or
                    may make itself felt in a more subtle manner by a mere tendency to degenerative
                    changes. In this wise hereditary predisposition may be regarded as a common
                    factor in all insanities —in the congenital class as an arrester of brain
                    development, in the acquired as the producer of the nervous diathesis. How the
                    constitutional condition is generated, and in what its pathological nature
                    consists, is beyond the ken of science; it may in fact be freely admitted that
                    the proof of its existence hangs more on popular observation than on scientific
                    evidence. The observation is not confined to the nervous system; it extends
                    itself to others, as is shown by hereditary predisposition to gout, consumption,
                    cancer, and other diseases.</p>
                <p>It has been strongly asserted that consanguineous marriage is a prolific source
                    of nervous instability. There is considerable diversity of opinion on this
                    subject; the general outcome of the investigations of many careful inquirers
                    appears to be that the offspring of healthy cousins of a healthy stock is not
                    more liable to nervous disease than that of unrelated parents, but that where
                    there is a family history of diathesis of any kind there is a strong tendency in
                    the children of cousins to degeneration, not only in the direction of the
                    original diathesis, but also towards instability of the nervous system.<note

                    >The Marriage of Near Kin,</hi> 1875.</p></note> The objection to the marriage
                    of blood relations does not rise from the bare fact of their relationship, but
                    has its ground in the fear of their having similar vitiations in their
                    constitution, which, in their children, are prone to become intensified. There
                    is sufficient evidence adducible to prove that close breeding is productive of
                    degeneration; and when the multiform functions of the nervous system are taken
                    into account, it may almost be assumed not only that it suffers concomitantly
                    with other organs, but that it may also be the first to suffer
                    independently.</p>
                <p>Of the other causes affecting the parents which appear to have an influence in
                    engendering a predisposition to insanity in the offspring, the abuse of
                    alcoholic stimulants and opiates, over-exertion of the mental faculties,
                    advanced age, and weak health may be cited. Great stress has been laid on the
                    influence exercised by the first of these conditions, and many extreme
                    statements have been made regarding it. Such must be accepted with reserve, for,
                    although there is reason for attaching considerable weight to the history of
                    ancestral intemperance as a probable causating influence, it has been generally
                    assumed as the proved cause by those who have treated of the subject, without
                    reference to other agencies which may have acted in common with it, or quite
                    independently of it. The question has not as yet been fairly worked out. However
                    unsatisfactory from a scientific point of view it may appear, the general
                    statement must stand—that whatever tends to lower the nervous energy of a parent
                    may modify the development of the progeny. It is merely a matter of
                    probabilities in a given case.</p>
                <p>Constitutional tendency to nervous instability once established in a family may
                    make itself felt in various directions,—epilepsy, hysteria, hypochondriasis,
                    neuralgia, certain forms of paralysis, insanity, eccentricity. It is asserted
                    that exceptional genius in an individual member is a phenomenal indication.</p>
                <p>Confined to the question of insanity, this morbid inheritance may manifest itself
                    in two directions,·—in defective brain organization manifest from birth, or from
                    the age at which its faculties are potential, <hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi>
                    congenital insanity; or in the neurotic diathesis, which may be present in a
                    brain to all appearance congenitally perfect, and may present itself merely by a
                    tendency to break down under circumstances which would not affect a person of
                    originally healthy constitution.</p>
                <p>In systematic works and in asylum reports, it has been too much the fashion to
                    accept the evidence of the existence of insanity in a relative as a proof of
                    hereditary predisposition in a given case. In estimating the value to be
                    attached to such histories, two things must be taken into account,— first, the
                    amount and quality of proved ancestral nervous disease, and, secondly, the
                    period of life at which it appeared in the alleged insane ancestor. Take, for
                    instance, the case of a lunatic whose father or mother is reported to have died
                    insane; this may be true in fact, but may still have no bearing on the causation
                    of the patient’s insanity; for the parent may have been the subject of mental
                    disease at a period subsequent to the birth of the child, he may have drunk
                    himself into alcoholic mania late in life, or disease of the cerebral arteries
                    in old age may have produced senile insanity. It is difficult to limit the
                    remoteness<pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit13newyrich/page/n106/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0913-0106-0097"/> of relationship in tracing hereditary
                    predisposition, mainly from the fact that it frequently skips a generation. As a
                    rule it does not confine itself to a single individual of a family, but makes
                    itself felt in one form or another in several members. According to Esquirol and
                    Baillarger, it is more frequently transmitted through the female than through
                    the male branch, but this opinion is called in question by Koch of Würtemberg,
                    whose statistics show that hereditary tendency to insanity acts more strongly
                    through the father than through the mother.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Congenital Insanity.</hi></p>
                <p>The morbid mental conditions which fall to be considered under this head are <hi
                    rend="italic">Idiocy</hi> (with its modification <hi rend="italic"
                    >Imbecility)</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Cretinism.</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Idiocy.—</hi> In treating of idiocy it must be carefully borne in mind that we
                    are dealing with mental phenomena disassociated from active bodily disease, and
                    that, in whatever degree it may exist, we have to deal with a brain condition
                    fixed by the pathological circumstances under which its possessor came into the
                    world, or by such as had been present before full cerebral activity could be
                    developed, and the symptoms of which are not dependent on the intervention of
                    any subsequent morbid process. From the earliest ages the term <hi rend="italic"
                    >Amentia</hi> has been applied to this condition, in contradistinction to <hi
                    rend="italic">Dementia,</hi> the mental weakness following on acquired
                    insanity.</p>
                <p>The causes of congenital idiocy may be divided into four classes:—(1) hereditary
                    predisposition, (2) constitutional conditions of one or both parents affecting
                    the constitution of the infant, (3) injuries of the infant head prior to or at
                    birth, and (4) injuries or diseases affecting the infant head during infancy.
                    All these classes of causes may act in two directions: they may produce either
                    non-development or abnormal development of the cranial bones, as evidenced by
                    microcephalism, or by deformity of the head; or they may induce a more subtle
                    morbid condition of the constituent elements of the brain. As a rule, the
                    pathological process is more easily traceable in the case of the last three
                    classes than in the first. For instance, in the case of constitutional
                    conditions of the parents we may have a history of syphilis, a disease which
                    often leaves its traces on the bones of the skull; and in the third case
                    congenital malformation of the brain may be produced by mechanical causes acting
                    on the child in utero, such as attempts to procure abortion, and deformities of
                    the maternal pelvis rendering labour difficult and instrumental interference
                    necessary. In such cases the bones of the skull may be injured; it is only fair,
                    however, to say that more brains are saved than injured by instrumental
                    interference. With regard to the fourth class, it is evident that the term
                    congenital is not strictly applicable; but, as the period of life implicated is
                    that prior to the potentiality of the manifestation of the intellectual powers,
                    and as the result is identical with that of the other classes of causes, it is
                    warrantable to connect it with them, on pathological principles more than as a
                    mere matter of convenience.</p>
                <p>Dr Ireland, in his work <hi rend="italic">On Idiocy and Imbecility,</hi>
                    classifies idiots from the standpoint of pathology as follows :— (1) Genetous
                    idiocy: in this form, which he holds to be complete before birth, he believes
                    the presumption of heredity to be stronger than in other forms; the vitality of
                    the general system is stated to be lower than normal; the palate is vaulted and
                    narrow, the teeth misshapen, wrongly placed, and prone to decay, and the patient
                    dwarfish in appearance; the head is generally unsymmetrical, and the commissures
                    occasionally atrophied; (2) Microcéphalie idiocy, a term which explains itself;
                    (3) Eclampsie idiocy, due to the effects of infantile convulsions; (4) Epileptic
                    idiocy;</p>
                <p>(5) Hydrocephalic idiocy, due to water on the brain;</p>
                <p>(6) Paralytic idiocy, a rare form, due to the brain injury causing the paralysis;
                    (7) Traumatic idiocy, a form produced by the third class of causes above
                    mentioned; (8) Inflammatory idiocy; (9) Idiocy by deprivation of one or more of
                    the special senses. Dr Ireland’s wide experience has enabled him to
                    differentiate these groups further by describing the general characteristics,
                    mental and physical, of each.</p>
                <p>The general conformation of the idiot is often very imperfect; he is sometimes
                    deformed, but more frequently the frame is merely awkwardly put together, and he
                    is generally of short stature. Only about one-fourth of all idiots have heads
                    smaller than common. Many cases are on record in which the cranial measurements
                    exceed the average. It is the irregularity of development of the bones of the
                    skull, especially at the base, which marks the condition. Cases, however, often
                    present themselves in which the skull is perfect in form and size. In such the
                    mischief has begun in the brain matter. The palate is very often highly arched,
                    in some cleft; hare-lip is not uncommon; in fact congenital defect or
                    malformation of other organs than the brain is more commonly met with amongst
                    idiots than in the general community. Of the special senses, hearing is most
                    frequently absent. Sight is good, although coordination may be defective. Many
                    are mute. On account of the mental dulness it is difficult to determine whether
                    the senses of touch, taste, and smell suffer impairment; but the impression is
                    that their acuteness is below the average. It is needless to attempt a
                    description of the mental phenomena of idiots, which range between utter want of
                    intelligence and mere weakness of intellect.</p>
                <p>The term Imbecility has been conventionally employed to indicate the less
                    profound degrees of idiocy, but in point of fact no distinct line of demarcation
                    can be drawn; the application of either term to a given case depends more on the
                    opinion of the observer than on the condition of the observed. As the scale of
                    imbeciles ascends, it is found that the condition is èvidenced not so much by
                    low obtuseness as by irregularity of intellectual development. This serves to
                    mark the difference between the extreme stupidity of the lowest of the healthy
                    and the highest form of the morbidly deprived type. The two conditions do not
                    merge gradually one into the other. Extreme stupidity and sottish ness mark many
                    cases of idiocy, but only in the lowest types, where no dubiety of opinion can
                    exist as to their nature, and in a manner which can never be mistaken for the
                    dulness of the man who is less talented than the average of mankind. Where in
                    theory the morbid (morbid in the sense of deprivation) and the healthy types
                    might be supposed to approach each other, in practice we find that, in fact, no
                    debatable ground exists. The uniformity of dulness of the former stands in
                    marked opposition to the irregularity of mental conformation in the latter.
                    Comparatively speaking, there are few idiots or imbeciles who are uniformly
                    deprived of mental power; some may be utterly sottish, living a mere vegetable
                    existence, but every one must at least have heard of the quaint and crafty
                    sayings of manifest idiots indicating the presence of no mean power of applied
                    observation. In institutions for the treatment of idiots and imbeciles, children
                    are found not only able to read and write, but even capable of applying the
                    simpler rules of arithmetic. A man may possess a very considerable meed of
                    receptive faculty and yet be idiotic in respect of the power of application; he
                    may be physically disabled from relation, and so be manifestly a deprived
                    person, unfit to take a position in the world on the same platform as his
                    fellows.</p>
                <p>Dr Ireland subdivides idiots, for the purposes of education, into five
                    grades,—the first comprising those who can neither <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit13newyrich/page/n107/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0913-0107-0098"/> speak nor understand speech, the second those who
                    can understand a few easy words, the third those who can speak and can be taught
                    to work, the fourth those who can be taught to read and write, and the fifth
                    those who can read books for themselves. The treatment of idiocy and imbecility
                    consists almost entirely of attention to hygiene, and the building up of the
                    enfeebled constitution, along with endeavours to develop what small amount of
                    faculty exists by patiently applied educational influences. The success which
                    has attended this line of treatment in many of our public and private
                    institutions has been very considerable. It may be safely stated that all
                    idiotic or imbecile children have a far better chance of amelioration in asylums
                    devoted to them than by any amount of care and teaching lavished upon them at
                    home.</p>
                <p>In the class of idiots just spoken of imperfect development of the intellectual
                    faculties is the prominent feature, —so prominent that it masks the arrest of
                    potentiality of development of the moral sense, the absence of which, even if
                    noticed, is regarded as relatively unimportant; but, in conducting the practical
                    study of congenital idiots, a class presents itself in which the moral sense is
                    wanting or deficient, whilst the intellectual powers are apparently up to the
                    average. It is the custom of writers on the subject to speak of “intellectual”
                    and “moral” idiots. The terms are convenient for clinical purposes, but the two
                    conditions cannot be disassociated, and the terms therefore severally only imply
                    a specially marked deprivation of intellect or moral sense in a given case. The
                    everyday observer has no difficulty in recognizing as a fact that deficiency in
                    receptive capacity is evidence of imperfect cerebral development; but it is not
                    so patent to him that the perception of right and wrong can be compromised
                    through the same cause, or to comprehend that loss of moral sense may result
                    from disease. The same difficulty does not present itself to the pathologist;
                    for, in the case of a child born under circumstances adverse to brain
                    development, and in whom no process of education can develop an appreciation of
                    what is right or wrong, although the intellectual faculties appear to be but
                    slightly blunted or not blunted at all, he cannot avoid connecting the psychical
                    peculiarity with the pathological evidence. The world is apt enough to refer any
                    fault in intellectual development, manifested by imperfect receptivity, to a
                    definite physical cause, and is willing to base opinion on comparatively slight
                    data; but it is not so ready to accept the theory of a pathological implication
                    of the intellectual attributes concerned in the perception of the difference
                    between right and wrong. Were, however, two cases pitted one against another—the
                    first, one of so-called intellectual, the second, one of so-called moral idiocy
                    —it would be found that, except as regards the psychical manifestations, the
                    cases might be identical. In both there might be a family history of tendency to
                    degeneration of the nervous system, a peculiar cranial conformation, a history
                    of nervous symptoms during infancy, and of a series of indications of mental
                    incapacities during adolescence, differing only in this, that in the first the
                    prominent indication of mental weakness was inability to add two and two
                    together, in the second the prominent feature was incapacity to distinguish
                    right from wrong. What complicates the question of moral idiocy is, that many of
                    its subjects can, when an abstract proposition is placed before them, answer
                    according to the dictates of morality, which they may have learnt by memory. If
                    asked whether it is right or wrong to lie or steal they will say it is wrong;
                    still, when they themselves are detected in either offence, there is an evident
                    non-recognition of its concrete nature. The question of moral idiocy will always
                    be a moot one between the casuist and the pathologist; but, when the whole
                    natural history of such cases is compared, there are points of differentiation
                    between them and mere moral depravity which must appeal to even biased
                    observers. Family history, individual peculiarities, the manifest imbecility of
                    the acts committed, the general bizarre nature of the phenomena, remove such
                    cases from the ordinary category of crime.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Statistics.—</hi> According to the census returns of 1871 the
                    total number of persons described as Idiots and Imbeciles in England and Wales
                    was 29,452, the equality of the sexes being remarkable— namely, 14,728 males and
                    14,724 females. Compared with the entire population, the ratio is one idiot or
                    imbecile to 771 persons, or 13 per 10,000 persons living. Whether the returns
                    are defective, owing to the natural sensitiveness of persons who would desire to
                    conceal the occurrence of idiocy in their families, we have no means of knowing;
                    but such a feeling is no doubt likely to exist among those who look upon mental
                    infirmity as humiliating, rather than as one of the many physical evils which
                    afflict humanity. According to Ireland, this number (29,452) is 25 per cent,
                    below the mark. The following table shows the number of idiots according to
                    official returns of the various countries; probably they are subject to the same
                    criticism as the census returns for England.</p>

                <p>It is difficult to understand the wide divergence of these figures, except it be
                    that in certain (states, such as Prussia and Bavaria, dements have been taken
                    along with aments, and in others cretins. This cannot, however, apply to the
                    case of France, which is stated to have only 66 idiots to every 100 lunatics. In
                    many districts of France cretinism is very common; it is practically unknown in
                    England, where the proportion of idiots is stated as higher than in France; and
                    it is rare in Prussia, which stands at 158 idiots to 100 lunatics. Manifestly
                    imperfect as this table is, it shows how important an element idiocy is in
                    social statistics; few are aware that the number of idiots and that of lunatics
                    approach so nearly.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Cretinism.—Cretin</hi> probably comes from <hi rend="italic"
                    >Chrétien,</hi> either from the idea that the person was innocent in the sense
                    in which that word is employed occasionally to imply a person who cannot sin, or
                    from the religious respect in which cretins were held. Cretinism is a form of
                    congenital insanity inasmuch as the cretino-genetic miasma acts before birth; it
                    is endemic in many mountainous countries, and is said to occur most frequently
                    on magnesian limestone formations, but never at an elevation above 3000 feet.
                    Although all cretins have not goitre, and all goitrous persons are not cretins,
                    there is a very intimate relationship between the two conditions. The districts
                    in Europe in which it is most common are the departments of Hautes-Pyrénées,
                    Haute-Savoie, and Hautes-Alpes; Styria, Upper Austria, the province of Aosta,
                    and Sardinia. It is found more sparsely in other parts of Europe, and also among
                    the Himalayas and Andes. It occasionally presents itself in flat countries,—a
                    remarkable instance being the island of Niederwerth below Coblentz, where out of
                    750 inhabitants there are 131 cretins (Dr Ireland). Notwithstanding the
                    circumscribed area in which this disease exists, affording, it might be
                    supposed, data founded on the conditions of <pb break="no"

                    conclusions as to its cause, nothing has been definitely determined. Cretinism
                    has occupied the attention of many eminent observers, but the various theories
                    they have advanced have been in succession overturned. It has been suggested
                    that the condition is due to the constant use of snow water, or to the presence
                    of sulphate of iron or of lime in water, but none of these theories admit of
                    universal application. That the disease is due to some geological or climatic
                    cause appears certain from the fact, stated by Baillarger, that it disappears
                    from a family in one or two generations after removal to a healthy climate, and
                    may even be prevented by the gravid mother leaving a valley where it is rife for
                    localities where cretinism is unknown. The physical and mental symptoms of
                    cretinism are so closely allied in essentials to those of congenital idiocy as
                    not to demand a separate description. The marked features of the disease are its
                    endemic nature and its intimate connexion with goitre. See <hi rend="smallcaps"

                <p>It is predicated in treating of Acquired Insanity that we have to deal with
                    brains congenitally perfect, the exercise of whose functions has been normal
                    until the incidence of disease. A full description of the tissues of the healthy
                    brain will be found in the article <hi rend="smallcaps">Anatomy</hi> (vol. i.
                    pp. 869- 880), a careful perusal of which will very materially assist the reader
                    in following the present remarks on pathology. A short recapitulation of certain
                    anatomical facts is, however, necessary. The purely nervous structures of the
                    brain consist of very delicate fibres and cells, the latter occurring only in
                    the grey matter. It is richly supplied with blood vessels, the supply being six
                    times greater to the grey matter than to the white. These tissues are supported
                    and separated one from the other by a connective tissue, or interstitial matter,
                    the <hi rend="italic">neuroglia;</hi> the whole organ is enveloped in membranes
                    which separate it from the skull. By one system of independent fibres (the
                    expansion system) communication is maintained between the spinal cord, the
                    central ganglia, and the cortical grey matter; by a second system of fibres (the
                    commissural), corresponding and identical regions of the grey matter of the two
                    opposite hemispheres are united; and by a third system (the horizontal)
                    communication is maintained between parts of the same hemisphere. The cells
                    communicate one with the other by means of processes or poles, fine projections
                    from the body of the cell. The observations of Cleland and Boll show that the
                    apical processes become connected with the fibres as they go to the periphery;
                    the basal processes loop with the horizontal fibres, and also, by means of their
                    recurrent poles, with those of the expansion series. But it is of great
                    importance to observe that we have no evidence of fibre communicating directly
                    with fibre, or no certain proof that one series of fibres communicates directly
                    with others; in fact, all anatomical demonstration goes to prove the
                    individuality and isolation of fibre, the processes of the cells being the
                    connecting link. It is universally accepted that the cerebral cells possess the
                    vital property of generating, receiving, and transmitting nervous influences,
                    and that the fibres are the organs by means of which these influences are
                    received and communicated. In the words of Herman, “in a part of the central
                    organs (the cortical cells) certain material processes are accompanied in an
                    inexplicable manner with wholly undefinable phenomena which characterize what we
                    term <hi rend="italic">consciousness.”</hi> The term <hi rend="italic">mind</hi>
                    may be applied to the combination of all the actual and possible states of
                    consciousness of the organism. “We have a right to presuppose that in the brain,
                    as in other organs of the body, the normal exercise of function is dependent on
                    a perfect maintenance of the anatomical relations of the component structures,
                    and conversely that morbid conditions of these structures must affect the whole
                    economy more or less seriously” (Bucknill and Tuke). In studying brain pathology
                    it must be kept in view that the brain cannot, like the lungs, liver, and
                    kidneys, cast any of its functions on other organs; it must do its own work, rid
                    itself of its effete matter, and of the products of injury or disease, and
                    provide within itself for the resumption of functions, the exercise of which has
                    become impaired from whatever cause.</p>
                <p>Solutions of continuity, preventing perfect maintenance of the component cerebral
                    tissues, may arise from—(1) idiopathic causes, <hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi>
                    causes originating primarily in the brain; (2) traumatic causes (injury to the
                    head); (3) the effects of other neuroses (morbid nerve conditions); (4)
                    adventitious products (tumours, &amp;c.); (5) morbid conditions of the general
                    system secondarily implicating the brain; (6) evolutional conditions of the
                    system concurrently affecting the brain; (7) toxic agents (poisons). In the case
                    of insanity the results of morbid action are confined to the convolutions of the
                    superior surface of the brain, and to the upper part of its lateral aspects; for
                    the most part its base and inferior lateral aspects and the cerebellum are
                    unaffected. It is true that in old standing cases the central ganglia present
                    lesions, but these are for the most part secondary, and are due to the action of
                    disease in the superior convolutions.</p>
                <p>1. Idiopathic changes occur from disease affecting the tissues, the cause of
                    which it may be impossible to trace, —as, for instance, acute inflammation,
                    which, however, is not a frequent cause of insanity. Diffused subacute
                    inflammation is held to be a much more fruitful cause, producing increase
                    (sclerosis) of the neuroglia, degeneration of the cells, destruction (atrophy)
                    and displacement of fibres, and aneurism, distortion, and obliteration of
                    vessels.</p>
                <p>A large and important class of causes of idiopathic morbid action is due to
                    over-excitation of the brain. The causes of over-excitation of the brain
                    functions are those which, in most works on insanity, are spoken of as “moral”
                    (grief, anxiety, domestic complications, disappointment, terror, sorrow or joy,
                    religious or political excitement, the exercise of the mental faculties by study
                    unduly prolonged or conducted under adverse circumstances) in contradistinction
                    to “physical” causes,—a distinction which implies some material difference in
                    their method of operation. To the most superficial observer, the deformed head
                    of the idiot, and the paralysis of mind and body which follows on the rupture of
                    a cerebral vessel, are coarsely material conditions; but when mental aberration
                    follows on mental excitement, men are prone to regard it more as a derangement
                    of function than as an evidence of deterioration<pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0913-0109-0100"/> of brain structure. If, however, we give due
                    weight to the results of physiological research, the matter is not quite so
                    obscure. Arguing from the analogies of other organs and from direct observation,
                    there is reason to believe that when the brain functions are being actively
                    exerted there is a dilatation of the vessels and an increased blood supply
                    (hyperaemia) to its superior and lateral surfaces. This functional hyperaemia is
                    caused by the direct action of the cerebral cells, which, along with the
                    sympathetic system of nerves, exercise control over the muscular coats of the
                    arteries, the immediate regulators of blood supply to any given part. Control
                    over muscular tissue implies, of course, control in two directions, dilatation
                    and contraction. Functional hyperaemia is in every respect a healthy condition,
                    one necessary for the provision of. temporary nutriment during temporary action,
                    ceasing with the withdrawal of stimulus, when the calibre of the vessels is
                    reduced to its original dimensions through the contracting influence of the
                    cells. But if the excitement is unduly prolonged a new result appears; the cells
                    themselves become exhausted, and therefore, even if the stimulus is withdrawn,
                    they are unable to assert their ordinary control over the arterial muscular
                    coats in the direction of contraction, so that the increased blood supply
                    continues although the stimulus which caused it has been removed. Instead of
                    functional hyperaemia we have a hyperaemia caused, not by functional excitement,
                    but by exhaustion of the controlling organs. In a minor degree the results of
                    this condition are matters of everyday observation; overtaxation of the brain
                    functions, by study for instance, is very generally followed by sensations of
                    fulness and aching of the head, loss of sleep, and general exhaustion,—a
                    condition which is recovered from when the primary irritation is withdrawn, <hi
                    rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> when the arteries reacquire healthy tone. But if relief
                    from the causes of irritation is not obtained, a sequence of events ensues
                    tending to deterioration of tissue. In the first place, sleep, the condition
                    necessary for rest and recuperation of the cells, becomes unattainable.
                    Physiological research has shown that during sleep the supply of blood to the
                    brain is diminished (anaemia), that anaemia is necessary for, and hyperaemia is
                    inimical to, its production. Further deterioration of cell activity follows on
                    non-recuperation, and concomitant diminished control over the vessels tends to
                    the establishment of morbid hyperaemia and more or less blood stagnation
                    (stasis). It would be far beyond the compass of this article to follow out in
                    detail the various pathological processes which ensue on paralysis of vaso-motor
                    action; two only need be alluded to—(1) the various changes which take place in
                    the behaviour of the constituents of the blood, producing congestion and greater
                    or less obstruction to its normal distribution, and (2) the effects which
                    congestion produces on the lymphatic system of the brain, the system by which
                    effete matter is largely removed from it. It is now generally recognized that
                    the lymphatics of the brain are perivascular, <hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> that
                    they are tubes surrounding the arteries, patent under ordinary conditions; when,
                    however, the arteries are distended, it is easy to comprehend that the lymphatic
                    system becomes occluded by the artery filling up the space provided for it, and
                    therefore that the removal of waste products becomes difficult or impossible. It
                    is a pathological axiom that the structural integrity of a part is dependent on
                    the maintenance of its vascular unity, in other words, on the regular supply and
                    withdrawal of blood by its regular channels. This if impaired or destroyed is
                    necessarily followed by histological changes and by disturbance of function.</p>
                <p>By this exposition of a probable sequence of pathological events it is desired to
                    indicate that disturbance of function directly referable to over-excitation of
                    the brain is not a mere functional derangement, not a mere morbid increase of a
                    normal emotion, but that it is the manifestation of a pathological
                    condition,—that, in effect, so-called moral causes may be the producers of
                    physical cerebral disease. This meets with support from the clinical observation
                    that, with very rare exceptions, a considerable period of time elapses between
                    the incidence of the moral cause and the first indication of mental
                    alienation,—an interval during which sleep has been absent in consequence of
                    continued hyperaemia. Instances of melancholy or mania being suddenly produced
                    by mental shock must be searched for in works of fiction. Sudden fright, more
                    especially, is stated to produce immediate convulsion, epilepsy, and catalepsy,
                    but not insanity; except in certain comparatively rare instances, in which it
                    appears to induce with great rapidity a cataleptic mental state, presently to be
                    spoken of as acute primary dementia. Over-exercise of the intellectual function
                    is not by any means such a prolific cause of brain disease as undue emotion. It
                    is not -work but worry that kills the brain. When both are combined the result
                    is often rapid.</p>
                <p>On the removal or persistence of congestion depends the issue of a case—recovery,
                    or further and permanent solution of continuity. Unless relief is soon obtained,
                    the changes in the cells are followed by lesions of other brain structures which
                    are productive of important pathological conditions affecting the general
                    system; these in their turn render recovery more difficult or impossible, or may
                    even cause death. (For a full account of the various lesions found in the brains
                    of the insane, consult Bucknill and Tuke, <hi rend="italic">Manual of

                    is most conveniently termed <hi rend="italic">traumatic.</hi> Violence to the
                    head may produce fracture of the skull with or without depression, extravasation
                    of blood in or on the brain, or concussion. There is no relation between the
                    apparent extent of the injury and the results in insanity; extensive fractures
                    of the frontal, lateral, and superior surfaces of the skull, even when
                    complicated with rupture of the envelopes and loss of brain matter, are not,
                    taken over all, more productive of insanity, if so much so, as the apparently
                    less serious condition of concussion. The reason of this is not far to seek; by
                    the open wound free egress is afforded for extravasated blood and the products
                    of inflammation, whereas in concussion, which may also involve extravasation of
                    blood in or on the brain, foreign substances have no means of escape, and so may
                    set up morbid action of a grave nature. Occasionally insanity follows rapidly on
                    the injury, but much more frequently weeks or even months elapse before
                    development of mental symptoms amounting to insanity. During this period morbid
                    action is proceeding on the inner surface of the skull, in the membranes, or in
                    the brain itself. On the inner table of the skull bony growths may be in process
                    of formation, subacute inflammation of the membranes may be going on, and from
                    the same cause the brain may be undergoing progressive changes generally in the
                    direction of sclerosis, <hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> increase of connective
                    tissue.</p>
                <p>3. The nervous diseases in the train of which insanity occasionally follows are
                    Epilepsy, Hysteria, and Locomotor Ataxy. In the case of Epilepsy the brain
                    lesions are doubtless the result of the frequently asphyxiated condition of the
                    patient and of the blood poisoning due to the retention of carbonic acid gas
                    (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Epilepsy). As</hi> might be expected, lesions of the
                    arteries in the form of hypertrophy of their coats is frequently observed. The
                    canals in the brain <pb break="no"

                    frequently found dilated to from two to six times their normal dimensions. If
                    the richness of the blood supply to the grey matter is considered, this
                    condition of dilatation must imply an immense loss of brain tissue; moreover,
                    the cells are frequently found suffering degeneration. In dealing with the
                    subject of Hysteria, we have, as stated in the article especially bearing on tha
                    subject <hi rend="smallcaps">(Hysteria),</hi> to do with a disease which,
                    although marked by very prominent symptoms, possesses no anatomical seat, and
                    thus when the disease amounts to insanity we are equally in the dark as to the
                    cerebral conditions. The insanity following or accompanying hysteria is not a
                    fatal one in its earlier stages, and there is no report extant of an autopsy on
                    a recent case of this disease. Locomotor Ataxy is a disease of the spinal cord,
                    sclerosis of its posterior columns (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Ataxy).</hi> It
                    implicates other parts of the nervous system,—for instance, the optic tracts and
                    nerves. Insanity occasionally is concurrent with, and probably, if not
                    certainly, is produced by an extension of the sclerosis to the cerebral
                    convolutions. This theory meets support from the fact that the mental symptoms
                    associated with locomotor ataxy resemble very closely those of general
                    paralysis, in which hypertrophy of the connective tissue of the superior
                    convolutions has been demonstrated.</p>
                <p>4. By the term adventitious products it is meant to indicate all forms of tumours
                    of the brain, skull-cap, and membranes. Such foreign bodies have three distinct
                    effects on the brain structure :—“1st, They create an irritation tending to
                    ramollissement in the nerve substance, with which they are in contact from their
                    first appearance. 2d, They cause pressure on distant parts, which in its turn
                    causes an alteration of the structure and nutrition. 3d, They set up progressive
                    disease and degeneration of certain parts of -the nerve structure, the true
                    nature of which is as yet not very well known; but it seems to be in some way
                    directly connected with the essential nature and constitution of all sorts of
                    nerve substance, whether cells or fibres. Its results pathologically are an
                    increase of the connective tissue in the form of granules, and enlargement and
                    thickening of the coats of the blood-vessels; but all these seem to be secondary
                    changes” (Clouston, “On Tumours of the Brain,” <hi rend="italic">Journal of
                    Mental Science,</hi> vol. xviii.). Apoplectic clots are practically tumours.</p>
                <p>5. Morbid conditions of the general system secondarily implicating the brain. It
                    is of great interest from an etiological point of view to note that insanity is
                    seldom if ever the immediate result of diseases of individual organs, but that
                    it is more or less intimately associated with those forms of disease which
                    result from a general constitutional instability, such as tuberculosis,
                    rheumatism, gout, and syphilis. There are many diseases painful in character and
                    very depressing to the nervous system, such as stone, fistula (in fact all the
                    so-called surgical diseases of the rectum and bladder), cancer of the uterus,
                    &amp;c., which might be presupposed to be probable causes of insanity, yet in
                    point of fact are not inimical to mental health. They may be so indirectly,
                    inasmuch as they prevent sleep, but even in this wise their effect is very
                    slight. Nor does there appear sufficient reason to connect diseases of the
                    heart, liver, kidneys, directly with insanity. Much stress has been laid on
                    diseases of the uterus and ovaries, and more especially on tumours of these
                    organs, being the primary factors in the production of insanity. Skae laid down
                    as a special form ovario-or utero-mania; and Wergt of Illnau has described the
                    various morbid conditions of the female organs of generation found on
                    post-mortem examination, and has connected with them mental symptoms. But
                    authors on gynaecology make no mention of insanity being a sequela of uterine
                    disease, except in so far as the mental depression which in most women follows
                    on the knowledge that they are affected by serious, perhaps fatal, disease, and
                    the pain and anxiety inseparable therefrom, may produce sleeplessness, and
                    consequent melancholy; and there is no proof of such tumours exercising an
                    extensive influence on causation by peripheral irritation. The fallacy has in
                    the great majority of instances probably arisen from the observation often made
                    in asylums that insanity arising from whatever cause is conditioned by the
                    presence of uterine growths, and that delusions of a sexual character may arise
                    from the sensations thereby produced. Of the very few instances on record in
                    which a direct connexion between uterine disease and insanity has been traced
                    may be cited a case reported by Van der Kolk, in which deep melancholy and
                    prolapsus uteri coexisted; the mental symptoms were at once relieved by the
                    organ being restored to its normal position. Such cases are very rare.</p>
                <p>It is still a moot point whether a true tubercular or phthisical insanity exists;
                    if it does, it certainly does not arise from tubercular deposits in the brain—a
                    very rare condition in the insane. Those authorities who deny the existence of
                    phthisical insanity hold that, although mental symptoms do frequently present
                    themselves in cases of consumption, and although consumption is very frequent
                    amongst the insane, the insanity is hot directly dependent on the diathesis, but
                    more probably results from the general lowering of the system, and at most is
                    only conditioned by the primary disease. In the case of rheumatism and gout
                    there are strong reasons for believing that an actual translation (metastasis)
                    of the <hi rend="italic">materies morbi</hi> occasionally takes place from
                    affected joints to the connective tissue of the brain and cord,—the evidence
                    being choreic movements of the limbs (St Vitus’s Dance) accompanied by acute
                    mental symptoms, both of which disappear contemporaneously with the return of
                    inflammatory swellings of the joints. Syphilis may act on the brain by the
                    production of tumours (which, however, do not differ in their effects from those
                    of other adventitious products), and by specific changes in the coats of the
                    arteries, which become thickened and even occluded. As a consequence the tissues
                    in their neighbourhood suffer deterioration.</p>
                <p>The pathological relation between sun-stroke (insolation) and brain disease has
                    not been ascertained. A certain amount of brain congestion has been observed,
                    but not invariably. The cerebral lesion is more probably due to the extreme
                    depression of the whole nervous system; but the <hi rend="italic">modus</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">operandi</hi> is unknown.</p>
                <p>The morbid condition of the general system which most frequently implicates the
                    brain is anaemia, not itself a disease, but the result of many diseases, such as
                    fever, and of such drains on the constitution as lactation (suckling) and
                    imperfect nourishment. The operativeness of these drains may be assisted by
                    over-work under unhealthy conditions. As a typical example may be cited the
                    dressmaker, poorly paid, poorly fed, working for many hours daily in an
                    ill-ventilated room, and sleeping in an unhealthy garret. The term anaemia is
                    not used here to indicate a condition antithetical to hyperaemia—it does not
                    imply any mechanical deprivation of blood supply; on the contrary, the amount of
                    blood, such as it is, is not reduced in quantity. The temporary mechanical
                    anaemia which results from extreme cold produces its effects rapidly,—short
                    delirium and profound sleep. But it is qualitative anaemia, an impoverished
                    state of the blood, which produces more or less permanent results on cerebral
                    health. Inanition acts rapidly on the brain: in the case of those cast away at
                    sea on rafts or in boats the general story is that of short delirious mania,
                    suicide, or death from nervous exhaustion, before emaciation <hi rend="italic"
                    >(i.e.,</hi> before the reserve food of the system is consumed) takes place. So
                    in cases where inanition is <pb break="no"

                    depressed. Λnd here the position becomes somewhat complicated; for not only is,
                    under such circumstances, the relative amount of the blood constituents
                    different from the normal standard, but its corpuscular elements change in
                    quality; they acquire a degree of viscidity which tends to cause the red
                    corpuscles to coalesce and hang together, and the white to lag and wander into
                    surrounding tissues; and further, this unphysiological behaviour of the
                    corpuscles is apt to become aggravated in regions whose nervous energy is
                    depressed. Anaemia thus acts and reacts in procuring a condition of stasis.</p>
                <p>6. The effects of evolutional periods concurrently affecting the brain: puberty,
                    adolescence, utero-gestation, the climacteric period, and old age. “Although
                    from the time when the human being comes into the world to the final cessation
                    of his corporeal existence the various functional operations of organic life are
                    carried on with ceaseless activity, whilst those of animal life are only
                    suspended by the intervals of repose which are needed for the renovation of
                    their organs, yet there are very marked differences, not only in the <hi

                    rend="italic">relative degrees of energy rvhich they severally manifest</hi> at
                    different epochs” (Carpenter’s <hi rend="italic">Principles of Human
                    Physiology,</hi> chap, xviii.). These differences in degree imply physiological
                    modifications of nutrition, and the observation of ages has caused it to be
                    accepted as a fact in the etiology of disease that numerous and various
                    degenerations occur contemporaneously with such modifications, more especially
                    in the subjects of diathetic conditions. The development of phthisis during
                    adolescence, and of cancer amongst persons at the climacteric period, maybe
                    cited as instances. It may be freely admitted that the nexus between the
                    physiological and the pathological position is, as regards certain of the
                    periods, obscure, and that it is dependent more on induction than on
                    demonstration; but it may be pleaded that it is not more obscure in respect of
                    insanity than of other diseases. The pathological difficulty obtains mostly in
                    the relation of the earlier evolutional periods, puberty and adolescence, to
                    insanity; in the others a physiologico-pathological nexus may be traced; but in
                    regard to the former there is nothing to take hold of except the purely
                    physiologioal process of development of the sexual function, the expansion of
                    the intellectual powers, and rapid increase of the bulk of the body. Although in
                    thoroughly stable subjects due provision is made for these evolutional
                    processes, it is not difficult to conceive that in the nervously unstable a
                    considerable risk is run by the brain in consequence of the strain laid on it.
                    Other adjuvant influences may be at work tending to excite the system which will
                    be spoken of when the insanity occurring at these periods is described. Between
                    the adolescent and climacteric periods the constitution of the nervous, as of
                    the other systems, becomes established, and disturbance is not liable to occur,
                    except from some accidental circumstance apart from evolution. In the most
                    healthily constituted individuals the “change of life” expresses itself by.some
                    loss of vigour. The nourishing (trophesial) function becomes less active, and
                    either various degrees of wasting occur, or there is a tendency towards
                    restitution in bulk of tissues by a less highly organized material. The most
                    important instance of the latter tendency is fatty degeneration of muscle, to
                    which the muscle of the arterial system is very liable. In the mass of mankind
                    those changes assume no pathological importance: the man or woman of middle life
                    passes into advanced age without serious constitutional disturbance; on the
                    other hand, there may be a break down of the system due to climacteric disease
                    of special organs, as, for instance, fatty degeneration of the heart. In all
                    probability the insanity of the climacteric period may be referred to two
                    pathological conditions: it may depend on structural changes in the brain due to
                    fatty degeneration of its arteries and cells, or it may be a secondary result of
                    general systemic disturbance, due to cessation of menstruation in the female,
                    and, possibly, to some analogous modification of the sexual function in men. The
                    senile period brings with it further reduction of formative activity; all the
                    tissues waste, and are liable to fatty and calcareous degeneration. Here again
                    the arteries of the brain are very generally implicated: atheroma in some degree
                    is almost always present, but is by no means always followed by insanity.
                    Whewell retained his faculties to the last, notwithstanding that his cerebral
                    arteries were much diseased. Still this condition must be taken into account in
                    studying the causation of senile insanity, as it necessarily implicates the
                    nutrition of the brain. It must assist in preventing recuperation of the cells;
                    it may in certain instances diminish suddenly the blood supply to a particular
                    area; but the stronger probability is that senile mental decay lies at the door
                    of senile degeneration of the cells.</p>
                <p>The various and profound modifications of the system which attend the periods of
                    utero-gestation, pregnancy, and child-bearing do not leave the nervous centres
                    unaffected. Most women are liable to slight changes of disposition and temper,
                    morbid longings, strange likes and dislikes during pregnancy, more especially
                    during the earlier months; but these are universally accepted as accompaniments
                    of the condition not involving any doubt as to sanity. But there are various
                    factors at work in the system during pregnancy which have grave influence on the
                    nervous system, more especially in those hereditarily predisposed, and in those
                    gravid for the first time. There is modification of direction of the blood
                    towards a new focus, and its quality is changed, as is shown by an increase of
                    fibrin and water and a decrease of albumen. How much these· changes structurally
                    affect the encephalon may be deduced from the fact of the presence of bony
                    plates (osteophyte) on the surface of the dura mater .and the inner table of the
                    skull, and how much functionally, by constant congestions and flushings. To such
                    physical influences are superadded the discomfort and uneasiness of the
                    situation, mental anxiety and anticipation of danger, and in the unmarried the
                    horror of disgrace. In the puerperal (recently delivered) woman there are to be
                    taken into pathological account the various depressing influences of child-bed,
                    its various accidents reducing vitality, the sudden return to ordinary
                    physiological conditions, the cessation of the occasional physiological
                    condition, the rapid call for a new focus of nutrition, the translation as it
                    were of the blood supply from the uterus to the mammae,—all physical influences
                    liable to affect the brain. These influences may act independently of moral
                    shock; but, where this is coincident, there is a condition of the nervous system
                    unprepared to resist, or, it may rather be said, prepared to succumb.</p>
                <p>7. Among the toxic agents which affect the brain, alcohol holds the foremost
                    place. On the action of this poison the article <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Drunkenness</hi> supplies full information. Considerable difficulty exists as
                    to the estimation of the importance to be attached to alcohol in the production
                    of brain disease from the fact that excess in the use of stimulants is very
                    frequently a symptom of incipient insanity, and that the symptom is often
                    mistaken for the cause. The habitual use of opium and Indian hemp <hi
                    rend="italic">(Cannabis</hi><hi rend="italic">indica),</hi> which first
                    stimulate and then paralyse the action of the cerebral cells, is a frequent
                    cause of lesion.</p>
                <p>Difficulties may arise in individual cases in establishing a theory of causation
                    from the presence of what are generally spoken of in systematic works on
                    insanity as “mixed” causes, <hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> the presence of two
                    morbid factors in one individual. So long as these consist in variety in <pb
                    break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit13newyrich/page/n112/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0913-0112-0103"/> character of excited psychical action, such as
                    grief and anxiety of business, over-prolonged study and domestic affliction, the
                    combination does not affect the position; but when we have a history of one or
                    more of such psychical influences being associated with a depraved condition of
                    the general system, with poverty, with excess in alcoholic stimulants, or with
                    hereditary predisposition, it appears at the first glance difficult to assess
                    the value to be attached to each in the production of brain disease. This
                    complication is, however, more apparent than real; weakness of the system,
                    whether produced by disease or by malnutrition, only implies a condition in
                    which cerebral degeneration is more likely to occur, but where there is no
                    reason to believe it would have occurred if the brain, weakened along with the
                    other organs of the body, had not been subjected to over-excitation. It may be
                    argued that the brain excitation would not have produced the lesion if the tone
                    of the general system had not been lowered: that is as it may be, —it is a
                    proposition which cannot be accepted or denied positively in the absence of
                    positive data. But negative data obtain which warrant its refusal. These are
                    twofold: —a depraved condition of the general system is a frequent result of
                    over-excitation of the brain, the result being liable to be mistaken for the
                    efficient cause; and the history and symptoms of insanity resulting from special
                    morbid conditions of the system differ materially from those produced by
                    over-excitation.</p>
                <p>The action of all these varied morbid factors is in the direction of solution of
                    continuity of cerebral elements, and consequently of perversion of psychical
                    function. And here a wide gap opens itself in the study of brain pathology' in
                    its relation to morbid psychology. No adequate theory has been advanced to
                    account for the sequence of a particular type or train of morbid mental symptoms
                    on a particular morbid condition of the brain. In the most definite forms of
                    insanity, those of which the morbid anatomy is pretty definitely determined,
                    there is not the slightest suggestion afforded of the causation of the peculiar
                    type of mental symptoms which symptomatize them, or for the alternation of
                    symptoms in an individual case, or for diversity of symptoms apparently starting
                    from the same cause. All that is known is that when the hemispherical ganglia
                    are diseased we may have excitement or depression of feeling, delusion, or
                    obfuscation of the intellectual and moral qualities; but why in one case
                    excitement, in another delusion, and in a third both, is an utter mystery.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Classification.</hi></p>
                <p>The mental symptoms of acquired insanity have been classified from the time of
                    Pinel—it might, save from some slight difference in the application of the
                    terms, be said from the time of Hippocrates—as mania, melancholia, and dementia,
                    according as exaltation or depression of feeling or weakness of intellect
                    presents itself most prominently in a given case. To these has been added
                    delusional insanity, spoken of by certain authors as monomania. Numberless
                    classifications founded on psychological considerations have been advanced,
                    involving, however, more variety in terminology than in principle; all such,
                    when analysed, are reducible to the primitive mania, melancholia, and dementia.
                    Pritchard asserted that mental symptoms were divisible into two great classes,
                    according as the intellectual and moral faculties were implicated. This
                    principle falls to the ground from the simple but most important fact that the
                    primary symptom in all insanities is perversion of the moral sense, and that
                    this perversion pervades all cases of mental disease to their termination. This
                    change of morale amounts to various degrees of perversion of the ordinary
                    character and disposition of the individual. He becomes indifferent to social
                    considerations, apathetic and neglectful of the personal and family duties,
                    evinces dislike and suspicion of friends and relatives, and may betake himself
                    to excess in alcoholic stimulants and other forms of dissipation. There is a
                    general concentration of his ideas on himself, which is often spoken of as the
                    selfishness of the insane. According to the direction in action in which
                    perversion of the moral sense is manifested such so-called forms of insanity
                    have been constructed as dipsomania, kleptomania, erotomania, &lt;fcc., which,
                    however, are to be regarded as merely accidental phenomena. Moral insanity may
                    appear to exist alone at certain times in certain cases, but it is greatly to be
                    doubted whether it really ever exists apart from intellectual perversion. The
                    mere fact that a person cannot appreciate the change in himself, cannot, as it
                    were, disapprove of his own actions, is evidence that the moral faculties are
                    not alone implicated. The converse proposition may be stated even more strongly—
                    intellectual insanity never exists without moral perversion.</p>
                <p>Moral perversion is, however, only one of the initial symptoms. In most
                    insanities a “period of incubation” is observed, generally spoken of as the
                    prodromal or initial period. Sudden and violent outbursts of insanity are
                    occasionally reported, but, when these are carefully examined into, a train of
                    prodromal symptoms, physical as well as psychical, can almost invariably be
                    traced. These symptoms are for the most part insidious in character. Founding on
                    the statements of patients suffering from premonitory symptoms, on those made by
                    others, who, having recovered, are able to carry back their recollection to the
                    incidence of the prodromal stage, and on the direct observation of the
                    physician, physical indications are the first to present themselves. These
                    consist in a feeling of fulness in the head, throbbing of the forehead and
                    eyeballs, flashes of light before the eyes, and general malaise. The mental
                    symptoms follow closely, and consist, in addition to the change in morale
                    already spoken of, in restlessness, irritability, inability to apply the mind to
                    the everyday affairs of life, and sleeplessness. In certain forms this
                    description of the prodromal symptoms requires some slight modification. They
                    are very generally accompanied by impairment of general health.</p>
                <p>The classification of the insanities according to the predominant mental symptom
                    is adopted in almost all treatises on the subject; but there is a growing
                    conviction that this basis is neither so scientific nor so convenient as a
                    classification based on pathology. Mania, melancholia, and dementia are merely
                    symptoms of brain disease. If these symptoms were constant in even a
                    considerable majority of all cases, there would be better warrant for employing
                    them as a basis of nosology; but they vary so widely in kind and degree, they
                    run so closely one into the other, they may all appear in an individual case
                    within so very short a space of time, that their use is generally misleading,
                    even as indicating the mental condition of a patient. In many cases of insanity
                    mania may present itself to-day, melancholia to-morrow, and dementia the day
                    after, being, in fact, indications of the course of the complaint. It is
                    undoubtedly true that in a proportion of the insane there is a general
                    predominance of one or other of these conditions, but it is equally true that
                    there is an equal proportion in which the application of any one of these terms
                    is open to question. Thus we may have a melancholic mania or a maniacal
                    melancholia. Moreover, there are many forms of insanity of which the connexion
                    with the causation is so intimate that even those authors who adhere to the
                    archaic classification cannot refuse to acknowledge them as pathological
                    classes, and are compelled to treat of them under their pathological
                    designations; puerperal insanity, epileptic insanity, senile insanity, and
                    general paralysis may be cited as prominent examples.</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit13newyrich/page/n113/mode/1up"

                <p>To say of a man that he is maniacal is not saying more than to say of one who has
                    lost power over his limbs that he suffers from palsy, a diagnosis which no
                    scientific physician of the present day would be content with, as it conveys no
                    definite idea as to the pathological character or cause of impairment of
                    mobility. It may be freely admitted that medical science is not yet able to base
                    a nosology of the insanities on the highest pathological platform, that of
                    morbid anatomy. Considerable advances have been made in this direction, but the
                    observations of pathologists, with the exception of those bearing on three or
                    four classes of brain disease, are vague and quite insufficient for the purpose.
                    Clinical observation, however, has served to relate symptoms with cause to such
                    an extent as to enable the observer of mental disease to fall back on the second
                    pathological position—etiology, and has enabled him to assert, in a very large
                    proportion of cases, causation as a scientific and convenient standpoint for
                    classification. After all, classifications are matters of convenience. It is not
                    asserted that the classification adopted in this article is more than
                    provisional; but it is asserted that it is more convenient to study the
                    insanities in connexion with the bodily conditions of their subjects than to
                    rely on a general description of mental symptoms which are inconstant in kind
                    and degree, and often so complex as to render analysis impossible.</p>
                <p>When Esquirol’s definition of the mental conditions is quoted, little more need
                    be added, for further description would merely involve an amplified account of
                    psychological peculiarities. Esquirol thus describes the conditions:—(1)
                    Melancholia, or, as he terms it, Lypemania, disorder of the faculties with
                    respect to one or a small number of objects, with predominance of a sorrowful
                    and depressing passion; (2) Monomania, in which the disorder of the faculties is
                    limited to one or a small number of objects, with excitement, and predominance
                    of a gay and expansive passion; (3) Mania, in which the insanity extends to all
                    kinds of objects, and is accompanied by excitement; (4) Dementia, in which the
                    insensate utter folly, because the organs of thought have lost their energy and
                    the strength requisite for their functions. In 1852 Schroeder van der Kolk and
                    in 1860 Morel laid the foundation of a classification more in accordance with
                    pathological science. The former included the different forms of the disease
                    under two great classes :—“idiopathic insanity,” comprising all cases produced
                    by primary affections of the brain; and “sympathetic insanity,” including those
                    due to morbid conditions of the general system. Morel divided the insanities
                    into six groups :—(1) hereditary insanity; (2) toxic insanity; (3) insanity
                    produced by the transformation of other diseases; (4) idiopathic insanity; (5)
                    sympathetic insanity; (6) dementia, a terminative stage. Notwithstanding faults
                    of detail, it may be fairly said that these propositions marked a great advance
                    in the study of insanity, and that all later classifications based on the same
                    principles have been derived from study of them. The following system admittedly
                    is so.</p>

                <p>I. <hi rend="smallcaps">Idiopathic Mania and Melancholia.</hi> —It is proposed to
                    consider under the head of idiopathic mania and melancholia the large and
                    important class of cases which result from over-excitation of the brain due to
                    so-called moral causes. In considering this form of insanity, a difficulty
                    arises in reconciling the dependence of two such apparently widely divergent
                    morbid psychical states as mania and melancholia on one common pathological
                    condition. That they are so is maintained by the following clinical
                    observations—1st, that during the prodromal period, <hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi>
                    the period during which over-excitation is using its influence on the brain
                    tissues, the symptoms of excitement and depression generally alternate; 2d, that
                    in certain acute cases mania and melancholia coexist, that is to say, it is
                    impossible for the observer to say whether they are cases of maniacal
                    melancholia or melancholic mania; 3d, that, as many cases run their course
                    towards recovery, the symptoms are consecutively mania, melancholia, and
                    dementia; 4th, that the effects of irritating poisons applied to the brain,
                    alcohol markedly, produce these symptoms in some individuals in a very short
                    space of time. These observations point, not to a difference of pathological
                    causation, but to variation in symptoms in conformity with the progress of
                    pathological processes. It must be borne in mind that congestion is not a
                    condition constant in quality or in quantity, and, further, that it is an
                    inconstant condition acting on an inconstant subject, and therefore productive
                    of cumulative inconstant results. Brain congestion, due to over-excitation,
                    produces functional excitement of that organ. It must be remembered that
                    although mania is accompanied by exaltation, and melancholia by depression of
                    feeling, they are both manifestations of excitement of feeling. Given this
                    common psychological condition of excitement, a reason must be sought for the
                    variety of its manifestation either in some peculiarity of the irritating cause
                    or in some idiosyncracy of the affected individual. In either case no material
                    assistance is gained from psychological considerations, for there is no
                    necessary connexion between depressing emotions and melancholia; intense grief
                    often produces acute mania, and the insanity of the man of saturnine mind is as
                    often as not characterized by mania. The peculiarity of the irritating cause
                    appears to be, not its psychological characteristic, but its intensity. The more
                    rapidly excitement of feeling is produced, the more likely is mania to be the
                    symptom of the insanity. That melancholia often supervenes on depressing
                    emotions gradual in their incidence does not imply a psychological nexus, but
                    that, as their irritating influence is slowly applied, so the results of the
                    irritation are slowly produced, and (as in the case of every tissue of the body)
                    there is variety of degree of symptoms in conformity with the rapidity of the
                    progress of pathological events. There are also various underlying conditions
                    difficult to treat of in the mass, any one of which may have considerable
                    bearing on an individual case. Constitutional predisposition (diathesis) may
                    render a person more prone to the sub-acute forms of disease, and the condition
                    of the body at the time of irritation may influence the nature of the symptoms
                    in either direction. In the absence of the possibility of applying to the brain
                    the mechanical aids which have given the physician an insight into the sequence
                    of pathological events occurring in other organs, the pathologist has nothing to
                    depend on save clinical observation. He has presented to him a diseased organ,
                    complex in function, of the physiology of which he is, as regards its psychical
                    action, profoundly <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit13newyrich/page/n114/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0913-0114-0105"/> ignorant; all he can say is that, when its
                    histological integrity is impaired, he has reason to believe that “some
                    functions become torpid and oppressed, while others are excited into
                    preternatural activity” (Bucknill and Tuke). It must be stated, however, that in
                    a considerable proportion of cases the nature of the ultimate condition is
                    foreshadowed from the very commencement by the character of the initial
                    symptoms. Simple depression of feeling may be the first and last symptom of
                    insanity, or it may gradually increase in intensity till it attains the extreme
                    and most complicated form of melancholia. In like manner simple excitement and
                    exaltation of feeling may characterize a case from beginning to end, or it may
                    culminate more or less rapidly in active mania, without the intervention of
                    other psychical symptoms.</p>
                <p>As to the duration of the prodromal period, in the mass of cases nothing can be
                    stated with certainty; it can only be said that, as a general rule, the
                    incidence of melancholia is more slow than that of mania. Putting aside
                    exceptional cases, it may be stated that, whereas the former is a matter of
                    months or weeks, the latter is a matter of weeks or days.</p>
                <p>The initial mental symptoms having been already described, it remains only to say
                    that the general system becomes coincidentally affected; functional disturbances
                    of the digestive organs soon manifest themselves, and the nutrition of the body
                    becomes defective. To this implication of other systems consequent on impairment
                    of the trophesial (nourishment-regulating) function of the brain can be traced a
                    large amount of the errors which exist as to the causation of idiopathic
                    melancholia and mania. Very frequently this secondary condition is set down as
                    the primary cause; the insanity is referred to derangements of the stomach or
                    bowels, when in fact these are, concomitantly with the mental disturbance,
                    results of the cerebral mischief. Doubtless these functional derangements
                    exercise considerable influence on the progress of the case by assisting to
                    deprave the general economy, and by producing depressing sensations in the
                    region of the stomach. To them may probably be attributed, together with the
                    apprehension of impending insanity, that phase of the disease spoken of by the
                    older writers as the <hi rend="italic">stadium</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >melancholicum,</hi> which so frequently presents itself in incipient idiopathic
                    cases.</p>
                <p>During the earlier stages of the prodromal period it is impossible, in the
                    majority of cases, for the physician to predict, with anything like certainty,
                    whether the case may culminate in acute melancholia or acute mania. But as it
                    progresses the irritability and restlessness which ushered in the malady become
                    intensified; sleep is either irregular or may be lost for nights together;
                    further degeneration of the brain constituents necessarily follows, and the loss
                    of controlling power over ideas is manifested in excitement in one of two
                    ways—(1) by the domination of one set of ideas, which are for the most part of a
                    depressed character, or (2) by a tendency to follow lines of thought suggested
                    by accidental external circumstances. Although in the one case there is a
                    concentration and in the other a diffusion of ideas, there is the common result
                    of occlusion of the individual from a normal process of thought, inconsequence
                    of his inability to review external circumstances correctly.</p>
                <p>1. <hi rend="italic">Acute Idiopathic Melancholia</hi> presents itself in three
                    degrees of intensity:—(1) simple depression of feeling, (2) depression of
                    feeling with delusion, (3) depression of feeling with mania or delirium. The
                    second and third of these conditions may supervene on the first, or any one of
                    them may singly characterize the case.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Simple Depression of Feeling.—</hi> In no form of insanity is
                    the sane mind more prone to project a psychological scheme of causation than in
                    that of which simple depression of feeling is the predominant symptom. The
                    restlessness and irritability which accompany anxiety, grief, and worry, and the
                    consequent exhaustion and depression, suggest a psychological continuity. There
                    is, however, a very distinct difference between depression of feeling within the
                    limits of health and the depression of feeling resulting from morbid processes
                    going on in the brain, and in symptoms there is a distinct line of demarcation.
                    A mere fit of depression, from whatever cause, does not prevent a man from using
                    his intellectual faculties; circumstances influence him, and he can review his
                    position; but where the limit of health is passed the normal influence of
                    external circumstances is lost. This indication is accompanied by a gloomy
                    apathy; the memory of the past is misery, the present is unendurable, and there
                    is no hope in the future; everything is black within and without, every incident
                    feeds the melancholy, every suggestion of hope is parried, and every appeal to
                    the reason falls dead on the ear of the sufferer. This latter symptom—the
                    inoperativeness of appeals to the reason—is a feature of all forms of insanity,
                    and it is therefore well to notice it particularly when treating of the
                    simplest. What to the sane mind is the simplest proposition, to the insane
                    appears either utterly false in itself, or to have no bearing on the position.
                    The power of comparing idea with idea, the faculty of discriminating their
                    differences, or the perception of agreement in the midst of difference is
                    lost—in a word, the judgment is impaired or utterly in abeyance. The common
                    everyday expression “out of his judgment,” employed to indicate that a man is
                    insane, is psychologically accurate, and logically applicable in all forms of
                    insanity. A strong tendency to suicide frequently presents itself; the utmost
                    ingenuity is exercised to accomplish this object, the whole mental energies
                    being concentrated upon it. It is impossible to render in terms the general as
                    well as facial expression of the melancholic; it cannot be simulated with
                    success before any one conversant with the condition.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Depression of Feeling with Delusion.</hi> —Idiopathic
                    melancholia symptomatized by simple depression of feeling may become gradually
                    complicated with delusion and hallucination, or this complicated condition may
                    follow immediately on the initial symptoms. The delusions and hallucinations of
                    idiopathic melancholia may be divided into three classes :—(1) those traceable
                    to perverted sensation produced by implication of the functions of the general
                    system; (2) those apparently dependent on the nature of the primary causating
                    train of emotion; and (3) those which it is impossible to connect with any
                    particular influence, either psychical or somatic. The first class contains the
                    delusional symptoms resultant on atony of the alimentary canal, which, by
                    producing obstinate constipation, catarrhal affections of the stomach and
                    bowels, and dyspepsia, cause sensations which are referred by the insane mind to
                    supernatural influences: he believes that he has serpents or worms inside him,
                    that his gullet is closed, or that his bowels are so obstructed as to render
                    relief by the natural passage impossible. As a direct result of this delusion
                    food is systematically refused, and it often becomes necessary to resort to
                    artificial feeding by the stomach-pump or some allied apparatus. Hallucinations
                    and illusions of smell and taste may be referred to the same causes as the
                    delusions just spoken of: the foetor of the breath due to dyspepsia may suggest
                    to the melancholic that he is surrounded by a poisonous atmosphere, and that
                    everything near him stinks; and the foul tongue of the same condition may be
                    productive of hallucinations of taste, and may even lead up to the very common
                    delusion that his food is poisoned. Such distinct objective starting points,
                    however, do not suggest themselves for hallucinations of vision and hearing;
                    these can only be regarded as incidental results of the morbid cerebral
                    condition of which the process of production is unknown. Hallucinations of sight
                    are comparatively rare; when they <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit13newyrich/page/n115/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0913-0115-0106"/> do occur it is generally in the form of spectres,
                    which prompt to suicide, self-mutilation, or homicide. Hallucinations of hearing
                    are more common, and are believed to be of graver import. As a rule the
                    hallucination takes the form of words emanating from a something or some one of
                    whose personality the patient has no conception. That an apparent connexion can
                    often be traced between the character of the delusion and that of the primary
                    causating emotion is particularly true of the melancholic delusions which follow
                    on religious emotionalism, so much so that many writers regard religious
                    melancholia as a distinct form of insanity. This is a term, however, very
                    loosely employed, and it is, in fact, by no means easy to ascertain what it
                    implies; by one section of authors it is regarded as that form of melancholia in
                    which the insanity centres upon religious ideas, by another as the form of
                    insanity produced by depressing religious emotion. The latter position is
                    tenable on purely clinical considerations, if the insanity retains the character
                    of the causating emotion, which it very frequently does not; the former is open
                    to the objection that the delusions may be mere accidents in a case, and may
                    bear no relation whatever to the exciting psychical cause. One reason why the
                    term is so strongly impressed on the mind of the public is, that it may appear
                    as pseudo-epidemic. The waves of religious emotionalism, which almost
                    periodically disturb society in the form of “revivals,” are apt to produce
                    explosion of psychical action in those members of the community predisposed to
                    nervous degradation. The public never considers, in fact does not know, that any
                    other equally potent cause of emotion might be as effectual, and therefore sets
                    down such accidental congeries of cases as “religious melancholia,” accepting
                    that term as representing all the abnormal psychical conditions which may result
                    from “revivals.” It is better to consider religious influences in the common
                    category of emotions producing over-excitation of the brain. The deep
                    despondency which follows on religious emotionalism may be productive of such
                    predominating ideas as that the soul is irretrievably lost, that the
                    unpardonable sin has been committed, and that there is no hope of salvation.
                    Although in the abstract it is open to question whether such predominating ideas
                    are strictly delusions, inasmuch as they may be considered as morbid
                    exacerbations of fears and anxieties suggested by certain schools of religious
                    thought, still in the concrete they amount to delusion; for, even supposing they
                    have been arrived at by a normal process of reasoning—which in most cases is
                    extremely doubtful—they are maintained at the expense of all other religious
                    considerations, and by the exclusion of all arguments founded on the experience
                    of others.</p>
                <p>The delusions which it is impossible to connect with any particular physical or
                    psychical influence are for the most part characterized by suspicion and fear,
                    and take such forms in the mind of the patient as that spies surround him, that
                    all his actions are watched, that all connected with him are plotting against
                    him, that conspiracies are being organized with a view to deprive him of his
                    estate, procure his ruin, or do him some evil of which he can give no definite
                    explanation. Occasionally delusions of fear and suspicion are connected with
                    persons whom the patient has never seen, or with sections of society, such as
                    political parties or religious communions. Self-accusation of serious crime is a
                    frequent result of delusion. This idea of crime may be entirely unsubstantial,
                    or it may possess some very slight foundation in fact, one which has no rational
                    bearing on the existing position. When insane self-accusations are critically
                    examined, it is found that remorse is very rarely connected with the real or
                    imaginary crimes, from the consequences of which others have or might have
                    suffered. The poetic stories of insanity produced by remorse of conscience for
                    crimes involving the ruin or disgrace of others than the actual offenders may be
                    set down as in the main apocryphal.</p>
                <p>The delusions of the melancholic are often fearfully intense, and produce very
                    serious results in action; they are apt to extend beyond himself. By a process
                    of reasoning which the sane mind cannot appreciate, he may argue himself into
                    the belief that his misery is also the misery of his friends and family, that
                    his relatives are cognizant of or implicated in his imaginary crimes, and that
                    they must suffer the consequences along with him. As death offers to him the
                    only chance of relief, so he believes it best that those nearest and dearest to
                    him should die also. From this state of feeling follow those fearful acts of
                    homicide which occasionally startle society—a parent destroys several of his
                    children, a lover his mistress, or a husband his wife, before committing
                    self-destruction. It is as well to attract attention here to the appearance of a
                    tendency to homicide and suicide as an incident in a case, as the subject will
                    have to be recurred to when adverting to the question of homicidal and suicidal
                    insanity.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Depression of Feeling associated with Delirium or Mania.—</hi>
                    In this class of cases it is impossible to say whether they should be called
                    melancholic mania or maniacal melancholia. The wildest delirious excitement
                    coexists with the deepest depression of feeling; delusions of fear and horror
                    are given expression to in the most extravagant manner, and relief from them is
                    sought in frantic attempts at suicide; the patient dashes his head against the
                    floor or wall, tries to cast himself down stairs, holds his breath in the hope
                    that he may suffocate. In this condition there is a strong tendency towards
                    death, which not unfrequently occurs within a few days of the development of the
                    graver symptoms, and which is generally produced by congestion of the lungs as a
                    direct result of the cerebral condition, t.e., by a true cerebral pneumonia.</p>
                <p>2. <hi rend="italic">Acute Idiopathic Mania</hi> presents itself in three forms
                    —(1) simple exaltation of feeling, (2) exaltation of feeling with delusion, (3)
                    acute delirious mania. The second and third of these psychical conditions may
                    supervene on the first, or any one of them may singly characterize a case; in
                    all, the period of transition from the prodromal stage is much more rapid than
                    in acute idiopathic melancholia.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Simple exaltation of feeling</hi> manifests itself in all
                    degrees of intensity between mild general excitement and the extreme forms of
                    maniacal furor; in kind it may not amount to more than a decided increase of the
                    initial symptoms of restlessness, irritability, and change of disposition; in
                    degree it is characterized by greater or less excitement of thought, word, and
                    action. The general vague restlessness and irritability of the prodromal period
                    not only become exacerbated, but manifest a tendency to produce results in
                    action. Excited action may show itself either in a general exaltation or in the
                    suspension of normal trains of thought. A prominent example of the first
                    psychical condition is found in the naturally devout mind under certain
                    conditions of excitement: the habitually religious man may have meditated on
                    schemes for self-conduct, the good of mankind, or the spread of religion,
                    schemes which, so long as mental action was under control, were mere projects,
                    things to be hoped for, but which under morbid excitement assert themselves so
                    powerfully as to be regarded by the unbalanced mind as immediate necessities, to
                    be procured at the expense of all considerations. The real distinction of
                    religious mania from religious enthusiastic excitement consists, not in the form
                    of the ideas, for which parallel cases might be found in sanity and insanity,
                    but in the <hi rend="italic">per</hi><hi rend="italic">saltum</hi> manner in
                    which it is sought to carry them into action, in the leaving out of those links
                    which the sane mind uses to decide on the <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit13newyrich/page/n116/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0913-0116-0107"/> adoption or rejection of a scheme, but the
                    omission of which transfers the scheme suddenly from the region of imagination
                    and hope to one of present reality. There is an absence of religious totality;
                    the patient is bound up in some scheme for the advancement of religious
                    knowledge, in some project for the building of a church, the founding of a
                    school, the establishing of a mission, or, more probably, for all at once; for
                    this he neglects his family, all social considerations, and those duties which
                    are the precepts of his faith. Whether the apparently efficient cause be
                    religion, politics, or the prominent social question of the day, the results are
                    identical, being only conditioned by the nature of the original idea. The
                    ordinary behaviour of the man is changed; he is ever on the move; his gestures,
                    loud tone of voice, volubility of talk, and general manner are such as to cause
                    his friends distinctly to mark the change. A large proportion of such cases
                    recover under appropriate treatment, but they not unfrequently pass into acute
                    delirious mania. When the disease is manifested by the suspension of the
                    ordinary trains of thought, the symptoms consist, for the most part, in
                    recklessness of action and conversation; there is a sort of exalted joyousness,
                    a strong tendency to dissipation, loud and wild though not necessarily
                    incoherent talk, extreme restlessness, and utter want of respect for all
                    conventionalities. Such patients (reputable members of society, be it
                    remembered, a month or a week before) outrage all sense of decency <hi
                    rend="italic">; they</hi> may walk the street with strumpets, and appear drunk
                    in public, forcing their behaviour on the notice of the police. They care
                    nothing for the feelings of friends or the prospects of their families. The
                    intellectual faculties may be active; thus wit and humoui, uncontrolled by any
                    feelings of consideration for others, may stand out all the more prominently.
                    The condition, taken over all, is very closely allied to that stage of
                    intoxication in which the poison of alcohol sets free all controlling
                    influences. When the restraining power of association is lost, there is no
                    difficulty in comprehending that the uncontrolled brain may act in any
                    direction. This class of cases is specially emphasized, because they are apt to
                    be mistaken by the public for instances of mere moral obliquity.</p>
                <p>The relation of amount of mental disturbance to the degree of excitement is not
                    definable; mania may be extreme, and the disturbance of ideas apparently slight,
                    and <hi rend="italic">vice versa.</hi> It is of great importance that the two
                    following facts should be insisted on—(1) that mania of an extreme description
                    can exist without delusion; and (2) that mania of a dangerous nature may exist
                    without furious excitement. It is in this class of mania that cases of so-called
                    <hi rend="italic">folie raisonnante</hi> are for the most part met with—a class
                    strongly insisted on by many Continental authorities as of great pathological
                    importance. By one section of foreign writers it is spoken of as <hi
                    rend="italic">folie raisonnante,</hi> by another under the original name
                    suggested by Pinel <hi rend="italic">mania sine</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >delirio,</hi> while by a third both are used promiscuously to indicate a class
                    of cases in which, although considerable disturbance and excitement may exist,
                    the sufferer is able to justify his course of action by a line of reasoning not
                    illogical in itself, although founded on false premises.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Exaltation of feeling with delusion or delusional mania,</hi>
                    whether it follows on a period of simple exaltation of feeling, or is coexistent
                    with the first symptoms of excitement, is not to be connected with the
                    originating psychical cause; indeed the intellectual confusion is so great and
                    of such a kind as to render any analysis impossible. It is well to mark here the
                    psychological difference between maniacal and melancholic delusions; the latter
                    are persistent in character and appear to proceed from within, the former are
                    changeful and are readily acted on from without. The general expansiveness of
                    ideas, the rapidity with which they are produced and influenced by external
                    objects, along with the inability to correlate idea with idea, are productive of
                    incoherence in thought, word, and action. For instance, a man may imagine and
                    state that he is the king of the universe, at the same time that he enters no
                    remonstrance against herding and eating with his fellow paupers; he may assert
                    his superiority, but may not object to obey the behests of a common keeper.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Acute delirious mania</hi> is a condition often rapidly
                    produced and not unfrequently fatal. It may be the culmination of a case which
                    has passed through the stages of simple exaltation of feeling and mania with
                    delusion— the latter rarely; or it may appear in a few days or even a few hours
                    as the result of some severe mental shock. It may persist for only a short time,
                    and is then spoken of as acute transitory mania. The symptoms are very
                    definite,— the wildest yells and screams, a frenzied rushing to and fro, a
                    reckless casting of the body on the ground or against the walls and furniture,
                    smashing everything that comes in the way without any definite purpose save
                    smashing, flushed features, clammy sweat, and a high bounding rapid pulse;
                    nothing can control the patient but physical force, for his fury renders him
                    blind to all influences.</p>
                <p>3. <hi rend="italic">Acute Primary Dementia.—</hi> This disease is of rapid
                    incidence. It may result from sudden psychical disturbance, especially fright;
                    occasionally no cause can be traced. After a few days or hours, during which the
                    patient is somewhat stupid and apathetic, these symptoms increase to such a
                    degree as to cause him to be, to all outward appearance, utterly demented; he
                    sits unaffected by anything that goes on around him; he is completely helpless,
                    cannot take off or put on his clothes nor feed himself, and passes urine and
                    faeces where he sits or stands; he is speechless, and cannot be roused to action
                    by any appeal; his movements are slow, when he can be got to move at all; but
                    the chief motor symptom is a degree of catalepsy. It may be said with truth that
                    the condition is one of mental and bodily catalepsy. Such cases to the ordinary
                    observer appear utterly hopeless. There is a strong tendency towards death; but,
                    when this is overcome, it often happens that the sufferer gradually emerges from
                    the condition, and can give an account of the sensations experienced during his
                    illness. It may terminate in dementia of a very low type. Post-mortem
                    examination of recent cases frequently reveals dropsy of the brain, or changes
                    in interstitial tissues producing pressure. (See Blandford, <hi rend="italic"

                    progressive paralytic dementia, or, as it is more frequently spoken of, <hi
                    rend="italic">general paralysis,</hi> is a disease of the superior and lateral
                    convolutions of the brain, which gradually extends over the whole nervous
                    system, producing a peculiar impairment of motor power, and invariably
                    accompanied by insanity. It is marked by well-defined series of physical and
                    psychical symptoms, and terminates in a peculiar manner within a definite
                    period.</p>
                <p>General paralysis was first recognized as a special disease in France; it was
                    indicated by Esquirol, and its history was fairly elucidated by Bayle, Delaye,
                    and Calmeil, the latter giving it the name of <hi rend="italic">paralysie
                    générale des aliénés.</hi> General paralysis is a common disease, and is
                    generally spoken of as “softening of the brain,” a term diametrically opposed to
                    its pathological anatomy. The condition is essentially a chronic diffuse
                    subinflammatory overgrowth of the connective tissue of the cerebral hemispheres,
                    leading to destruction of the true nerve elements, and principally affecting
                    that region of the brain in which recent observers have localized the cortical
                    motor centres. General paralysis is said to be a disease of middle life; this is
                    to a certain extent true, for, in the large majority of cases, its incidence <pb

                    xml:id="kp-eb0913-0117-0108"/> occurs between the ages of thirty-five and fifty;
                    it is, however, met with prior to the first-mentioned age, less frequently after
                    the latter period of life. Statistics show that the decade between forty and
                    fifty is the one during which the disease is most likely to occur. Men are more
                    subject to it than women, in the proportion of, at least, eight to one; in women
                    the symptoms are less strongly pronounced, and the disease runs its course more
                    slowly. Although the relative frequency of the disease appears to be equal in
                    the higher and lower classes of society, statistics show that the town artisan
                    is more liable to it than the agricultural labourer. In the lower grades of
                    society general paralysis is much more common in England than in Scotland or
                    Ireland; in certain English asylums general paralytics constitute from a sixth
                    to an eighth of the inmates, whilst in Scotch and Irish district asylums the
                    proportion does not amount to more then 2 or 3 per cent.</p>
                <p>The progressive character of the disease is marked by three stages, termed the
                    prodromal, the acute, and the ter-miuative. The <hi rend="italic">prodromal
                    stage</hi> is marked by a somewhat incongruous congeries of mental symptoms,
                    consisting of total change in the habits and disposition, general restlessness
                    and irritability, impairment of memory, extravagance in thought and action, and
                    a peculiar facility closely followed by, or intercurrent with, the bodily
                    symptoms of impaired mobility of the face and tongue. For the purposes of
                    diagnosis the physical are more important than the mental phenomena. As a rule
                    the <hi rend="italic">bouleversement</hi> of disposition is peculiarly well
                    marked; the impairment of memory consists, not only in the blurring and
                    confusion of past events, but in the forgetting of the occurrence of one minute
                    in the next,—purposes formed and intentions expressed are forgotten almost as
                    soon as formed and expressed. This want of fixity is also shown by the
                    nonrecognition of the lapse of time, and by the manner in which violent passion
                    is suddenly changed into amiability. To the same cause may probably be traced
                    the peculiar facility of disposition of the general paralytic; even at this
                    early stage there are indications of the optimism which, as the case progresses,
                    affords the characteristic psychical symptom. In the prodromal period it is
                    manifested by a degree of morbid vanity, general exaltation, and a tendency to
                    regard all things in the brightest possible light. The physical symptoms consist
                    in a finely fibrillar action of the muscles of the tongue, twitching of the
                    upper lip, hesitancy of speech, and a loss of facial expression; the tongue
                    symptom consists of a rapid agitation of its surface, the voluntary movements of
                    the whole organ not being entirely under control, <hi rend="italic">e.g.,</hi>
                    it is protruded with a jerk: the upper lip hangs and trembles before utterance
                    like that of one struggling against weeping; the hesitancy of speech can best be
                    illustrated by saying that it is identical with the slurring of words in the
                    first stage of intoxication,—the patient “speaks thick;” the face assumes a
                    mask-like want of expression—the muscular power being impaired to such a degree
                    as to cause change of expression to be a comparatively slow process. As the
                    disease advances there is greater excitability, and the general exaltation of
                    ideas becomes so great as to lead the patient to the commission of insanely
                    extravagant actions, such as purchases of large numbers of useless articles, or
                    of lands and houses far beyond his means, numerous indiscriminate proposals of
                    marriage, the suggestion of utterly absurd commercial schemes, or attempts at
                    feats utterly beyond his physical powers. Not unfrequently he is found
                    committing theftuous acts. The <hi rend="italic">acute period</hi> is frequently
                    ushered in by maniacal symptoms which generally assume the type of what is
                    termed by French writers <hi rend="italic">delire</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >ambitieux.</hi> Delusion of the wildest character may now present itself; the
                    patient may believe himself to be in possession of millions of money, to be
                    unsurpassed iu strength and agility, to be a great and overruling genius, and
                    the recipient of the highest honours. Every idea is expanded and exalted,
                    whether it relates to time, space, or personal attributes. Although grandiose
                    and extravagant delusion is very frequent, existing as it does in about one-half
                    of all cases, it is by no means such a persistent symptom as the <hi
                    rend="italic">bien être,</hi> which condition is the diagnostic of the disease
                    in that it is invariably present. This is shown by perfect contentment with
                    himself and all things around him, by the constant use of superlatives and such
                    expressions as “all right,” “splendid,” “first rate”; he speaks of his health as
                    robust, “never better in my life,” even when there is grave constitutional
                    disturbance; he is unaffected by the death of child, or wife, or nearest friend.
                    He is Utterly unsuspicious, lost to all appreciation of social relations, and
                    facile in the extreme. Synchronously with this condition, the physical symptoms
                    become exacerbated; the tongue and facial symptoms already spoken of increase in
                    intensity, and in addition impairments of the motor powers of the extremities
                    present themselves, consisting in a loss of co-ordinating power, not in a loss
                    of muscular strength. Thus the gait becomes straddled and uncertain; there is a
                    widening of the basis of support; he has to pick his steps as he goes up and
                    down stairs, and is apt to trip over small obstacles; the action of walking
                    resembles that of a half-drunk man. Later on the arms become involved. The
                    pupils are often irregular. The third or <hi rend="italic">terminativβ
                    stage</hi> is marked by “epileptiform” or more properly apoplectiform attacks,
                    the general condition becoming more and more degraded. By this time the patient
                    is almost bedridden; actual palsy often occurs. Towards the end certain of the
                    semivoluntary muscles are affected; bed-sores may form; and he may die slowly of
                    exhaustion or suddenly during an apoplectiform attack. General paralysis runs
                    its course in from one to four years; more rapid and more protracted cases are
                    on record, but, taken over all, eighteen months may be stated as its average
                    duration. The disease is incurable.</p>
                <p><hi> II.</hi><hi rend="smallcaps">Traumatic Insanity.</hi> —Generally speaking,
                    insanity is not developed for some months or even years after receipt of the
                    injury, but in the interval the patient suffers from headache, more especially
                    after mental effort, irascibility of temper, confusion of thought, and
                    consequent inaptitude for business, weakened memory, and a constant feeling of
                    fatigue. If this condition is not overcome, a progressive dementia sets in, of
                    which the special character is violence of temper, and a tendency to impulsive
                    action. This dementia is generally complicated with maniacal attacks intervening
                    at uncertain periods and marked by furor or violence. Dipsomania or insane
                    drinking is a not very uncommon result, apart from all other indications of
                    aberration. Prognosis is unfavourable.</p>

                    between the fits the patient is generally stupid and dull of apprehension.
                    Immediately before or after fits, or, as some believe, occasionally taking their
                    place, mania of a violent and furious, of a subacute, or of an ecstatic
                    character presents itself. All authorities recognize epileptic insanity as the
                    form most dangerous to the public. Prognosis is unfavourable. <hi rend="italic"

                    rend="smallcaps">Hysteria</hi> may become so exacerbated as to amount to
                    insanity. Superadded to these may be delusions of a sexual nature. The most
                    extreme form of mental disturbance supervening on hysteria is acute mania of a
                    very violent character; it is generally of a delirious nature, but does not
                    usually continue for any great length of time. It is open to question whether
                    the “fasting girls” and women with “stigmata” should not be included among the
                    <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit13newyrich/page/n118/mode/1up"

                    are liable to this form of insanity. In a sense the prognosis is favourable,
                    inasmuch as prolonged treatment procures great abatement of symptoms, if not
                    actual recovery. <hi rend="italic">Insanity occurring with locomotor ataxy</hi>
                    strongly resembles general paralysis. Taken over all, it may be stated that the
                    symptoms differ more in degree than in kind, not being so intense. There is not
                    the same extravagance of delusion or violence of mania.</p>

                    characterized by a short period of mania, melancholia, or delusion, which soon
                    passes into a mixture of subacute mania and dementia. The symptom, according to
                    Clouston, is a tendency to be suspicious. (Consult Clouston, “Tuberculosis and
                    Insanity,” <hi rend="italic">Journ. of Mental Science,</hi> April 1863.) <hi
                    rend="italic">Rheumatic insanity</hi> is characterized by hallucinations of
                    sight, touch, and taste, loss of memory, acute delirium succeeded by confusion
                    of ideas and sluggishness of mind, accompanied by choreic movements of the.
                    limbs, deadening of reflex action, and even paralysis. These symptoms appear as
                    the articular affection diminishes or disappears; they are, as it were, one
                    vicarious of the other. Prognosis is favourable. (See Griesinger <hi

                    well marked. The latter are general mania with delusions of suspicion. Prognosis

                    commences with acutely maniacal symptoms, shortly followed by hypochondriasis of
                    marked character, paralysis of energy, and rapid progressive dementia.
                    Extravagant delusions often present themselves so strongly as to render the
                    diagnosis between this condition and general paralysis difficult. Prognosis
                    unfavourable. (The most important paper on this form of insanity is by Mickle,

                    October 1876.) In <hi rend="italic">anaemic insanity,</hi> however produced, the
                    general train of symptoms is violent mania of short continuance followed by
                    melancholic dementia. Prognosis favourable.</p>

                    manifested by various trains of symptoms. Acute mania is on the whole the most
                    common: it is characterized by motor restlessness; the patient walks, talks,
                    smokes, drinks, must ever be on the move. Where self-abuse comes in as a factor,
                    the sufferer is melancholic and suspicious, self-accusing. Dipsomania is a not
                    unfrequent symptom. But whatever may be the general symptoms of these three sets
                    of patients, they have one common symptom, a perversion or increase of the
                    sexual instinct Prognosis is favourable as regards the attack present,
                    unfavourable as to the probability of recurrence. <hi rend="italic">Climacteric

                <p>In employing the above classification it must be clearly borne in mind that the
                    term of the symptom should, whenever possible, be appended to the pathogenetic

                    idiopathic mania, epileptic mania, &lt;fcc. If the terms are combined, the
                    nature of the disease and its general psychical characteristics are expressed in

                <p>It will be noted that no separate notice has been taken of such popular terms as
                    homicidal or suicidal insanity. They in no wise indicate a class of the insane;
                    they are symptoms common to many insanities, especially to epileptic, traumatic,
                    puerperal, and idiopathic insanity, and as such must be regarded as incidents in
                    a given case-</p>

                <p>Insanity terminates in recovery, in death, or in.chronic mania or chronic
                    dementia. Accurate statistics of the two first-named terminations are
                    unattainable, as a large number of patients are treated at home; and asylum
                    statistics do not therefore show the result overhead, only that of the more
                    aggravated cases. The result of treatment in lunatic hospitals gives about 40
                    per cent., calculated on the admissions, which, however, include idiocy, chronic
                    terminative insanity, and such acknowledged incurable forms of the disease as
                    general paralysis. This figure does not of course represent the results of
                    treatment of all the insanities, which, although there are no figures at command
                    to support the assertion, may be fairly estimated at not less than 70 per cent.,
                    excluding idiocy. There is a general tendehcy of all insanities to shorten life;
                    as already noted, some are in themselves fatal, or render their subjects less
                    able to withstand disease. Asylum statistics show from 7 to 8 per cent, per
                    annum as the average mortality calculated on the numbers resident.</p>
                <p>It is needless to attempt a description of the various phases of chronic
                    terminative dementia and mania. Delusion may continue, or the patient may become
                    more or less sottish and degraded in habits; or, on the other hand, he may
                    retain a considerable amount of mental power, still not sufficient to render him
                    a responsible member of society. The great mass of the inmates of asylums belong
                    to this class of lunatics, mostly harmless, yet precluded from mixing with the
                    world as much for the convenience and safety of society as for their own
                    benefit. A small proportion are detained on account of their liability to suffer
                    from recurrence of attacks of insanity, although they are not actually insane
                    during the intervals. To this condition foreign authorities have applied the
                    term <hi rend="italic">folie circulaire,</hi> and some have asserted that it is
                    the characteristic of certain cases <hi rend="italic">ab</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >initio.</hi> It is mostly confined to persons strongly hereditarily
                    predisposed. The term explains itself: after intervals of comparative sanity,
                    the patient manifests symptoms which run their course through the prodromal, the
                    acute, and the demented stages, on again to recovery, in manner similar to a
                    recent case.</p>

                <p>In speaking of the treatment of the insanities, it will simplify matters to
                    eliminate, in the first place, those forms <pb break="no"

                    agents in the present state of medical knowledge. Medicine, whether hygienic or
                    therapeutic, cannot touch general paralysis, the insanity produced by
                    adventitious products, or senile insanity, except in the reduction of intensity
                    of symptoms. Traumatic insanity is for the most part hopeless; it is probable
                    that sufficient attention has not been directed to surgical measures in such
                    cases.</p>
                <p>In the insanities due to morbid conditions of the general system, in those
                    associated with other neuroses, and in toxic insanity, the physician attacks the
                    head symptoms through treatment of the causating factor. It is true that in
                    these forms symptoms have to be attacked directly, but ultimate cure is to be
                    looked for through treatment of the diathetic condition. It is rare, and then
                    only in the earlier stages of the initial symptoms, that the progress of these
                    diseases is cut short by therapeutic measures, inasmuch as they seldom come
                    under the cognizance of the physician at that period. The exception to this
                    statement is to be found in the case of puerperal insanity, where the patient is
                    very generally under immediate medical supervision; in her case, therefore, the
                    prodromal indications are often observed, and the disease arrested by the timely
                    administration of drugs. But in the great mass of cases the last idea which
                    occurs to the minds of friends is the possibility of impending insanity, and it
                    is not till the disease has considerably advanced that the fact is recognized
                    and the physician called in. When he has the opportunity of applying his art
                    during the initial stages, he directs his attention to the procuring of sleep by
                    means of opium and other narcotics, the bromides of potash and ammonium and
                    chloral hydrate, and by rectifying the disorders of the digestive system. But
                    when the disease has reached the congestive stage the treatment becomes for the
                    most part expectant, as it does in analogous complaints of other systems.
                    “Change of scene” is often adopted, and properly so in the very earliest stages;
                    but when the disease is confirmed it is much more apt to aggravate the
                    condition, fatigue and excitement only fanning the flame; it is much the same as
                    if a man with a congested lung were asked to walk a mile uphill, in the hope
                    that he would breathe more freely at the top. Till within the last few years
                    treatment by bleeding, cupping, and blistering, shaving the head, and cold
                    applications, was much in vogue. In asylums of the present day a shaved head is
                    never seen. It was likewise the custom to administer large doses of sedatives.
                    The system of treatment which now generally obtains is almost purely hygienic.
                    Opiates are much less used, and are to be deprecated in those forms
                    characterized by excitement; in idiopathic and climacteric melancholia, however,
                    they often produce good results. General constitutional treatment is what is
                    usually adopted. In such forms as idiopathic mania and melancholia, the mania of
                    adolescence, puerperal mania, and climacteric melancholia, the disease, like
                    many others, runs its course, not very materially affected by remedial agents
                    apart from those applied to the maintenance of the system, and its cure is
                    similarly dependent on rest and nursing. And the main question concerning
                    treatment is, Where are these best to be obtained? In the case of the poor there
                    is no alternative, even in comparatively mild cases, but to send the patient to
                    an asylum. In the case of the rich it resolves itself very much into a question
                    of convenience, for, with plenty of money at command, the physician can convert
                    any house into an asylum. But under ordinary circumstances, when the patient is
                    violent, noisy, suicidal, homicidal, or offensive to society, it becomes
                    necessary to seclude him, both for the purposes of cure and for the safety and
                    comfort of the family. Except amongst the very affluent, treatment at home is
                    for the most part unsatisfactory <hi rend="italic">; it</hi> is very generally
                    tried, but breaks down under the constant strain to which the friends are
                    subjected. In a well-ordered hospital for the insane there is every possible
                    appliance for treatment, with trained nurses who are under constant supervision;
                    and it therefore affords the best chance of recovery.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">History.—</hi> The history of the treatment of insanity has
                    been stated to be divisible into three epochs—the barbaric, the humane, and the
                    remedial. But this does not take into account the very highly humane and
                    probably highly remedial system of treatment which obtained in very ancient
                    times. In Egypt the temples of Saturn, and in Greece the Asclepia, were resorted
                    to by lunatics, and the treatment there adopted was identical in principle with
                    that of the present day. The directions given by all the classical medical
                    authors, and especially Hippocrates and Galen, are of the soundest character.
                    How long their influence existed it is difficult to say, but in the Middle Ages,
                    and up to the middle of the last century, little attention was paid to the care
                    or cure of the insane. A small proportion were received into monastic houses or
                    immured in common jails. In 1537 a house in Bishopsgate Street, London, fell
                    into the possession of the corporation, and was appropriated for the reception
                    of fifty lunatics. This, the first Bethlehem Hospital or Bedlam, was removed in
                    1675 to Moorfields, and in 1814 the present hospital in St George’s Fields was
                    erected. St Luke’s was instituted in 1751. Bedlams or houses of detention for
                    lunatics appear to have existed in other cities, but, with these exceptions, no
                    provision was made for the insane, who were allowed to wander at large. There is
                    good reason for believing that many were executed as criminals or witches. About
                    1750 the condition of the insane attracted some amount of public attention, and
                    the incarceration in madhouses of a considerably larger number than formerly
                    followed, not on account of any philanthropic sympathy with their condition,
                    butas a measure demanded for the public safety and comfort. But this measure by
                    no means brought about the termination of the barbarie period. The houses,
                    misnamed asylums, were in the hands of private parties, under little or no
                    supervision, and were in fact merely prisons of the very worst description. The
                    unhappy inmates were immured in cells, chained to the walls, flogged, starved,
                    and not unfrequently killed. It is almost impossible to believe that this
                    condition of matters existed far on into the present century. According to
                    Conolly, “there is clear proof of the continued existence of these abuses in
                    1827; and it cannot be denied that not a few of them survived in some public and
                    private asylums in 1850.” Matters were no better in France when Pinel was
                    appointed in 1792 to the charge of the Bicêtre, the great hospital of Paris for
                    male lunatics. In that establishment, and in the Salpétrière, the condition of
                    the inmates was as degraded as in the British madhouses. This great
                    philanthropist adopted the bold step of striking off the chains and other
                    engines of restraint from those under his care. About the same time, the most
                    gross abuses having been brought to light in connexion with the management of
                    the city of York asylum, William Tuke, a member of the Society of Friends, was
                    mainly active in instituting the York Retreat for the care and cure of insane
                    members of that sect. This real asylum was conducted on non-restraint
                    principles. The names of Pinel and Tuke are indissolubly connected with the
                    history of the humane treatment of the insane, and to their efforts must be
                    ascribed the awakening not only of the public but of the medical profession to
                    the true principles of management. It took, however, many years before the
                    principles laid down by these men were universally adopted. In 1815 a committee
                    of the House of Commons brought to light many gross abuses in Bethlehem
                    Hospital, and it was not'till 1836 that mechanical restraint <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit13newyrich/page/n120/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0913-0120-0111"/> was entirely abolished in an English public
                    asylum. This took place at Lincoln, where Dr Gardiner Hill did away with all
                    engines of restraint. Shortly afterwards Conolly adopted the same line of
                    treatment at Hanwell, near London, and through the influence of his example and
                    precept the measure extended over the whole of Great Britain. Experience has
                    shown that, as restraint of all forms is abandoned, the management of lunatics
                    becomes easier. Walled-in airing-courts, barred windows, and strong dark rooms
                    have almost entirely disappeared, and in some Scotch asylums it is found
                    practicable to discontinue, the use of lock and key. It has been said that the
                    type of insanity has changed within the last forty years; it would be more true
                    to say that the type of treatment has changed. It is much less common nowadays
                    to meet with those extremely violent forms of madness which entered into the
                    descriptions of many authors. With the reduction of restraint a higher order of
                    supervision on the part of attendants is demanded, and as they, are trained to
                    rely more and more on the moral influence they can exercise over their charges,
                    and less on mechanical apparatus, the patient is not so apt to resent control,
                    and therefore a greater calm and contentment pervades the atmosphere of our
                    asylum wards. This has been mistaken for a change in the type of the
                    disease.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Statistics.—</hi> The statistics of lunacy are merely of
                    interest from a sociological point of view; for under that term are comprised
                    all forms of insanity. It is needless to produce tables illustrative of the
                    relative numbers of lunatics in the various countries of Europe, the systems of
                    registration being so unequal in their working as to afford no trustworthy basis
                    of comparison. Even in Great Britain, where the systems are more perfect than in
                    any other country, the tables published in the Blue Books of the three countries
                    can only be regarded as approximately correct, the difficulty of registering all
                    cases of lunacy being insuperable.</p>

                <p>There is thus an increased ratio in England and Wales of lunatics to the
                    population (which in 1859 was 19,686,701, and in 1880 was estimated at
                    25,480,000) of 186’7 per 100,000 as against 279’4, and in Scotland of 157 as
                    against 217 per 100,000. The publication of these figures has naturally given
                    rise to the question whether lunacy has actually become more prevalent during
                    the last twenty years, whether there is real increase of the disease. There is a
                    pretty general consent of all authorities that if there has been an increaes it
                    is but very slight, and that the apparent increase is due, first to the improved
                    systems of registration instituted by the boards of lunacy, which have brought
                    under their cognizance a mass of cases which were formerly neglected, “who would
                    not have been dealt with as paupers in 1858, but who are now dealt with as such,
                    so as to obtain for them the advantage of accommodation in pauper asylums.”
                    Secondly, a further and far more powerful reason is to be found in the
                    increasing tendency among all classes, and especially among the poorer class, to
                    recognize the less pronounced forms of mental disorder as being of the nature of
                    insanity, and requiring to be dealt with as such. Thirdly, the grant of four
                    shillings per week which in 1876 was made by parliament from imperial sources
                    for the maintenance of pauper lunatics has induced parochial authorities to
                    regard as lunatics a large number of weak-minded paupers, and to force them into
                    asylums in order to obtain the benefit of the grant and to relieve the rates.
                    These views receive support from the fact that the increase of private patients,
                    <hi rend="italic">i.c.,</hi> patients who are provided for out of their own
                    funds or those of the family, has advanced in a vastly smaller ratio. In their
                    case the increase, small as it is, can be accounted for by the growing
                    disinclination on the part of the community to tolerate irregularities of
                    conduct due to mental disease, and the consequent relegation of its victims to
                    asylums for the sake of family convenience. And again, careful inquiry has
                    failed to show a proportional increase of admissions into asylums of such
                    well-marked forms as general paralysis, puerperal mania, &amp;c. The main cause
                    of the registered increase of lunatics is thus to be sought for in improved
                    registration, and parochial and family convenience. If there is an actual
                    increase, and there is reason for believing that there is a slight actual
                    increase, it is due to the tendency of the population to gravitate towards towns
                    and cities, where the conditions of health are inferior to those of nιral life,
                    and where there is therefore a greater disposition to disease of all kinds.</p>

                <p>The effect of insanity upon responsibility and civil capacity has been recognized
                    at an early period in every system of law. In the Roman jurisprudence its
                    consequences were very fully developed, and the provisions and terminology of
                    that system have largely affected the subsequent legal treatment of the subject.
                    Its leading principles were simple and well marked. The insane person having no
                    intelligent will, and being thus incapable of consent or voluntary action, could
                    acquire no right and incur no responsibility by his own acts; his person and
                    property were placed after inquiry by the magistrate under the control of a <hi
                    rend="italic">curator.</hi> The different terms by which the insane were known,
                    such as <hi rend="italic">demens, furiosus, fatuus,</hi> although no doubt
                    signifying different types of insanity, did not infer any difference of legal
                    treatment. They were popular names which were used somewhat indifferently, but
                    which all denoted the complete deprivation of reason. During the Middle Ages the
                    insane were but little protected or regarded by law. Their legal acts were
                    annulled, and their property placed under control, but little or no attempt was
                    made to supervise their personal treatment. In England the wardship of idiots
                    and lunatics, which was annexed before the reign of Edward II. to the king’s
                    prerogative, had regard chiefly to the control of their lands and estates, and
                    was only gradually elaborated into the systematic control of their person and
                    property now exercised in chancery. Those whose means were insignificant were
                    left to the care of their relations or to charity. In criminal law the plea of
                    insanity was unavailing except <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit13newyrich/page/n121/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0913-0121-0112"/> in extreme cases. About the beginning of this
                    century a very considerable change commenced. The public attention was very
                    strongly attracted to the miserable condition of the insane who were
                    incarcerated in asylums without any efficient check or inspection; and at the
                    same time the medical knowledge of insanity entered on a new phase. The
                    possibility and advantages of a better treatment of insanity were illustrated by
                    eminent physicians both in France and England; its physical origin became
                    generally accepted; its mental phenomena were more carefully observed, and its
                    relation was established to other mental conditions which had not hitherto been
                    regarded as insane in the proper sense of the word. From this period we date the
                    commencement of legislation such as that known in England as the Lunacy Acts,
                    which aimed at the regulation and control of all constraint applied to the
                    insane. And at the same time we find the commencement of a new state of matters
                    in the courts. Hitherto, the criteria of insanity had been very rude, and the
                    evidence was generally of a loose and popular character; but, whenever it was
                    fully recognized that insanity was a disease with which physicians who had
                    studied the subject were peculiarly conversant, expert evidence obtained
                    increased importance, and from this time became prominent in every case. The
                    newer medical views of insanity were thus brought into contact with the old
                    narrow conception of the law courts, and a controversy arose in the field of
                    criminal law which in England, at least, is not yet settled.</p>
                <p>The fact of insanity may operate in law—(1) by excluding responsibility for
                    crime; (2) by invalidating legal acts;</p>
                <p>(3) by affording ground for depriving the insane person by a legal process of the
                    control of his person and property; or</p>
                <p>(4) by affording ground for putting him under restraint.</p>
                <p>1. Responsibility for crime may be destroyed by insanity. The theory of the
                    limitations under which this plea is recognized by English law is first clearly
                    stated by Hale <hi rend="italic">{Pleas of the Crown,</hi> i. c. 2) in these
                    terms: “When there is no will to commit an offence there can be no
                    transgression, and, because the choice of the will presupposes an act of the
                    understanding, it follows that when there is a total defect of the understanding
                    there is no free act of the will in the choice of things or actions.” This
                    doctrine was closely followed by the courts, and in the subsequent cases we find
                    nothing admitted in defence short of a total defect of the understanding. In
                    later times, however, frequent attempts were made on the part of the defence to
                    break through this stringent rule, and in 1843 the case of Macnaughton, which
                    resulted in an acquittal, attracted so much public attention, and seemed to cast
                    so much doubt on the law as previously understood, that a series of questions
                    were put by the House of Lords to the judges with the view of determining
                    conclusively how the law really stood. These answers practically affirmed the
                    old law. They decided that, in order to establish a defence on the ground of
                    insanity, “it must be clearly proved that at the time of the committing of the
                    act the party accused was labouring under such a defect of reason from disease
                    of the mind as not to know the nature and quality of the act he was doing, or
                    if’ he did know it he did not know that he was doing wrong.” These answers are
                    now the ruling authority both in England and Scotland, although there have been
                    undoubtedly many instances in which the defence of insanity has been sustained
                    either through the judge abstaining from pressing the law very strictly or from
                    the jury taking a wider view of the case. Frequently, also, a more lenient view
                    has practically been given effect to by the intervention of the home secretary,
                    many of the most puzzling cases having been disposed of in this way. When the
                    prisoner is unable to plead or has been acquitted on the ground of insanity, the
                    jury are obliged to state whether they find the prisoner to be insane, and in
                    that case he is ordered to be detained during her majesty’s pleasure; and the
                    home secretary has power to order him to be detained at such place as he may
                    direct. Prisoners who become insane while in prison upon any form of legal
                    process may also be removed by warrant of the home secretary to whatever asylum
                    he thinks fit. All these are known technically as criminal lunatics, and an
                    asylum has been provided for their detention at Broadmoor, from which they can
                    only be discharged by warrant of the home secretary. (39 &amp; 40 Geo. III. c.
                    94; 3 &lt;fc 4 Vict. c. 54; 23 &amp; 24 Vict. c. 65; 27 &amp; 28 Vict. c. 29; 30
                    &lt;t 31 Vict. c. 12.)</p>
                <p>The law thus clearly laid down by the courts has been strongly condemned by most
                    medical authorities, who maintain that it is founded upon an ignorant and
                    imperfect •view of insanity. There can be no doubt that insanity does not wholly
                    or even chiefly affect the will through the intellectual faculties. The
                    disturbance of emotion and feeling is at least of equal consequence. We have
                    cases where a criminal act seems to spring entirely from this source, and very
                    many others where we have a complex of morbid intelligence and feeling which it
                    is impossible to disentangle. In cases like those it is impossible by any
                    analysis to separate the intellectual from the emotional phenomena, and to
                    assess the amount of intelligence which, although morbid or defective, ought to
                    be sufficient to restrain the equally morbid emotional condition. It seems clear
                    that in judging of responsibility we ought to take the mental condition of the
                    insane as a whole; and the present view of the law seems to have originated
                    partly from ignorance of the more obscure phenomena of insanity, and partly from
                    the metaphysical conception of a will whose freedom is only limited by its
                    intelligence. It must, however, be remembered, on the other hand, that the
                    courts have had serious difficulties to encounter. The views of insanity and
                    consequent irresponsibility presented to them in medical evidence were often so
                    vague that they seemed capable of indefinite extension, and there is no subject
                    on which the experts have appeared so much at variance with each other. But
                    these difficulties, however much they may call for the watchfulness of the
                    courts, seem no sufficient ground for limiting the effect of insanity in
                    relation to responsibility to the intellectual faculties. Such a limitation
                    seems opposed, not merely to our present knowledge of insanity, but to the
                    experience of ordinary psychology. These controversies are not confined to
                    England. In the United States the law may generally be said, to be the same as
                    that of England, but, as the judges have been by no means so tightly bound down
                    as the English judges have been by the opinions in Macnaughton’s case, a
                    considerable tendency has been shown in many (or indeed most) States to take a
                    more liberal view of the question. In France the provision of the Code Napoléon,
                    “il n’y a ni crime ni délit lorsque le prévenu était en état de démence,”
                    depends for its effect upon the interpretation given to the word <hi
                    rend="italic">démence,</hi> and for some time the tribunals were inclined to
                    interpret it in such a manner as to make the law very much the same as that of
                    England; but the view of the physicians is now generally prevalent. In Germany
                    the matter is dealt with in a section (§51,27. <hi rend="italic">G.Bf</hi> of
                    the criminal code, which was the result of very careful discussion both by
                    physicians and lawyers. It runs thus: “There is no criminal act when the actor
                    at the time of the offence is in a state of unconsciousness or morbid
                    disturbance of the mind, through which the free determination of his will is
                    excluded.”</p>
                <p>2. In the case of all civil acts, the general rule is that capacity must be
                    measured in relation to the act. The mere fact of insanity will not in itself
                    make void a will, for example, if it appears that the testator had a fairly
                    clear <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit13newyrich/page/n122/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0913-0122-0113"/> conception of the nature of his property and the
                    objects of his bounty. But it is needless to say that the least appearance of
                    insanity in the deed itself, or any appearance of fraud or undue persuasion on
                    the part of any one, is immediately fatal to the deed. In the case of contracts
                    an additional element is knowledge of the insanity by the other party. When the
                    contract was entered into <hi rend="italic">bona fide,</hi> and the insanity of
                    the one party was not known to the other, the contract may not be set aside
                    unless the parties can be exactly restored to their previous condition.</p>
                <p>3. Both the property and person of the insane may be placed under control by a
                    legal process. In England this right was early annexed to the prerogative of the
                    crown, and is even yet in consequence not exercised by the ordinary courts, but
                    by the lord chancellor and such other judges as may be entrusted with it by the
                    sign manual. The procedure is now governed by the Lunacy Regulation Acts (16
                    &amp; 17 Vict. c. 70; 18 Vict. c. 13; 25 &amp; 26 Vict. c. 86). The question of
                    insanity is tried before one of the masters in lunacy, either with or without a
                    jury, according to circumstances. The terms of the inquiry are—whether the party
                    is of unsound mind and incapable of managing himself and his affairs; and on
                    this being found his person and property are placed in charge of one or more
                    persons called committees, whose administration is subject to the masters in
                    lunacy, and through them to the chancellor. Persons thus found insane
                    (technically known from the old form of procedure as lunatics so found by
                    inquisition) are under the inspection of the board of chancery visitors,
                    consisting of two medical men and a barrister, who arc appointed to visit them
                    at intervals. They are not subject to the provisions of the Lunacy Acts.</p>
                <p>In Scotland the old procedure is by a brieve or writ from chancery, formerly
                    tried before the judge ordinary and now before the lord president of the court
                    of session. The nearest male agnate of twenty-five years of age is appointed
                    tutor, but, latterly at least, is not entrusted with the personal custody, the
                    court, if necessary, selecting some one for the purpose, generally the nearest
                    cognate. The procedure by brieves is now becoming infrequent. More generally
                    application is made to the court of session to appoint a <hi rend="italic"
                    >curator bonis</hi> to take charge of the estate. This procedure is in many ways
                    simpler and more convenient, especially in the numerous cases which are
                    unopposed, as the court when they are satisfied that every person concerned has
                    had due notice will grant the application on the certificate of two medical men.
                    In America and on the Continent similar forms of procedure exist, which cannot
                    be gone into in detail. In the United States the law is mostly, as is natural,
                    derived from the English sources, but the procedure is regulated by statute in
                    the different States. In many other countries, where the common law is based on
                    Roman jurisprudence, the procedure seems to differ in many points from the
                    English forms, but in substance the law on the subject has in nearly all
                    countries reached very much the same results.</p>
                <p>4. Insane persons (although not lunatics so found by inquisition) may be placed
                    under personal restraint. At common law this power is limited to cases where the
                    insane person is dangerous to himself or others, but in practice it used
                    frequently to be exercised with little discretion and often with great
                    barbarity. The care and restraint of the insane (other than that exercised by
                    their friends and relatives in their own homes) is now strictly controlled by
                    the Lunacy Acts (8 &amp; 9 Vict. c. 100; 16 &amp; 17 Vict. c. 96; 16 &amp; 17
                    Vict. c. 97; 25 &amp; 26 Vict. c. Ill), the general nature of whose provisions
                    may be thus briefly described. The chief supervision of the insane is vested in
                    a body called the Commissioners of Lunacy. No insane person can be received for
                    profit, or detained in any house or asylum except upon an order by a person who
                    becomes responsible for his detention, accompanied by certificates of two
                    qualified medical practitioners that he is insane, and a proper person to be
                    taken charge of and detained under care and treatment. Every such case must at
                    once be reported to the commissioners, who must also be informed of the
                    patient’s death, discharge, change of residence, and similar circumstances. Not
                    more than one insane person can be received into a house unless a licence has
                    been previously obtained. In the metropolitan districts such licences are
                    granted after due examination by the commissioners, and in the provinces by the
                    justices of peace in quarter sessions. Every house thus licensed, together with
                    public hospitals and asylums (which are not under licence), and every patient
                    under private treatment, are subjected to a more or less frequent inspection by
                    the commissioners, as well as by visitors appointed in their respective
                    districts by the quarter sessions. The private licensed houses are under
                    especially frequent inspection; their regulations and arrangements are subject
                    to the approval of the commissioners, and especial precautions are taken that
                    the patients shall have full opportunity of having their cases examined and of
                    communicating with the commissioners. Patients may be discharged as cured, or on
                    the direction of the person who ordered their detention, or on the order of the
                    commissioners, all these modes of discharge, however, being guarded by various
                    conditions. The order for detention of a lunatic may be given by any person
                    having an interest in him, and he is liable in damages if there prove to have
                    been no sufficient ground for the order, his position differing in this respect
                    from that of the physicians and keeper of the asylum, who are only liable in the
                    event of negligence or mala fides.</p>
                <p>In Scotland the equivalent Acts are 20 &amp; 21 Vict. c. 71, 25 &amp; 26 Vict. c.
                    54, and 29 &amp; 30 Vict. c. 51. The system is in its main features the same as
                    that of England, the leading differences being that the Commissioners of Lunacy
                    are the only licensing body, and that an order granted on application by the
                    sheriff takes the place of the order by a private person.</p>
                <p>The regulations applicable to pauper lunatics differ in some respects from the
                    ordinary case. The provisions applicable to them arc for the most part to be
                    found in 16 &amp; 17 Vict. c. 97, and in 20 &amp; 21 Vict. c. 71.</p>
                <p>The nature of the evidence, and the manner in which it is to be presented to the
                    court, is an important question in every department of the legal treatment of
                    insanity. In England the courts, although giving increasing prominence to expert
                    evidence, have gone a good deal on the theory that the medical evidence is
                    merely a part of the general evidence in the case. In most Continental
                    countries, on the other hand, the whole evidence is presented in the shape of
                    reports by medical men (in most instances officials) who have previously
                    examined the case; and in this way every piece of evidence as to the state of
                    mind of the insane person is commented on by an expert who is presumably better
                    acquainted with its true import than an ordinary court or jury.</p>
