                    House (1567), with quaint emblematic mouldings of Charles H.’s reign,
                    Archdeacon’s Place (1471), and Wolsey’s Gateway (1528), sole relic this of one
                    of those “twins of learning,” the colleges of Christ Church and Ipswich. The
                    public buildings, however, are one and all of them modern. The town-hall (1868)
                    is an imposing edifice in the Venetian style, surmounted by a clock-tower 120
                    feet high, and beautified with statues and medallions. Close by, and similar in
                    style, are the post-office (1880) and the new corn-exchange (1880-81), and a
                    second good group is formed by the new museum and fine art gallery (1880-81),
                    the former of which, founded in 1847, has a splendid collection of red crag
                    fossils. Other buildings are the East Suffolk Hospital (1836-69), militia
                    artillery barracks (1855), custom-house (1845), mechanics’ institute (1824;
                    greatly enlarged 1877), working men’s college (1862), public hall (1868), and a
                    little theatre, "where Garrick made his début in 1740. The grammar school,
                    dating from at least 1477, was last refounded by Queen Elizabeth in 1565, and
                    was rebuilt in 1851 on the northern outskirts of the town, the Prince Consort
                    laying the foundation stone. It is a red brick Tudor pile, with a pretty chapel,
                    has 6 masters and 85 boys, and is endowed with 11 scholarships of an aggregate
                    yearly value of £302. Fourteen board schoolshad an average attendance of 2426 in
                    May 1880, when there were twenty-two other elementary schools, attended by 3130
                    children. The older of the sixteen churches are all of them towered flint-work
                    structures, wholly or mainly Perpendicular in style, with the exception of St
                    Peter’s (restored and enlarged in 1877), which is Decorated. They include St
                    Margaret’s (restored 1846-74), with a beautiful oak Tudor roof, elaborately
                    painted <hi rend="italic">temp.</hi> William and Mary; St Matthews (restored
                    1860), St Lawrence (1431; restored 1858); and St Clement’s (restored 1860-80),
                    containing the tomb of Eldred, an early circumnavigator. St Michael’s (1880) is
                    a wholly new erection in Early English style, and three other churches have
                    practically been rebuilt—St Mary-le-Tower (1863-66), rich in oak carving and
                    painted glass, with a tower and spire 176 feet high, and a peal of twelve bells;
                    St Helen’s (1877-78), also with a spire; and St Mary (1871) at Stoke, a suburb
                    south of the Gipping. Of nonestablished places of worship the Roman Catholic
                    church of St Paneras (1863) is the most noticeable, a late First Pointed edifice
                    with a richly carved reredos and a lofty flèche. Ipswich has two finely planted
                    arboretums, the upper one of which is public; alongside stretches Christ Church
                    park, with its picturesque Tudor mansion (1549). There are shady walks too,
                    between the river and a wet dock, which, formed in 1842 at a cost of £130,000,
                    covers 32 acres, and admitted vessels drawing 14 feet. Under an Act obtained in
                    1877 the commissioners have expended £80,000 more in making a new entrance lock,
                    to admit vessels drawing 18 feet, in erecting public warehouses, and i∏
                    deepening and improving the river.</p>
                <p>In 1879, 264 vessels of 54,353 tons entered from, and 89 of 11,406 tons cleared
                    to, foreign countries and British possessi or s; coastwise there entered 2405 of
                    152,161, and cleared 1792 of 118,624 tons. There were 125 vessels of 9779 tons,
                    besides 23 fishing boats, registered as belonging to the port on 31st December
                    of that year, in which the customs revenue amounted to £20,828, the chief
                    imports being coal (51,720 tons), linseed, cotton seed, maize, barley, iron, and
                    iron pyrites; the exports, wheat, malt, flour, artificial manures, and
                    agricultural implements. The last are manufactured at the Orwell Works (V§5) of
                    Ransomes, Sims, &amp; Head, the greatest in the world, covering 13 acres, and
                    employing over 1400 hands. Shipbuilding (27 vessels of 1965 tons during
                    1875-79), brewing, tanning, and the manufacture of manure from coprolites, and.
                    of silk, flax, ropes, and artificial stone, are the leading industries. Ipswich
                    returns two members to parliament. The borough has an area of 8192 acres. The
                    population, which in 1871 was 42,947, had increased in 1881 to 50,213.</p>
                <p>A pavement found in Castle Field in 1854 establishes the presence of the Romans,
                    but Ipswich is first mentioned in history as having been plundered by Northmen
                    in 991 and 1000. Lying out of the course of events, it has played no conspicuous
                    part, and the chief incidents in its history are the granting of its earliest
                    charter by John (1199); the visits of Edward I. (1297), Edward III. (1350),
                    Elizabeth (1561, 1565, and 1578), and George II. (1737); the meeting of the
                    British Association (1851) and of the British Archaeological Association (1864).
                    Thomas Wolsey (1471-1530), William Butler (1535-1618), Bishop Ralph Brownrigg
                    (1592-1659), Clara Reeve (1738-1803), and Mrs Trimmer (1741-1810) were natives;
                    and Gainsborough, a resident from 1747 to 1759, has given his name to a
                    beautiful lane above the “princely” Orwell. See G. R. Clarke’s <hi rend="italic"
