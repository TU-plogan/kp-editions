                    emperor of the East from 1185 to 1195, and again in 1203-4, who came to the
                    throne in the manner described under <hi rend="smallcaps">Andronicus</hi> I.
                    (vol. ii. p. 23), succeeded also to the unfinished Sicilian war. The favourable
                    close of that was counterbalanced by the failure of an attempt to recover
                    Cyprus, where Isaac Comnenus had established an independent throne. Of the
                    numerous revolts excited during Isaac’s reign by his vices and incapacity, the
                    most serious was the rebellion of the Bulgarians and Wallachians between Mount
                    Haemus and the Danube, which, breaking out in 1186, resulted in the independence
                    of a second Bulgarian kingdom. Alexis Branas, the general sent against the
                    rebels in 1187, after temporarily repulsing them, treacherously turned his arms
                    against his master, and, leading his troops to Constantinople, attempted to
                    seize the city. There he met with more resistance than Isaac’s vices had led him
                    to expect, and in the ensuing battle was defeated and slain. After a
                    hastily-arranged truce with the Bulgarians, the emperor’s attention was next
                    demanded in the east, where several claimants to the throne successively rose
                    and fell. In 1189 Frederick Barbarossa of Germany sought and obtained leave to
                    lead his troops on the third crusade through the Byzantine territory; but he had
                    no sooner crossed the border than the wily and treacherous Greek, who had
                    meanwhile sought an alliance with Saladin, threw every impediment in his way,
                    and was only by force of arms compelled to fulfil his engagements. The next five
                    years were disturbed by fresh rebellions of the Wallachians, against whom Isaac
                    led several expeditions in person. During one of these, in 1195, Alexius, the
                    emperor’s brother, taking advantage of the latter’s absence from camp on a
                    hunting expedition, proclaimed himself emperor, and was joyfully hailed by the
                    soldiers, who heartily despised the craven vices of their late emperor. Isaac
                    was seized; his eyes were put out, and he was imprisoned in a lonely tower at
                    Constantinople. It has already been related <hi rend="smallcaps">(Crusades,</hi>

                    dungeon to his throne once more. But both mind and body had been enfeebled by
                    captivity, and his son Alexius IV. was the actual monarch. Isaac’s feeble hold
                    on life was loosened by the turmoil which followed the restoration,.</p>

                <p>and he died in 1204. He was one of the weakest and most vicious princes that ever
                    occupied the Byzantine throne. His father had been censured as a general for
                    cowardice, and Isaac II. seems to have inherited a full share of the paternal
                    failing, which his connexion on the mother’s side with the Comnenian family had
                    not counteracted. He was vain, superstitious, and sensual; and, while he
                    neglected the duties of his lofty position, ho abandoned himself to all the
                    pleasures which it commanded. Surrounded by a crowd of slaves, mistresses, and
                    flatterers, he permitted his empire to be administered by unworthy favourites,
                    while he squandered the vast sums of money wrung from his unhappy provinces on
                    costly buildings and expensive gifts to the churches of his metropolis. It is
                    little to be wondered at that his cowardice and vice stirred up numerous rivals,
                    who sought to emulate the ease with which a creature so worthless had obtained
                    an empire.</p>
