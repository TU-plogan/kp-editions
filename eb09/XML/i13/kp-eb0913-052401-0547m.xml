                    South America, occurring chiefly on the banks of the river Magdalena, Colombia,
                    always found in damp localities, not only, however, on the lower coast region as
                    in Darien, but also at a considerable elevation above the sea. It is mostly
                    found in separate groves, not mixed with other trees or shrubs, and where
                    travellers tell us even herbs are rarely met with, “the ground appearing as if
                    it had been swept.” The plant is severally known as the “Tagua” by the Indians
                    on the banks of the Magdalena, as the “Anta” on the coast of Darien, and as the
                    “Pullipunta” and “Homero” in Peru. It is a stemless or caulescent palmlike
                    plant, the top of which is crowned with from twelve to twenty very long
                    pinnatifid leaves. The plants are dioecious, the males forming higher, more
                    erect, and robust trunks than the females. The male inflorescence is in the form
                    of a simple fleshy cylindrical spadix covered with flowers; the female flowers
                    are also in a single spadix, which, however, is shorter than in the male. The
                    fruit consists of a conglomerated head composed of six or seven drupes, each
                    containing from six to nine seeds, and the whole being enclosed in a walled
                    woody covering forming altogether a globular head as large as that of a man. A
                    single plant sometimes bears at the same time from six to eight of these large
                    heads of fruit, each weighing from 20 to 25 lb. In its very young state the seed
                    contains a clear insipid fluid, which travellers take advantage of to allay
                    thirst. As it gets older this fluid becomes milky and of a sweet taste, and it
                    gradually continues to change both in taste and consistence until it becomes so
                    hard as to make it valuable as a substitute for animal ivory. In their young and
                    fresh state the fruits are eaten with avidity by bears, hogs, and other animals.
                    The seeds, or nuts as they are usually called when fully ripe and hard, are used
                    by the American Indians for making small ornamental articles and toys. They are

                    name of “Corozo” nuts, a name by which the fruits of some species of <hi
                    rend="italic">Attalea</hi> are known in Central America,—their uses being
                    chiefly for small articles of turnery. The question of the position of this
                    plant in the vegetable kingdom is one upon which botanists have been much
                    divided. The plant has at different times occupied the attention of such
                    well-known botanical authorities as Ruiz and Pavon, who gave to it its
                    scientific name of <hi rend="italic">Phytelephas macrocarpa,</hi> and of
                    Martius, Morren, Humboldt, Bonpland, Spruce, and others, by whom it has been
                    considered respectively to be near to the <hi rend="italic">Palmeae</hi> or the
