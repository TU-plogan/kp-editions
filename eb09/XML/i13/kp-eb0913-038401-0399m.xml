                    interior of Asia Minor, bounded by Mount Taurus and Cilicia on the S., by
                    Lycaonia on the E., by Phrygia on the N., and by Pisidia on the W. Like the
                    neighbouring Lycaonia, it consisted in great part of a cold and barren upland

                    of freebooters, owing merely a nominal allegiance to either the Persian or the
                    Macedonian monarchy. The only occasion on which they come prominently forward in
                    history was during the war of the Cilician and other pirates against Rome, in
                    which they took so active a part that the proconsul P. Servilius deemed it
                    necessary to follow them into their mountain fastnesses, and compelled the whole
                    people to submission, an exploit for which he received the title of Isauricus
                    (75 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.).</hi> They were afterwards placed for a time
                    under the rule of Amyntas, king of Galatia; but it is evident that they always
                    continued to retain their predatory habits and their virtual independence; and
                    under the Roman empire they gave so much trouble that it was ultimately agreed
                    to leave them in the undisturbed possession of their inaccessible mountain
                    homes. In the 4th century they are still described by Ammianus Marcellinus as
                    the scourge of the neighbouring provinces of Asia Minor; but they are said to
                    have been effectually subdued in the reign of Justinian.</p>
                <p>From the nature of the countιy Isauria contained but very few towns, the most
                    important of which bore the name of Isaura, as the capital of the district. It
                    was rebuilt by Amyntas, and extensive remains of it are still visible at a place
                    called Zengi Bor. Carallia, which seems to have been included in the province,
                    and was noted as giving name to the Lake Caralitis, was situated farther north.
                    This lake, now known as the Kereli Göl, is a considerable sheet of water; it
                    communicates by the river called Bei Sechr with a lesser lake called by Strabo
                    Trogitis, now known as Soghla Göl; both are perfectly fresh. The boundary of
                    Isauria and Lycaonia seems to have been always unsettled. Strabo indeed speaks
                    of Isauria as a part of Lycaonia, but it is certain that they were separate
                    districts for administrative purposes, though their limits cannot be accurately
                    defined. Of the ethnographical character or origin of the Isaurians we know
                    nothing.</p>

                    Byzantine emperor. The first of these, Zeno, in the 5th century (474-495 A.D.),
                    was not calculated to reflect any lustre on his native country; but at a later
                    period Leo III., who ascended the throne of Constantinople in 718, and reigned
                    till 741, was a monarch of vigour and capacity, and became the founder of a
                    dynasty which ruled over the empire for three generations.</p>
