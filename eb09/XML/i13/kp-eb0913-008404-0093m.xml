                    to 1406, was a native of Solmona in the Abruzzi, and early distinguished himself
                    by his learning both in civil and in canon law. By Urban VI. he was called to
                    the papal court, and entrusted with various responsible offices, being finally
                    promoted to the archbishopric of Ravenna, and afterwards to the bishopric of
                    Bologna. Boniface IX. made him cardinal, and employed him as legate in several
                    delicate and important missions. On the death of Boniface, Migliorati was
                    unanimously chosen (October 17, <pb break="no"

                    had bound himself by a solemn obligation to employ all lawful means for the
                    restoration of the church’s unity in the event of his election, and even to
                    resign the papal dignity should that be considered necessary to this end. The
                    election was resisted at Rome by the Ghibelline party, but peace was maintained
                    by the aid of Ladislaus of Naples, who thus laid Innocent under embarrassing
                    obligations, from which he freed himself at the earliest possible moment. The
                    assassination of some leading members of the city party by Ludovico Migliorati
                    (a nephew of Innocent) and his friends compelled the pope to take refuge, in
                    August 1405, at Viterbo, whence he did not return until January of the following
                    year. These troubles furnished him with a pretext, of which he was not unwilling
                    to avail himself, for postponing the meeting of a general council which was
                    urged by Charles of France, the university of Paris, Rupert of Germany, and John
                    of Castile, as the only means of healing the schism which had prevailed so long.
                    It is hardly necessary to say that he showed no favour to the proposal that he
                    as well as the antipope Benedict XIII. should resign in the interests of peace.
                    He died somewhat suddenly at Rome on November 6, 1406; there is no evidence for
                    the truth of the allegation that his death was not due to natural causes. His
                    successor was Gregory XII.</p>
