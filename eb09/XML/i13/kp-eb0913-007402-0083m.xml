                    taking portraits, or obtained an engagement as a violin player. He brought up
                    his son to command the same varied resources, but in consequence of certain
                    early successes—the lad’s performance of a concerto of Viotti’s was applauded at
                    the theatre of Toulouse—his attention was directed chiefly to the study of
                    music. At Toulouse, to which place his father had removed from Montauban in
                    1792, Ingres had, however, received lessons from Joseph Roques, a painter, whom
                    he quitted at the end of a few months to become a pupil of Μ. Vigan, professor
                    at the academy of fine arts in the same town. From M Vigan, Ingres, whose
                    vocation became day by day more distinctly evident, passed to Μ. Briant, a
                    landscape-painter who insisted that his pupil was specially gifted by nature to
                    follow the same line as himself. For a while Ingres obeyed, but he had been
                    thoroughly aroused and enlightened as to his own objects and desires by the
                    sight of a copy of Raphael’s Madonna della Sedia, and, having decisively ended
                    his connexion with Briant, he started for Paris, where he arrived about the
                    close of 1796. He was then admitted to the studio of David, for whose lofty
                    standard and severe principles he always retained a profound appreciation. David
                    recognized the merit of one who soon ranked amongst his most promising pupils,
                    and Ingres, after four years of devoted study, in the course of which (1800) he
                    obtained the second place in the yearly competition, finally carried off the
                    Grand Prix (1801). The work thus rewarded—the Ambassadors of Agamemnon in the
                    Tent of Achilles (École des Beaux Arts)—was admired by Flaxman so much as to
                    give umbrage to David, and was succeeded in the following year (1802) by the
                    execution of a Girl after Bathing, and a woman’s portrait; in 1804 Ingres
                    exhibited Portrait of the First Consul (Musée de Liége), and portraits of his
                    father and himself; these were followed in 1806 by Portrait of the Emperor
                    (Invalides), and portraits of M., Mme., and Mdlle. Rivière (the first two now in
                    the Louvre). All these and various minor works were executed in Paris, for it
                    was not until <pb break="no"

                    the reestablishment of the Academy of France at Rome, and we find from the
                    journals of the day that they produced a disturbing impression on the public. It
                    was clear that the artist was some one who must be counted with; his talent, the
                    purity of his line, and his power of literal rendering were generally
                    acknowledged; but he was reproached with a desire to be singular and
                    extraordinary. “Ingres,” writes Frau V. Hastier <hi rend="italic">(Lehen
                    und</hi><hi rend="italic">Kunst in Paris,</hi> 1806) “wird nach Italien gehen,
                    und dort wird er vielleicht vergessen dass er zu etwas Grossem geboren ist, und
                    wird eben darum ein hohes Ziel erreichen.” In this spirit, also, Chaussard
                    violently attacked his Portrait of the Emperor <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Ρausaηiccs</hi><hi rend="italic">Français,</hi> 1806), nor did the portraits
                    of the Rivière family escape. The points on which Chaussard justly lays stress
                    are the strange discordances of colour,—such as the blue of the cushion against
                    which Mme. Rivière· leans, and the want of the relief and warmth of life, but he
                    omits to touch on that grasp of his subject as a whole, shown in the portraits
                    of both husband and wife, which already evidences the strength and sincerity of
                    the passionless point of view which marks all Ingres’s best productions. The
                    very year after his arrival in Rome (1808) Ingres produced CEdipus and the
                    Sphinx (Louvre; lithographed by Sudre, engraved by Gaillard), a work which
                    proved him in the full possession of his mature powers, and began the Venus
                    Anadyomene (Collection Rieset; engraving begun by Pollet), completed forty years
                    later, and exhibited in 1855. These works were followed by some of his best
                    portraits, that of M. Bochet (Louvre), and that of Mme. la Comtesse de Tournon,
                    mother of the prefect of the department of the Tiber; in 1811 he finished
                    Jupiter and Thetis, an immense canvas now in the Musée of Aix; in 1812 Romulus
                    and Acron (École des Beaux Arts), and Virgil reading the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Aeneid</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi> a composition very different from the
                    version of it which has become widely popular through the engraving executed by
                    Pradier in 1832. The original work, executed for a bedchamber in the Villa
                    Aldobrandini-Miollis, contained neither the figures of Maecenas and Agrippa nor
                    the statue of Marcellus; and Ingres, who had obtained possession of it during
                    his second stay in Rome, intended to complete it with the additions made for
                    engraving. But he never got beyond the stage of preparation, and the picture
                    left by him, together with various other studies and sketches, to the Musée of
                    his native town, remains half destroyed by the process meant for its
                    regeneration. The Virgil was followed by the Betrothal of Raphael, a small
                    painting, now lost, executed for Queen Caroline of Naples; Don Pedro of Toledo
                    Kissing the Sword of Henry IV. (Collection Deymié; Montauban), exhibited at the
                    Salon of 1814, together with the Chapelle Sistine (Collection Legentil;
                    lithographed by Sudre), and the Grande Odalisque (Collection Seillière;
                    lithographed by Sudre). In 1815 Ingres executed Raphael and the Fornarina
                    (Collection Mme. N. de Rothschild; engraved by Pradier); in 1816 Aretin and the
                    Envoy of Charles V. (Collection Schroth), and Aretin and Tintoret (Collection
                    Schroth); in 1817 the Death of Leonardo (engraved by Richomme) and Henry IV.
                    Playing with his Children (engraved by Richomme), both of which works were
                    commissions from M. le Comte de Blacas, then ambassador of France at the
                    Vatican. Roger and Angelique (Louvre; lithographed by Sudre), and Francesca di
                    Rimini (Musée of Angers; lithographed by Aubry Lecomte), were completed in 1819,
                    and followed in 1820 by Christ giving the Keys to Peter (Louvre). In 1815, also,
                    Ingres had made many projects for treating a subject from the life of the
                    celebrated duke of Alva, a commission from the family, but a loathing for “cet
                    horrible homme” grew upon him, and finally he abandoned the task and entered in
                    his diary—“J’étais forcé par la nécessité de peindre un pareil tableau; Dieu a
                    voulu qu’il restât en ébauche.” During all these years Ingres’s reputation in
                    France did not increase. The interest which his Chapelle Sistine had aroused at
                    the Salon of 1814 soon died away; not only was the public indifferent, but
                    amongst his brother artists Ingres found scant recognition. The strict
                    classicists looked upon him as a renegade, and strangely enough Delacroix and
                    other pupils of Guérin—the very leaders of that romantic movement for which
                    Ingres, throughout his long life, always expressed the deepest abhorrence— alone
                    seem to have been sensible of his ·. .erits. The weight of poverty too was hard
                    to bear. In 1813 Ingres had married; his marriage had been arranged for him with
                    a young woman who came in a business-like way from Montauban, on the strength of
                    the representations of her friends in Rome to whom the painter was well known.
                    Mme. Ingres speedily acquired a faith in her husband which enabled her to combat
                    with heroic courage and patience the difficulties which beset their common
                    existence, and which were increased by their removal to Florence. There
                    Bartolini, an old friend, had hoped that Ingres might have materially bettered
                    his position, and that he might have aroused the Florentine school—a weak
                    offshoot from that of David—to a sense of its own shortcomings. These
                    expectations were disappointed. The good offices of Bartolini, and of one or two
                    persons who felt a friendly interest in the painter, could only alleviate the
                    miseries of this stay in a town where Ingres was all but wholly deprived of the
                    means of at least gaining daily bread by the making of those small portraits for
                    the execution of which, in Rome, his pencil had been constantly in request.
                    Before his departure he had, however, been commissioned to paint for Μ. de
                    Pastoret the Entry of Charles V. into Paris, and Μ. de Pastoret now obtained an
                    order for Ingres from the Administration of Fine Arts; he was directed to treat
                    the Voeu de Louis ΧΙΠ. for the cathedral of Montauban. This work, which was
                    exhibited at the Salon of 1824, met with universal approbation: even those sworn
                    to observe the unadulterated precepts of David found only admiration for the
                    Voeu de Louis XIΠ. On his return Ingres was received at Montauban with
                    enthusiastic homage, and found himself celebrated throughout France. In the
                    following year (1825) he was elected to the Institute, and his fame was further
                    extended in 1826 by the publication of Sudre’s lithograph of the Grande
                    Odalisque, which, having been scorned by artists and critics alike in 1819, now
                    became widely popular. A second commission from the Government called forth the
                    Apotheosis of Homer, which, replaced by a copy in the decoration of the ceiling
                    for which it was designed, now hangs in the galleries of the second story of the
                    Louvre. From this date up till 1834 the studio of Ingres was thronged, as once
                    had been thronged the studio of David, and he was a recognized <hi rend="italic"
                    >chef T école.</hi> Whilst he taught with despotic authority, and admirable
                    wisdom, he steadily worked; and when in 1834 he produced his great canvas of the
                    Martyrdom of Saint Symphorien (cathedral of Autun; lithographed by
                    Trichot-Garneri), it was with angry disgust and resentment that he found his
                    work received with the same doubt and indifference, if not the same hostility,
                    as had met his earlier ventures. The suffrages of his pupils, and of one or two
                    men—like Decamps—of undoubted ability, could not soften the sense of injury.
                    Ingres resolved to work no longer for the <hi rend="superscript"> -</hi> public,
                    and gladly availed himself of the opportunity to return to Rome, as director of
                    the Ecole de France, in the room of Horace Vernet. There he executed La Vierge à
                    1’Hostie (Imperial collections, St Petersburg), Stratonice (Duc d’Aumale),
                    Portrait of Cherubini (Louvre), and the Petite Odalisque for Μ. Marcotte, the
                    faithful admirer for whom, in 1814, Ingres had painted the Chapelle Sistine.</p>

                <p>The Stratonice, executed for the duke of Orleans, had been exhibited at the
                    Palais Royal for several days after its arrival in France, and the beauty of the
                    composition produced so favourable an impression that, on his return to Paris in
                    1841, Ingres found himself received with all the deference that he felt to be
                    his due. A portrait of the purchaser of Stratonice was one of the first works
                    executed after this return; and Ingres shortly afterwards began the decorations
                    of the great hall in the Château de Dampierre, which, unfortunately for the
                    reputation of the painter, were begun with an ardour which gradually slackened,
                    until in 1849 Ingres, having been further discouraged by the irreparable loss of
                    his faithful and courageous wife, abandoned all hope of their completion, and
                    the contract with the Due de Luynes was finally cancelled. A minor work, Jupiter
                    and Antiope, marks the year 1851, but Ingres’s next considerable undertaking
                    (1853) was the Apotheosis of Napoleon I., painted for the ceiling of a hall in
                    the Hôtel de Ville; Jeanne d’Arc (Louvre) appeared in 1854; and in 1855 Ingres
                    consented to rescind the resolution more or less strictly kept since 1834, in
                    favour of the International Exhibition, where a room was wholly reserved for his
                    works. In consequence of the effect which they produced, Prince Napoleon,
                    president of the jury, proposed an exceptional recompense for their author, and
                    obtained from the emperor Ingres’s nomination as grand officer of the Legion of
                    Honour. With renewed confidence Ingres now took up and completed one of his most
                    charming productions—La Source (Louvre), a figure of which he had painted the
                    torso in 1823, and which seen with other works in London (1862) there renewed
                    the general sentiment of admiration, and procured him, from the imperial
                    government, the dignity of senator. After the completion of La Source, the
                    principal works produced by Ingres were with one or two exceptions (Molière and
                    Louis XIV., presented to the Théâtre Français, 1858; Le Bain Turc, 1859), of a
                    religious character; La Vierge de l’Adoption, 1858 (painted for Mdlle.
                    Roland-Gosselin), was followed by La Vierge Couronnée (painted for Mme. la
                    Baronne de Larinthie) and La Vierge aux Enfans (Collection Blanc); in 1859 these
                    were followed by repetitions of La Vierge à l’Hostie; and in 1862 Ingres
                    completed Christ and the Doctors (Musée Montauban), a work commissioned many
                    years before by Queen Marie Amélie for the chapel of Bizy. On the 14th January
                    1867 Ingres died, in his eighty-eighth year, having preserved his faculties in
                    wonderful perfection to the last. For a moment only—at the time of the execution
                    of the Bain Turc, which Prince Napoleon was fain to exchange for an early
                    portrait of the master by himself— Ingres’s powers had seemed to fail, but he
                    recovered, and showed in his last years the vigour which marked his early
                    maturity. It is, however, to be noted that the Saint Symphorien exhibited in
                    1834 closes the list of the works on which his reputation will chiefly rest; for
                    La Source, which at first sight seems to be an exception, was painted, all but
                    the head and the extremities, in 1821; and from those who knew the work well in
                    its incomplete state we learn that the after-painting, necessary to fuse new and
                    old, lacked the vigour, the precision, and the something like touch which
                    distinguished the original execution of the torso. Touch was not, indeed, at any
                    time a means of expression on which Ingres seriously calculated: his constant
                    employment of local tint, in mass but faintly modelled in light by half tones,
                    forbade recourse to the shifting effects of colour and light on which the
                    Romantic school depended in indicating those fleeting aspects of things which
                    they rejoiced to put on canvas;—their methods would have disturbed the
                    calculations of an art wholly based on form and line. Except in his Sistine
                    Chapel, and one or two slighter pieces, Ingres kept himself free from any
                    preoccupation as to depth and force of colour and tone; driven, probably by the
                    excesses of the Romantic movement into an attitude of stricter protest, “ce que
                    Γon sait” he would repeat, “il faut le savoir l’épée à la main.” Ingres left
                    himself, therefore, in dealing with crowded compositions, such as the Apotheosis
                    of Homer and the Martyrdom of Saint Symphorien, without the means of producing
                    the necessary unity of effect which had actually been employed in due measure—as
                    the Stanze of the Vatican bear witness— by the very master whom he most deeply
                    reverenced. Thus it came to pass that in subjects of one or two figures Ingres
                    showed to the greatest advantage: in Oedipus, in the Girl after Bathing, the
                    Odalisque, and La Source—subjects only animated by the consciousness of perfect
                    physical wellbeing—we find Ingres at his best. One hesitates to put Roger and
                    Angelique upon this list, for though the female figure shows the finest
                    qualities of Ingres’s work,—deep study of nature in her purest forms, perfect
                    sincerity of intention and power of mastering an ideal conception,—yet side by
                    side with these the effigy of Roger on his hippogriff bears witness that from
                    the passionless point of view, which, as before said, was Ingres’s birthright,
                    the weird creatures of the fancy cannot be seen. A graphic account of “Ingres,
                    sa vie et ses travaux,” and a complete catalogue of his works, were published by
                    M. Delaborde in 1870, and dedicated to Mme. Ingres <hi rend="italic">née</hi>
