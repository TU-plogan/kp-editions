                    captain in Sir Robert Pye’s regiment. Shortly before the battle of Naseby, in
                    June 1645, he was promoted to a colonelcy, and on the eve of the battle he was
                    on the suggestion of Cromwell made commissary-general and appointed to the
                    command of the left wing, Cromwell himself commanding the right. The wing under
                    Ireton was completely broken by the impetuous charge of Rupert, and Ireton was
                    taken prisoner, but after the rout of the enemy which ensued on the successful
                    charge of Cromwell he regained his freedom. He was present at the siege of
                    Bristol in the September following, and he took an active part in the subsequent
                    victorious campaign which resulted in the overthrow of the royal cause. While
                    occupied with the siege of Oxford he was, in June 15, 1646, married at Holton
                    House, 5 miles distant from the city—and at that time probably the headquarters
                    of Fairfax—to Bridget, daughter of Oliver Cromwell. In the negotiations of the
                    army with the Parliament, and in the conferences with the king, he took a
                    leading part, being the person chiefly entrusted with the drawing up of the army
                    papers, including the heads of proposals from the army to the king, a task for
                    which he possessed the special qualifications of “a subtle-working brain” and a
                    complete legal training. He is said to have been one of the principal
                    instigators of the trial of the king, and was one of the most zealous supporters
                    of his execution. The regiment of Ireton having been chosen by lot to accompany
                    Cromwell in his Irish campaign, Ireton was appointed major-general; and on the
                    recall of his chief to take the command in Scotland he remained with the title
                    and powers of lord-deputy to complete the work of reduction. This he proceeded
                    to do with his usual energy, and as much by the severity of his methods of
                    punishment as by his military skill was rapidly bringing his task to a close,
                    when during the siege of Limerick he died, November 26, 1651, of an inflammatory
                    fever, the result in all probability of exhaustion and exposure. His loss
                    “struck a great sadness into Cromwell,” and perhaps there was no one of the
                    Parliamentary leaders who could have been less spared. He is said to have been
                    of “melancholic, reserved, dark temperament;” and, while ho possessed very high
                    abilities as a soldier and great political penetration and insight, he resembled
                    in stern unflinchingness of purpose the Protector himself.</p>
                <p>1RIARTE, or <hi rend="smallcaps">Yriarte, Tomas de</hi> (1750-1791), Spanish poet
                    of the age of Charles III., was born September 18, 1750, at Orotava in the
                    island of Teneriffe, and received his literary education at Madrid under the
                    care of his uncle, Juan de Iriarte, a scholar who for forty years was head of
                    the royal library, and whose name as a collector of proverbs still finds a place
                    in the literary annals of his country. In his eighteenth year the nephew began
                    his literary career by translating French plays for the royal theatre, and in
                    1770, under the anagram of Tirso Imarete, he published an original comedy
                    entitled <hi rend="italic">Hacer</hi><hi rend="italic">que</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >kacemos.</hi> In the following year he received an appointment as official
                    translator in the foreign office, and in 1776 he became a ’keeper of the records
                    in the war department. For a short time he now edited a journal entitled the <hi
                    rend="italic">Mercurio Politico,</hi> and during this period of his life he
                    added to the number of his original dramas (the best of these being <hi
                    rend="italic">La Sehoriia</hi><hi rend="italic">mal</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >criada),</hi> and also composed various minor poems. In 1780 appeared his
                    didactic poem <hi rend="italic">La</hi><hi rend="italic">Musica,</hi> the
                    outcome of his proficiency in music, which attracted some attention in Italy and
                    France as well as at home. It is composed in those masses of irregular lines
                    known nationally as <hi rend="italic">silυas,</hi> and consists'of five books
                    which severally treat of the elements of music, the various kinds of musical
                    expression, the music of the theatre, of society, and of solitude. Its poetical
                    merit is very small. In 1782 appeared the <hi rend="italic">Fdbulαs
                    Literarias,</hi> with which his name is most intimately associated. The work is
                    of interest to the student of Spanish literature as being the first original
                    attempt at fable-writing in that language; the stories, which numbered in the
                    first edition about sixty and afterwards increased to eighty, are composed in a
                    great variety of metres, and show in many cases considerable ingenuity
                    (sometimes, it must be confessed, very far-fetched) and careful execution. As
                    their name is intended to imply, they all relate to the follies and weaknesses
                    of literary men. They have been translated into several European languages. An
                    English version by Rockliffe reached a third edition in 1866. During his later
                    years, partly rn consequence of the <hi rend="italic">Fabulas,</hi> he became
                    involved in troubles with several of his literary contemporaries; and in 1786 he
                    was charged before the Inquisition with having manifested leanings towards the
                    new French philosophy. He died September 17, 1791.</p>
                <p>The first collected edition of his works (Oδrαs), prepared by himself, appeared
                    at Madrid in six volumes in 1787; another, more complete, in eight volumes, in
                    1805. They include, besides those already mentioned, translations of the <hi
                    rend="italic">Λrs Pocticα</hi> of Horace and of the first four books of the <hi
                    rend="italic">Aencid,</hi> and also some metrical epistles.</p>
