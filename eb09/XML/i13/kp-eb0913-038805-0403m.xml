                    rend="smallcaps">b.c.,</hi> seven years before Plato. His father Theodorus was
                    an Athenian citizen of the deme of Erchia,—the same in which, about 431 <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">b,c.,</hi> Xenophon was born,—and was sufficiently wealthy to
                    have served the state as choregus. The fact that he possessed slaves skilled in
                    the trade of flute-making perhaps lends point to a passage in which his son is
                    mentioned by the comic poet Strattis.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    292.</p></note> Several popular “sophists” are named as teachers of the young
                    Isocrates. Like other sons of prosperous parents, he may have been trained in
                    such grammatical subtleties as were taught by Protagoras or Prodicus, and
                    initiated by Theramenes into the florid rhetoric of Gorgias, with whom at a
                    later time (about 390 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.)</hi> he was in personal
                    intercourse. He tells us that his father had been careful to provide for him the
                    best education which Athens could afford. A fact of greater interest is
                    disclosed by Plato’s <hi rend="italic">Phaedrus.</hi> “Isocrates is still young,
                    Phaedrus,” says the Socrates of that dialogue, “but I do not mind telling you
                    what I prophesy of him. . . . . It would not surprise me if, as years go on he
                    should make all his predecessors seem like children in the kind of oratory to
                    which he is now addressing himself, or if—supposing this should not content
                    him—some divine impulse should lead him to greater things. My dear Phaedrus, a
                    certain philosophy is inborn in him.” This conversation is dramatically supposed
                    to take place about 410 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> It is unnecessary to
                    discuss here the date at which the <hi rend="italic">Phaedrus</hi> was actually
                    composed. From the passage just cited it is at least clear that there had been a
                    time—while Isocrates could still be called “young ”—at which Plato had formed a
                    high estimate of his powers.</p>
                <p>Isocrates took no active part in the public life of Athens; he was not fitted, as
                    he tells us, for the contests of the popular assembly or of the law-courts. He
                    lacked strength of voice,—a fatal defect in the ecclesia, when an audience of
                    many thousands was to be addressed in the open air; he was also deficient in
                    “boldness” (τόλμα). He was, in short, the physical opposite of the successful
                    Athenian demagogue in the generation after that of Pericles; by temperament as
                    well as taste he was more in sympathy with the sedate decorum (εΰκοσμία) of an
                    older school. Two ancient biographers have, however, preserved a story which, if
                    true, would show that this lack of voice and nerve did not involve any want of
                    moral courage. During the rule of the Thirty Tyrants, Critias denounced
                    Theramenes, who sprang for safety to the sacred hearth of the council chamber.
                    Isocrates alone, it is said, dared at that moment to plead for the life of bis
                    friend.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>[Plut.] <hi

                    biographer. Dionysius does not mention the story, though he makes Isocrates a
                    pupil of Theramenes.</p></note> Whatever may be the worth of the story, it would
                    scarcely have connected itself with the name of a man to whose traditional
                    character it was repugnant. While the Thirty were still in power, Isocrates
                    withdrew from Athens to Chios.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>Some would refer the sojourn of Isocrates at Chios to the

                    will be found in Jebb’s <hi rend="italic">Attic Orators,</hi> vol. ii. p. 6,

                    War— doubtless in the troubles which attended on its close—he lost the whole of
                    that private fortune which had enabled his father to serve the state, and that
                    he then adopted the profession of a teacher. The proscription of the “art of
                    words” by the Thirty would thus have given him a special motive for withdrawing
                    from Athens. He returned thither, apparently, either soon before or soon after
                    the restoration of the democracy in 403 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi></p>
                <p>For ten years from this date he was occupied—at least occasionally—as a writer of
                    speeches for the Athenian law-courts. Six of these speeches are extant. The
                    earliest (Or. xxi.) may be referred to 403 B.c.; the latest (Or. xix.) to 394-93
                    <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> This was a department of his own work which
                    Isocrates afterwards preferred to ignore. Nowhere, indeed, does he say that he
                    had not written forensic speeches. But he frequently uses a tone from which that
                    inference might be drawn. He loves to contrast such petty concerns as engage the
                    forensic writer with those larger <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit13newyrich/page/n404/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0913-0404-0389"/> and nobler themes which are treated by the
                    politician. This helps to explain what would otherwise be startling. Not long
                    after his death it could be asserted—by his adopted son, Aphareus—that he had
                    written nothing for the law-courts. Whether the assertion was due to false shame
                    or merely to ignorance, Dionysius of Halicarnassus decisively disposes of it.
                    Aristotle had, indeed, he says, exaggerated the number of forensic speeches
                    written by Isocrates; but some of those which bore his name were unquestionably
                    genuine, as was attested by one of the orator’s own pupils, Cephisodorus. The
                    doubt would not, indeed, have been even plausible, had not Isocrates frequently
                    spoken of such work with the aversion of one who would gladly forget, if he
                    could, a distasteful episode of early life,—a mere prelude to those labours of
                    riper age in which he afterwards found his delight and his reward.</p>
                <p>The real vocation of Isocrates was discovered from the moment that he devoted
                    himself to the work of a teacher and a writer. The instruction which Isocrates
                    undertook to impart was based on rhetorical composition, but it was by no means
                    merely rhetorical. That “inborn philosophy,” of which Plato recognized the germ,
                    still shows itself. In many of his works—notably in the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Panegyricus</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi> we see a really remarkable power of
                    grasping a complex subject, of articulating it distinctly, of treating it, not
                    merely with effect, but luminously, at once in its widest bearings and in its
                    most intricate details. Young men could learn more from Isocrates than the
                    graces of style; nor would his success have been what it was if his skill had
                    been confined to the art of expression.</p>
                <p>It was about 392 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> —when he was forty-four—that he
                    opened his school at Athens near the Lyceum, and to the end of his life he
                    continued to teach as well as to write. In 339 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> he
                    describes himself as revising the <hi rend="italic">Panathenaiσιιs</hi> with
                    some of his pupils; he was then ninety-seven. The celebrity enjoyed by the
                    school of Isocrates is strikingly attested by ancient writers. Cicero describes
                    it as that school in which the eloquence of all Greece was trained and
                    perfected: its disciples were “brilliant in pageant or in battle,”<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Partim in pompa, partim in
                    acie illustres.— <hi rend="italic">De Orαt.,</hi> ii., § 94.</p></note> foremost
                    among the accomplished writers or powerful debaters of their time. The phrase of
                    Cicero is neither vague nor exaggerated. Among the literary pupils of Isocrates
                    might be named the historians Ephorus and Theopompus, the Attic archaeologist
                    Androtion, and Isocrates of Apollonia, who succeeded his master in the school.
                    Among the practical orators we have, in the forensic kind, Isaeus; in the
                    political, Leodamas of Acharnae, Lycurgus, and Hyperides. And these are but a
                    few names out of many. Hermippus of Smyrna (mentioned by Athenaeus) wrote a
                    monograph on the “Disciples of Isocrates.” And scanty as are now the sources for
                    such a catalogue, a modern scholar<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>Sanneg, <hi rend="italic">De</hi><hi rend="italic">Schola
                    Isocratea,</hi> Halle, 1867.</p></note> has still been able to recover forty-one
                    names. At the time when the school of Isocrates was in the zenith of its fame,
                    it drew disciples, not only from the shores and islands of the Aegean, but from
                    the cities of Sicily and the distant colonies of the Euxine. As became the image
                    of its master’s spirit, it was truly Panhellenic. When Mausolus, prince of
                    Caria, died in 351 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.,</hi> his widow Artemisia
                    instituted a contest of panegyrical eloquence in honour of his memory. The most
                    accomplished rhetoricians of Greece entered the lists at Halicarnassus; but
                    among all the competitors there was not one—if tradition may be trusted— who had
                    not been the pupil of Isocrates.</p>
                <p>Meanwhile the teacher who had won this great reputation had also been active as a
                    public writer. The most interesting and most characteristic works of Isocrates
                    are those in which he deals with the public questions of his own day.</p>
                <p>The influence which he thus exercised throughout Hellas might be compared to that
                    of an earnest political essayist gifted with a popular and attractive style. And
                    Isocrates had a dominant idea which gained strength with his years, until its
                    realization had become, we might say, the main purpose of his life. This idea
                    was the invasion of Asia by the united forces of Greece. The Greek cities were
                    at feud with each other, and were severally torn by intestine faction. Political
                    morality was become a rare and a somewhat despised distinction. Men who were
                    notoriously ready to sell their cities for their private gain were, as
                    Demosthenes says, rather admired than otherwise.<note anchored="true"

                    condition of Greece was becoming very unhappy. The wealth of the country had
                    ceased to grow; the gulf between rich and poor was becoming wider; party strife
                    was constantly adding to the number of homeless paupers; and Greece was full of
                    men who were ready to take service with any captain of mercenaries, or, failing
                    that, with any leader of desperadoes. Isocrates draws a vivid and terrible
                    picture of these evils. The cure for them, he firmly believed, was to unite the
                    Greeks in a cause which would excite a generous enthusiasm. Now was the time, he
                    thought, for that enterprise in which Xenophon’s comrades had virtually
                    succeeded, when the headlong rashness of young Cyrus threw away their reward
                    with his own life.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi

                    of the Ten Thousand: let united Greece attack it and it must go down at the

                    Greek society would be drafted into fertile homes beyond the Aegean.</p>
                <p>A bright vision; but where was the power whose spell was first to unite
                    discordant Greece, and, having united it, to direct its strength against Asia!
                    That was the problem. The first attempt of Isocrates to solve it is set forth in
                    his splendid <hi rend="italic">Panegyricus</hi> (380 <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >b.c.</hi>). Let Athens and Sparta lay aside their jealousies. Let them assume,
                    jointly, a leadership which might be difficult for either, but which would be
                    assured to both. That eloquent pleading failed. The next hope was to find some
                    one man equal to the task. Jason of Pherae, Dionysius the First of Syracuse,
                    Archidamus III., son of Agesilaus —each in turn rose as a possible leader of
                    Greece before the imagination of the old man who was still young in his
                    enthusiastic hope, and one after another they failed him. But now a greater than
                    any of these was appearing on the Hellenic horizon, and to this new luminary the
                    eyes of Isocrates were turned with eager anticipation. Who could lead united
                    Greece against Asia so fitly as the veritable representative of the Heraclidae,
                    the royal descendant of the Argive line,—a king of half-barbarians it is true,
                    but by race, as in spirit, a pure Hellene,—Philip of Macedon? We can still read
                    the words in which this fond faith clothed itself; the ardent appeal of
                    Isocrates to Philip is extant; and another letter shows that the belief of
                    Isocrates in Philip lasted at any rate down to the eve of Chaeronea.<note

                    Whether it survived that event is a doubtful point. The popular account of the
                    orator’s death ascribed it to th? mental shock which he received from the news
                    of Philip’s victory. He was at Athens, in the palaestra of Hippocrates, when the
                    tidings came. He repeated three verses in which Euripides names three foreign
                    conquerors of Greece— Dandus, Pelops, Cadmus—and four days later he died of <pb

                    -of Eli) seems to conceive the death of Isocrates as instantaneous—</p>

                    old man eloquent.</p>
                <p>Now the third of the letters which bears the name of Isocrates is addressed to
                    Philip, and appears to congratulate him on his victory at Chaeronea, as being an
                    event which will enable him to assume the leadership of Greece in a war against
                    Persia. Is the letter genuine? There is no evidence, external or internal,
                    against its authenticity, except its supposed inconsistency with the views of
                    Isocrates and with the tradition of his suicide. As to his views, those who have
                    studied them in his own writings will be disposed to question whether he would
                    have regarded Philip’s victory at Chaeronea as an irreparable disaster for
                    Greece. Undoubtedly he would have deplored the conflict between Philip and
                    Athens; but he would have divided the blame between the combatants. And, with
                    his old belief in Philip, he would probably have hoped, even after Chaeronea,
                    that the new position won by Philip would eventually prove compatible with the
                    independence of the Greek cities, while it would certainly promote the project
                    on which, as he was profoundly convinced, the ultimate welfare of Greece
                    depended,—a Panhellenic expedition against Persia.</p>
                <p>As to the tradition of his suicide, the only rational mode of reconciling it with
                    that letter is to suppose that Isocrates destroyed himself, not because Philip
                    had conquered, but because, after that event, he saw Athens still resolved to
                    resist. He might have felt that the moment was coming when duty to his native
                    city would be in sharp conflict with his loyalty to one whom he regarded as the
                    destined saviour of Greece; nor would he have been the only man who has
                    deliberately preferred death to the agony of a divided allegiance. We should be
                    rather disposed to ask how much weight is to be given to the tradition itself.
                    The earliest authority for it—Dionysius of Halicarnassus in the age of Augustus—
                    may have had older sources; granting, however, that these may have remounted
                    even to the end of the 4th century B.C., that would not prove much. Ancient
                    biography usually contained a large alloy of unsifted popular gossip; in
                    particular it is strongly marked by a tendency to invent striking coincidences,
                    or to adorn such as had actually occurred. Suppose that Isocrates—being then
                    ninetyeight, and an invalid—had happened to die from natural causes a few days
                    after the battle of Chaeronea. Nothing could have originated more easily than a
                    story that he killed himself from intense chagrin. Everyone knew that Isocrates
                    had believed in Philip; and most people would have thought that Chaeronea was a
                    crushing refutation of that belief. Once started, the legend would have been
                    sure to live, not merely because it was picturesque, but also because it served
                    to accentuate the contrast between the false prophet and the true,—between
                    Isocrates and Demosthenes; and Demosthenes was very justly the national idol of
                    the age which followed the loss of Greek independence.<note anchored="true"

                <p>Isocrates is said to have taught his Athenian pupils gratuitously, and to have
                    taken money only from aliens; but, as might have been expected, the fame of his
                    school exposed him to attacks on the ground of his gains, which his enemies
                    studiously exaggerated. After the financial reform of 378 B.C., he was one of
                    those 1200 richest citizens who constituted the twenty unions <hi rend="italic"
                    >(σvμpoplaT)</hi> for the assessment of the war-tax <hi rend="italic"
                    >(elσφopa).</hi> He had discharged several public services (λeιτoυpγtαι); in
                    particular, he had thrice served as trierarch. He married Plathane, the widow of
                    the “sophist” Hippias of Elis, and then adopted her son Aphareus, afterwards
                    eminent as a rhetorician and a tragic poet. In 355 <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >b.c.</hi> he had his first and only lawsuit. A certain Megaclides challenged
                    him to undertake the trierarchy, or exchange properties. This was the lawsuit
                    which suggested the form of the discourse which he calls the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Antidosis</hi> (“exchange of properties”—353 <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >b.c.</hi>)—his defence of his professional life.</p>
                <p>He was buried on a rising ground near the Cynosarges, •—a temenos of Heracles,
                    with a gymnasion, on the east side of Athens, outside the Diomeian gate. His
                    tomb was surmounted by a column some 45 feet high, crowned with the figure of a
                    siren, the symbol of persuasion and of death. A tablet of stone, near the
                    column, represented a group of which Gorgias was the centre; his pupil Isocrates
                    stood at his side. Aphareus erected a statue to his adopted father near the
                    Olympieion. Timotheus, the illustrious son of Conon, dedicated another in the
                    temple of Eleusis.</p>
                <p>It was a wonderful century which the life of one man had thus all but spanned,—a
                    century fuller than any other that could be named of great events both in the
                    political and in the intellectual life of Greece. Isocrates had reached early
                    manhood when the long struggle of the Peloponnesian War—begun in his
                    childhood—ended with the overthrow of Athens. The middle period of his career
                    was passed under the supremacy of Sparta. His more advanced age saw that brief
                    ascendency which the genius of Epaminondas secured to Thebes. And he lived to
                    urge on Philip of Macedon a greater enterprise than any which the Hellenic world
                    could offer. His early promise had won a glowing tributefrom Plato, and the
                    rhetoric of his maturityfurnished matter to the analysis of Aristotle; he had
                    composed his imaginary picture of that Hellenic host which should move through
                    Asia in a pageant of sacred triumph, just as Xenophon was publishing his plain
                    narrative of the retreat of the Ten Thousand; and, in the next generation, his
                    literary eloquence was still demonstrating the weakness of Persia when
                    Demosthenes was striving to make men feel the deadly peril of Greece. This long
                    life has an element of pathos not unlike that of Greek tragedy; a power above
                    man was compelling events in a direction which Isocrates could not see; but his
                    own agency was the ally of that power, though in a sense which he knew not; his
                    vision was of Greece triumphant over Asia, while he was the unconscious prophet
                    of an age in which Asia should be transformed by the diffusion of
                    Hellenism.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Isocrates, a

                    Ernst Curtius has ably shown, a forerunner of Hellenism—analogous, in the

                <p>A just estimate of Isocrates demands that his character should be viewed in both
                    its main aspects,—the political and the literary.</p>
                <p>With regard to the first, two questions have to be asked: —(1) How far were the
                    political view’s of Isocrates peculiar to himself, and different from those of
                    the clearest minds contemporary with him? (2) How far were those views which he
                    held—singly, or in common with others—falsified by the event?</p>
                <p>1. In regard to Hellenic politics at large, Isocrates held that they must go from
                    bad to worse, unless the wrangling and demoralized cities could be united by the
                    spell of a national enthusiasm, under the leadership of one strong state or one
                    strong man. This national enthusiasm would be, he believed, most certainly
                    evoked by a war against the great Asiatic empire of Persia. Such an expedition
                    might well abolish the miserable squabbles of state with state, if only a
                    captain could be found.</p>

                <p>The whole tone of Greek thought in that age had taken a bent towards monarchy in
                    some form. This tendency may be traced alike in the practical common sense of
                    Xenophon and in the lofty idealism of Plato. There could be no better instance
                    of it than a well-known passage in the <hi rend="italic">Politics</hi> of
                    Aristotle. He is speaking of the gifts which meet in the Greek race,—a race
                    warlike, like the Europeans, but more subtle,—keen, like the Asiatics, but
                    braver. Here, he says, is a race which “might rule all men, if it were brought
                    under a single government.”<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"

                    unnecessary to suppose a special allusion to Alexander; but it is probable that
                    Aristotle had in his mind a possible union of the Greek cities under a strong
                    constitutional monarchy. His advice to Alexander (as reported by Plutarch) was
                    to treat the Greeks in the spirit of a leader (τ)γe∕zovικως), and the barbarians
                    in the spirit of a master (δecrπoτικως).<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    i., vi.</p></note> Aristotle agreed, then, with Isocrates in holding that, if
                    the Greek race was to have a great future, the first requisite was union under a
                    central power. Aristotle conceived this power as political and permanent;
                    Isocrates conceived it as, in the first place, military—having for its immediate
                    aim the conduct of an expedition against Asia. Had Isocrates foreseen that such
                    a command-in-chief was inseparable from a permanent monarchy, he -would
                    undoubtedly have accepted the latter; but he would have insisted, in the spirit
                    of Aristotle’s advice, on the constitutional liberty of the Greek subjects. The
                    general views of Isocrates as to the largest good possible for the Greek race
                    were thus substantially the same as those of Aristotle; and they were in accord
                    with the prevailing tendency of the best Greek thought in that age.</p>
                <p>2. How far were these views justified by the issue? The vision of the Greek race
                    “brought under one polity” was not, indeed, fulfilled in the sense of Aristotle
                    or of Isocrates. But the invasion of Asia by Alexander, as captain-general of
                    Greece, became the event which actually opened new and larger destinies to the
                    Greek race. The old political life of the Greek cities was -worn out; in the new
                    fields which were now opened, the empire of Greek civilization entered on a
                    career of world-wide conquest, until Greece became to East and West more than
                    all that Athens had been to Greece. Athens, Sparta, Thebes, ceased indeed to be
                    the chief centres of Greek life; but the mission of the Greek mind could
                    scarcely have been accomplished with such expansive and penetrating power if its
                    influence had not radiated over the East from Pergamus, Antioch, and
                    Alexandria.</p>
                <p>Panhellenic politics had the foremost interest for Isocrates. But in two of his
                    works—the oration <hi rend="italic">On the Peace</hi> and the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Areopagiticus</hi> (both of 355 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.)</hi> —he deals
                    specially with the politics of Athens. The speech <hi rend="italic">On the
                    Peace</hi> relates chiefly to foreign affairs. It is an eloquent appeal to his
                    fellow-citizens to abandon the dream of supremacy, and to treat their allies as
                    equals, not as subjects. The fervid orator personifies that empire, that false
                    mistress which has lured Athens, then Sparta, then Athens once more, to the
                    verge of destruction. “Is she not worthy of detestation ?” Leadership passes
                    into empire; empire begets insolence; insolence brings ruin. The <hi
                    rend="italic">Areopagiticus</hi> breathes a kindred spirit in regard to home
                    policy. Athenian life had lost its old tone. Apathy to public interests,
                    dissolute frivolity, tawdry display and real poverty—these are the features on
                    which Isocrates dwells. With this picture he contrasts the elder democracy of
                    Solon and Clisthenes, and, as a first step towards reform, would restore to the
                    Areopagus its general censor ship of morals. It is here, and here alone—in his
                    comments on Athenian affairs at home and abroad—that we can distinctly recognize
                    the man to whom the Athens of Pericles was something more than a tradition. We
                    are carried back to the age in which his long life began. We find it difficult
                    to realize that the voice to which we listen is the same which we hear in the
                    letter to Philip.</p>
                <p>Turning from the political to the literary aspect of his work, we are at once
                    upon ground where the question of his merits will now provoke comparatively
                    little controversy. Perhaps the most serious prejudice with which his reputation
                    has had to contend in modern times has been due to an accident of verbal usage.
                    He repeatedly describes that art which he professed to teach as his
                    &lt;∕&gt;ιλcσo&lt;∕&gt;iα. His use of this word—joined to the fact that in a few
                    passages he appears to allude slightingly to Plato or to the Socratics— has
                    exposed him to a groundless imputation. It cannot be too distinctly understood
                    that, when Isocrates speaks of his <hi rend="italic">φιλοσοφία,</hi> he means
                    simply his theory or method of “culture”—to use the only modern term which is
                    really equivalent in latitude to the Greek word as then current.<note

                <p>The <hi rend="italic">φιλοσοφία,</hi> or practical culture, of Isocrates was not
                    in conflict, because it had nothing in common, with the Socratic or Platonic
                    philosophy. The personal influence of Socrates may, indeed, be traced in his
                    work. He constantly desires to make his teaching bear on the practical life. His
                    maxims of homely moral wisdom frequently recall Xenophon’s <hi rend="italic"
                    >Memorabilia.</hi> But there the relation ends. Plato alludes to Isocrates in
                    perhaps three places. The glowing prophecy in the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Phaeilrus</hi> has been quoted; in the <hi rend="italic">Gorgias</hi> a phrase
                    of Isocrates is wittily parodied; and in the <hi rend="italic">Euthydemus</hi>
                    Isocrates is probably meant by the person who dwells “on the borderland between

                    a few more or less distinct allusions to Plato’s doctrines or works, to the
                    general effect that they are barren of practical result.<note anchored="true"

                    herd” (αγελαίοι <hi rend="italic">σοφισται).</hi> First, then, he claims, and
                    justly, greater breadth of view. The ordinary teacher confined himself to the
                    narrow scope of local interests,—training the young citizen to plead in the
                    Athenian law courts, or to speak on Athenian affairs in the ecclesia. Isocrates
                    sought to enlarge the mental horizon of his disciples by accustoming them to
                    deal with subjects which were not merely Athenian, but, in his own phrase,
                    Hellenic. Secondly, though he did not claim to have found a philosophical basis
                    for morals, it has been well <pb break="no"

                    that, in an age of corrupt and impudent selfishness, he always strove to raise
                    the minds of his hearers into a higher and purer air. Thirdly, his method of
                    teaching was thorough. Technical exposition came first. The learner was then
                    required to apply the rules in actual composition, which the master revised. The
                    ordinary teachers of rhetoric (as Aristotle says) employed their pupils in
                    committing model pieces to memory, but neglected to train the learner’s own
                    faculty through his own efforts. Lastly, Isocrates stands apart from most
                    writers of that day in his steady effort to produce results of permanent value.
                    While rhetorical skill was largely engaged in the intermittent journalism of
                    political pamphlets, Isocrates set a higher ambition before his school. His own
                    essays on contemporary questions received that finished form which has preserved
                    them to this day. The impulse to solid and lasting work, communicated by the
                    example of the master, was seen in such monuments as the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Atthis</hi> of Androtion, the <hi rend="italic">Hellenic History</hi> of
                    Theopompus, and the <hi rend="italic">Philippica</hi> of Ephorus.</p>
                <p>In one of his letters to Atticus, Cicero says that he has used “all the fragrant
                    essences of Isocrates, and all the little stores of his disciples.”<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Totum Isocratis <hi
                    rend="italic">μυροθηκιον</hi> atque omnes ejus discipulorum arculas, <hi
                    rend="italic">Ad Att., ii.</hi> 1.</p></note> The phrase has a point of which
                    the writer himself was perhaps scarcely conscious: the style of Isocrates had
                    come to Cicero through the school of Rhodes; and the Rhodian imitators had more
                    of Asiatic splendour than of Attic elegance. But, with this allowance made, the
                    passage may serve to indicate the real place of Isocrates in the history of
                    literary style. The old Greek critics consider him as representing what they
                    call the “smooth” or “florid” mode of composition <hi rend="italic">(γλαφυρά,
                    ανθηρά αρμονία)</hi> as distinguished from the “harsh” <hi rend="italic"
                    >(αυστηρά)</hi> style of Antiphon and the perfect “mean” <hi rend="italic"
                    >(μίση)</hi> of Demosthenes. Tried by a modern standard, the language of
                    Isocrates is certainly not “florid.” The only sense in which he merits the
                    epithet is that (especially in his earlier work) he delights in elaborate
                    antitheses. Isocrates is an “orator” in the larger sense of the Greek word <hi
                    rend="italic">rhetor;</hi> but his real distinction consists in the fact that he
                    was the first Greek who gave an artistic finish to literary rhetoric. The
                    practical oratory of the day had already two clearly separated branches—the
                    forensic, represented by Isaeus, and the deliberative, in which Callistratus was
                    the forerunner of Demosthenes. Meanwhile Isocrates was giving form and rhythm to
                    a standard literary prose. Through the influence of his school, this normal
                    prose style was transmitted—with the addition of some florid embellishments—to
                    the first generation of Romans who studied rhetoric in the Greek schools. The
                    distinctive feature in the composition of Isocrates is his structure of the
                    periodic sentence. This, with him, is no longer rigid or monotonous, as with
                    Antiphon,—no longer terse and compact, as with Lysias,—but ample, luxuriant,
                    unfolding itself (to use a Greek critic’s image) like the soft beauties of a
                    winding river. Isocrates was the first Greek who worked out the idea of a prose
                    rhythm. He saw clearly both its powers and its limits; poetry has its strict
                    rhythms and precise metres; prose has its metres and rhythms, not bound by a
                    rigid framework, yet capable of being brought under certain general laws which a
                    good ear can recognize, and which a speaker or writer may apply in the most
                    various combinations. This fundamental idea of prose rhythm, or number, is that
                    which the style of Isocrates has imparted to the style of Cicero. When
                    Quintilian (x. 1, 108) says, somewhat hyperbolically, that Cicero has
                    artistically reproduced <hi rend="italic">(effinxisse)</hi> “the force of</p>
                <p>Demosthenes, the wealth of Plato, the <hi rend="italic">charm</hi> of Isocrates,”
                    he means principally this smooth and harmonious rhythm. Cicero himself expressly
                    recognizes this original and distinctive merit of Isocrates.<note

                    through Rome, and especially through Cicero, the influence of Isocrates, as the
                    founder of a literary prose, has passed into the literatures oi modern Europe.
                    It is to the eloquence of the preacher that we may perhaps look for the nearest
                    modern analogue of that kind in which Isocrates excelled,—especially, perhaps,
                    to that of the great French preachers. Isocrates was one of the three Greek
                    authors, Demosthenes and Plato being the others, who contributed most to form
                    the style of Bossuet.</p>
                <p>The extant works of Isocrates consist of twenty-one speeches or discourses, and
                    nine letters. Among these, the six forensic speeches represent the first period
                    of his literary life,—belonging to the years 403-393 <hi rend="smallcaps"

                    as spurious by G. E. Benseler, viz., Or. xxi., on account of the frequent hiatus
                    and the short compact periods, and Or. xvii., on the first of these grounds. But
                    we are not warranted in applying to the early work of Isocrates those canons
                    which his mature style observed. The genuineness of the speech against Euthynus
                    is recognized by Philostratus; while the <hi rend="italic">Trapeziticus—</hi>
                    thrice named without suspicion by Harpocration—is treated by Dionysius, not only
                    as authentic, but as the typical forensic work of its author. The speech against
                    Lochites—where “a man of the people” (τoυ <hi rend="italic">πλφθoυs As)</hi> is
                    the speaker—exhibits much rhetorical skill. The speech <hi rend="italic">πcp∖
                    τoυ ζeυyoυs</hi> (“concerning the team of horses”) has a curious interest. An
                    Athenian citizen had complained that Alcibiades had robbed him of a team of four
                    horses, and sues the statesman’s son and namesake (who is the speaker) for their
                    value. This is not the only place in which Isocrates has marked his admiration
                    for the genius of Alcibiades; it appears also in the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Philippus</hi> and in the <hi rend="italic">Busiris.</hi> But, among the
                    forensic speeches, we must, on the whole, give the palm to the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Aegineticus</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi> a graphic picture of ordinary Greek
                    life in tho islands of the Aegean. Here—especially in the narrative—Isocrates
                    makes a near approach to the best manner of Lysias.</p>
                <p>The remaining fifteen orations or discourses do not easily lend themselves to the
                    ordinary classification under the heads of “deliberative” and “epideictic.” Both
                    terms must be strained; and neither is strictly applicable to all the pieces
                    which it is required to cover. The work of Isocrates travelled out of the
                    grooves in which the rhetorical industry of the age had hitherto moved. His
                    position among contemporary writers was determined by ideas peculiar to himself;
                    and his compositions, besides having a style of their own, are in several
                    instances of a new kind. The only adequate principle of classification is one
                    which considers them in respect to their subject-matter. Thus viewed, they form
                    two clearly separated groups —the scholastic and the political.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Scholastic Writings.—</hi> Under this head we have, first,
                    three letters or essays of a hortatory character. (1) The letter to the young
                    Demonicus,—once a favourite subject in the schools,—contains a series of
                    precepts neither below nor much above the average practical morality of Greece.
                    (2) The letter to Nicocles—the young king of the Cyprian Salamis—sets forth the
                    duty of a monarch to his subjects. (3) In the third piece, it is Nicocles who
                    speaks, and impresses on the Salaminians their duty to their king—a piece
                    remarkable as containing a popular plea for monarchy, composed by a citizen of
                    Athens. These three letters may be referred to the years 374-372 B.c.</p>
                <p>Next may be placed four pieces which are “displays” (e⅛-ιδe(∣∈∣s) in the proper
                    Greek sense. The <hi rend="italic">Busiris</hi> (Or. xi., 390-91 <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi>) is an attempt to show how the ill-famed king of
                    Egypt might be praised. The “Encomium on Helen” (Or. x., 370 <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">b,c.),</hi> a piece greatly superior to the last, contains the
                    celebrated passage on the power of beauty. These two compositions serve to
                    illustrate their author’s view that “encomia” of the hackneyed type might be
                    elevated by combining the mythical matter with some topic of practical
                    interest,—as, in the case of <hi rend="italic">Busiris,</hi> with the
                    institutions of Egypt, or, in that of Helen, with the reforms of Theseus. The
                    <hi rend="italic">Eνagoras</hi> (Or. ix., 365 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> ?)
                    is a laudatory epitaph on a really able man,—the Greek king of the Cyprian

                    the influences of Hellenic civilization had prevailed over the surrounding
                    barbarism. The <hi rend="italic">Panathenaicus</hi> (Or. xii.), intended for the
                    great Panathenaea of 342 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.,</hi> but not completed till

                    by Athens to Greece, but digresses into personal defence against critics; his
                    last work, written in extreme old age, it bears the plainest marks of failing
                    powers.</p>
                <p>The third subdivision of the scholastic writings is formed by two most
                    interesting essays on education—that entitled “Against the Sophists” (Or. xiii.,
                    391-90 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.),</hi> and the “Antidosis” (Or. xv., 355 <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi>). The first of these is a manifesto put forth by
                    Isocrates at the outset of his professional career of teaching, in which he
                    seeks to distinguish his aims from those of other “sophists.” These “sophists”
                    are (1) the “eristics” <hi rend="italic">(oi πep'ι τas epiSas),</hi> by whom he
                    seems to intend the minor Socratics, especially Euclides; (2) the teachers of
                    practical rhetoric, who had made exaggerated claims for the efficacy of mere
                    instruction, independently of natural faculty or experience; (3) the writers of
                    “arts” of rhetoric, who virtually devoted themselves (as Aristotle also
                    complains) to the lowest, or forensic, branch of their subject. As this piece is
                    the prelude to his career, its epilogue is the speech on the “Antidosis,”—so
                    called because it has the form of a speech made in court in answer to a
                    challenge to undertake the burden of the trierarchy, or else exchange properties
                    with the challenger. The discourse “Against the Sophists” had stated what his

                <p><hi rend="italic">Political Writings.—</hi> These, again, fall into two
                    classes—those which concern (1) the relations of Greece with Persia, (2) the
                    internal affairs of Greece. The first class consist of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Panegyricus</hi> (Or. iv., 380 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> ) and the <hi
                    rend="italic">Philippus</hi> (Or. v., 346 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.)</hi> The
                    <hi rend="italic">Panegyricus</hi> takes its name from the fact that it was
                    given to the Greek public at the time of the Olympic festivals—probably by means
                    of copies circulated there. The orator urges that Athens and Sparta should unite
                    in leading the Greeks against Persia. The feeling of antiquity that this noble
                    discourse is a masterpiece of careful work finds expression in the tradition
                    that it had occupied its author for more than ten years. Its excellence is not
                    merely that of language, but also—and perhaps even more conspicuously—that of
                    lucid arrangement. The <hi rend="italic">Philippus</hi> is an appeal to the king
                    of Macedon to assume that initiative iu the war on Persia which Isocrates had
                    ceased to expect from any Greek city. In the view of Demosthenes, Philip was the
                    representative barbarian; in that of Isocrates, he is the first of Hellenes, and
                    the natural champion of their cause.</p>
                <p>Of those discourses which concern the internal affairs of Greece, two have
                    already been noticed,—that <hi rend="italic">On the Peace</hi> (Or. viii. ), and
                    the <hi rend="italic">Areopagiticus</hi> (Or. vi.)—both of 355 B.c.—as dealing
                    respectively with the foreign and the home affairs of Athens. The <hi
                    rend="italic">Plataicus</hi> (Or. xiv. ) is supposed to be spoken by a Plataean
                    before the Athenian ecclesia in 373 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> In that year
                    Plataea had for the second time in its history been destroyed by Thebes. The
                    oration—an appeal to Athens to restore the unhappy town—is remarkable both for
                    the power with which Theban cruelty is denounced, and for the genuine pathos of
                    the peroration. The <hi rend="italic">Archidamus</hi> (Or. vi.) is a speech
                    purporting to be delivered by Archidamus III., son of Agesilaus, in a debate at
                    Sparta on conditions of peace offered by Thebes in 366 <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >b.c.</hi> It was demanded that Sparta should recognize the independence of
                    Messene, which had lately been restored by Epaminondas (370 <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >b.c.</hi>). The oration gives brilliant expression to the feeling which such a
                    demand was calculated to excite in Spartans who knew the history of their own
                    city. Xenophon witnesses that the attitude of Sparta on this occasion was
                    actually such as the <hi rend="italic">Archidamus</hi> assumes <hi rend="italic"
                    >{Hellen.,</hi> viii. 4, §§ 8-11).</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Letters.—</hi> The first letter—to Dionysius I.—is fragmentary;
                    but a passage in the <hi rend="italic">Philippus</hi> leaves no doubt as to its
                    object. Isocrates was anxious that the ruler of Syracuse should undertake the
                    command of Greece against Persia. The date is probably 368 <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >b.c.</hi> Next in chronological order stands the letter “To the Children of
                    Jason” (vi.). Jason, tyrant of Pherae, had been assassinated in 370 B.c.; and no
                    less than three of his successors had shared the same fate. Isocrates now urges
                    Thebe, the daughter of Jason, and her half-brothers, to set up a popular
                    government. The date is 359 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi><note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>This is shown by the present writer in a
                    paper on “The Sixth Letter of Isocrates,” <hi rend="italic">Journal of
                    Philosophy,</hi> vol. v. p. 266, 1874. The fact that Thebe, widow of Alexander
                    of Pherae, was the daughter of Jason, is incidentally noticed by Plutarch in his
                    life of Pelopidas, c. 28. It is this fact which gives the clue to the occasion
                    of the letter; <hi rend="italic">cf.</hi> Diod. xvi. 14.</p></note> The letter
                    to Archidamus III. (ix.)—the same person who is the imaginary speaker of oration
                    vi.—urges him to execute the writer’s favourite idea,—“to deliver the Greeks
                    from their feuds, and to crush barbarian insolence.” It is remarkable for a
                    vivid picture of the state of Greece; the date is about 356 <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >b.c.</hi> The letter to Timotheus (vii., 345 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> ),
                    ruler of Heraclea on the Euxine, introduces an Athenian friend who is going
                    thither, and at the same time offers some good counsels to the benevolent
                    despot. The letter “to the government of Myti'- lene” (viii., 350 <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">b.c.)</hi> is a petition to a newly established oligarchy,
                    begging them to permit the return of a democratic exile, a distinguished
                    musician named Agenor. The first of the two letters to Philip of Macedon (ii.)
                    remonstrates with him on the personal danger to which he had recklessly exposed
                    himself, and alludes to his beneficent intervention in the affairs of Thessaly;
                    the date is probably the end of 342 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> The letter to
                    Alexander (v. ), then a boy of fourteen, is a brief greeting sent along with the
                    last, and congratulates him on preferring “practical” to “eristic” studies— a
                    distinction which is explained by the sketch of the author’s <hi rend="italic"
                    >φιλοσοφία,</hi> and of his essay “Against the Sophists,” given above. It was
                    just at this time, probably, that Alexander was beginning to receive the lessons
                    of Aristotle (342 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.).</hi> The letter to Antipater (iv.
                    ) introduces a friend who wished to enter the military service of Philip.
                    Antipater was then acting as regent in Macedonia during Philip’s absence in
                    Thrace (340-339 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.).</hi> The later of the two letters to
                    Philip (iii.) appears to be written shortly after the battle of Chaeronea in 338
                    <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> The questions raised by it have already been
                    discussed.</p>
                <p>No lost work of Isocrates is known from a definite quotation, except an “Art of
                    Rhetoric,” from which some scattered precepts are cited. Quintilian, indeed, and
                    Photius, who had seen this “Art,” felt a doubt as to whether it was genuine.
                    Only twenty-five discourses—out of an ascriptive total of some sixty—were
                    admitted as authentic by Dionysius; Photius <hi rend="italic">(circ.</hi> 850
                    <hi rend="smallcaps">a.d.</hi>) knew only the number now extant—twenty-one.</p>
                <p>With the exception of defects at the end of Or. xiii., at the beginning of Or.
                    xvi., and probably at the end of letters i., vi., ix., the existing text is free
                    from serious mutilations. It is also unusually pure. The smooth and clear style
                    of Isocrates gave few opportunities for the mistakes of copyists. On the other
                    hand, he was a favourite author of the schools. Numerous glosses crept into his
                    text through the comments or conjectures of rhetoricians. This was already the
                    case before the 6th century, as is attested by the citations of Priscian and
                    Stobaeus. Jeroine Wolf and Koraes successively accomplished much for the text.
                    But a more decided advance was made by Immanuel Bekker. He used fiveMSS., viz.,
                    (1) Codex Urbinas III., Γ (this, the best, was his principal guide); (2)
                    Vaticanus 936, Δ; (3) Laurentianus 87,14, Θ (13th century); (4) Vaticanus 65, A;
                    and (5) Marcianus 415, S. The first three, of the same family, have Or. xv.
                    entire; the last two are from the same original, and have Or. xv.
                    incomplete.</p>
                <p>Baiter and Sauppe (Zurich, 1850) follow Γ “even more constantly than Bekker.”
                    Their apparatus is enriched, however, by a MS. to which he had not
                    access,—Ambrosianus O. 144, E, which in some cases, as they recognize, has alone
                    preserved the true reading. The readings of this MS. were given in full by G. E.
                    Benseler in his second edition (1854-55). The distinctive characteristic of
                    Benseler’s textual criticism was a tendency to correct the text against even the
                    best MS., where the MS. conflicted with the usage of Isocrates as inferred from
                    his recorded precepts or from the statements of ancient writers. Thus, on the
                    strength of the rule ascribed to Isocrates,— <hi rend="italic">φωvηevτa μn
                    συμπiιrτeιi', —</hi> Benseler would remove from the text every example of
                    hiatus. Benseler’s edition has been revised by F. Blass (1878-79), who amends a
                    large number of his readings, but usually follows him in details of form and
                    spelling.</p>
