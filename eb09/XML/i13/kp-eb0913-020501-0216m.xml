                <p><label type="entry">IONIAN ISLANDS</label>, the ordinary collective name of Corfu
                    (Κέρκυρα), Cephalonia (Κεφαλλήνια), Zante (Ζάκυνθος), Santa Maura (Λεύκάς),
                    Ithaca, Cerigo (Kυtfypα), and Paxo, with their minor dependencies. As the
                    islands are seven in number they are often called the Heptanesus (Επτάνησος) in
                    Greek, and Heptanesian or Septinsular is the corresponding adjective. The
                    history of the use of Ionian as the distinctive epithet of the islands is
                    sufficiently obscure; but it is probable that, like the application of the name
                    Ionian Sea to this part of the Mediterranean, it is due to the settling of
                    Ionian colonists on the coasts and islands. The islands have no real
                    geographical unity beyond that involved in the fact that, with the exception of
                    Cerigo, situated off the south coast, they are all within a little distance of
                    the west coast of Greece or Albania. Corfu is separated from the mainland by not
                    more than 2 miles, while the passage from it to Santa Maura, the nearest of the
                    larger islands, is no less than 46. Since 1863 the whole Heptanesian territory
                    has been incorporated with the kingdom of Greece, and the several islands have
                    been assigned to different administrative divisions. Corfu, Cephalonia, and
                    Zante each gives its name to one of the thirteen nomarchies of the kingdom;
                    Cerigo is part of the nomarchy of Argolis and Corinth. The area of the seven
                    islands is computed at 1041 square miles. The population shows a steady
                    increase: in 1836 it was 204,242 (110,496 males, 93,746 females); in1854,
                    228,981(123,254 males, 105,727 females); in 1870, 229,516; and in 1879, 244,433.

                <p>Corfu has a denser population than any other part of Greece, more than 350
                    inhabitants to the square mile; and Zante ranks next with about 300. The city of
                    Corfu, with its 25,000 inhabitants, is the third in size of the Greek towns,
                    being exceeded only by Patras (Patrai) and Athens.</p>
                <p>As the Ionian Islands have no geographical unity, their political unity is of
                    comparatively modern date. A Septinsular or Heptanesian history, as
                    distinguished from the individual histories of the seven islands, is
                    consequently in its earlier chapters a mere conventional composition produced by
                    gathering together a variety of scarcely connected facts. To a certain extent
                    indeed the various islands have passed under the same succession of influences;
                    they have been subjected to the same invasions, and have received accessions to
                    their populations from the same currents of migration or conquest; but in the
                    degree in which even what may be considered as common experiences have affected
                    the individual islands there has been no small diversity. In the matter of
                    population, for instance, the island of Corfu has undergone much more important
                    modifications than the island of Ithaca. For such facts as the establishment of
                    Ulysses in Ithaca, the settlement of a Corinthian colony in Corfu, and the
                    origin of the Peloponnesian War in a dispute between the colony and the
                    “metropolis,” the reader will consult the separate articles <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Corfu, Ithaca, &amp;c.</hi></p>
                <p>The beginning of Heptanesian history may be said to date from the 15th century.
                    Though it is true that Leo the Philosopher (about 890 A.i&gt;.) formed all or
                    most of the islands into a distinct province under the title of the Tema of
                    Cephallenia, and that in this condition they belonged to the Eastern empire
                    after Italy had been divided into various states, this political or
                    administrative unity could not last long in the case of islands situated, as
                    they were, in the very meeting place of opposite currents of conquest. Robert
                    Guiscard, having captured Corfu (1081) and Cephalonia, might have become the
                    founder of a Norman dynasty in the islands but for his early death at Cassopo.
                    Amid the struggles between Greek emperors and Western crusaders that continued
                    to fill the 12th century, Corfu, Cephalonia, Zante, &amp;c., emerge from time to
                    time; but it was not till the Latin empire was established at Constantinople
                    that the Venetians, who were destined to give the Ionian Islands their place in
                    history, obtained possession of Corfu. They were afterwards robbed of the island
                    by Leon Vetrano, a famous Genoese corsair; but he was soon defeated and put to
                    death, and the senate, to secure their position, granted fiefs in Corfu to ten
                    noble families in order that they might colonize it (1206). The conquest of
                    Cephalonia and Zante followed, and we find five counts of the family of Tocco
                    holding certainly the former island, and probably the latter as well as Santa
                    Maura, as tributary to the republic. But the footing thus gained by the
                    Venetians was afterwards lost, and through the closing part of the 13th and most
                    of the 14th century the islands were a prey by turns to corsairs and to Greek
                    and Neapolitan claimants. In 1386, however, the people of Corfu made voluntary
                    submission to the republic which had now risen to be the first maritime power in
                    the Mediterranean, and in 1401 (August 16th) the senate, with mercantile
                    caution, secured their possession of the island from any claim which might be
                    asserted by the kings of Naples through the duchy of Taranto by obtaining a
                    ratification of their title from Ladislaus for the sum of 30,000 ducats. In 1485
                    Zante was purchased from the Turks in a very depopulated condition; and in 1499
                    Cephalonia was captured from the same masters; but Santa Maura, though
                    frequently occupied for a time, was not finally attached to Venice till 1684,
                    and Cerigo was taken only in 1717.</p>
                <p>On the fall of the Venetian republic in 1797, the treaty of Campo Formio, which
                    gave Venice to Austria, annexed the Ionian Islands to France; and in 1798 the
                    French Government ratified the arrangement, and their division into three
                    departments. But a Russo-Turkish force came to drive out the French at the close
                    of that year; and in the spring of 1799 Corfu capitulated. By treaty with the
                    Porte in 1800, the emperor Paul erected the Republic of the Seven United
                    Islands, which, with various modifications, was but another name for anarchy and
                    confusion, till a secret article in the treaty of Tilsit, in 1807, declared the
                    Ionian Islands an integral part of the French empire. They were incorporated
                    with the province of Illyria, and in this condition they remained till the
                    decline of the French power. The British forces, under General Oswald, took
                    Zante, Cephalonia, and Cerigo in 1809, and Santa Maura in 1810; Colonel Church
                    reduced Paxo in 1814; and after the abdication of Napoleon, Corfu, which had
                    been well defended by General Donzelot, was, by order of Louis XVIII., ceded to
                    Sir James Campbell. By the treaty of Paris (9th November 1815) the contracting
                    powers— Great Britain, Russia, Austria, and Prussia—agreed to place the “United
                    States of the Ionian Islands” under the exclusive protection of Great Britain,
                    and to give Austria the right of equal commercial advantage with the protecting
                    country, a plan strongly approved by Count Capodistrias, the famous Corfiot
                    noble who afterwards became president of the new republic of Greece.</p>
                <p>The terms of the treaty were unfortunately not only of indefinite import, but, if
                    not actually self-contradictory, at least susceptible of contradictory
                    interpretation. And, still more unfortunately, instead of interpreting the other
                    articles in harmony with the first, which declared the islands one “sole free
                    and independent state,” the protecting power availed itself of all that they
                    contained in support of the extension of its authority. The first lord high
                    commissioner, Sir Thomas Maitland, who as governor of Malta had acquired the
                    sobriquet of “King Tom,” was not the man to foster the constitutional liberty of
                    an infant state. The treaty required, with questionable wisdom, that a
                    constitution should be established, and this was accordingly done; but its
                    practical value may be judged of from the fact that the budget presented to the
                    assembly of representatives in 1840, without risk of discovery, consisted of so
                    much blank paper,—duly bound, it is true, in purple velvet. The constitution,
                    which came into force in January 1818, placed the administration in the hands of
                    a senate of six members and a legislative assembly of forty members; but the
                    real authority was vested in the commissioner, who was able directly to }τrevent
                    anything, and indirectly to effect almost anything. Sir Thomas Maitland was not
                    slow to exercise the control thus permitted him, though on the whole he did so
                    for the benefit of the islands. The construction of roads, the abolition of
                    direct taxes and of the system of farming the church lands, the securing of
                    impartial administration of justice, and the establishment of educational
                    institutions are among the services ascribed to his efforts. These, however,
                    made less impression on the Heptanesians than his despotic character and the
                    measures which he took to prevent them giving assistance in the Greek war of
                    independence in 1821. He was succeeded in 1823 by General Sir Frederick Adams,
                    who in the main carried out the same policy, though he showed more favour to the
                    aristocracy. It was under his government that the new fortifications of Corfu
                    began to be constructed, and that some of the most important public works which
                    still do honour to the English protectorate were undertaken. In Cephalonia the
                    credit belongs, however, to Colonel Napier, one of the most able and arbitrary
                    Englishmen who had to do with the islands. Lord Nugent, who became commissioner
                    in 1832, began by allowing the parliament greater freedom, but was afterwards
                    compelled to revert to the previous method of management. Sir Howard Douglas,
                    his successor (1835-1841), had a stormy reign. He ruled with a firm, too often
                    with a high hand; and he was met by continual intrigues, contentions, and
                    calumnies. The parliament was prorogued in 1831, 1841, and 1842, the principal
                    exponent of the opposition being the famous Mustoxidi (who died in 1861). A
                    complete change of policy was inaugurated by Mr Mackenzie (1841-43), but his
                    relations to the home Government, rendered more embarrassing by a bold act of
                    his own, led to his speedy resignation. Lord Seaton (1843-49) was induced by the
                    European disturbances of 1848 to propose and urge on a number of important
                    reforms in the constitution; and in 1848 liberty of the press was granted by
                    statute. Freedom of election, both parliamentary and municipal, a large
                    extension of the franchise, and the restoration of voting by ballot were among
                    the concessions of 1849. The assembly (the ninth) first elected under the
                    extended franchise had <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0913-0220-0207"/> to be twice prorogued by Sir Henry Ward
                    (1849-1855), and was finally dissolved in 1851; and the growing hostility to the
                    Government was vainly met by banishment of members of assembly and editors of
                    papers. The party which wished for union with Greece was rapidly growing in
                    vigour and voice. Serious insurrections of the peasantry, especially in
                    Cephalonia, had to be put down by military force both by Lord Seaton and Sir
                    Henry Ward. Sir John Young (1855-1859) found the tenth parliament of the same
                    temper as the ninth: in its first session it passed a resolution in favour of
                    immediate union with Greece. The hostility of the unionist party to the
                    commissioner himself was increased by the publication (1858) of one of his
                    despatches (stolen from the colonial office), in which he recommended that
                    “Corfu and Paxo should, with the consent of their inhabitants, be converted into
                    English colonies, and that only the southern islands should be handed over to
                    Greece.” About the same time, however, the hopes of the unionists were roused by
                    the appointment of Mr Gladstone as high commissioner extraordinary to
                    investigate into the condition of the islands. From his eminence in Greek
                    scholarship, and his known sympathy with Greek independence, it was their
                    expectation that he would support if he did not satisfy their pretensions. But
                    after a tour through the principal islands Mr Gladstone came to the conclusion
                    that the abolition of the protectorate was not the wish of the mass of the
                    people, and the cordial reception which he owed to his own reputation and
                    character was too much ascribed by him to the general goodwill of the Ionians to
                    the English Government. For a few days in 1859 he held office as lord high
                    commissioner, and in that capacity he proposed for the consideration of the
                    assembly a series of reforms. These reforms were, however, declared inadmissible
                    by the assembly; and Sir Henry Storks (February 16, 1859), who succeeded to the
                    difficult post which Mr Gladstone resigned, began his rule by a prorogation. The
                    contest continued in the same style between the assembly and the protectorate.
                    The English Government was slow to realize the true position of affairs: as late
                    as May 1861 Mr Gladstone spoke of the cession of the islands as “a crime against
                    the safety of Europe,” and Sir Henry Storks continued to report of tranquillity
                    and contentment. The assembly of 1862 accused the commissioner of violation of
                    the constitution and of the treaty of Paris, and complained that England
                    remained in ignorance of what took place in the islands. During this time there
                    had been considerable agitation in Greece owing to the disfavour in which King
                    Otto (of Bavaria) was held. On the abdication of that prince in 1862 the Greek
                    people by universal suffrage voted Prince Alfred of England to the throne, and
                    when he declined to accept the crown England was asked to name a successor. The
                    prince proposed was William, brother of the Princess of Wales; and the English
                    Government declared to the provisional Government of Greece that if they
                    accepted him (which they did) his power would be strengthened by the
                    long-refused cession of the Ionian Islands. In 1863 the commissioner laid before
                    the parliament (the thirteenth) the conditions on which the cession would be
                    carried out. The rejection of one of those conditions— the demolition of the
                    fortifications of Corfu—led to a new prorogation; but none the less (on November
                    14, 1863) the plenipotentiaries of the five great powers signed the protocol by
                    which the protectorate was brought to a close. The neutrality which they
                    attributed to the whole of the islands was afterwards (January 1864) confined to
                    Corfu and Paxo. On May 30 of that year the lord high commissioner handed over
                    the archives of the state to General Zaimis, the Greek plenipotentiary; and on
                    the following day he left Corfu with the English troops and men-of-war. King
                    George (Prince William of Schleswig-Holstein) made his entry into the capital on
                    June 6th. The eighty representatives of the Ionian Islands took their places in
                    the national parliament in July.</p>
