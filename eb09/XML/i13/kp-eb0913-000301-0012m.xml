                    >e.g.,</hi> in expiations for sacrilege, the boy, as being the nobler child, was
                    preferred. But what may be called the normal infanticide of early society was
                    probably confined to girls. The custom is in certain places and for certain
                    periods explained by the system of exogamy; but much more generally, as in China
                    at the present day, it is simply an illustration of what Malthus would call a
                    .“'positive check,” the reckless propagation of children far outrunning the
                    means of subsistence which the energy of the parents can provide. Infanticide
                    still survives among many savage races; and, where the necessity for strong
                    warriors is felt, a selection is sometimes made of the weaker children for
                    destruction. But this political element seldom enters into the custom. It is
                    because girls cannot provide for themselves that they are killed.</p>
                <p>More complex were the leading forms of infanticide in India, now suppressed by
                    the wise action of the British Government. The practice, though forbidden by
                    both the Vedas and the Koran, prevailed among the Râjputs and certain of the
                    aboriginal tribes. Among the aristocratic Râjputs, for example, it was thought
                    dishonourable that a girl should remain unmarried. Moreover, a girl may not
                    marry below her caste; she ought to marry her superior, or· at least her equal.
                    This reasoning was obviously most powerful with the highest castes, in which,
                    accordingly, the disproportion of the sexes was painfully apparent. But,
                    assuming marriage to be possible, it is ruinously expensive to the bride’s
                    father. He has to make gifts of money, clothes, jewels, and sweetmeats to the
                    bridegroom’s relatives: and when the marriage ceremony comes, he has, chiefly
                    owing to the exactions of the BrΛhmans and Bhats or minstrels, to face a lavish
                    expenditure on feasts which in the case of some râjàs has been known to reach
                    more than £100,000. To avoid all this, the R&lt;4jput killed a certain
                    proportion of his daughters,—sometimes in a very singular way. A pill of tobacco
                    and bhang might be given to the newborn child to swallow; or it was drowned in
                    milk; or the mother’s breast was smeared with opium or the juice of the
                    poisonous <hi rend="italic">Datura.</hi> A common form was to cover the child’s
                    mouth with a plaster of cow-dung before it drew breath. Infanticide was also
                    practised to a small extent by some sects of the aboriginal Kandhs, and by the
                    poorer hill tribes of the Himalayas. Where infanticide occurs in India, though
                    it really rests on the economic facts stated, there is usually some poetical
                    tradition of its origin. The measures against the practice were begun towards
                    the end of the 18th century by Jonathan Duncan and Major Walker. They were
                    continued by a series of able and earnest officers during the present century.
                    One of its chief events, representing many minor events, was the Umritsur durbar
                    of 1853, which was arranged by the late Lord Lawrence. At that great meeting the
                    chiefs residing in the Punjab and the trans-Sutlej states signed an agreement
                    engaging to expel from caste every one who committed infanticide, to adopt fixed
                    and moderate rates of marriage expenses, and to exclude from these ceremonies
                    the minstrels and beggars who had so greatly swollen the expense. According to
                    the present law, if the female children fall below a certain percentage in any
                    tract or among any tribe in northern India where infanticide formerly prevailed,
                    the suspected village is placed under police supervision, the cost being charged
                    to the locality. By these measures, together with a strictly enforced system of
                    reporting births and deaths, infanticide has been almost trampled out; although
                    some of the Râjput clans keep their female offspring suspiciously close to the
                    lowest average which secures them from surveillance.</p>
                <p>The modern crime of infanticide shows no symptom of diminution in the leading
                    nations of Europe. In all of them it is closely connected with illegitimacy in
                    the class of farm and domestic servants. The crime is generally committed by the
                    mother for the purpose of completing the concealment of her shame, and in other
                    cases, where shame has not survived, in order to escape the burden of her
                    child’s support. The paramour sometimes aids in the crime, which is not confined
                    to unmarried mothers. The ease with which affiliation orders are obtained in
                    Great Britain must save the lives of many children. In France, where the inquiry
                    into paternity is forbidden, a controversy still goes on as to the influence of
                    hospitals for “assisted children,” which are said to save life at the expense of
                    morality. It seems certain that the great administrative change involved in
                    closing the “tour” at these hospitals has not perceptibly affected infanticide
                    in France. The laws of the European states differ widely on this subject,—some
                    of them treating infanticide as a special crime, others regarding it merely as a
                    case of murder of unusually difficult proof.</p>
                <p>In the law of England, the inexcusable killing of infants is theoretically
                    murder. The infant must of course be a human being in the legal sense; and “a
                    child becomes a human being when it has completely proceeded in a living state
                    from the body of its mother, whether it has breathed or not, and whether it has
                    an independent circulation or not, and whether the navel string is severed or
                    not; and the killing of such a child is homicide when it dies after birth in
                    consequence of injuries received before, during, or after birth.’ A child in the
                    womb, or in the act of birth, though it may have breathed, is therefore not a
                    human being, the killing of which amounts to homicide. The <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit13newyrich/page/n13/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0913-0013-0004"/> older law of child murder under a statute of
                    James I. consisted of cruel presumptions against the mother, and it was not till
                    1803 that trials for that offence were placed under the ordinary rules of
                    evidence. There now is a presumption, said to be based on considerations of
                    humanity, that every newborn child found dead is born dead until the contrary is
                    very clearly shown. It is the opinion of the most eminent of British medical
                    jurists that this presumption has tended to increase infanticide. Apart from
                    this, the technical definition of human life has excited a good deal of comment
                    and some indignation. The definition allows many wicked acts to go unpunished.
                    The experience of assizes in England shows that many children are killed when it
                    is impossible to prove that they were wholly born. The distinction taken by the
                    law has probably by this time reached the minds of the class to which most of
                    the unhappy mothers belong. Partly to meet this complaint, it was suggested to
                    the Royal Commission of 1866 that killing during birth, or within seven days
                    thereafter, should be an offence punishable with penal servitude. The second
                    complaint is of an opposite character,—partly that infanticide by mothers is not
                    a fit subject for capital punishment, and partly that, whatever be the intrinsic
                    character of the act, juries will not convict or the executive will not carry
                    out the sentence. Earl Russell gave expression to this feeling when he proposed
                    that no capital sentence should be pronounced upon mothers for the killing of
                    children within six months after birth.</p>
                <p>It is a statutory offence, under 24 &amp; 25 Vict. c. 100, to administer poison
                    or any noxious thing to a woman with child with intent to procure her
                    miscarriage, or to use any instrument for the same purpose, the maximum
                    punishment being penal servitude for life. The previous law had drawn the
                    distinction of “quick with child,” and in such cases had punished capitally. It
                    was a very old controversy among the philosophers and physicians of antiquity,
                    when the foetus ceased to be <hi rend="italic">pars</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >viscerum matris</hi> and became “vital,” or, as it was afterwards called,
                    “animate.” The law has not yet succeeded in putting down the degraded and wicked
                    trade in abortion. There can be no doubt from the French and American treatises
                    of Gallard and Storer that the crime prevails extensively, and even in classes
                    of society in which infanticide proper would not be thought of without a
                    shudder.</p>
                <p>Under the same statute it is a misdemeanour punishable by two years’ imprisonment
                    with hard labour, as a maximum, to endeavour to conceal the birth of a child by
                    any secret disposition of its dead body, whether the child died before, after,
                    or at its birth. This does not apply to very premature births, where it was
                    impossible that the foetus should be alive. But it does apply to all those
                    numerous cases where the child’s body, without being actually hidden, is placed
                    where it is not likely to be found except by accident, or upon search. Lastly,
                    under the same statute it is a misdemeanour punishable by five years’ penal
                    servitude, as a maximum, to abandon or expose a child under the age υf two
                    years, so as to endanger its life, or to inflict permanent injury, actual or
                    probable, upon its health.</p>
                <p>It is difficult to say to what extent infanticide prevails in the United Kingdom.
                    At one time a large number of children were murdered in England for the mere
                    purpose of obtaining the burial money from a benefit club.<note anchored="true"

                    of Commons found it necessary to appoint a select committee “to inquire as to
                    the best means of preventing the destruction of the lives of infants put out to
                    nurse for hire by their parents.” The trials of</p>
                <p>Margaret Waters and Mary Hall called attention to the infamous relations between
                    the lying-in houses and the baby-farming houses of London. The form was gone
                    through of paying a ridiculously insufficient sum for the maintenance of the
                    child. “Improper and insufficient food,” said the Committee, “opiates, drugs,
                    crowded rooms, bad air, want of cleanliness, and wilful neglect are sure to be
                    followed in a few months by diarrhoea, convulsions, and wasting away.” These
                    unfortunate children were nearly all illegitimate, and the mere fact of their
                    being hand-nursed, and not breast-nursed, goes some way (according to the
                    experience of the Foundling Hospital and the Magdalene Home) to explain the
                    great mortality among them. Such children, when nursed by their mothers in the
                    workhouse, generally live. The practical result of the committee of 1871 was the
                    Act of 1872, 35 &amp; 36 Vict. c. 38, which provides for the compulsory
                    registration of all houses in which more than one child under the age of one
                    year arc received for a longer period than twenty-four hours. No licence is
                    granted by the justices of the peace, unless the house is suitable for the
                    purpose, and its owner a person of good character and able to maintain the
                    children. Offences against the Act, including wilful neglect of the children
                    even in a suitable house, are punishable by a fine of <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >j£5</hi> or six months’ imprisonment with or without hard labour.</p>
                <p>The law of Scotland also treats the unlawful killing of completely born infants
                    as murder. In such cases a verdict of culpable homicide is usually returned, the
                    punishment being entirely in the discretion of the court. Still more commonly
                    the charge of concealment of pregnancy is made under the Act 49 Geo. III. c. 14,
                    the maximum punishment being two years’ imprisonment. It must be shown that the
                    woman concealed her condition during the whole period of pregnancy, and did not
                    call for help at the birth. Unlawfully procuring abortion, whether by drugs or
                    instruments, is also a crime known to the common law of Scotland, the punishment
                    being penal servitude or imprisonment according to circumstances. In a variety
                    of cases, which do not admit of general statement, convictions have also been
                    obtained against parents of exposing and deserting children or placing them in
                    danger, and of cruel and unnatural treatment and neglect.</p>
