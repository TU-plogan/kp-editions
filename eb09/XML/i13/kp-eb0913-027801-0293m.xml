                <p>1. <hi rend="italic">Properties of Iron.—</hi> The peculiar physical characters
                    of iron, more especially when in the form of steel or slightly carbonized iron,
                    have rendered this element one of special importance since the earliest ages for
                    the fabrication of cutting instruments, weapons, and tools of various kinds. In
                    the form of moderately-pure malleable or wrought iron, the metal is a substance
                    possessed of considerable lustre and hardness, and of a bluish-white or
                    bluish-grey colour; it takes a high polish, and when bright does not readily
                    oxidize in dry air, although moist air, especially in presence of traces of
                    acids, even of carbonic acid, readily effects its tarnishing and the subsequent
                    formation of rust. It has a specific gravity near to 7 <hi rend="italic"
                    >'75,</hi> and requires a very high temperature to effect its fusion, the
                    melting point being the more elevated the purer the substance; its most valuable
                    and characteristic property is its power of becoming soft and pasty before
                    undergoing complete fusion, so that two hot masses may be pressed or squeezed
                    together into one by the process of <hi rend="italic">ιoelding,</hi> and so that
                    by forging, rolling, hammering, or other analogous operations it can readily be
                    fashioned into shapes which its rigidity and strength when cold enable it to
                    maintain. Its strength and tenacity are very high, as also are its powers of
                    being drawn into wire and rolled or hammered into sheets (ductility and
                    malleability); these properties, however, are very largely influenced by the
                    presence of impurities. In magnetic characters it is superior to all other
                    substances, nickel and cobalt coming next to it in these respects, but being
                    much lower in power; when it is almost pure, the magnetic influence produced,
                    owing to induction, by the proximity of a permanent magnet or of an electric
                    current disappears entirely on removal of the magnet or current; if, on the
                    other hand, carbon be present (as is usually the case to some extent even in the
                    softest malleable iron), there remains after removal of the magnet or current a
                    greater or less amount of permanent magnetism according to circumstances, hard
                    steel exhibiting the greatest power of becoming permanently magnetized under
                    given conditions, and substances intermediate between pure iron and hard steel
                    (soft steels and hard irons) possessing this power to a lesser extent. Other
                    elements besides carbon, <hi rend="italic">e.g.,</hi> oxygen and sulphur, can
                    communicate to iron the power of becoming permanently magnetized, as in the case
                    of the minerals loadstone (magnetic oxide of iron) and magnetic pyrites. The
                    effect of a magnet on iron at high temperatures is far below that exhibited at
                    ordinary temperatures; according to Matteucci the action of a given magnet on a
                    molten globule of iron is only 0 ’ 0015 per cent, of that on the same globule
                    when cold, so that the attractive action is wholly insensible in the case of
                    molten iron except when a powerful electromagnet is employed. In electrical
                    conductivity and power of conducting heat (which are always approximately in the
                    same ratio), iron stands about midway amongst metals; Matthiessen’s experiments
                    give the specific resistance (C. G. S. system) of annealed iron as 9827 at 0°
                    C., that of annealed silver being 1521 and that of mercury 96,190 at the same
                    temperature. As with the other physical properties, the presence of small
                    amounts of impurity largely affects the numerical value of the specific
                    resistance, which is decreased some 35 per cent, by a rise in temperature from
                    0° to 100° C.</p>
                <p>The specific heat of iron at the ordinary temperature is 0Ί1379 (Régnault), 0110
                    (Dulong and Petit). Pouillet gives the melting point when in a state of high
                    purity as between 1500° and 1600° (probably somewhat too low), Scheerer as
                    2100°, Deville as near to that of platinum, which is not far from 1900°-2000°.
                    The presence of minute quantities of carbon, sulphur, &amp;c., sensibly lowers
                    the fusing point, whilst 1 per cent, of the former furnishes a steel melting at
                    several hundred degrees lower than pure iron (at near 1600°),—cast iron
                    containing some 3 per cent, of carbon <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit13newyrich/page/n294/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0913-0294-0279"/> melting at near 1500°, and being rendered still
                    more fusible by the presence of small quantities of sulphur and silicon; whence
                    sulphurized pig irons are often blended with purer varieties in order to produce
                    good casting metal for various purposes. At the ordinary temperature the linear
                    coefficient of expansion of wrought iron is near to 0Ό000125 (values between
                    0Ό000115 and 0Ό000144 having been obtained by Borda, Smeaton, Lavoisier and
                    Laplace, Troughton, and Dulong and Petit), so that 1 unit of length at 0° will
                    become on an average 1 <hi rend="superscript"> ,</hi> 00125 units in length at
                    100°. Slightly lower values have been obtained with steel of different qualities
                    by various of these observers, averaging 0Ό000115; whilst cast iron expands less
                    still, averaging 0 ’ 0000111 as linear coefficient of expansion; the precise
                    numbers obtainable vary with the conditions, according as the metal has been
                    hammered, rolled, hardened, annealed, &lt;fcc. At somewhat elevated temperatures
                    the rate of expansion is higher; thus Dulong and Petit find that the mean rate
                    of expansion of iron between 0° and 100° is to that between 0° and 300° nearly
                    in the ratio of 4 to 5. The force exerted during expansion is very great, being
                    equal to that requisite to produce an elongation of the bar examined to the
                    extent through which its length increases by heat; thus, according to Barlow, a
                    weight of 1 ton suspended to an iron bar a square inch in section will extend
                    its length by 0Ό001 times the original length, so that 1 inch of length will
                    become 1∙0001 inches; this increase in length would be brought about by a rise
                    in temperature of about 9° C.; hence for an increase of 36°, or less than the
                    average difference between a cold and warm day in winter and summer
                    respectively, a girder of iron of 20 square inches in section would exert a
                    thrusting strain upon two walls, &amp;c., built firmly up to its ends when
                    coldest, equal to about 20 × <hi rend="superscript"> 3</hi> ∕ or 80 tons for
                    each inch of its length, were it not that the pressure is more or less relieved
                    by the giving of the walls long before this strain is reached. In consequence it
                    is indispensable to allow a space for expansion in all constructions in which
                    iron is employed, <hi rend="italic">e.g.,</hi> ordinary buildings, railways,
                    furnaces braced together with tie-rods, &amp;c.</p>
                <p>With large masses of ironwork exposed to the weather, very great strains may be
                    produced through unequal expansion in differently heated parts, <hi
                    rend="italic">e.g.,</hi> in the portions exposed to sunshine and in the shade
                    respectively; as just indicated, a difference of temperature of 9° between two
                    portions rigidly connected will produce a strain of about 1 ton per square inch.
                    Edwin Clark has calculated that half an hour’s sunshine produces more effect in
                    the way of developing strain on the tubes of the Britannia bridge over the Menai
                    Straits than the heaviest rolling loads or the most violent storms. Variations
                    of temperature also exert some effect upon the strength and tenacity of iron;
                    the numerical values are largely variable with the quality of the metal. At
                    temperatures below a red heat the strength is considerably lessened, and at high
                    temperatures approximating to the welding temperature the tenacity becomes
                    comparatively small (see § 43).</p>
                <p>A peculiar suspension of the chemical activity of iron in reference to nitric
                    acid (passive condition) appears to be connected with its electrical
                    relationships; when placed in nitric acid very slightly diluted (specific
                    gravity about l <hi rend="superscript"> -</hi> 4), iron is ordinarily violently
                    attacked; but if whilst in the acid it be touched with certain substances, e.y.,
                    gold, platinum, plumbago, &amp;c., the action stops (at least under certain
                    conditions, especially when not heated above some particular temperature varying
                    with the strength of the acid —Ordway); the iron thus rendered passive will
                    induce the same condition in a second piece immersed in the acid by contact; on
                    exposure to air the passive iron loses its power of remaining unattacked.
                    Concentrated nitric acid, of specific gravity 1 <hi rend="superscript"> -</hi>
                    45, produces the passive condition at once, so that a piece of bright metal may
                    be kept for months immersed in the acid without any action being set up; acid of
                    strength below specific gravity 1 '35, on the other hand, is usually incapable
                    of permitting iron to become or remain passive in contact with it. If, whilst
                    passive and immersed in nitric acid, iron be made the positive pole for a
                    voltaic current sent through the acid, oxygen is evolved from its surface
                    without any oxidation being visible; if on the other hand it be made the
                    negative pole, it immediately loses its passivity, and is attacked by the acid.
                    In consequence of the production of the passive state by contact with
                    concentrated nitric acid, iron is sometimes substituted for carbon or for
                    platinum in the forms of voltaic battery known as Bunsen’s and Grove’s cells.
                    Passivity may also be brought about in iron by heating the bright metal in the
                    flame of a spirit lamp, &amp;c., so as to coat it superficially with a film of
                    oxide.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Preparation of Pure Iron.—</hi> In order to prepare pure iron,
                    special chemical operations must be gone through, of increasing complexity the
                    greater the purity desired. Berzelius obtained a nearly pure fused substance by
                    mixing filings of the purest soft iron of commerce obtainable with about 20 per
                    cent, of pure ferric oxide and some glass powder (free from lead) as a flux, and
                    exposing for an hour to the highest heat of a smith’s forge in a covered
                    crucible; in this Λvay the small quantities of carbon and other impurities still
                    retained by the filings are oxidized, and a button of silvery lustre results, of
                    specific gravity 7 <hi rend="superscript"> -</hi> 844, more tough but softer
                    than ordinary iron. Matthiessen and Szczepanowski found the greatest difficulty
                    in obtaining iron absolutely free from sulphur by means of the ordinary methods
                    for preparing oxide of iron subsequently reduced by pure hydrogen, but
                    ultimately succeeded in obtaining moderately large quantities of metal not
                    containing more than ΟΌ0025 to 0 ’ 0007 per cent, of sulphur by the employment
                    of a specially prepared ferric oxide made by heating together pure ferrous
                    sulphate and sodium sulphate <hi rend="italic">{Brit. Assoc. Reports,</hi> 1868,

                    After reduction in platinum vessels by pure hydrogen, and fusion in lime
                    crucibles by the oxyhydrogen flame fed with purified gases, buttons of metal
                    were obtained absolutely free from phosphorus, silicon, and calcium, and
                    practically free from sulphur. By the electrolysis of as nearly as possible
                    neutral solutions of ferrous chloride, or better of double magnesium ferrous
                    sulphate, iron is thrown down in hard brittle films containing a considerable
                    amount of occluded hydrogen (usually about twenty times its volume); on
                    annealing, the metal becomes soft, malleable, and silvery white, increasing
                    considerably in density, the specific gravity when first deposited, being about
                    7 ’ 67, and rising to 7’81 after annealing; Lenz finds that the amount of
                    hydrogen occluded is greater the thinner the film of metal, the amount rising in
                    the case of a very thin film to upwards of 180 volumes; the metal deprived of
                    the occluded gas by heating in vacuo decomposes water at ordinary temperatures
                    and rusts, partially reabsorbing hydrogen in so doing <hi rend="italic">{Pegg.
                    Aηηaleη,</hi> v. 242, 1870); whereas before the expulsion of the hydrogen by
                    heating in vacuo the iron is highly brittle and of a fine granular texture,
                    showing no crystalline structure under the microscope (being deposited from
                    solutions containing no free acid), after the expulsion of the hydrogen the
                    metal becomes highly tenacious and capable of resisting repeated bending
                    backwards and forwards without rupture; the hardness is lowered from 5 5 to 4‘5
                    on the mineralogical scale, ie., from something between the hardness of felspar
                    and apatite to something between that of apatite and fluorspar. Under certain
                    conditions iron can be obtained in a crystallized state, the crystalline
                    character being far more readily assumed when small quantities of other
                    substances, notably carbon, are present; by reducing ferrous chloride by
                    hydrogen at a red heat, Peligot obtained· the metal in brilliant crystals
                    belonging to the cubic system; by reduction with zinc vapour Poumare&lt;le
                    transformed ferrous chloride into hollow tetrahedra of specific gravity 7’84.
                    Bessemer iron has been obtained in distinct cubic crystals, whilst Percy has
                    observed solid and skeleton octahedra in cast iron. Malleable iron that has been
                    much rolled and forged during its manufacture exhibits on etching with acids a
                    fibrous structure; when pulled asunder by a slowly acting force, this structure
                    is also well seen; if, however, it be transversely ruptured by a suddenly
                    applied force <hi rend="italic">{e.g.,</hi> the impact of a heavy shot on an

                    structure on etching is usually considerably more tough and tenacious than that
                    which is crystalline. A change from the former kind of molecular structure to
                    the latter, producing comparative brittleness, is believed by many to occur with

                    from this fact), the other iron compounds found in nature are far less marked in

                <p>Oxides of iron of all classes are readily acted upon by reducing agents

                    constant conditions than reduction by carbon oxide forming carbon dioxide,

                <p>When ferric oxide is reduced by carbon oxide, a peculiar secondary change is

                    Bell with the present writer’s cooperation <hi rend="italic">(loc. cit.)</hi>;
                    this consists in the reaction of a lower oxide of iron (Fe <hi rend="subscript">
                    2</hi> O ?) formed at a certain stage of the reduction on the carbon oxide
                    forming a higher oxide of iron and setting free carbon;<note anchored="true"

                    portion of carbon oxide, and so on in a cycle, so that after some time the
                    quantity of free carbon deposited largely exceeds the total iron present. This
                    peculiar action is also exhibited by oxides of nickel and cobalt, but apparently
                    by those of no other metals; it has a most remarkable influence upon the nature
                    of the chemical changes ensuing in the process of smelting iron by the blast
                    furnace (§ 19), and is doubtless the chief source of the carbon contained in pig
                    iron thus produced; it is also the main reaction taking place during the
                    conversion of iron into steel by cementation (§ 32).</p>
                <p>Ferrous carbonate differs from most of the other compounds of iron found in
                    nature in being soluble in water, especially when excess of carbonic acid is
                    also present, an “acid carbonate” being formed. Such water on exposure to air
                    forms a rusty deposit of hydrated ferric oxide produced by the combination of
                    the oxygen of the air with the ferrous oxide contained in the ferrous carbonate,
                    the carbon dioxide originally combined therewith being set free. In certain
                    localities large deposits of more or less pure hydrated ferric oxide are thus
                    formed, constituting “bog iron ores.”</p>

                    the iron they contain, and more especially with certain kinds of pyrites on
                    account of the copper, silver, and gold sulphides intermixed therewith. It is to
                    be noticed in connexion with pyrites that, by the action of reducing agents on
                    solutions of iron compounds in presence of sulphates, a slow formation of
                    crystalline FeS <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> often results; thus many fossil
                    plants and animals occur in various strata in which the deposition of pyrites by
                    this means has produced a perfect cast or pseudomorph, so to speak, of the
                    organism; it is probable that the pyritous deposits of large magnitude which
                    exist in various localities have been formed by these agencies, the soluble iron

                <p>3. <hi rend="italic">Relationships between Iron {Malleable and Cast) and
                    Steel.—</hi> Iron possesses the power of uniting with a number of elements,
                    forming products which either are highly intimate mixtures of more than one
                    substance presenting apparent homogeneity, or else are compounds of an
                    indefinite character, <hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> in which the constituents are
                    combined in proportions which do not come under the usual chemical laws of
                    invariableness of composition and of combination in multiple proportions; in
                    short, these iron compounds are substances belonging to the same category as
                    alloys generally and solutions, the placing of which inside or outside the class
                    of true chemical compounds depends on the particular definition of a chemical
                    compound adopted. Probably the most accurate view of the constitution of such
                    substances is that which regards them as being “solidified solutions” of one
                    substance in another (Matthiessen), <hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> when the bodies
                    in question have been fused: the most useful commercial forms of iron are of
                    this class. Thus, for example, iron sulphide and metallic iron fused together in
                    such proportions that the latter greatly predominates form a homogeneous mixture
                    (or solution of irop sulphide in molten iron), which on cooling solidifies as a
                    whole, not exhibiting any tendency to separation t&gt;f the iron and iron
                    sulphide; a product similar but melting more readily is formed if iron sulphide
                    and sulphur be fused together, forming one of the varieties of the so-called
                    “Spence’s metal” recently patented; so that between the extremes of pure iron on
                    the one hand and pure sulphur on the other an apparently homogeneous mass can be
                    obtained containing iron or sulphur in any assignable proportions, the compound
                    being a solidified solution of iron sulphide in either iron or sulphur,
                    according as the former or the latter is in excess. Silicon and phosphorus can
                    be similarly incorporated with excess of iron, forming analogous solidified
                    solutions; the same remark is true for nitrogen and other non-metallic elements,
                    as well as for manganese and many other metals, notably nickel, gold, tin,
                    platinum, rhodium, aluminium, zinc, titanium, tungsten, and chromium. With
                    arsenic and tin definite compounds can be produced expressible by simple
                    formulae, e.y., FeAs (Gehlen) and FeSn (Deville and Caron). When carbon is thus
                    incorporated with iron a peculiar phenomenon is (under certain circumstances)
                    observable which has no parallel with the other compounds, except perhaps to
                    some extent in the case of silicon; this is that, whereas the carbon is in the
                    amorphous condition when first dissolved, yet on long-continued maintenance in
                    the molten state, but more especially on cooling (whilst the substance is still
                    liquid or semisolid), a more or less complete separation of carbon <hi

                    mechanically from a highly crystalline pig iron graphitoidal scales, which
                    consist so entirely of carbon as to leave little or no appreciable residue on
                    combustion.</p></note> often ensues; so that the cooled mass is no longer
                    visibly homogeneous, but consists of granules and crystals, partly of graphite
                    and partly of solidified solution of amorphous carbon (and such other elements
                    as were originally present) in iron. This phenomenon may be compared with a
                    somewhat analogous change undergone by phosphorus: when this element is
                    dissolved in carbon disulphide or certain organic bodies, <hi rend="italic"
                    >e.g.,</hi> ethyl iodide, the phosphorus gradually changes more or less
                    completely into the red variety, which, being insoluble in the menstruum,
                    precipitates in flakes. The amount of carbon which changes during solidification
                    from the amorphous into the graphitoidal variety depends largely on the nature
                    and amount of the substances present along with it dissolved in the iron, and
                    also on the absolute amount of carbon present and on the rate of cooling; it
                    appears to be promoted by the presence of silicon, the greyest irons <hi
                    rend="italic">{cseteris paribus)</hi> being usually the richest in silicon. On
                    remelting graphitoidal cast iron, the graphite is again dissolved, so that by
                    rapidly chilling the fused mass “white” iron results. Under certain conditions
                    silicon appears to extrude from highly silicious irons in cooling, but not in a
                    difficultly oxidizable form, so that the outside of the pigs becomes covered
                    with silica of a peculiar physical aspect (Lowthian Bell, <hi rend="italic"
                    >Journal Iron and Steel Institute,</hi> 1871, i. 44); under other conditions
                    several parts per cent of silicon can be permanently retained by the pig without
                    extrusion on cooling, forming a peculiar metal known as “glazy iron,” bearing to
                    the silicious pig from which silicon does separate much the same relations as
                    highly carbonized white iron bears to grey pig.</p>
                <p>When foreign substances are present in but small quantity (manganese excepted),
                    and the amount of total carbon does not exceed 1 ’ 5 to 2Ό per cent, of the
                    iron, little or no separation of graphitoidal carbon takes place, and the
                    resultant product is tolerably homogeneous, and possesses the properties of <hi
                    rend="italic">steel</hi> more or less soft in proportion as the carbon
                    percentage is minute or otherwise.</p>
                <p>When the carbon amounts to some 2 ’ 5 or upwards per cent, of the iron, and
                    especially when the fused substance is rapidly cooled, the metal often
                    solidifies as an almost homogeneous mass, possessing somewhat different
                    properties from those of good steel; it is then known as <hi rend="italic">white
                    cast iron</hi> (from its colour after fracture); under other conditions,
                    especially when a longer time is allowed for solidification, a more or less
                    complete separation of graphite and consequent production of a coarse-grained
                    crystalline structure results, the product being then termed <hi rend="italic"
                    >grey cast iron,</hi> which consequently stands to white cast iron in much the
                    same relation as devitrified glass (Reaumur’s porcelain) to ordinary glass. When
                    the amount of manganese present is relatively large (constituting several parts
                    per cent, of the iron present), this separation of graphitoidal carbon takes
                    place to but a small or even inappreciable extent; the cooled mass is
                    homogeneous and highly crystalline, the fractured surface exhibiting great
                    brilliancy, whence the term <hi rend="italic">spiegeleisen</hi> applied to such
                    substances. As a rule cast irons, whether white or grey, contain more than
                    traces of impurities, such as sulphur, phosphorus, and silicon; but otherwise no
                    absolute line of demarcation between malleable iron and steel on the one hand,
                    and between steel and white iron on the other, can be drawn, based on the
                    chemical composition; so that it cannot be said that a substance containing so
                    much carbon is malleable iron, and so much more carbon steel, and so much more
                    still cast iron; the definition is purely arbitrary; moreover, the physical
                    qualities of a steel containing a given amount of carbon often differ much,
                    according as the proportion of other substances present varies.</p>
                <p>The ordinary practical test applied todistinguish iron from steel is the
                    ascertaining whether the substance hardens on heating and quenching in cold
                    water, becoming again softened on reheating and cooling slowly: <hi
                    rend="italic">a substance which does this may fairly be regarded as steel</hi>
                    (possibly of very bad quality, but still steel), <hi rend="italic">ιvhilst one
                    which does not may be fairly regarded as a soft iron.</hi> With certain
                    specimens it is difficult thus to classify the substances under either head
                    satisfactorily, whilst such a classification would not be accepted by many who
                    would define a steel as being either the product of the cementation of malleable
                    iron or as a substance that has been <hi rend="italic">fused</hi> during
                    manufacture, and who consequently would not admit that a very hard puddled metal
                    was steel, even though it did harden distinctly on heating and quenching in cold
                    water.</p>

                <p>The following recommendations as to the nomenclature of iron and steel were made
                    by an international committee appointed at Philadelphia in the year 1876 by the
                    American Institute of Mining Engineers, consisting of I. L. Bell, Dr H. Wedding,
                    Professors Tiinner and Akermann, L. Griiner, A. L. Holley, and T. Egleston

                    aggregated from pasty masses or from piles or from any form of iron not in a.
                    fluid state, and which will not sensibly harden and temper, and which generally
                    resemble what is called wrought iron, shall be called <hi rend="italic">weld

                <p>2. That such compounds, when they will from any cause harden and temper, and
                    rvhich resemble what is now called “puddled steel,” shall be called <hi
                    rend="italic">weld steel</hi> (German, <hi rend="italic">Schιctissstahl</hi>;
                    French, <hi rend="italic">acier soudé).</hi></p>
                <p>3. That all compounds of iron, with its ordinary ingredients, which have been
                    cast from a fluid state into malleable masses, and which will not sensibly
                    harden by being quenched with water while at a red heat, shall be called <hi
                    rend="italic">ingot iron</hi> (German, <hi rend="italic">Flusseisen-,</hi>

                <p>Siemens (Lecture to Chemical Society, <hi rend="italic">Journal Chem. Soc.,</hi>
                    1868, p. 284) lays down the aphorism that “no method of producing steel can be
                    considered admissible at the present day which does not pass the metal through
                    the condition of entire liquefaction, for it is only by fusion that foreign
                    admixtures can be thoroughly separated, and that flaws and fissures can be
                    avoided;” which appears to imply that no substance that has not been completely
                    fused should be termed a true steel even though it be susceptible of hardening.
                    Nine years later <hi rend="italic">{Presidential Address to the Iron and Steel
                    Institute,</hi> 1877), in discussing the above proposed definitions of the
                    international committee, he remarks that practical difficulties would be
                    introduced by these definitions; for instance, railway bars, which ordinarily
                    contain from 0 ’ 2 to 0'6 per cent, of carbon, would sometimes be stamped as
                    ingot iron and sometimes as ingot steel; and he further objects that, unless the
                    precise temperature to which the metal is to be heated in order to harden it is
                    specified, and also the cooling medium into which it is plunged, discrepancies
                    will be introduced between the results of tests of the same metal by different
                    experimenters, certain conditions of temperature and cooling material enabling
                    particular classes of metal to take a slight temper, the·which substances would
                    not be hardened by the use of lower temperatures or different cooling materials,
                    <hi rend="italic">e.g.,</hi> oil in lieu of water or msreury.</p>
                <p>In view of the difficulty experienced in defining precisely what is meant at the
                    present day by the terms iron and steel, and the practical inconveniencesand
                    litigation thereby brought about, it has been proposed by Sir Joseph Whitworth
                    and others to disuse the terms “iron’’and “steel” as distinctive marks of
                    quality, and instead to define the metal in terms of its tensile strength and
                    ductility (percentage elongation before rapture). The following table
                    illustrates such a “scale” of qualities, being one employed at Seraing<note

                <p>A tensile strength of 1 kilogramme per square millimetre is about equal to 0 '63
                    tons per square inch, so that on this scale extra soft, soft and semihard, and
                    hard steels have average tensile strengths of about 32, 39, and 55 tons per
                    square inch respectively. Steels of the <hi rend="italic">(a)</hi> class can be
                    bent U" shape without breaking, and will generally allow the two ends of the U
                    to be hammered together without fracture; steels of the (e) class break when the
                    angle of bend reaches to 130°-140°; and the .other classes are intermediate
                    between these limits.</p>
                <p>Hackney has proposed a classification of iron and steel practically identical
                    with this “Seraing scale”; the main objections to such scales are that, as even
                    the softest completely fused metals are thus designated “steel,” the
                    time-honoured definition of steel as being a substance that can be hardened and
                    tempered is wholly done away with; and the circumstance that the numerical
                    values expressing the ductility and tensile strength are variable with the
                    dimensions of the piece of metal tested (§ 43). Much confusion and litigation
                    would be avoided were some name other than ‘ ‘ steel” applied to the modern
                    metals of low carbon percentage obtained by fusion processes, and destitute of
                    the power of taking any considerable amount of temper by heating red hot and
                    rapidly cooling.</p>
                <p>In practically testing a sample of steel, the difference between a specimen that
                    has been prepared by a fusion process and by a process of puddling is usually
                    very manifest when the specimens are slightly etched by dilute nitric acid or
                    other agent that will gradually attack the metal: the fusion product exhibits a
                    regular more or less granular structure, whilst the other exhibits more or less
                    of a fibroid character. On dissolving the metal in cupric chloride (§ 6), a
                    small amount of silicious cinder is left undissolved in the latter case, but
                    practically none with a properly fused steel.</p>
                <p>The presence of <hi rend="italic">sulphur</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >phosphorus</hi> in true steels in other than the most minute proportions
                    exercises a marked deteriorating effect upon the strength and tenacity of the
                    metal, the former substance rendering the steel more or less brittle when hot
                    (red-short or hot-short), the latter causing it to be liable to crack and break
                    when cold (cold-short). The presence of manganese, however, and to some extent
                    of carbon and silicon, modifies the exact amount of effect produced by a given
                    quantity of phosphorus or sulphur; as a general rule it may be said that a steel
                    containing 0 ’ 5 per cent, of carbon and upwards, and also containing more than
                    04 per cent, of sulphur, will be objectionably red-short, and that, if it
                    contain more than 04 per cent, of phosphorus, it will be too cold-short for most
                    applications; whilst a much smaller quantity, as little as 0Ό3 per cent.,
                    renders the steel almost useless for tools and cutting instruments, &amp;c., in
                    which a fine temper is essential. These figures, however, are subject to notable
                    corrections: the presence of manganese to an extent of several times the amount
                    of sulphur present considerably mitigates the evil effect of that substance,
                    whilst, provided the carbon be very low <hi rend="italic">(i.e.</hi><hi
                    rend="italic subscript"> t</hi> that the metal is really not steel at all but
                    only fused iron), much larger quantities of phosphorus than 04 per cent, may be
                    present without deteriorating the properties of the substance to so great an
                    extent as would be occasioned by the presence of much smaller quantities of
                    phosphorus simultaneously with several tenths per cent, of carbon. Thus years
                    ago the practical experience acquired at the Terre Noire works proved that good
                    rails could be made from steel containing about 1 per cent, of manganese and as
                    much as 0 ’ 3 per cent, of phosphorus, provided the carbon did not exceed half
                    that amount; subsequently, good serviceable rails have been rolled not only in
                    England but also in Saxony, Austria, America, and elsewhere, containing 0 <hi
                    rend="superscript"> ,</hi> 3 to nearly 0 ’ 4 per cent, of phosphorus and about
                    half as much of carbon, or less. These “phosphoric steels” (more correctly
                    “homogeneous irons,” fused irons, or “ingot irons ”), however, are wholly
                    unsuitable for all purposes requiring the metal to be tempered, on account of
                    the impossibility of having so much phosphorus present together with more than
                    minute amounts of carbon without producing brittleness and utter inability to be
                    worked.</p>
                <p>The effect of <hi rend="italic">silicon</hi> on the physical qualities of steel
                    is far less marked than that of sulphur and phosphorus. Like that of the latter
                    it is modified by the amount of carbon present: thus Riley has found 2 per cent,
                    of silicon in rails of good quality; Gautier states that a siliconeisen
                    containing upwards of 7 per cent, of silicon, but almost destitute of carbon,
                    could be forged perfectly, whilst a steel containing 1 ’ 5 per cent, of silicon
                    and slightly less than 0 ’ 2 per cent, of carbon (with O ’ 76 of manganese)
                    rolled perfectly and was very strong. The presence of silicon, moreover,
                    conjointly with that of manganese, exerts a remarkable action in diminishing the
                    extrusion of gases from molten steel in the act of solidifying, thereby
                    producing honeycombing; so that when very soft steels are cast into ingots much
                    sounder masses are obtained by the ordinary casting processes <hi rend="italic"
                    >(i.e.,</hi> not under hydraulic or other powerful pressure) when a little
                    siliciuretted metal is added to the steel just before casting than when ordinary
                    rich spiegeleisen or ferro-manganese is employed. On the other hand, when carbon
                    and silicon are simultaneously present to the extent of 0 <hi rend="superscript"
                    > -</hi> 5 to 1Ό per cent, or thereabouts, both hot and cold shortness are
                    brought about to a greater or lesser extent.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Nitrogen</hi> has been supposed by many chemists and especially
                    by Fremy to be an essential constituent of steel; and in favour of this view it
                    is to be noticed that in the preparation of steel by cementation the addition of
                    nitrogenous organic matter (scraps of leather, horn, ferrocyanide of potassium,
                    &amp;c.) is found to facilitate the conversion of bar iron into blister steel.
                    On the other hand this may be due simply to the formation and absorption of
                    cyanogen, which carbonizes the iron without necessarily communicating nitrogen
                    to it. The actual quantity of nitrogen found in steel by various experimenters
                    is always extremely small,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"
                    ><p>From 0Ό11 to 0T8 per cent, of nitrogen was found by Bonis in various
                    specimens of malleable iron, cast iron, and steel; from 0 Ό07 . to 0 '057 per
                    cent, in various steels and wrought irons was found by Boussiugault. By heating
                    metallic iron in ammonia gas much more highly nitrogenized substances can be
                    produced, Fremy having thus obtained substances containing as much as 9 <hi
                    rend="superscript"> -</hi> 8 per cent, of nitrogen. In these and other analogous
                    experiments by others, various methods of analysis were adopted, the most
                    conclusive ones being solution of the metal in pure hydrochloric acid, and
                    determination ot the ammonia freed by the combination of the nascent hydrogen
                    with the nitrogen. Recently A. H. Allen has repeated these experiments, and also
                    made others by passing steam over the red-hot metal, and determining the ammonia
                    produced. The quantity of nitrogen thus obtainable varied from 0’0041 per cent,
                    in spiegeleisen to 0 ’ 0172 per cent, in steel made from Dannemora
                    iron.</p></note> whilst it is possible to produce steel from iron free from
                    nitrogen by cementation in pure carbon oxide, or in an atmosphere of coal gas
                    (Macintosh’s patent),—so that nitrogen is clearly not an essential constituent
                    in these cases. Moreover, nitrogen has been found both in wrought and in cast
                    iron in even larger quantity than in steel, so that the peculiar properties of
                    steel as regards hardening <pb break="no"

                    the presence of this constituent. No connexion between the amount of nitrogen
                    present and the physical properties of the metal, or the amount of carbon or
                    other foreign elements present therein, has as yet been thus established by any
                    experimenter.</p>
                <p>As regards the presence of <hi rend="italic">oxygen</hi> in iron and steel, and
                    its effect on their qualities, little evidence as yet exists. It is well known
                    that certain metals, <hi rend="italic">e.g.,</hi> copper, will dissolve small
                    proportions of oxide, the presence of which renders the metal much less
                    tenacious than it otherwise would be, so that certain operations are usually
                    gone through in the final stages of the extraction of these metals for the
                    purpose of again reducing the oxide disseminated through the mass, <hi
                    rend="italic">e.g.,</hi> “poling” melted copper. The tenacity exhibited by
                    “phosphor-bronze” is largely due to the complete reduction of copper and tin
                    oxides by the phosphorus. This solution of oxide in the metal also takes place
                    with iron, especially when tolerably free from silicon; this element is capable
                    of reducing iron oxide when heated therewith, so that when present the silicon
                    is oxidized in preference to the iron.</p>
                <p>Overblown Bessemer metal is comparatively unforgeable and brittle, so that
                    probably the presence of oxygen affects iron in the same way as sulphur. When
                    iron and steel are overheated for a long time, they become “burnt” and brittle;
                    this is supposed by some to be due to the formation of oxide disseminated
                    through the mass of the metal, but many others consider that a more or less
                    crystalline structure set up under the influence of a softening heat is the sole
                    cause of the diminution in strength and tenacity &lt;§ 43).</p>
                <p>Iron and steel usually give off, on heating under diminished pressure, carbon
                    oxide and more or less hydrogen, and the former gas is largely extruded from
                    steel in the act of solidifying (Bessemer), thereby giving rise to honeycombing
                    of the casting. This is usually attributed to the same cause as the “spitting”
                    of silver, <hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> to a physical inability on the part of
                    the metal to retain in solution at a lower temperature the same amount of gas
                    that it can dissolve when more highly heated; the presence or silicon diminishes
                    this evolution of gas, probably by the decomposition of the carbon oxide with
                    formation of non-gaseous silica. A number of observations and determinations of
                    the gases occluded by and otherwise present in iron and steel have been made by
                    Parry, Troost and Hautefeuille, Miiller, and others, but without leading to any
                    definite correlations between the physical properties of the metals and the
                    gases occluded. Moreover, it does not seem to be absolutely established whether
                    the carbon oxide obtained by heating in an exhausted tube really exists as
                    dissolved gas or as a mixture of oxide and carbide (or solution of carbon); the
                    writer has found that by varying the mode of heating and the temperature
                    variable proportions of carbon oxide and dioxide may be obtained from spongy
                    iron (prepared by heating to a bright red heat ferric oxide in an atmosphere of
                    carbon oxide) when it is heated in connexion with a Sprengel pump; which seems
                    to suggest that a mixture of oxide and carbide is present rather than simply
                    occluded gases.</p>
                <p>Hydrogen when present in iron to a considerable extent appears very considerably
                    to diminish the tenacity and strength; thus electro-deposited iron containing
                    much hydrogen is brittle, but becomes soft and flexible on heating under
                    diminished pressure so as to extract the hydrogen. When iron or steel wires are
                    immersed in dilute sulphuric acid, especially in contact with zinc, so as to
                    evolve hydrogen copiously from the surface of the iron, the wires take up about
                    twenty times their volume of hydrogen, and become so brittle that they break on

                    When steel contains a few tenths per cent, of copper it is distinctly red-short,
                    more so when the proportion is increased (Eggertz). Malleable iron does not seem
                    to be so much affected by copper, 0 ’ 5 per cent, giving but little
                    red-shortness; the welding power is, however, considerably diminished. On the
                    other hand, addition of iron to bronze and similar copper alloys increases their
                    strength and tenacity, as in Aich’s gun-metal and Gedge’s metal. <hi
                    rend="italic">Antimony</hi> acts as injuriously upon iron as sulphur and
                    phosphorus conjointly, a few tenths per cent rendering bar iron highly
                    cold-short and also hot-short. <hi rend="italic">Chromium, tungsten,
                    vanadium,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">titanium</hi> are all apparently capable of
                    increasing the strength of iron more or less after the fashion of carbon, and
                    accordingly have been regarded as valuable constituents in special kinds of iron
                    and steel, <hi rend="italic">e.g.,</hi> the so-called chromium steel and
                    tungsten steel, and the iron containing traces of vanadium employed on the Swiss
                    wire bridges at Freiburg. Faraday and Stodart found that about 1 per cent, of
                    <hi rend="italic">platinum</hi> or certain of its congeners <hi rend="italic"
                    >(e.g., palladium</hi> and <hi rend="italic">rhodium)</hi> improved the
                    toughness of steel, and communicated to it a fine grain. <hi rend="italic"
                    >Hickel</hi> is largely present in meteoric iron <hi rend="italic">(vide
                    infra),</hi> from which knife blades, &amp;c., are readily beaten out, so that
                    the presence of nickel does not appear to diminish materially the malleability
                    of iron.</p>
                <p>The question as to whether the carbon which does not separate in the graphitoidal
                    state on cooling molten cast iron or steel is truly <hi rend="italic"
                    >combined</hi> or not (in the sense in which oxygen is combined in ferric oxide,
                    and not in the sense in which silicate of cobalt may be said to be combined in
                    blue glass to which it gives the colour, or in which sugar is combined with
                    water in syrup) is one about which great divergence of opinion exists. It is
                    usual to speak of this carbon as “combined carbon,” because when the iron or
                    steel is dissolved in an acid (e. <hi rend="italic">g.</hi>, hydrochloric acid),
                    this carbon combines with the evolved hydrogen and escapes as carburetted
                    hydrogen of some kind, whereas the graphitoidal carbon remains behind
                    unaffected; just in the same way the sulphur escapes as sulphuretted hydrogen.
                    It is by no means apparent, however, that carbon if set free in the amorphous
                    condition in a state of excessively fine division and in presence of nascent
                    hydrogen would not forthwith combine with the hydrogen, even though its
                    condition in the iron were only that of a dissolved body; the probability is
                    indeed rather the other way, for such carbon when free and warm is known to be
                    often pyrophoric in the air, whilst the mixture of carbon and partially reduced
                    iron and iron oxide, formed when carbon oxide is allowed to act on feme oxide
                    for some time at a low red heat, evolves hydrogen containing much carburetted
                    hydrogen on treatment with an acid, <hi rend="italic">e.g.,</hi> hydrochloric
                    acid. It is to be remembered also that, whilst definite sulphides of iron are
                    known and are easily obtainable, the same can hardly be said of carbides of
                    iron; it is true that spiegeleisen (manganeseiron alloy) contains a larger
                    amount of so-called combined carbon than ordinary steel, amounts up to 6 per
                    cent, having been found therein; but it hardly follows from this that
                    spiegeleisen and steel, &amp;c., contain a definite carbide, such as Fe <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 4</hi> C, or Fe <hi rend="subscript"> 8</hi> C, which has
                    sometimes been considered as present therein, <hi rend="italic">e.g.,</hi> by
                    Karsten, Gurlt, Mattieu Williams, and others. A compound the constituents of
                    which separate <hi rend="italic">on cooling</hi> would be a very unusual sort of
                    substance, whereas it is well established that by fusing and very rapidly
                    chilling certain kinds of grey cast iron they are more or less converted into
                    white or mottled iron, the amount of “combined” carbon largely increasing, and
                    that of graphite correspondingly decreasing; whilst the converse change can be
                    brought about in some kinds of white iron by fusing and very slowly cooling
                    them, a notable separation of graphite and diminution in the quantity of
                    “combined” carbon present being thus brought about. According to Âkermann fusion
                    is not indispensable, long continued maintenance at a yellow heat sufficing to
                    change white iron into grey.</p>
                <p>In practice the quality of pig iron is to a considerable extent decided by the
                    degree of crystallinity exhibited by it, <hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> by the
                    extent to which graphite has separated out during solidification, and the size
                    of the crystals of this substance and of the solidified partly decarbonized pig
                    iron, the crystallization of which is promoted by the particles of graphite
                    acting as nuclei. Pigs with the largest crystals are known as No. 1; those made
                    up of somewhat smaller but still moderately large crystals, as No. 2;
                    smaller-grained pigs, but still crystalline and grey, arc known as Nos. 3 and 4.
                    The finest grained No. 4 pigs, being usually unsuitable for making castings, and
                    only serviceable for the puddling forge, are designated ‘ ‘ forge 4,” the higher
                    kinds being known generically as “foundry iron.” Sometimes a pig will solidify
                    partly as white iron partly as grey, the crystallization having commenced in
                    patches, but not having spread throughout the whole mass before it solidified;
                    such iron is known as “mottled pig.” The price of market pig iron is regulated
                    by these numbers and the locality of the furnace, <hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi>
                    the nature of the ore from which it is smelted; those brands which are specially
                    free from phosphorus, and are consequently applicable to the preparation of
                    “Bessemer metal” (steel made by the Bessemer-Mushet process—§ 36), are usually
                    designated “Bessemer pig.” Special qualities of white iron free from sulphur and
                    phosphorus and containing several parts per cent, of manganese smelted from
                    spathose and other highly manganiferous ores are known as <hi rend="italic"
                    >spiegeleisen,</hi> from their mirror-like fracture. <hi rend="italic"
                    >Ferro-mαngαnese</hi> is a similar product containing a much larger amount of

                <p>4. <hi rend="italic">Meteoric Iron.—</hi> Metallic iron in a more or less pure
                    condition is occasionally met with in nature, but the supply of metal from this
                    source is wholly inconsiderable. Probably nearly all such substances are of
                    meteoric origin, with the exception of ferruginous metallic platinum. Certain
                    masses of oxidized iron with unoxidized metal in the interior have been found in
                    Saxony and elsewhere; but great doubt exists as to whether these substances are
                    not artificially prepared metal which has rusted exteriorly in the course of
                    time. Near Nery (France), at a spot where a seam of coal had been burning for
                    some time, Mossier found a mass of a very hard steely iron weighing upwards of
                    16 lb, together with smaller lumps, evidently formed by the reducing action of
                    the burning coal on ferruginous matter in the soil and rock. True meteoric iron
                    usually if not invariably contains nickel to the extent of from 1 or 2 parts per
                    100 of iron (as in meteorites analysed by Prout) up to considerably larger
                    amounts. The following analyses of various specimens of meteoric iron consisting
                    wholly or almost entirely of unoxidized substances may be taken as representing
                    the general composition of the substance :—</p>

                <p>Many meteorites consist of nickeliferous iron intermixed with larger or smaller
                    amounts of oxidized minerals, in particular olivine, augite, labradorite, and
                    other silicates, together with chrome ironstone, magnetic pyrites, magnetic
                    oxide of iron, and schreibersite (phosphide of nickel and iron), &amp;c. On
                    solution in acids many of these substances are left undissolved, especially
                    schreibersite; in consequence meteorites of mainly metallic character often
                    exhibit peculiar crystalline figures (something like the “moirée metallique”
                    produced by pouring acids on tinplate) when etched by acids (Wiedmanstadt’s
                    figures). Nordenskjöld has recently shown that many meteorites that have fallen
                    at different times exhibit great uniformity in composition, so that it is highly
                    probable that they all had a common extra-terrestrial origin. Graham found <hi

                    Lenarto iron yielded on heating in vacuo 2'85 times its volume of gas,

                <p>whilst ordinary malleable iron (horse-shoe nails) yielded a rather smaller amount
                    of gas, of which carbon oxide and dioxide constituted the majority; from the
                    fact that he was unable to impregnate ordinary metallic malleable iron with more
                    than about its own volume of hydrogen, whilst this meteoric metal contained
                    upwards of two and a half times its volume of that gas, Graham concluded that
                    the meteorite was derived from a cosmical body possessing a dense atmosphere of
                    hydrogen, such as spectrum analysis indicates as ex» isting in various fixed
                    stars, of which α Lyrae may be taken as a type.</p>
                <p>5. <hi rend="italic">Ores of Iron.—</hi> Cutting instruments of a rough character
                    have been fashioned by savage and semi-savage nations from meteoric iron; but
                    the sources from which the metal is practically extracted are those ores in
                    which the metallic properties of the element are masked by its combination with
                    non-metallic substances. These ores are essentially divisible into three
                    classes, viz., those respectively in which the iron exists as sulphide, as
                    carbonate, and as oxide. The first class of ore is best exemplified by <hi
                    rend="italic">pyrites</hi> or iron disulphide, FeS <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi>;
                    comparatively little iron is directly pro duced from ores of this class,
                    although the impure ferric oxide obtained from the residue left in the vitriol
                    works after combustion of pyrites and extraction of copper from the residue,
                    known as “purple ore” or “blue billy,” is utilized as “fettling” in the puddling
                    operation, and has sometimes been employed on the spot where it is produced as a
                    source of finely divided metallic iron for the precipitation of the more
                    valuable copper, the reduction being simply effected by heating together the
                    iron oxide and small coal, or by passing over the heated oxide reducing gases
                    prepared by the partial combustion of coal or other fuel, &amp;c. It may be
                    noticed in passing that the <hi rend="italic">ferrum</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >redactum</hi> of pharmacy, or spongy metallic iron, is produced in much the
                    same way, purer materials being employed, ordinarily a pure ferric oxide or
                    hydrated ferric oxide and hydrogen gas; and that several methods for the
                    reduction of iron on a manufacturing scale from various ores based on the same
                    principle have been attempted hitherto without much commercial success (§ 30).
                    The ores in which iron exists as carbonate, FeCO <hi rend="subscript"> 3</hi>,
                    are essentially of two kinds, viz., those in which the ferrous carbonate is
                    crystalline and but little admixed with earthy matters, and those in which a
                    larger or smaller amount of clayey matter is intimately intermixed with the
                    ferruginous compound: the former class is generally termed <hi rend="italic"
                    >spathic iron ore</hi> (sparry ore, siderite, spathose), and often contains a
                    notable amount of magnesium or of manganese carbonate; the latter class is from
                    its texture and appearance generally spoken of as <hi rend="italic">clay
                    ironstone</hi> or <hi rend="italic">argillaceous iron ore.</hi> Large deposits
                    of a variety of clay ironstone exist in the Coal Measures, frequently
                    alternating with layers of carbonaceous matter, whence the term <hi
                    rend="italic">blackband</hi> is applied to this variety. In many cases deposits
                    of spathose and of clay ironstone have become more or less altered by the action
                    of air and moisture, the effect of which is to convert ferrous carbonate into
                    ferric oxide; in other instances by the action of heat derived from the
                    underlying strata by conduction, or due to trap dykes and analogous volcanic
                    agency, the ferrous carbonate is more or less completely converted into an iron
                    oxide akin to magnetic oxide,—so that the deposits of spathose ore or clay
                    ironstone shade off in places into deposits of the iron oxide class.</p>
                <p>The third class of iron ores in which the iron exists as oxide may be divided
                    into three subclasses, viz., those in which the iron respectively exists as
                    anhydrous ferric oxide, Fe <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> O <hi rend="subscript">
                    3</hi>, as hydrated ferric oxide, Fe <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> O <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 3</hi>,H <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> O, or other hydrate, and
                    as ferrous and ferric oxides combined, of which magnetic oxide of iron Fe <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 3</hi> O <hi rend="subscript"> 4</hi> is the type. To the
                    first division belong the <hi rend="italic">red</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >haematite</hi> and <hi rend="italic">specular</hi> ores, to the second <hi
                    rend="italic">brown</hi><hi rend="italic">haematite</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >bog iron ore,</hi> and to the third the <hi rend="italic">magnetic iron
                    ore</hi> properly so called, or <hi rend="italic">loadstone,</hi> and various
                    modifications of this found in different localities, and usually also designated
                    as magnetic ore, although frequently not possessed of strongly marked magnetic
                    properties, and also the <hi rend="italic">ironsands</hi> of India, New Zealand,
                    St Lawrence, and elsewhere. These latter are usually almost pure Fe <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 3</hi> O <hi rend="subscript"> 4</hi>, intermixed with more or
                    less silicious matter (often titaniferous), and are distinguished by their
                    remarkable freedom from tendency to take up oxygen and pass into the state of
                    ferric oxide, the which property is not by any means possessed to an equal
                    extent by all so-called magnetic ores; just as deposits of ferrous carbonate by
                    the action of heat, air, and moisture become changed, so beds of ore exhibiting
                    in the main a composition akin to that of magnetic oxide of iron often contain
                    portions which have become converted by similar agencies into ores more
                    resembling red or brown haematite. Owing also to the variable intermixture of
                    gangue of various kinds with the veins of iron ore, the physical properties of
                    the substances become more or less altered, so that it is often difficult to <pb
                    break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit13newyrich/page/n301/mode/1up"

                    general terms.</p>
                <p>According to the nature and amount of the admixed substances, the value of the
                    ore varies largely. The presence of certain impurities, notably of phosphorus,
                    in more than minute quantity prevents the use of certain ores for particular
                    purposes, and thus reduces their value; the admixture of particular kinds of
                    gangue in other cases renders the ores unsuitable for working in the same kind
                    of way that would otherwise be advantageous; in smelting such ores by means of a
                    blast furnace different kinds and amounts of flux for the earthy impurities are
                    requisite in different cases, thus affecting the cost of production, —so that in
                    fine the value of an ore is by no means necessarily proportionate to the amount
                    of actual iron present therein. The following table gives a rough idea of the
                    general composition and characters of the leading classes of iron ores, such as
                    are in actual use as sources of metal :—</p>

                    structure; softer varieties are known as “red ochre” and “puddlers’ ore,” owing
                    to their use for “fettling” puddling furnaces and’as pigments, and are of
                    unctuous consistency almost earthy in character. ‘ ’ Specular ore” is a hard
                    well-crystallized form, deriving its name from the brightness of the surface of
                    its crystals, which appear dark grey or black by reflected light; this variety
                    is well exemplified by the Elba ore; its specific gravity is near 5 ‘0, the
                    crystalline, system being the hexagonal. “Titaniferous iron ore” or “ilmenite”
                    resembles specular ore in appearance and crystalline form; it is more strictly a
                    variety of magnetic ore, however, inasmuch as it usually contains a considerable
                    amount of ferrous oxide; the ferrous titanate present may on the other hand be
                    regarded as FeTiO <hi rend="subscript"> 3</hi>, or Fe <hi rend="subscript">
                    i</hi> O <hi rend="subscript"> 3</hi>, in which half of the iron is replaced by
                    titanium; whilst some of the ferrous iron is frequently replaced by magnesium.
                    “Micaceous iron ore” is a crystalline scaly substance which, when of sufficient
                    brilliancy, forms a good pigment for ironwork, known as ‘ ‘ minium de fer.” Asa
                    rule haematites are considerably free from phosphorus and sulphur; various
                    haematitic deposits in Spain, however, have been found by the writer and others
                    to contain large amounts of phosphorus, sometimes to the extent of several parts
                    per cent, of that element in relation to the iron; whilst occasionally pyrites
                    veins are found in haematite beds. The chief haematitic ores worked are those
                    from Cumberland and North Lancashire (Ulversion, Furness, Whitehaven, &amp;c.);
                    from Sweden and Norway (Dalkarlsberg, Uto, &amp;c.); from Liege, Saxony, the
                    Harz, Silesia, and Austria; from Elba and Brazil (specular ore); and from
                    Missouri (Iron Mountain, Pilot Knob), Lake Superior, Ohio, Tennessee, and
                    Alabama; many other deposits, however, exist, this class of ore being very
                    widely spread; thus it is found in some quantity in Cornwall (Restormel),
                    Brixham, Ayrshire, Glamorganshire, North Wales, the Isle of Man, the Erzgebirge,
                    Russia, Spain, &amp;c. Haematitic ores are usually found in the older geological
                    formations, especially the Huronian, Cambrian, Silurian, Devonian, and
                    Carboniferous rocks; in many cases they are distinctly of sedimentary character,
                    <hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> they have obviously been deposited by aqueous
                    agency. Some deposits have probably been originally thrown down either as ferric
                    oxide detritus from the abrasion of rocks, &amp;c., containing ferruginous
                    matter, or as hydrated oxide from the oxidation of water containing ferrous
                    carbonate in solution, the ochreous deposits thus formed having been rendered
                    more or less completely anhydrous and indurated by the long-continued effect of
                    pressure and the conduction of the internal heat of the earth to them. The
                    Cumberland haematite largely occurs in pockets in Carboniferous Limestone, and
                    has doubtless been produced by the latter kind of agency, the cavities of the
                    limestone rock becoming gradually filled up by the deposition of iron oxide. Red
                    sandstones, on the other hand, represent deposits of ferric oxide thrown down
                    simultaneously with much sand; whilst the earthy varieties of haematite have
                    probably been less indurated by heat and pressure, and were doubtless formed by
                    deposition from water containing clayey matters in suspension to a greater or
                    lesser extent. The Alabama deposits exhibit distinct stratification, forming a
                    bed between the Coal Measures and the Devonian Limestone upwards of 100 feet in
                    thickness, and several square miles in extent. In Cornwall, North Wales, and
                    especially in the Lake Superior and Missouri districts, the haematitic deposits
                    form large veins and lodes. The specular ores of Elba, Sweden, Missouri, and
                    elsewhere usually occur as massive deposits; portions of the latter occasionally
                    show the passage of spathose ore into specular ore (Snelus), suggesting the
                    effect of heat accompanied by oxidizing action. Occasionally brown haematite is
                    found passing into red, indicating gradual dehydration more complete in one
                    portion of the deposit than in another. The following analyses illustrate the
                    composition of some haematites :—</p>

                    haematite, and is found of the most varied degrees of purity. Many deposits have
                    been apparently formed by the alteration of argillaceous ferrous carbonate;
                    others form superficial sandy beds produced by the deposition of ochreous
                    matters from solution either by purely chemical action, such as the oxidation of
                    dissolved ferrous carbonate, or by the action of organized beings, especially

                    much earthy matters are contained in this class of ores, together with
                    considerable amounts of sulphur and phosphorus; certain deposits found in Spain
                    and Africa (Bilbao and Marbella ores, &amp;c.) are, however, often considerably
                    free from these objectionable ingredients. Usually brown haematites are
                    distinctly of sedimentary character, forming beds; but they often occur also as
                    veins, especially in the older formations, doubtless deposited (often along with
                    other minerals, <hi rend="italic">e.g.,</hi> copper ores) from water flowing
                    through the cracks and crevices of the rocks. Sometimes the brown colour is much
                    lightened, the tint being almost red and sometimes even yellow. In texture these
                    ores usually differ considerably from the more compact kinds of red haematite,
                    being cindery, earthy, or sandy in character, and only comparatively rarely
                    massive, save when they have been subjected to indurating and compressing
                    influences since their deposition, in which case they have usually lost water
                    and become partially converted into something more like red haematite. Sometimes
                    a definitely crystallized hydrate, Fe <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> O <hi

                    scaly minerals of the same composition have also been described under the names
                    of lepidocrocite, &amp;c. The larger deposits of brown haematite are found in
                    the Secondary and <pb break="no"

                    considerable ones occur among the Coal Measures and Carboniferous Limestone; the
                    Oolite, Lias, Jurassic, Greensand, and Wealden formations of England especially
                    Northamptonshire and adjacent counties), and of France ( Boulogne and the
                    Ardèche), Luxembourg, Bavaria, and Wurtemberg, contain deposits often of
                    considerable magnitude and extent, which occasionally show distinct passage into
                    reel haematite, and often passage of clay ironstone into brown haematite. Bog
                    and lake ores are considered by Ehrenberg to be mostly formed by infusorial
                    agency; on the dredging up of deposits of this kind (occurring in nodules and
                    granular concretions), a new formation of lumps is often found to occur after
                    the lapse of some years. In some cases these deposits are of large magnitude,
                    <hi rend="italic">e.g.,</hi> those of Finland, Sweden, Norway, and Three Rivers
                    (Canada). Pisolitic concretionary masses of a variety of brown haematite are
                    found sometimes in large quantity in the German Oolites, and elsewhere in the
                    cavities and crevices of limestones; these have been probably formed by
                    deposition from water percolating through the rock, and the aggregation together
                    of the ferric oxide thus thrown down, and the earthy matters also in suspension.

                <p><hi rend="italic">Magnetic Iron Gres.—</hi> The substances most nearly
                    approaching to the composition Fe3O <hi rend="subscript"> 4</hi> sometimes occur
                    well-crystallized in forms belonging to the cubic system, and possessing a
                    semi-metallic lustre; in the mineral <hi rend="italic">franklinite</hi> (found
                    in large quantities in New Jersey) the ferrous oxide present is largely replaced
                    by zinc and manganese oxides without altering the crystalline shape (usually
                    octahedral). The purest magnetites are strongly magnetic, and often show
                    polarity, then constituting <hi rend="italic">loadstone·,</hi> they differ from
                    haematites in the colour of the streak, magnetic ore yielding a black, red
                    haematite and specular iron a red, and brown haematite a brown streak; the
                    specific gravity is about the same as that of compact red haematite, viz., near
                    to 5'0, while brown haematites are usually considerably less dense, their
                    specific gravity being near to 4 '2. Massive deposits are found in the older
                    formations in Sweden and Norway (crystalline limestones, talcose schists, and
                    diorites), North America (Laurentian series), the Ural mountains (doleritic
                    porphyry), and Mexico (Cerro Mercado—felspathic porphyry); whilst considerable
                    amounts are also found in somewhat more recent formations, <hi rend="italic"
                    >e.g.,</hi> in Piedmont (Traversella—talcose schists and dolomites), Spain,
                    northern India, and Saxony (Berggieshiibel); in England only comparatively small
                    quantities are found, notably at Rosedale (Yorkshire) and Brent and Dartmoor
                    (Devonshire). The mines of Dannemora (southern Sweden) and Gellivara (Swedish
                    Lapland) are of great antiquity, the iron produced from the ore thence raised
                    being of the finest quality (partly owing to the use of charcoal in smelting);
                    the Indian mines have also been a source of wootz for some two thousand years at
                    least, whilst the Traversella deposits have been worked from time immemorial.
                    Notable amounts of magnetic ore also occur in various parts of France, Germany,
                    Spain, Portugal, North Africa, Greece, Australia, and Brazil; whilst in New
                    Zealand (Taranaki), as also in the Bay of Naples, and especially along the
                    north-east coast of British America and Labrador, enormous quantities of “iron
                    sand” occur along the beach, derived from the disintegration of rocks containing
                    crystalline magnetic oxide of iron (usually more or less titaniferous); this
                    variety of magnetic oxide is capable of resisting indefinitely the oxidizing
                    effect of air and water, and from its hardness and density becomes mechanically
                    separated from the felspathic and silicious particles of matrix simultaneously
                    formed during the erosion of the rocks; owing to its great freedom from sulphur
                    and phosphorus, it is practicable to obtain from it (by the aid of charcoal) the
                    finest qualities of iron. It has been supposed by some that the presence of
                    titanium in the ore communicates special qualities to the steel thence prepared;
                    but evidence in proof of this is requisite, inasmuch as it seems that the
                    titanium present in the pig iron smelted from titaniferous ores, to the extent
                    of some tenths per cent, or more, becomes eliminated during the transformation
                    into malleable iron and steel just as silicon is similarly oxidized and removed.

                    ore :—</p>

                <p><hi rend="italic">Spathose Iron Ores.—</hi> Ferrous carbonate, being isomorphous
                    with magnesium, manganese, and calcium carbonates, frequently occurs
                    crystallized either by itself as <hi rend="italic">siderite</hi> or with large
                    intermixture of one or the other of these salts; when manganese is present to
                    any considerable extent, the ores are more especially suitable for the
                    production of spiegeleisen and ferro-manganese, especially when they contain
                    little or no phosphorus. In Great Britain the chief deposits are those of
                    Weardale (Carboniferous Limestone), Alston Moor (Cumberland), Brendon hills
                    (Somerset), and Exmoor (Devonshire); these frequently show passage of the
                    mineral into brown haematite by oxidation through access of air and moisture.
                    Large massive deposits are found in Germany (Stahlberg near Müsen, Westphalia),
                    Styria (Eisenerz), Thuringia, and Carinthia, mostly in rocks of the Devonian
                    period or thereabouts, and sometimes constituting almost entire mountains; also
                    in the Basque provinces, the Pyrenees, South Spain, and Nova Scotia. These ores
                    are as a rule extremely free from phosphorus and sulphur, whence they are
                    largely employed for the manufacture of malleable iron, steel, and spiegeleisen
                    of high qualities; they are of notably less density than compact haematite or
                    magnetite, usually possessing a specific gravity of near 3 <hi

                <p><hi rend="italic">Clay Ironstone.—</hi> When ferrous carbonate occurs largely
                    mixed with clayey matter, the crystalline structure is usually non-apparent;
                    frequently so much calcium carbonate is also present as to make the ores useless
                    for smelting purposes except when intermixed with others, the calcareous matter
                    then serving as flux; nodules of this poor or· “lean” ironstone found in the
                    London clay and elsewdιere are, however, largely used in the manufacture of
                    cements, and hence are often known as <hi rend="italic">cement stones.</hi> The
                    largest deposits of clay ironstone are found in the Coal Measures, and often
                    exhibit distinct stratification, fossils being not unfrequently met with,
                    especially in the nodular varieties; <hi rend="italic">blackband</hi> ores
                    (layers of ironstone and clay alternating with coaly matter) are largely found
                    in Staffordshire, Wales, and Scotland, and to some extent in the Rhenish and

                    is not present in any considerable quantity, clay ironstone forms a dark
                    bluish-grey or greyish-yellow mass, sometimes forming layers of nodules,
                    sometimes distinctly bedded deposits of large area, <hi rend="italic">e.g.,</hi>
                    the Cleveland beds of North Yorkshire, the ores of Glamorganshire, Shropshire,
                    Derbyshire, France, Westphalia, and various parts of the United States, notably
                    Alabama, Tennessee, Kentucky, Ohio, and Pennsylvania. Curiously, although an
                    ordinary concomitant of coalfields, clay ironstone is almost entirely absent
                    from the Coal Measures of Durham and Northumberland. In many localities clay
                    ironstone has become so changed by oxidizing and hydrating influences as to
                    contain but little ferrous carbonate, the iron being converted into a hydrate,
                    giving to the ore the character of a brown haematite; this is specially
                    noticeable in the Northamptonshire deposits, most of which are usually classed
                    as brown haematite, although containing some amount of carbonate, whilst
                    occasionally ferrous carbonate is found in them having undergone but little
                    alteration, and forming a clay ironstone closely resembling that of Cleveland.
                    As a rule Coal-Measure ironstones are somewhat highly phosphorized; this is
                    especially noticeable with the Cleveland ore, which usually yields on smelting a
                    pig iron containing between 1 and 2 parts of phosphorus per 100 of iron. The
                    following table illustrates the composition of some of the more important clay

                    directly by the smelter as a source of iron; but the residue left after burning
                    pyrites to make vitriol and extracting copper from the residue by Henderson’s
                    process consists almost entirely of ferric oxide, and from its physical
                    characters is valuable as fettling for puddling furnaces; so that the iron
                    contained in the pyrites ultimately becomes largely reduced to the metallic
                    state, either in the puddling furnace itself, or subsequently from the tap
                    cinder produced therein on its being smelted in combination with other ores. The
                    cupreous pyrites of Spain and Portugal (Huelva and Tharsis ores), and certain

                <p>A valuable report on the character of various British iron ores is to be found in
                    the <hi rend="italic">Journal of the Iron and Steel Institute,</hi> 1871, whilst
                    numerous analyses and descriptions of ores from almost all parts of the world
                    are given in the volumes published during the last ten years or so.</p>
                <p>6. <hi rend="italic">Analysis of Iron Ores and of Metallic Iron and Steel.</hi>
                    —The analysis of iron ores by the “dry method” (fusing with reducing agents,
                    such as powdered charcoal, and suitable fluxes, and weighing the button of cast
                    iron produced) has the advantage of giving in a comparatively short time a
                    notion both of the amount of iron contained in the ore and of the presence or
                    absence of phosphorus, manganese, &amp;c. (judged of by the physical characters
                    of the button), but has little to recommend it on the score of minute accuracy.
                    The results are usually in excess of the iron actually present by to <hi
                    rend="subscript"> τ</hi> θ- <hi rend="subscript"> π</hi>, on account of the
                    button containing carbon, Ac.; whilst it does not by any means necessarily
                    follow that the reduction of a given ore on the small scale in a crucible and on
                    the large scale in a furnace will produce a metal of the same characters in each
                    case. Accordingly the “wet method” of analysis (solution in appropriate solvents
                    and separation of the various constituents from one another or other treatment
                    equivalent thereto) is ordinarily preferred.</p>
                <p>The ore, after being finely pulverized and sifted, &amp;c., and representing a
                    fair average sample of the material operated on, is dissolved in hydrochloric
                    acid (if this fails by itself to produce ready solution, the ore may be heated
                    to a low red heat in hydrogen so as to reduce to the metallic state, and then
                    dissolved in hydrochloric acid); the ferric salt present is then reduced to the
                    ferrous state by nascent hydrogen (evolved by adding fragments of pure zinc or
                    other reducing agents, such as sulphur dioxide), and the amount of iron
                    contained in the fluid determined either by adding a standard solution of
                    potassium permanganate to the diluted flüid until a pink tint just appears
                    (Marguerite), or by adding standard potassium dichromate solution until a drop
                    of fluid just ceases to form a blue precipitate or greenish colour with
                    potassium ferricyanide (Penny); the oxygen communicated by the test fluid being
                    known from the volume of liquid consumed, the amount of iron peroxidized is
                    known. When the ores contain iron in both the ferrous and ferric states, and the
                    amount of each is required to be determined, the ore is boiled with hydrochloric
                    acid, and the ferrous salt determined in one part of the solution, and the total
                    iron in another portion. If the iron exist wholly or partially as carbonate, the
                    amount of <hi rend="italic">carbon dioxide</hi> may be determined by treating
                    the finely pulverized ore with sulphuric acid in a suitably constructed
                    apparatus, and weighing the apparatus after the (completely dried) gas has been
                    wholly removed, or by absorbing the evolved gas in ammonia, boiling with calcium
                    chloride, and weighing the precipitated calcium carbonate, a correction being
                    made by means of a blank experiment for any ammonium carbonate originally
                    present in the ammonia solution, or formed by absorption of carbonic acid from
                    the air during the operation. <hi rend="italic">Manganese</hi> is conveniently
                    determined by dissolving the ore, peroxidizing if necessary, rendering nearly
                    neutral, and boiling with sodium or ammonium acetate, whereby all iron and
                    alumina present are thrown down as basic acetates, carrying with them all the
                    phosphoric acid which is in solution; to this filtrate bromine is added (or it
                    is saturated with chlorine), and the whole allowed to stand in not too cold a

                    >Phosphorus</hi> may be determined by dissolving the ore in aqua regia (usually
                    the phosphorus exists as phosphate, and is wholly dissolved by hydrochloric
                    acid), precipitating the phosphoric acid (best after separation of dissolved
                    silica by evaporation to dryness and re-solution in dilute acid) in combination
                    with part of the iron, by reducing most but not all the iron to the ferrous
                    state, and then precipitating the ferric iron and phosphoric acid by boiling
                    with an acetate; the precipitate is finally converted into magnesium
                    pyrophosphate by solution in hydrochloric acid, addition of citric acid (less
                    conveniently tartaric acid), ammonia, and magnesia liquor, and ignition of the
                    precipitate collected after standing twenty-four hours; Eggertz’s method of
                    determining phosphoric acid is, however, more suitable for the estimation of
                    minute quantities, this depending on the precipitation by molybdic acid of a
                    peculiar yellow crystalline phosphomolybdate of ammonium on bringing together
                    the phosphoric acid solution (from which dissolved silica has been removed by
                    evaporation to dryness) and excess of molybdate of ammonium solution

                <p>The analysis of iron and steel is carried out on much the same lines as that of
                    iron ores. The metal being dissolved in nitric acid or aqua regia, <hi

                    Eggertz’s process, the acid solution being previously evaporated to dryness and
                    treated with dilute hydrochloric acid, which leaves behind <hi rend="italic"
                    >silica</hi> formed from the <hi rend="italic">silicon</hi> present, <hi

                    burn off graphite, the silica is dissolved out by sodium carbonate solution and
                    the residual slag weighed; in this way, however, more silica is generally
                    obtained than represents the silicon originally present, as the silicates of the
                    slag are apt to be more or less attacked by the acid; a better method for the
                    determination of the slag is to dissolve the iron in bromine or iodine water, or
                    by means of copper chloride (or mixed copper sulphate and ammonium chloride
                    solution), which gives rise to cuprous chloride, dissolved out by heating; the
                    slag is thus left undissolved, and may be weighed after boiling with sodium
                    carbonate; the silica in the united sodium carbonate and bromine solutions being
                    determined, the silicon is readily calculable. <hi rend="italic">Manganese</hi>
                    is determined just as in the case of ores. <hi rend="italic">Sulphur</hi> is
                    conveniently determined by treating with hydrochloric acid, and leading the
                    evolved gases through a solution of lead or silver or some analogous metal, and
                    finally converting the precipitated sulphide into barium sulphate; or by
                    dissolving in aqua regia, evaporating, and converting the sulphuric acid found
                    into barium sulphate: this method usually gives lower values than the others,
                    barium sulphate not precipitating readily from very dilute highly acid
                    solutions. The so-called <hi rend="italic">“combined” carbon</hi> is found by
                    determining the <hi rend="italic">graphite</hi> left undissolved during the
                    treatment of the metal with hydrochloric acid (by collection and burning to CO
                    <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> in oxygen, and absorption in caustic potash), and
                    subtracting the amount from the <hi rend="italic">total carbon</hi> found by
                    digesting with copper sulphate or chloride, or with bromine water, collection of
                    the undissolved mass on an asbestos filter, and burning in oxygen, preferably
                    with lead chromate in the front of the tube, to prevent chlorine or bromine
                    vapours, &amp;c., passing over, should the precipitate contain (through
                    insufficient washing, &amp;c.) substances which may evolve chlorine or bromine.
                    Copper sulphate leaves behind an amount of copper equivalent to the iron
                    dissolved; this covers up the finely divided particles of carbon, and diminishes
                    the chance of pyrophoric oxidation and consequent loss of carbon during drying,
                    which may otherwise occasionally take place, especially when the filter is dried
                    by the aid of heat; but the solution of the iron is less rapid, and it is
                    difficult to see or feel with a glass rod when all the iron is dissolved. Weyl
                    dissolves the iron by making it the positive pole of a weak galvanic current
                    passing through hydrochloric acid. Fresenius determines the “combined” carbon
                    directly by dissolving in hydrochloric acid, passing the evolved hydrogen and
                    carburetted hydrogen over red-hot copper oxide, and determining the carbon
                    dioxide formed by absorption in potash as usual; if much sulphur is present,
                    lead chromate should be employed to avoid errors due to formation of sulphur
                    dioxide; if the amount of “combined” carbon is large, liquid non-volatile
                    hydrocarbons are apt to be formed, which causes the method to yield too low a
                    result. Ullgren determines the total carbon by oxidation to CO <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 2</hi> in the wet way with chromic and sulphuric acids of the
                    residue left after treatment with copper chloride or bromine; the results are
                    apt to be too low, owing to incomplete oxidation of the graphite. Régnault
                    determines the total carbon by heating the finely powdered metal with copper
                    oxide or lead chromate, and absorbing the CO <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi>
                    produced by potash; by passing air over the finely divided metal at a low red
                    heat, and when the ' oxidation is nearly complete finishing the operation in
                    oxygen at a somewhat higher temperature, the use of copper oxide or lead
                    chromate is rendered unnecessary; if too high a temperature and oxygen be
                    employed at first, there is risk of forming fusible Fe <hi rend="subscript">
                    3</hi> O <hi rend="subscript"> 4</hi> and of enclosing portions of carbonized
                    unoxidized metal within a coating of that substance, which more or less protects
                    it from the action of the oxygen, and tends to decrease the amount of CO <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 2</hi> collected. Eggertz determines the “combined” carbon in
                    steel by solution of a known amount of borings or filings in a known amount of
                    nitric acid, and comparison of the fluid as regards its colour with a similar
                    solution prepared from steel of a known carbon percentage, cr with a series of
                    solutions of caramel made so as to exhibit the same tints as those yielded by
                    steels of known carbon percentage when treated in this way. The principle of the
                    method depends on the formation of soluble humus-like carbon compounds by the
                    action of the nitric acid, probably analogous to the vegetable colouring matter
                    of peaty water. Opinions differ widely amongst chemists as to the absolute
                    accuracy of the method for general analytical operations, especially where
                    nothing is known of the precise details of the mode of manufacture of the steel;
                    but for a works laboratory, where speed is essential, and where it is only
                    required to compare one specimen of steel with another one prepared in the same
                    way but harder (the hardest steels being taken for the preparation of the
                    standards, and the solutions representing the lower carbon percentages being
                    obtained by diluting the fluid proportionately), the method is invaluable. For
                    the sake of saving time under analogous circumstances, Eggertz somewhat modifies
                    the above-described methods for the determination of sulphur and phosphorus, the
                    amount of sulphur present being estimated by noting the discoloration produced
                    on a plate of silver exposed to the gases evolved on solution in hydrochloric
                    acid, or digestion with sulphuric acid, and comparing it with that produced
                    under the same conditions from a metal of a known degree of sulphurization, and
                    the amount of phosphorus being estimated by transferring the phospho-molybdic
                    precipitate into a narrow measuring tube, and observing the volume occupied by
                    it comparatively with that occupied by the precipitate similarly produced from
                    metal containing a known amount of phosphorus. Sir J. Alleyne has described a
                    method of determining approximately the quantity of phosphorus present in iron
                    and steel by means of the spectroscope <hi rend="italic">(Journal I. and S.

                    so numerous as to leave no room for doubt as to the extreme antiquity of the use
                    of that metal instead of the yet earlier stone implements of primeval man. There
                    is every reason to believe that the earliest methods of iron smelting
                    essentially consisted in placing lumps of ore in a fire of wood or charcoal,
                    and, after the lapse of a sufficient length of time to permit of their more or
                    less complete reduction, hammer-_ ing the mass of spongy metal thus formed; so
                    that what is known as the “Catalan forge” of modern times is but a comparatively
                    slight modification of and improvement upon the oldest metallurgical appliances
                    for the extraction of iron, the main difference being in the size of the
                    apparatus and the use of an artificial air blast. Tradition assigns a very
                    remote period to the first discovery of the possibility of extracting iron or
                    crude steel from its ores, Tubal Cain (who has been compared with Vulcan) being
                    the first name mentioned in connexion with the metallurgy of this substance. In
                    the time of the Assyrians iron appears to have been in somewhat extensive use,
                    saws, knives, and other analogous tools having been found by Layard at Nineveh,
                    many of which are very similar to those in use at the present day. Both Homer
                    and Hesiod refer to the forging of iron, whilst the hardening and tempering of
                    steel also appear to have been operations in common use amongst the early
                    Greeks; indeed the employment of a rough kind of bellows for the forging of
                    tools (probably of iron) is figured in Egyptian sculpture of 1500 years and
                    upwards <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.,</hi> —the inflation being accomplished by the

                    by some almost savage Eastern nations, <hi rend="italic">e.g.,</hi> the Burmese.
                    In the time of Pliny (about 50 A.D.) the existence of large masses of iron ore
                    in Spain, Elba, Styria, and elsewhere was well known, these minerals being
                    described by him as largely employed in the manufacture of iron and steel;
                    whilst evidently the conditions requisite to produce the best temper of the
                    latter had been carefully examined at that epoch, as he states that the quality
                    of the steel depends on the nature of the water used to harden it, and that oil
                    is preferable for small articles. Prior to this the discovery of cast iron or
                    cast steel appears to have been made, for Aristotle (about 350 <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi>) describes the preparation of the fused or fritted
                    steely iron still prepared in India and known as <hi rend="italic">u)ootz,</hi>
                    whilst Galen refers to cutting knives made of this steel, and mentions that they
                    are apt to be brittle through excessive hardness. Through the agency of the
                    Romans the manufacture of iron was introduced almost all over the then known
                    world, and into those regions where it had not been previously practised; this,
                    however, does not appear to have been the case with Britain, as the use of iron
                    was probably known there before the Roman invasion; the knowledge, however, may
                    very possibly have been originally derived from the Romans through the
                    Gauls.</p>
                <p>The earliest kind of iron forge or bloomery was probably simply an excavation on
                    the windward side of a hill; the application of an artificial stream of air
                    doubtless soon followed, the blast being either produced by the alternate
                    dilatation and compression of a bladder or goat skins, &amp;c. (as still
                    practised in India and elsewhere), or by means of a fan propelling air through a
                    hollow tube, the fan developing into a kind of loosely fitting piston as still
                    employed in Orissa, Borneo, Madagascar, and elsew∣herβ; so that the modern
                    bellows and cylinder blowing machine are mere⅞y advanced and improved forms of
                    these crude contrivances. The construction of a clay chamber to contain the fuel
                    and ore, with the employment of a tuyere at the base, so as to be independent of
                    the direction of the wind and of the nature of the ground, was doubtless an
                    early improvement, and probably was the kind of forge used by the Romans, as it
                    still is substantially that used by various Eastern races.<note anchored="true"

                    bellows is uncertain, although it is known that such blowing machines were in
                    use in the Harz and elsewhere about the beginning of the 17th century. The date
                    of the invention of the <hi rend="italic">trompe</hi> (or air blast, due to the
                    fall of water and the carrying down of air with it) is also uncertain, but was
                    probably a little later, near 1640 (François); its use was probably almost
                    confined to the Pyrenees and similar districts where the requisite fall of water
                    was readily obtainable from natural rivulets and torrents. Cylinder blowing
                    machines were introduced at the Carron iron-works about 1760, water-power being
                    usually employed when practicable at that period; some twenty or thirty years
                    later, when the steam engine came into use, a great impetus was thereby given to
                    the iron industry, as to most other trades, owing to the increased facilities in
                    all directions given by the increased command of power thus obtained. The
                    precise date of the introduction of cast iron is unknown; probably it was an
                    accidentally formed product in the first instance, due to the employment of
                    larger furnaces and increased blowing power; in the 14th and 15th centuries it
                    appears to have been known, castings of this period made in Sussex (especially
                    of the later date) being said to be still extant, whilst in the 16th century
                    cannon ot some 3 tons weight each were cast by Johnson. About the end of the
                    century the iron-works of Sussex and neighbouring counties had attained to such
                    dimensions that their consumption of timber for fuel became a serious matter, so
                    that an Act was passed in Elizabeth’s reign prohibiting their further extension.
                    Probably this restriction was the cause of attempts being made to utilize coal
                    as fuel in iron smelting, a patent for this purpose being granted in 1611 to
                    Simon Sturtevant, who, however, does not seem to have been successful. Somewhat
                    later Dud Dudley succeeded in producing both cast iron and malleable iron by the
                    aid of coke, but met with so much opposition from the charcoal smelters that he
                    abandoned the process; a similar result befell Strada in Hainault about the same
                    time; a century later, however, about 1735, Abraham Darby of Colebrookdale
                    reintroduced coke as fuel with complete success. About 1766-1784 great
                    improvements in the mode of working malleable iron and of transforming cast iron
                    into wrought iron were introduced, partly by Thomas Cranage of Colebrookdale,
                    and Peter Onions, but more particularly by Henry Cort, who patented the use of
                    groovedrolls so as to supersede hammering in 1783, and of the puddling forge in
                    1784. Since the invention of puddling, and its improvement by Rogers by the
                    introduction of iron instead of sand bottoms, the main improvements in the iron
                    manufacture are the use of the hot blast instead of cold air, due to Neilson,
                    and patented in 1828; the employment of the waste gases from blast furnaces for
                    raising steam, &amp;c. (and subsequently for superheating the blast), first
                    patented by Aubertot in France in 1811, and subsequently largely employed in
                    most iron-producing districts, Scotland and Staffordshire excepted; the
                    invention of the steam hammer by Nasmyth, patented in 1842; and the introduction
                    of the Bessemer-Mushet process for steel making (1856) by blowing air through
                    molten cast iron so as to burn out the carbon, and then adding spiegeleisen so
                    as to produce a metal of any required degree of carbonization. In every
                    department of the iron industry, however, numerous improvements have been made,
                    amongst which must be specially mentioned the Siemens regenerative furnace and
                    gas producer, and the improved processes for making steel thence resulting; the
                    use of machinery in lieu of hand labour for puddling, introduced at first
                    unsuccessfully by Tooth and Menelaus, and several others, but brought to a
                    considerable degree of practical success by Danks, Crampton, and others; the
                    casting of steel under great pressure, due to Sir Joseph Whitworth; the
                    application of waste gases and the Siemens regenerative principle to the
                    superheating of the blast by the Cowper-Siemens and Whitwell stoves; and the
                    recently introduced improvements in Bessemerizing due to Snelus and to Thomas
                    and Gilchrist, whereby even highly phosphorized pig is rendered capable of
                    furnishing a fairly good quality of steel.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    cast iron is produced by a smelting process (§§ 9-21), and subsequently
                    transformed into steel or wrought iron by decarbonizing the resulting pig iron

                    29—31); (3) those in which steel is formed from wrought iron by directly
                    carbonizing it (§§ 32-35); and (4) those in which steel is finally prepared by
                    intermixture of carbonized and wrought iron in the fluid state (§§ 36-41). The
                    methods of class 1 include the preparation of pig iron; its purification by
                    refining, and conversion into wrought iron by fining and puddling (both by hand
                    and by machinery) and by inverse cementation (heating in contact with iron
                    oxide); and the preparation of puddled steel and pneumatic steel and iron, <hi
                    rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> steel prepared by Bessemer’s original process, viz.,
                    decarbonization more or less complete by blowing air through molten pig iron,
                    and also of Heaton’s steel (pig iron decarbonized by nitrate of sodium), &amp;c.
                    Class 2 includes the Catalan forge and allied processes, and the “direct”
                    methods of Clay, Chenot, Yates, Blair, Snelus, Du Buy, Siemens, aud others. The
                    processes included in class 3 are those of steel manufacture by cementation and
                    partial acieration by case hardening, together with various other allied methods
                    of producing steel from soft iron; whilst class 4 includes the Bessemer-Mushet
                    steel process, in which blown Bessemer metal is made into what is usually known
                    as “Bessemer steel” by incorporating with it spiegeleisen; and the allied open
                    hearth steel processes, in which wrought and cast iron are melted up together,
                    or iron is decarbonized in a Siemens hearth and then mixed with ferro-manganese,
                    &amp;c.; together with various modifications of these processes, such as the
                    Snelus-Thomas-Gilchrist method of blowing phosphorized pig, the Uchatius

                <p>9. <hi rend="italic">Preliminary Treatment of Ores.</hi> —Many kinds of ore are
                    unsuitable for use in the blast furnace without some preliminary
                    treatment,—consisting either of washing with water and dressing in the ordinary
                    way adopted with heavy minerals to wash out clay, &amp;c.; weathering by
                    exposure to air and moisture for considerable periods of time so as to oxidize
                    pyrites, &amp;c., and wash out the soluble matters formed; roasting, so as to
                    expel carbon dioxide and water and burn off organic matter, peroxidizing the
                    iron in so doing; or a combination of some or all of these processes. Even with
                    such ores as magnetic ironstone calcination is usually found to increase the
                    ease with which the ores are subsequently smelted, the lumps being rendered
                    somewhat porous, and hence more readily acted upon; indeed, with compact Swedish
                    magnetites previous calcination is indispensable, otherwise great waste of fuel
                    is occasioned. In the case of franklinite, a mangano-zinciferous magnetite, the
                    mineral is first roasted with lime and anthracite so as to distil off the zinc,
                    and the residue then smelted for spiegeleisen. Certain Westphalian and other
                    ores are deprived of sulphur existing as pyrites by roasting in a kiln, into
                    which superheated steam is admitted at intervals, whereby sulphuretted hydrogen
                    is first formed and subsequently burnt to sulphur dioxide, whilst the iron of
                    the pyrites is converted into oxide; by using a mixture of Ifighly carbonaceous
                    blackband and other ores, the roasting is effected without the use of any fuel
                    other than that contained in the blackband. Where fuel is not an object,
                    calcination of iron stone is frequently effected in heaps analogous to those
                    produced in the burning of “ballast” (clayey soil) for foundations of houses,
                    roads, &amp;c.; a fire of slack being made, shovelfuls of ironstone are thrown
                    on to it, and then more slack and more ironstone alternately, until a
                    sufficiently large heap is prepared; or the heap is first built up and
                    subsequently fired, the spots where the fire comes visibly out of the heap
                    being, when requisite, dampered over with moist small ore so as to prevent too
                    rapid combustion, which might otherwise cause the ore to frit. Blackband usually
                    requires only lighting with a little coal, &amp;c., when properly heaped,
                    furnishing its own fuel.</p>
                <p>When economy in fuel is desirable, a calcining kiln is employed, generally
                    resembling a lime kiln in construction. Fig. 1 represents a kind of kiln
                    (Gjers’s) used extensively in the Cleveland district; it is usually built of
                    firebrick cased with iron plates, circular in section, wider in the middle than
                    at top, and tapering downwards from the middle slightly more rapidly than
                    upwards. An iron double cone AA surmounts an orifice in the base connected with
                    radiating flues B, B, whereby air is introduced into the interior. The whole
                    superstructure rests on an annular cast iron entablature CC, supported on stout
                    iron pillars D, D; the calcined ore is raked out <hi rend="subscript"> i</hi>
                    'between these pillars, the spaces between them serving for the admission of air
                    at the base; a further air supply is obtained from orifices E, E, E, E in the
                    lower conical portion. A usual size is some 20 feet maximum diameter, and a
                    little more in height, with a capacity of upwards of <hi rend="italic">5000</hi>
                    cubic feet; but considerably larger kilns are often used; the consumption of
                    slack is from 4 to 5 per cent, of the. ore (Cleveland ironstone) calcined.
                    Siemens has patented a somewhat analogous calcining furnace, combustible gas and
                    air being led into the centre and distributed by a cone; Rachette’s calciner is
                    oval, <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit13newyrich/page/n307/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0913-0307-0292"/> with, three firing grates, two on one side and
                    one on the other. The magnetic ores and quartzose haematites of Sweden, Russia,
                    America, and elsewhere are often calcined in Westmann’s kiln (fig. 2). This is a
                    nearly tubular vertical kiln slightly diminishing in diameter upwards, and fed
                    at the base with waste gases from the blast furnace, together with air for their
                    combustion; the ore is thus rendered somewhat less dense than at first, whilst
                    pyrites, when present, is decomposed; analogous arrangements are employed in
                    many Continental iron-works. Many attempts have been made to smelt clay
                    ironstone without previous calcination, but as a generalrule but little saving
                    appears to be effected, if indeed any at all is brought about; the value of the
                    small coal and slack saved in the roasting barely, if at all, compensates for
                    various practical disadvantages attending the use of raw ore as compared with
                    calcined ores. Much the same remarks apply to brown ores, especially when
                    earthy. Several methods have been proposed to remove phosphorus compounds from
                    ores containing that constituent before smelting them, so as to produce a purer
                    metal; the success of these as manufacturing operations, however, has been
                    mostly indifferent, the cost and labour involved not being adequately repaid by
                    the results. Amongst these processes may be noticed those of Jacobi and Velge;
                    the former places the broken-up ores in tanks, and lixiviates them with aqueous
                    solution of sulphurous acid obtained by burning pyrites; in this way phosphates
                    are dissolved out, from which manures may be made; the latter impregnates the
                    ores (previously calcined) with brine, and after drying calcines again,
                    subsequently washing out the phosphate of sodium produced by water, or
                    preferably water containing a little hydrochloric acid. Jacobi’s process has
                    been tried on a considerable scale, and apparently could be worked commercially
                    were it not that, to extract the phosphates thoroughly, the ore requires
                    crushing to coarse powder, or at least to lumps so small as very materially to
                    interfere with its employment in the blast furnace; moreover, whilst calcium
                    phosphate is readily soluble in solution of sulphurous acid, ferrous phosphate
                    is not soluble in that menstruum, and hence is not removed irom ores containing
                    phosphorus in this form.</p>
                <p>The ores being ready for smelting, the next stage in their treatment consists in
                    subjecting them to the reducing action of carbon oxide (and also of carbon), at
                    a temperature gradually increasing as the reduction goes on, until finally the
                    reduced metal melts; in order to promote the separation of the earthy impurities
                    of the ore from the metal, and to facilitate their fusion, it is requisite
                    either to mix various classes of ores together in such a fashion that the
                    silicious admixtures of the one and the calcareous and aluminous impurities of
                    the others may jointly be in suitable proportions relatively to one another; or,
                    which is usually more convenient, to add calcareous or other matters (in the
                    form of limestone, ferruginous clay, aluminous poor iron ores, &amp;c.) to serve
                    as a flux. To carry out this operation the <hi rend="italic">blast furnace</hi>
                    is employed, the ore, flux, and fuel being charged in at the top of the
                    erection, and air being blown in at the base, so that a mixture of carbon oxide
                    and nitrogen is formed at the lower levels, which, passing upwards, effects the
                    deoxidation of the ore; the heat produced at the base fuses the reduced iron and
                    the earthy matters, &amp;c., which accumulate in two layers (the former being
                    the heavier), and are drawn off from time to time, the one as cast or pig iron,
                    into moulds for the market, the other as cinder or slag, usually of little or no
                    value. Fresh materials are added at the top, so that the furnace works
                    continuously.</p>
                <p>10. <hi rend="italic">Fuel.—</hi> The fuel employed in iron smelting by means of
                    the blast furnace is substantially always one of. three kinds, viz., raw coal
                    (anthracitic, or more or less bituminous), coke, or charcoal;<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Peat has been used
                    successfully as fuel in some Austrian furnaces, especially in the Vordernberg
                    district, in open-topped furnaces about 30 feet high. The peat was made into
                    compressed balls and dried in the air; these descended to the tuyere without
                    losing their shape, but of course wholly carbonized. The iron produced was
                    white, but of as good quality as that obtained with charcoal. Lignites and brown
                    coal have similarly been employed in districts where better coals are
                    scarce.</p></note> inasmuch, however, as raw coal inserted into the mouth of a
                    blast furnace speedily becomes coked, the combustible matter reaching the tuyere
                    level is invariably carbon in a greater or less state of purity. The effect of
                    using raw coal instead of coke in the first instance is chiefly marked as
                    regards the alteration thereby produced in the character of the gases in the
                    upper part of the furnace, and the consequent alteration in the chemical changes
                    taking place, chiefly owing to the presence of hydrogen and hydrocarbons in much
                    larger proportion. For numerous other operations in connexion with the
                    metallurgy of iron, other kinds of fuel are often employed, lignites, turf,
                    wood, &amp;c. The following analyses will give an idea of the general character
                    of the fuels usually employed. In the north of England a very hard variety of
                    coke, often known as “Durham coke,” is made specially for iron smelters; during
                    the production of this, on an average about one half of the sulphur originally
                    present in the raw coal is expelled, the yield of coke being about two-thirds of
                    the coal employed.</p>

                    the latent heat of water at 20° (Régnault); so that 8300 may be taken as an
                    approximation to the heat of combustion of ordinary <pb break="no"

                    20°. The heat of combustion of coke and charcoal is somewhat less than this: 1
                    part by weight of carbon gives out about 8000 units of heat, so that, if the
                    coke contained 7 ’ 5 per cent, of ash and no appreciable amount of hydrogen, the
                    heat of combustion (burnt to carbon dioxide) would be about 7400 (see § 20).</p>
                <p>For certain purposes, and more especially for use in the blast furnace, the
                    physical properties of the coke used are important; when caking coal is coked in
                    furnaces so constructed as to permit of the collection of the products of the
                    decomposition of the coal by heat, a larger yield of coke is obtained than is
                    got when the coking is effected at a higher temperature brought about by the
                    combustion of the volatile matters as fast as they are generated; but the softer
                    coke obtained in the former way is less suited for smelting iron in the blast
                    furnace than the harder variety obtained by the latter process; where lofty
                    furnaces are in use, a hard coke that will stand the crushing action of the
                    weight of the superincumbent materials answers better than a softer coke which
                    is disintegrated by the pressure. Moreover, the hard compact form is less
                    readily acted upon by carbon dioxide so as to produce carbon oxide (the carbon
                    of the coke being gasefied) than is the case with the softer form of cθke;
                    accordingly it results that when soft coke is employed in the blast furnace a
                    larger amount of it is requisite per given weight of iron made than would be
                    required were hard coke used instead; so that the greater yield of soft coke
                    from the coal used in the first instance is counterbalanced, and even more than
                    counterbalanced, by the increased quantity required to do the work of the
                    furnace.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Crampton’s Furnaces.—</hi> For various purposes for which fuel
                    is employed, whether for raising steam or producing a more or less oxidizing or
                    reducing flame <hi rend="italic">(e.g.,</hi> in puddling), a form of
                    flame-producer is available obtained by blowing into the furnace a jet of air
                    carrying with it finely ground coal; for this purpose Crampton employs a mill
                    like an ordinary flour mill with Derbyshire grit stones. The ground coal is
                    placed in a hopper A (fig. 3) containing a sieve B, two agitators C and D
                    stirring up the fine coal under the sieve, and urging it outwards through an
                    opening E, the size of which is controlled by a sliding door F; from this
                    opening it passes between rollers H and I, the distance between which can be
                    regulated by a screw L acting on a lever MX, which adjusts the position of the
                    bearings of the upper and smaller roller; in this way the feed is perfectly
                    under control; the agitators cannot force out the coal-dust from the hopper at a
                    greater speed than that regulated by the rollers. The stream of issuing
                    coal-dust falls down a shoot K, a scraper O being provided to prevent adherence
                    to the rollers; at the bottom of the shoot it is blown away continuously by an
                    air blast, the shoot delivering the dust into the blast pipe continuously; the
                    blast remaining the same, the amount of fuel is regulated by the screw and
                    levers; or, the coal-dust supply being constant, the air blast can be varied.
                    The flame thus produced on kindling the jet of air and coal (suitably
                    proportioned to one another) is smokeless, and perfect combustion is effected
                    with an intensely high temperature; for puddling and reheating furnaces, for
                    heat-generating purposes generally, and for steam raising, the arrangement
                    answers admirably <hi rend="italic">{Journ. I. and S. Inst.,</hi> 1873, 91, and

                    tar has been employed as fuel, being injected into the puddling furnace to be
                    heated by means of a jet of superheated steam, which carries with it a certain
                    amount of atmospheric air, the principle being much the same as that of firing
                    tar-stills with waste naphtha. The steam at a pressure of four atmospheres (60
                    lb per inch) is superheated by forcing through a coil in the exit flue of the
                    furnace, whereby it is raised to a red heat, and issues from a <hi

                    melting furnaces this fuel answered well, a consumption of a gallon of benzoline

                    allowed to trickle over a series of shelves in a chamber through which highly
                    superheated steam passes; the current of combustible vapour produced is used for
                    reheating and puddling furnaces, with the result of employing thirty barrels of
                    petroleum daily for an output of iron that would otherwise require 40 tons of
                    coal.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Natural Gas. —</hi> In Pennsylvania the gas evolved from
                    petroleum wells and springs into a subterranean stratum (some 1600 feet below
                    the surface) is largely utilized as fuel. One of the largest of these, the
                    Delamater Well, some 30 miles from Pittsburg, was described in 1877 by Professor
                    Laurence Smith as having at first yielded considerable amounts of petroleum,
                    btιt then giving off nothing but gas coming up with a velocity of 1700 feet per
                    second at the rate of about a million cubic feet per hour, or upwards of 1400
                    tons daily. In a 5f pipe at the well the pressure was 100 lb per square inch, so
                    that large engines were worked by the gas current pressure alone. The
                    illuminating power was about 7⅜ candles, or less than half that of good coal
                    gas; the calorific effect was considerably superior to that of the most
                    bituminous coal (weight for weight) on account of the much larger percentage of
                    hydrogen (free and combined). Puddling and reheating furnaces fired with this
                    fuel fed in through pipes in the rear of the fire bridge answer well, but emit
                    some smoke; when it is used with a more plentiful supply of air under steam

                <p>The extent to which this can be safely done depends on the fuel burnt, the
                    decomposition being attended by an absorption of heat; if more steam be admitted
                    than can be decomposed, the surplus passes on unchanged and dilutes the gases,
                    serving no useful purpose, but rather the contrary. Usually the small amount of
                    steam requisite is produced by placing a water-tank underneath the grate,
                    supplied continually with water as indicated in fig. 4, so that evaporation is
                    set up by the radiating effect of the fire; only a relatively small volume is
                    thus drawn in with the air used for combustion, but’ enough to give several
                    parts per cent, of additional hydrogen and carbon oxide in the gas, and sensibly
                    to increase the heating power. Roughly speaking, the calorific value of a unit
                    of weight of gas from a Siemens producer is about 650; for one part by weight of
                    carbon oxide will develop 2400 units of heat, and average gas contains about 25
                    per cent, by weight of carbon oxide with a little hydrogen (some 0 <hi
                    rend="superscript"> ,</hi> 5 per cent, by weight), and hydrocarbons equivalent
                    to some few parts per cent, more of carbon oxide. The mean specific heat of the
                    gases being about 0 ‘24, an alteration in temperature of 300° would represent
                    about 72 units of heat; or 11 per cent, of the heating power; so that by
                    conveying the hot gases from a Siemens producer such a distance that their
                    temperature is reduced by 300°, a considerable loss of effective heating power
                    is experienced, amounting to about one-ninth of the actual heat developed by
                    combustion. Partly owing to this cause, and partly owing to radiation,
                    absorption of heat by the brickwork of the fireplace, &amp;c., it has been
                    calculated that the heat actually producible by means of gaseous fuel is only
                    about two-thirds of that due to the fuel actually employed; but manifestly the
                    latter sources of loss apply to solid fuel burnt in an ordinary firegrate just
                    as much as to a gas producer. Experience shows that when the producers are near
                    to the furnaces fed by them the fuel consumption is perceptibly lessened.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Siemens Regenerative Furnace, —</hi> The peculiar feature of
                    this furnace is that the waste heat is employed to heat up both the gaseous fuel
                    and the air requisite to burn it before they are introduced into the furnace or
                    chamber in which they undergo combustion. This is effected by making the exit
                    gases pass through “regenerators,” consisting of piles of firebricks stacked
                    loosely together so as to expose as much surface as possible. Figs. 5 and 6
                    represent such a regenerative furnace as arranged for melting steel on an open
                    hearth <hi rend="italic">(Journal of Chemical Society,</hi> 1873, p. 661).</p>
                <p>Four such piles are employed, two being heated up by the waste gases escaping
                    from the melting furnace, whilst the other two are in use, the one for heating
                    the gaseous fuel supplied from a Siemens gas producer, or from a gas main fed by
                    several such producers, the other for heating he air requisite for the
                    combustion of the gas. By suitable valves the waste gases are shunted from the
                    first to the second pair of regenerators, whilst simultaneously the gas and air
                    are changed from the second to the first pair; as the temperature at which the
                    gas and air enter is close to that at which the products of combustion leave the
                    furnace, whilst the regenerators are being heated up, the temperature of the
                    combustion chamber continually rises (when not reduced by the introduction of
                    cold substances) with each reversal of the currents through the regenerators; so
                    that ultimately the only limit to the temperature attainable is the
                    refractoriness of the materials of which the furnace is constructed. Even Welsh
                    Dinas brick, which perfectly resists the ordinary steel melting <pb break="no"

                    the least fusible mildest steels are being prepared, can be easily melted when
                    the furnace is pushed; these bricks are made from a silicious clay (containing
                    98 <hi rend="superscript"> -</hi> 31 per cent, of silica, 0 '72 of alumina, 0 ’

                    potash and soda, and 0’35 of combined water), mixed with 1 per cent, of lime,
                    and are usually considered the most refractory in ordinary use. A specially
                    prepared brick made from a mixture of crushed pure quartz and 2 per cent, of
                    lime answers much better. Bauxite bricks are somewhat less refractory, and have
                    the further objectionable quality of shrinking much when highly heated, whilst
                    fresh bauxite introduced for repairing cavities caused by wear and tear will not
                    adhere properly to them; where ores requiring lime as flux are employed,
                    however, they are less readily corroded than silica bricks. The hot air and gas
                    currents and the waste gases are reversed through the regenerators at convenient
                    intervals by means of a cast iron valve on the principle of a four-way cock;
                    when the regenerators are placed vertically and heated from the top, their
                    action is more uniform than when the draught is in any other direction; they
                    should be at a lower level than the heating chamber, and may be worked either
                    with a gas pressure just about atmospheric, or preferably with a slightly
                    increased pressure so as to avoid possible chilling of the furnace by the
                    drawing in of cold air, the pressure being regulated by the chimney damper and
                    the valves governing the gas and air supplies.</p>
                <p>Since the composition of the gas from a Siemens gas producer is, roughly
                    speaking, somewhat less than one-third carbon oxide or gases equivalent thereto,
                    and somewhat more than two-thirds nitrogen and carbon dioxide, and as carbon
                    oxide requires half its volume of oxygen and hence about two and a half times
                    its volume of air for complete combustion, the volumes of gas and air equivalent
                    to one another are roughly equal; but, since an excess of air is usually
                    requisite, and is indispensable when an oxidizing atmosphere is desired, the
                    regenerators by which the air is heated are made somewhat larger than those used
                    for heating the gas; by suitably adjusting the speed of the air current by the
                    valve, the atmosphere can then be rendered neutral, reducing, or oxidizing at
                    will. This point is of less importance for other applications of the
                    regenerative furnace such as glass making or steel melting in crucibles than it
                    is for puddling and reheating furnaces. For every pound of coal burnt per hour
                    about 6 square feet of surface is requisite in the regenerators to take up the
                    heat; whilst about 60 lb weight of brickwork is requisite to expose the surface
                    to the best advantage, i.e., between three or four times the weight of brickwork
                    which would have the same capacity for heat as the waste gases (equal to about
                    17 ft&gt;).</p>

                    the production of gas from moist sawdust, is constructed on much the same
                    principles as Siemens’s gas producer, saving that the air is driven in by a
                    blast; as the sawdust contains upwards of 40 per cent, of moisture, the steam
                    and hot gases passing off from the furnace are cooled down, and the former
                    condensed, by jets of water-spray and a kind of scrubber consisting of piles of

                    arrangement, if not too wet. The gas evolved from sawdust has about the
                    following composition after condensation of steam, exclusive of about 3 volumes

                    requisite for combustion is supplied by means of a steam jet, and blows into a
                    bell-mouthed pipe outside, communicating with a boxshaped cast iron chamber in
                    the middle of the base of the producer; this chamber, being perforated,
                    distributes air and steam uniformly throughout the mass of fuel, and so prevents
                    unchanged steam and excess of air from passing away in the gases, which are led

                    smelted, such as Cumberland haematite or Swedish magnetite, the amount of
                    silicious and earthy matter present relatively to the iron oxide is but small,
                    and in consequence the amount of flux requisite to be added is also small. By
                    proper combination of ores of different kinds the necessity for the addition of
                    flux may be almost or altogether avoided; thus a highly aluminous ferric oxido
                    known as bauxite (valuable as a source of aluminium and its compounds, as well
                    as serviceable as a source of iron and flux in the blast furnace) and silicious

                    or quicklime, furnish a cinder consisting mainly of calcareous aluminium
                    silicate which readily melts and separates from the pig iron; similarly
                    aluminous shales from the Coal Measures may be used instead of bauxite, whilst
                    certain Swedish ores naturally containing as gangue fusible silicates of lime
                    and magnesia, together with limestone, can be smelted without any additional
                    flux of any kind, and will even serve to take up the silicious gangue from other
                    ores when smelted with them if the latter are not in too large a proportion. On
                    the other hand, clay ironstone and clayey ores generally usually require a
                    considerable admixture of limestone or quicklime in order to yield a
                    sufficiently fusible cinder, the presence of a sufficiently large amount of
                    basic matter (lime and magnesia, or manganese oxide) in the cinder being
                    essential in order to prevent the pig iron from taking up too much sulphur from
                    the coke or coal when these fuels are employed. Phosphorus, however, when
                    present in either the ore, the flux, or the fuel, is almost entirely taken up by
                    the pig iron, as was shown in 1838 by Berthier, and subsequently confirmed by
                    other observers; thus Lowthian Bell found that in a furnace smelting Cleveland

                    the amounts of phosphorus leaving the furnace in the slag and pig iron
                    respectively were almost exactly 10 and 90 per cent of the total phosphorus
                    present; whilst in the same series of experiments the sulphur retained by the

                    98 per cent, of the total sulphur present (which amounted to upwards of 4 parts
                    per 100 of pig).</p>
                <p>According to Riley the amount of phosphorus retained in the slag is greater the
                    more iron is present. When the reduction of the metal is all but complete, and
                    the furnace consequently is working well, the pig contains practically all the
                    phosphorus present, whether it be white or grey; but if the slag becomes more or
                    less of a “scouring” character through incomplete reduction of considerable
                    amounts of iron, notable quantities of phosphorus are also present therein.
                    Witherbee finds that a certain small amount of phosphorus contained in the
                    charge fails to appear in the pig iron, this amount being greater the higher the
                    temperature of the hearth, <hi rend="italic">i.er,</hi> being greater when
                    Bessemer pig is being run than with iron smelted at a lower temperature. This he
                    explains by supposing that phosphorus is <hi rend="italic">volatilized</hi> in
                    the furnace, a view apparently corroborated by direct experiments made by
                    Akermann.</p>
                <p>Some of the Lincolnshire ores are imbedded in a calcareous matrix or gangue; in
                    order to smelt these an admixture of silicious ore is necessary. For this
                    purpose the more or less silicated forge mill cinders from the manufacture of
                    malleable iron are frequently used, these substances virtually constituting rich
                    iron ores, the only drawback of which is that their texture is compact, and they
                    generally are in small pieces, so that they could not be smelted advantageously
                    alone; moreover, they usually contain considerable quantities of phosphorus, if
                    that constituent was present to any extent in the original pig used for
                    puddling, mill cinder (the scale formed and detached during rolling) being much
                    purer in this respect than forge cinder (the molten slag squirted out during
                    hammering).</p>
                <p>When any notable amount of manganese oxide is present in the cinder, it is
                    generally very fluid and easily fusible; accordingly, when a furnace shows a
                    tendency to “scaffold” (by the fritting together of lumps which form a
                    comparatively solid skeleton mass inside the furnace, preventing the charge from
                    descending properly), a manganiferous ore is sometimes employed as a sort of
                    flux to assist in removing the obstruction by melting it down. In Sweden, when
                    sulphur is present in the ores to an undue amount (through imperfect
                    calcination, &amp;c. ), it is usual to add some titaniferous ore to the charge
                    (some 10 per cent, or so); the pig is thereby prevented from taking up the
                    sulphur, possibly through the formation of titanium sulphocyanide. In the
                    anthracite furnaces at Cedar Point, U.S., it was found that a much more fluid
                    cinder was produced when a magnesian limestone, containing 67 per cent,
                    carbonate of lime and 27 per cent, carbonate of magnesia, was used than with
                    ordinary limestone of 95 per cent, carbonate of lime, other things being the
                    same.</p>
                <p>As a general rule it may be said that the composition of the cinder from a blast

                    of ferrous oxide present may amount to one-fifth or more of the cinder,
                    representing a very large loss of metal. The following analyses represent the

                            When quicklime, or calcined limestone, is employed instead of raw
                            limestone, a certain diminution in the amount of fuel requisite to run a
                            given quality of pig with a given furnace is noticed, arising from the
                            circumstance that in calcining limestone heat is absorbed, so that when
                            quicklime is used there is a less demand on the heat developed in the
                            furnace than with raw limestone. The saving in this way, however, is
                            rarely equal to the amount of fuel used in the limekiln itself, probably
                            because in the top portion of the furnace the quicklime becomes
                            partially recarbonated by the escaping gases. When the amount of
                            limestone used is large, the carbon dioxide introduced into the furnace
                            in that form is a large fraction of the total carbon dioxide expelled in
                            the escaping gases, and consequently the carbon of the fuel cannot be
                            burnt to so great an advantage as it</p></note></p></cell>

                <p>would be were less carbon dioxide introduced in the form of flux, since the total
                    amount of dioxide in the escaping gases is limited (see § 20); accordingly, a
                    further saving in fuel might be expected to accrue by calcining the limestone
                    previously, when large amounts of limestone flux are employed. The two sources
                    of saving jointly sometimes considerably exceed the fuel expenditure in the

                    comparative trials lasting over some three and a half years indicated not only

                <p>From these results as well as others described by Percy <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Metal</hi><hi rend="italic superscript"> 3</hi><hi rend="italic">lurgy},</hi>
                    and by Griiner <hi rend="italic">(Annales</hi><hi rend="italic">des Mines</hi>
                    [vi.], xx. 525) and others, it would seem that, with certain ores at any rate, a
                    distinct i&gt;ractical advantage attends the use of quicklime instead of raw
                    imestone. On the other hand, Lowtlιian Bell regards the advantage with Cleveland
                    ores as at least doubtful, his own experiments unmistakably indicating “that the
                    expense of calcining the limestone was unaccompanied by any advantage whatever
                    in the operation” <hi rend="italic">(Jenem.</hi><hi rend="italic">I. and S.
                    Institute,</hi> 1875, 406); similar results have also been observed by
                    others.</p>
                <p>As regards the quantity of flux requisite to produce good results, no general
                    statements can be made, the proportion being highly variable with circumstances,
                    and especially with the nature of the ore. Thus, with Cleveland ironstone
                    containing after calcination some 40 per cent, of iron, about 11 cwts. of
                    limestone are usually requisite per ton of pig iron, or about 22 per cent, of
                    the weight of “mine” used. Much larger quantities have been employed at various
                    Continental works using poor ores with much earthy matter, up to 20 cwt. and
                    more per ton of iron; on the other hand, some of the Swedish ores require no
                    flux at all, and Lake Superior ores often do not require more than some 2 cwts.
                    of limestone per ton. When it is practicable to mix aluminous, calcareous, and
                    silicious ores together, the amount of flux otherwise requisite may be largely
                    reduced; but the conditions governing the amount and nature of flux to be used
                    are too variable to be briefly generalized.</p>
                <p>12. <hi rend="italic">Construction of Blast Furnaces.—</hi> Intermediately
                    between the comparatively open hearths of the Catalan forge and analogous early
                    arrangements for the direct production of iron from its ores (§ 29) and the
                    completely closedin blast furnaces of gigantic dimensions in use at the present
                    day, may be classed the smaller closed-in blast furnaces used amongst various
                    nations, the products of which were either something approaching to malleable
                    iron, more or less carbonized and imperfectly fused, a fused or semi-fused
                    steel, or a completely melted more highly carbonized cast iron, according to
                    circumstances. Of this intermediate class of furnace the “Stückofen,” or high
                    bloomery furnace, formerly considerably used on the Continent, may be taken as a
                    type. By increasing the amount of fuel relatively to the ore smelted, a
                    completely fluxed cast iron resulted, run out as in the ordinary modern blast
                    furnace through a tapping hole; with less fuel,ie., increased “burden,” the
                    product approximated more to the pasty mass produced in the Catalan forge, being
                    extracted as a ball through a much larger opening in the hearth than was
                    necessary for simple tapping; in this latter mode of working the cinder was
                    usually allowed to escape <hi rend="italic">pari passu</hi> with its formation
                    so as not to allow the mass of reduced metal to be covered and protected from
                    the oxidizing action of the blast, otherwise a too highly carbonized metal
                    resulted. Essentially the Stückofen was a brickwork tower of some 10 to 15 feet
                    in height, the inner cavity being shaped like two truncated cones placed base to
                    base; in short differing from the ordinary blast furnaces for producing cast
                    iron in little but dimensions. As far back as 1841 these appliances were stated
                    by Karsten to have been entirely abandoned in Carinthia, Carniola, and Styria
                    (where formerly they were largely employed), on account of their large
                    consumption of fuel; at that period they were still in use to a small extent in
                    Hungary and near Henneberg in Germany. The “Osmund” furnace, formerly in use in
                    Sweden for converting bog iron ores into malleable iron, was essentially a
                    Catalan forge with the sides built up to a height of several feet so as to
                    constitute a small blast furnace entirely closed in save at the top.</p>
                <p>The modern blast furnaces for pig iron production in use in different districts
                    vary considerably in the details of their construction. The changes that have
                    been introduced during the last half century are mainly in the direction of
                    increased size, which up to a certain point has been found advantageous so far
                    as the consumption of fuel is concerned, at any rate with certain classes of
                    ore. Thus about 1830 the largest furnaces in use in Great Britain were usually
                    but little upwards of 40 feet in height, with a capacity of 4000 to 5000 cubic
                    feet, and were often much smaller; about 1864 Vaughan of Middlesborough built a
                    much larger one, 75 feet high; at the present day furnaces of 80, 90, and even
                    upwards of 100 feet in height and of 20,000 to 40,000 cubic feet capacity are in
                    use in certain localities, some of the largest being those at Ferryhill and
                    Ormesby in the Middlesborough district, furnaces of 103⅛ feet in height and
                    33,000 cubic feet capacity, and of 9Ö feet in height and 40,000 cubic feet
                    capacity, having been built at these places respectively. The researches of
                    Lowthian Bell on blast furnaces smelting Cleveland ironstone, and the practical
                    experience of iron smelters using this ore alone, or mixed with haematite,
                    coincide in indicating that, whilst a considerable saving in fuel consumed
                    (several cwt.) per ton of iron of given quality made at a given rate of working
                    from a given class of ore and flux accompanies the increase in dimensions from
                    40 or 50 feet in height and 5000 or 6000 cubic feet capacity up to about 80 feet
                    in height and some 12,000 cubic feet capacity, the economical effect of
                    increasing the dimensions beyond these limits is not marked, although, according
                    to Bell, a further increase in capacity up to some 15,000 or 16,000 cubic feet
                    (without increase of height beyond 80 feet) appears on the whole to tend to
                    increase of regularity during working. On the other hand, when a very hard coke
                    (such as that specially made in Durham and Northumberland for the purpose) is
                    not obtainable as fuel, or when very friable ores are employed, the extra weight
                    of material in a very high furnace so crushes and pulverizes the ore and fuel as
                    seriously to interfere with the working; so that with charcoal or soft
                    anthracite or other coal as fuel, or with ores which either at first or when
                    partially reduced have but little coherence, the disadvantages of increasing the
                    size of the furnace beyond certain limits outweigh the benefit derived from the
                    saving of fuel Accordingly the 80 feet furnaces and upwards of the Cleveland
                    district are but little used out of England; the furnaces employed in the North
                    Lancashire and Whitehaven districts, where haematite mainly is smelted, are
                    usually 60 to 70 feet in height, and those in use in the United States for
                    similar ores rarely exceed 55 to 65 or 70 feet in height, with a maximum width
                    of 15 or 16 feet at the boshes, and are often only from 40 to 50 feet in height;
                    whilst furnaces very much smaller than these are in use both in America and on
                    the Continent where charcoal iron is made; thus at Vordernberg in Styria
                    furnaces of only some 28 feet in height, 6 feet greatest internal diameter, and
                    450 cubic feet capacity were in use a few years ago and probably are still,
                    whilst in various places <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit13newyrich/page/n313/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0913-0313-0298"/> in Sweden, Norway, and Lapland furnaces of 30 to
                    40 feet in height and 1000 to 2000 cubic feet capacity are employed. Of late
                    years, however, large furnaces have been built in Sweden of 50 to 60 feet in
                    height, especially for Bessemer pig smelting.</p>
                <p>The internal shape of the blast furnaces in general use is somewhat variable.
                    Those of the older construction may be described as being made up of two
                    truncated cones placed base to base, the greatest diameter (the <hi
                    rend="italic">boshes)</hi> being about one-third way up; those of more recent
                    construction exhibit much less angle at the boshes, and are internally shaped
                    more like a barrel, or like an inverted soda water bottle with most of the neck
                    and the conical bottom cut off. Fig. 8 illustrates the alterations in size and
                    shape that have taken place in the blast furnaces of the Cleveland district
                    during the last thirty years or so (abridged from a paper by J. Gjers, <hi
                    rend="italic">Journal Iron and Steel Institute,</hi> 1871, ii. 202). Similar
                    alterations in dimensions and shape of furnaces have taken place in other
                    localities. The smaller furnaces of 30 to 35 or 40 feet in height have mostly
                    been replaced (when worn . out) by larger and higher ones, the angles of the
                    internal cavities of the older shapes being rounded off.</p>
                <p>Fig. 9 illustrates the section and ground plan of one of the plder form of
                    open-mouthed furnaces used at Dowlais (Truran), consisting of a heavy mass of
                    masonry, square at base, strongly braced together with iron tie-rods, rising in
                    the shape of a truncated pyramid to the height of the boshes, and then
                    surmounted with a conical top surrounded at the throat by a gallery for the
                    introduction of the charging materials. In the square base were four arched
                    recesses or <hi rend="italic">tuyere houses,</hi> one on each side, F, F, for
                    the introduction of the blast through blowing holes by means of <hi
                    rend="italic">tuyeres,</hi> the front recess G also serving for the removal of
                    cinder and the tapping of the furnace for the running of the pig. The lowest
                    portion of the hearth or <hi rend="italic">crucible,</hi> A, was constructed of
                    refractory sandstone, grit, or conglomerate, or of difficultly fusible
                    firebrick, the inner portion of the upper part of the furnace being also built
                    of firebrick set in fireclay with an air course between the double lining thus
                    constructed; ex- .teriorly the furnace was built of less expensive and
                    refractory materials, usually of stone, strongly bound round with iron hoops.
                    Above the charging gallery D a slighter brickwork continuation of the internal
                    cavity arose, E, termed the <hi rend="italic">tunnel head,</hi> in which
                    door-holes, closed with movable iron doors, were perforated for the introduction
                    of the charge. At the level of the boshes BB or thereabouts, the pyramidal base
                    was finished off exteriorly with a cap or coping, the conical <hi rend="italic"
                    >shaft</hi> C rising upwards therefrom. Fig. 10 represents a somewhat later
                    form, chiefly differing from the former in that the base is circular instead of
                    square, the whole forming a truncated cone into which the tuyere houses A,A,A,B
                    are sunk, the <hi rend="italic">cinder notch</hi> and <hi rend="italic">tapping
                    hole</hi> for the outflow respectively of the cinder and pig iron being in the
                    tuyere house B, towards which the walls of the hearth and crucible are cut away;
                    the outer portion of this form of furnace consisted of a shell of boiler plate
                    rivetted together, and. the masonry was considerably less massive than that of
                    the older form. The more modern furnaces (such as fig. 11) are constructed like
                    this, but the masonry at the base is still less massive, so that, instead of
                    there being four distinct tuyere houses, the separating walls of the houses are
                    wholly cut away and replaced by a number of stout iron pillars on which rests
                    the greater portion of <pb break="no"

                    walls of the hearth are pierced conical arched openings for the tuyeres; the
                    throat is fitted with a valve for introducing materials from time to time, such
                    as the cup and cone arrangement (see § 18). Just below the cup a perforation
                    through the furnace wall allows the gases to pass out into a down flue of
                    rivetted boiler plate through which the, gases pass (when the cone is in its
                    normal raised position) to the boiler fires, blast superheaters, &amp;c.; in
                    order to prevent the fire being extinguished when the cone is lowered, a small
                    coal fire is kept burning under the boilers, &amp;c., unless the temperature of
                    the fireplace is sufficiently high to relight the gases when the cone is again
                    raised. Even at the present day, however, many furnaces are in use of the
                    open-mouthed class, the escaping gases simply passing into the air through the
                    tunnel head as a mass of roaring flame, unless the temperature is too low to
                    enable them to ignite spontaneously, in which case they escape without flame
                    except when accidentally or intentionally lit.</p>
                <p>The precise angle made at the boshes between the lower and upper portions of the
                    inner furnace wall is a matter of some moment. If the hearth slopes too gently,
                    the fall of the materials downwards as the reduced metal and cinder melt is apt
                    to be retarded, and “scaffolding” to be produced. Modern furnaces usually have
                    the walls of the hearth more nearly vertical than the older ones, whilst the
                    shaft instead of being conical from the boshes upwards is often cylindrical for
                    -some considerable distance, then gradually closing in barrel-wise towards the
                    throat; the tuyeres also are often more than four, especially in the larger
                    furnaces. In some of the furnaces in use some twenty years ago and upwards, the
                    hearth was originally built square in plan, like the still older ones of half a
                    century back and more; but observation of the fact that the hearth of blown-out
                    furnaces was always corroded or fused away to an irregular circular outline, and
                    that the same kind of effect was also Îiroduced in the inner ining of the boshes
                    and shaft where an angle originally existed, led to the gradual substitution of
                    inner cavities shaped in the first instance as much as possible like the
                    ultimate shape to which the furnace became corroded.</p>
                <p>In building a blast furnace, the “stack” or upper portion is usually constructed
                    first on its supporting columns, the hearth and its outer casing being built in
                    subsequently. The firebrick used for the purpose should be as free as possible
                    from iron, otherwise it is apt to be disintegrated by the reducing action of
                    carbon oxide on the ferruginous matter, a continual reduction of iron and
                    reoxidation of the metal with deposition of carbon being produced in virtue of
                    the reactions described in § 19, equations (3) and (4); according to Pattinson ’
                    s observations <hi rend="italic">{Joum. I. and S. Inst., 1316,</hi> 101) this
                    action has in several instances caused considerable injury when iron was present
                    to a notable extent (3 or 4 per cent.). In Austria and Hungary steatite is often
                    used for lining the charcoal furnaces in use there; serpentine has also been
                    employed, but is not so advantageous on account of the difficulty in obtaining
                    it of uniform texture and sufficient compactness; it does not wear so well as
                    good firebrick. The hearth and foundations frequently require to be specially
                    prepared, consisting of a large mass of concrete, broken stone, &amp;c., with
                    air courses interspersed; above this is the <hi rend="italic">hearth
                    bottom,</hi> formerly made of one or more large slabs of sandstone or grit, but
                    with the modern large furnaces of masses of firebrick or sandstone laid inverted
                    domewise, or like the under portion of a barrel drain, to diminish the tendency
                    to undermining and forcing upwards by the molten metal and slag. The crucible
                    and hearth are then constructed of as great thickness and as infusible material
                    as convenient, so as to increase the time requisite before renewal is necessary,
                    owing to the solvent action continually being exerted by the cinder, especially
                    when the furnace is working irregularly and forming a slag containing much
                    unreduced iron <hi rend="italic">{semiring cinder)</hi> which attacks the hearth
                    lining powerfully. The tuyere holes are built in as conical perforations through
                    the hearth wall at a level of some few feet above the bottom, —the front tuyere
                    hole being made into an arched recess (like the old “tuyere house,” but on a
                    smaller scale) reaching from the bottom to a level of 2 or 3 feet above the
                    other tuyeres; the <hi rend="italic">tymp arch</hi> usually projects a little
                    forward from the earth wall, constituting the “fore hearth,” at the base of the
                    front of which is the <hi rend="italic">dam,</hi> a block of stone or mass of
                    firebrick pierced by a vertical cavity <hi rend="italic">{tapping hole),</hi>
                    the bottom of which is on a level with the base of the hearth, and through which
                    the molten pig iron is drawn off from time to time, the liquid metal being
                    dammed back by ramming a mixture of clay and sand or small coal into the hole
                    when the furnace is not being tapped, and the stopping being withdrawn by
                    hammering with a pointed crowbar when all is ready for tapping. The top of the
                    dam <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit13newyrich/page/n315/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0913-0315-0300"/> is nearly on a level with the tuyeres, and has a
                    groove <hi rend="italic">{cinder notch)</hi> cut in it forming a channel through
                    which the cinder continuously flows out when the iron and cinder have risen to a
                    level with the top of the dam since the last tapping; occasionally the top of
                    the dam is raised to a somewhat higher level than the tuyeres, when it
                    consequently results that the blast is blown in <hi rend="italic">through</hi>
                    and not <hi rend="italic">over</hi> the liquid cinder. The space between the dam
                    and the top of the tymp arch is filled up with brickwork, or with clay and sand,
                    &amp;c., with the exception of the cinder channel terminating in the cinder
                    notch; when the furnace has been tapped and the level of the cinder has sunk
                    below the notch, this cavity is temporarily stopped until the cinder level rises
                    again, to prevent the blast issuing from the hole. In order to prevent wearing
                    away of the dam, water cooling arrangements are sometimes applied analogous to
                    those used for the hot-blast tuyere (§ 15); various arrangements of this kind
                    are in use, notably Liirman’s.</p>
                <p>On the Continent the older massive round or square-based class of furnace (of
                    variable dimensions in different localities) is still employed to a considerable
                    extent. In some of the smaller-sized furnaces, such as those in use in Sweden
                    and Finland, the heavy external masonry is replaced by a log casing, prevented
                    from heating by a jacket of earth and rock between it and the furnace casing
                    proper. When the furnaces are only in blast at certain seasons (being blown out
                    during the rest of the year), holes for the escape of moisture from the interior
                    brickwork or stonework on relighting are usually provided. The hearth is
                    constructed of a mixture of fireclay and crushed quartz or old used fireclay
                    moulded whilst soft into shape by being rammed in between the outer casing and a
                    wooden internal mould and carefully dried gradually before use. Rachette’s

                    certain copper smelting works, differs considerably in shape from the ordinary
                    English form; the shaft A is an inverted foursided pyramid, the throat being the
                    widest part of all, about 7 feet wide and 18 long; towards the hearth D the
                    width diminishes to 2 <hi rend="superscript"> -</hi> 75 feet, the total height
                    being about 30 feet. At each end of the oblong hearth is a slaghole and a
                    tapping hole, C, C. The tuyeres B, B are some dozen in number, arranged in two
                    ranks opposite to one another, each tuyere on one side being midway between the
                    axes of two adjacent tuyeres of the opposite side. In order to keep the walls
                    cool air courses E,E are built under the hearth and others 0,0,0 in the walls of
                    the shaft, all communicating with one another; when the furnace is being blown

                    lowest and largest air space E and fired. The chief advantages claimed for this
                    form of furnace are that its small height and comparatively slight construction
                    render it far less costly to build than more massive furnaces; that the
                    ascending current of gases must slacken in vertical speed as it reaches the
                    wider uppermost portion, and must consequently be more efficaceous in reducing
                    the ore than in furnaces the shafts of which taper the other way at top, so that
                    the yield of iron relatively to the cubic capacity is larger; and that when
                    first built it can be blown in much sooner than ordinary furnaces owing ⅛&gt;

                    magnetic ore furnishing 67 per cent.'of grey pig with charcoal and cold blast,
                    was from three to three and a half times that of the old type of furnace
                    (measured for equal cubic capacity! the consumption of fuel being from 10 to 15

                <p>A peculiar furnace, known as Ferrie’s self-coking furnace, after the name of its
                    inventor, in which raw coal is employed, has been used at the Monkland Iron
                    works and elsewhere during the last few years. On the top of an ordinary furnace
                    of about 53 feet in height and 7000 cubic feet capacity were erected four
                    chambers or retorts about 2D feet in depth, each having a capacity of 500 cubic
                    feet; external flues, in which a portion of the waste gases weηe burnt, served
                    to heat these chambers in such a way as to coke the raw coal, the temperature of
                    the flues being about <hi rend="smallcaps">800</hi><hi rend="superscript

                    coking retort flues is led off by the usual bell and cone arrangement.</p>
                <p>Before these chambers were erected the quantity of raw coal requisite to make a
                    ton of pig from the Lanarkshire ironstone averaged about 52 <hi
                    rend="superscript"> ,</hi> 5 cwt.; the addition of the coking chambers reduced
                    the amount of coal to 33 ’ 5 cwt., producing a saving of 19 cwt. of raw coal,
                    equivalent to upwards of 12 cwt. of coke per ton of iron. According to Lowthian
                    Bell this result is largely due to the increase in the height of the furnace
                    produced by the addition of the coking chambers; <hi rend="italic">i. e.,</hi> a
                    large proportion of the saving (estimated by Bell at about one half) would have
                    been brought about by an increase in furnace height, even though the upper part
                    were not specially heated by the combustion of waste gases, the balance being
                    due, first, to the avoidance of a large portion of the heat absorption during
                    the coking of the coal that would otherwise have taken place at the expense of
                    the heat developed by chemical changes in the upper part of the furnace, owing
                    to the supply of heat from the combustion of waste gases in the external flues,
                    and, secondly, to the modifying action of the hydrocarbons developed on the
                    chemical changes themselves, the direction of the modification being that of
                    increased rate of reduction of iron oxide. In any case, the consumption of fuel
                    is by no means inferior to that which with the most advantageous conditions will
                    suffice to smelt a given iron ore (§ 21). For further details see <hi

                    at the top are connected with condensers for collection of tar and ammoniacal
                    liquor; the fuel only is placed in these chambers, the mine and flux being
                    introduced at their base.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Double Rows of Tuyeres.—</hi> Experiments have been made,
                    notably at Pittsburg, U.S., on furnaces with two sets of tuyeres, one row at a
                    lesser height above the sole than that of the other row, both rows used
                    simultaneously; the general effect has been found to be the reverse of
                    advantageous. It is, however, frequently convenient to have two or more tuyeres
                    symmetrically disposed round the furnace at a somewhat higher level than those
                    ordinarily used, the higher series being employed, not in the ordinary working
                    of the furnace, but only in case of certain derangements of working such as
                    scaffolding, &amp;c.; accordingly several furnaces of recent construction,
                    especially in America, have been thus fitted with “auxiliary tuyeres,” at 16 to
                    18 inches level above the others, ready for use when occasion needs. In certain
                    cases when scaffolding had taken place to such an extent that the furnace did
                    not give any fused matter at all at the hearth, and it was probable that it
                    would have to be put out of blast and partly unbuilt, proper working has been
                    brought about and the obstruction removed by what was thought when first
                    practised to be a desperate remedy, viz., cutting holes in the shaft at some

                    tuyeres blast at the orifices thus formed, so as to flux away the obstructing
                    matter. In certain American works scaffolds have been melted away by introducing
                    a little above the tuyere a pipe communicating with a barrel of petroleum, so as
                    to create an intense local heat by the combustion of the petroleum allowed to
                    run in in a gentle stream.</p>
                <p>13. <hi rend="italic">Hoists and Lifts.—</hi> Except when the natural variations
                    in the level of the ground permit of the materials being drawn in waggons or
                    trucks to the top of the furnace directly, lifts of various kinds are employed
                    to raise them. “Water lifts” consist of a pair of chambers or cages working in
                    guides suspended to the two ends of a chain passing over a pulley, and provided
                    with water boxes, so that a stream of water from a tank or reservoir at a higher
                    elevation can be directed into the uppermost waterbox, rendering that heavier
                    than the other, when the weighted cage descends with the empty trucks drawing up
                    the other one with the trucks laden with materials, the rate of descent being
                    regulated by a brake. In frosty weather lifts of this kind are apt to become
                    impracticable. Hydraulic lifts are sometimes used, consisting of a similar
                    chamber suspended from a chain passing over multiplying pulley blocks and
                    attached to the piston of a hydraulic ram, so that when the ram makes a stroke
                    the chain draws up the cage; if. the blocks multiply tenfold a stroke of 7 feet
                    of the ram draws up the cage 70 feet. At the Bethlehem Works, U.S., an hydraulic
                    hoist is employed in which the relatively short stroke of the ram is made to
                    raise the cage through a much greater height by making the ram actuate an axle
                    by means of a rack and pinion, a large wheel being fixed on the axle over which
                    the cage rope passes. Besides these lifts, an inclined plane and stationary
                    engine, or a vertical lift like a colliery winding engine, is sometimes
                    employed. Pneumatic lifts of various kinds are also in use, one consisting of a
                    tall bell immersed in a water tank like an exaggerated thin gasometer; the bell
                    is attached to the cage (underneath it) and also to a chain passing over a
                    pulley to a counterpoise, the weight being so arranged that the bell, when not
                    containing air under pressure, together with the cage and empty trolly, is
                    heavier than the counterpoise, and sinks when a valve is opened, so that the
                    internal air pressure becomes atmospheric; whilst on closing the valve and
                    forcing air in, the water inside the bell is partially displaced, and the bell
                    and cage, being relatively lighter, rise like an ordinary gasometer. Gjers’s
                    pneumatic lift is à piston box, such that, the air being exhausted or compressed
                    under the piston which is connected with the cage, a motion up or down as the
                    casé may be is brought about. Fig. 14, taken from a paper by Gjers.in the <hi
                    rend="italic">Journal Iron and Steel Institute,</hi> 1871, ii. 209, illustrates
                    the mode of action; the cylinder is about 36 inches diameter, the piston being
                    connected with the travelling platform (through the centre of which the cylinder
                    passes freely) by four wire ropes passing over pulleys overhead; the platform
                    runs along guides bolted to the cylinder. The platform and empty barrows being
                    at the top, air at about 2 lb pressure per square inch is forced into the
                    cylinder underneath the piston, which suffices to make it ascend, and
                    consequently to cause the table to descend; when barrows full of mine, coke,
                    &amp;c., are wheeled on to the platform, the air is sucked out from underneath
                    the piston so as to make a vacuum of about 4 lb <hi rend="italic">{i.e.,</hi>
                    the pressure is reduced from 14 to 10 tt&gt; per square inch) with heavy loads,
                    and proportionately less with lighter ones, when the atmospheric pressure now
                    forces the piston down and draws the cage up. The strain on the ropes is thus
                    diminished, whilst the objection to water lifts of being unworkable in frosty
                    .weather is entirely done away with. For heavier weights two larger cylinders
                    are employed, working conjointly with the cage or platform between them.</p>
                <p>14. <hi rend="italic">Production of Blast.—</hi> The earliest blowing machines
                    were made of goats’ skins, inflated by hand by pulling cords, and compressed
                    either by standing on them or by a weight or a bent bamboo acting as a spring,
                    &amp;c.; such rude arrangements are still in use amongst certain Eastern
                    nations; a kind of rudimentary cylinder blowing machine is also employed iu
                    certain districts, consisting of a hollowed log with a piston packed with
                    feathers, leaves, &amp;c. About the middle of the 17 th century the trompe
                    appears to have been first invented, probably in Italy. The action of this
                    arrangement depends on the suction of air into a stream of falling water running
                    from a tank by an orifice not too far from the surface of the water, just as
                    occurs on pulling out the plug of an ordinary lavatory basin so as to discharge
                    the water therein; the air carried down by the water is discharged into a
                    chamber withan outlet at bottom for the water and one at top for the air, so
                    that as long as the stream of water is kept up a continuous air current passes
                    out of the air hole, the force of which is regulated by a plug-valve attached to
                    a lever and cord, so that the furnaceman can at will diminish or increase the
                    amount of falling water. In practice the trompe only utilizes a small fraction
                    of the power of the descending water. It is of course inapplicable in cold
                    climates during frost; a serious disadvantage too is the fact that much fine
                    spray accompanies the blast and interferes with the production of heat thereby.
                    With a fall of 20 to 30 feet a well-proportioned trompe will deliver a
                    sufficient air supply for a Catalan forge at a pressure of about 9 or 10
                    centimetres of mercury (about ∣ atmosphere = nearly 2 lb per square inch).</p>

                <p>The blowing engines in ordinary use in England are worked by steam, but in other
                    countries, <hi rend="italic">e.g.,</hi> Sweden, where water-power is available,
                    this is frequently utilized. In principle cylinder blowing machines are
                    precisely like inverted steam engines, the air taking the place of the steam;
                    the singleacting machines are the reciprocal analogues of the atmospheric engine
                    (saving of course in the means by which the return stroke is effected), whilst
                    the double-acting machines are high-pressure steam engines inverted. In clack
                    valve machines the motion of the piston in one direction causes a diminished
                    pressure behind it, and consequently air rushes in through the intake valve at
                    that end, whilst the compression of the air in front of it opens the outlet
                    valve of the other end and causes the air to escape; on the return motion this
                    outlet valve is closed and the intake valve of the same end opened, whilst the
                    intake valve of the other end is closed and the outlet valve opened. In “slide
                    valve” machines the moving clack valves are replaced by sliders connected with
                    the piston rod by means of an eccentric on the shaft driving it, so that, when
                    the piston begins to make its stroke, the appropriate valves are closed or
                    unclosed as the case may be. In order to equalize the intermittent blast thus
                    produced, a regulator is sometimes interposed between the blowing cylinder and
                    the furnace, consisting of a reservoir or chamber of considerable size which
                    acts in much the same way as the air chamber of an ordinary force pump, the
                    whole mass of air becoming somewhat compressed when air is blown in, and the
                    expansion during the momentary cessation of the supply keeping up a sufficiently
                    equable stream qf air issuing from the reservoir until the next cylinderful of
                    air is blown in. To economize space, a piston box with a piston loaded with
                    weights, or a loaded gasometer in a water tank, may be substituted for the
                    reservoir; the latter expedient is objectionable, causing the air to be
                    saturated with moisture. If the furnace is at some distance from the blowing
                    engine, the large mass of air in the blast main and superheaters serves to
                    render uniform the current supplied to the furnace without any other regulator
                    being requisite.</p>

                    apparatus, applied by Neilson, consisted of a tubular rivetted boiler plate
                    heating vessel (Λ, <hi rend="italic">h,</hi> fig. 15), mounted in a brick
                    chamber OOOO, and heated by a fire underneath fed through the door D, the waste
                    gases from the fire passing out at the far end to the chimney. Crescentshaped

                    the arrows, finally passing off at S to the furnace. This was speedily
                    superseded by the “Calder pipe stove” (fig.</p>
                <p>16), consisting of two parallel tubes L, L running along the base of the stove
                    above the firebars <hi rend="italic">d, d,</hi> communicating the one with the
                    other by a series of inverted U or horse-shoe shaped tubes; the blast being

                    through the curved tubes A, <hi rend="italic">h,</hi> becoming heated in so
                    doing, the flames from the fire D&lt;7 enveloping the horse-shoe tubes and then
                    passing by the flue <hi rend="italic">f</hi> to the chimney C. Many
                    modifications of this stove hâve been introduced, several of which are still in
                    use: thus in some the air is compelled to pass alternately from a portion of the
                    one main to the other and <hi rend="italic">vice versa</hi> several times so as
                    to be more completely heated, passing through several horse-shoes before
                    emerging; the horse-shoes are sometimes altered into inverted V’s, and made
                    rectangular or flatly elliptical in section instead of circular so as to expose
                    greater heating surface. To avoid the liability to fracture through unequal
                    expansion, the U’s are sometimes made of two parallel vertical tubes united by a
                    horizontal connecting tube socketed into each, just as each vertical tube is
                    socketed into the main (fig. 17). The “pistol pipe” stove, still largely used
                    (fig. 18), chiefly differs from this in having the limbs of the U tube closely
                    adjacent, so as to consist in fact of a single tube with a partition D in the
                    centre, the cold air passing up one side of the partition and down the other so
                    as to become heated in passing; to accommodate the pipe to an arched roof, the
                    upper end is bent inwards, thus giving the form of a pistol stock and barrel to
                    the double pipe, two ranks of pipes facing one another being built in the same
                    stove. Another modification of the older tubular superheater consisted of a
                    serpentine or coil of piping made of cast iron pipes bent into half circles and
                    socketed together, so as to form a continuous worm tube which was mounted inside
                    a brickwork stove and heated by a fire in much the same way as the Calder pipe
                    stove. The “Wasseralfingen superheater” consists of a kind of serpentine of
                    which the curved parts lie outside the stove, only straight tubes being exposed
                    to heat. The “Blaina oven” differs from this chiefly in the serpentine being
                    vertical instead of horizontal, and in the whole of the serpentine (the curved
                    ends inclusive) being exposed to the heating flame.</p>
                <p>The substitution of the waste gases from the blast furnaces as fuel for the coal
                    or coke-fired, fireplaces originally used for these and various other forms of
                    superheater not only works advantageously in saving the fuel that would
                    otherwise be requisite, but also keeps up a more regular heating effect, and
                    diminishes the liability to breakage through unequal expansion, &amp;c. All
                    these forms of superheater, however, are open to the same objection, viz., that
                    it is impracticable to heat the blast continuously by means of them to a higher
                    temperature than about 450° C., otherwise the iron pipes get speedily burnt
                    away. In order to obtain a higher temperature, the principle of the Siemens
                    regenerative furnace is employedin the Siemens-Cowper stove, the flame from the
                    combustion of the waste gases from the blast furnaces being made to traverse
                    piles or stacks of brickwork loosely heaped together or regularly laid so as to
                    heat up the brickwork, the products of combustion finally passing, off to the
                    chimney at a comparatively low temperature. After the lapse of a certain time
                    the flame is shut off, and the cold air blast made to traverse the heated
                    brickwork in the reverse direction, entering at the cooler chimney end, and
                    leaving at the hottest point near where the furnace gases and the air to burn
                    them originally entered; two such regenerators are used together alternately,
                    thé flame heating up one whilst the blast is being heated in the other, and <hi
                    rend="italic">vice versa,</hi> the shifting of the blast and furnace gases from
                    the one to the other being accomplished by opening and shutting suitable valves.
                    Owing to the presence of dust in the blast furnace gases, the cavities between
                    the piled bricks are apt to become filled up with deposit; to remedy this
                    inconvenience in the “Whitwell stove” the piles of brickwork are replaced by a
                    series of parallel firebrick walls about 9 inches apart, each wall being
                    perforated by arched openings at the top and bottom respectively in each
                    alternate wall, so that the flame passes alternately up and down between each
                    wall and the adjacent one, thus heating up the surfaces of the walls (figs. 19,
                    20). By means of manholes at the top and sides scrapers can be introduced from
                    time to time, and the deposit of flue dust scraped off the walls and removed
                    from the stove without rendering it necessary to take down the internal
                    brickwork at all. With regenerative stoves of this description worked in pairs
                    it is easy to obtain a continuous blast at a temperature of 75(Γ <hi
                    rend="superscript"> ,</hi> to 800° C.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Determination of Temperature of Blast.—</hi> A rough and ready
                    method often employed is to take out a plug from the blast main, or “gooseneck,”
                    supplying the tuyere, and to hold in the issuing stream of hot air a rod of zinc
                    or other test metal for a determinate time, noting how long it takes to melt its
                    end. More accurate methods consist in the use of specially constructed
                    pyrometers. Certain forms containing a compound silver and platinum spiral,
                    working on much the same principle as that of Breguet’s thermometer, and others
                    in which the expansion of a bar of metal moves an index by means of multiplying
                    wheels or levers, although useful for comparatively low temperatures (below 500°

                    forms of pyrometer invented by Siemens are applicable. One of these is an

                <p>Siemens’s instrument (fig. 21) is a copper cylinder jacketed outside with a
                    double jacket, the inner portion of which is an air space and the outer a
                    concentric laver of hair so as to diminish errors due to radiation and
                    atmospheric action; this is provided with a thermometer, the bulb of which is
                    protected by a copper gauze covering, fixed in a groove in the wall of the
                    innermost vessel; a sliding scale is attached, so constructed as to indicate at
                    sight the temperature of the ball dropped in when the zero of the scale is
                    adjusted to the temperature of the calorimeter before starting as indicated by
                    the height of the thermometric mercurial column, and the level of the mercury

                    dropped in,—the size of the ball and the quantity of water in the instrument
                    being duly proportioned to one another. The “ball” is a cylinder of copper with
                    a perforation in the axjs, so that it can be lifted up on a pointed rod and
                    introduced through a small opening into the blast main, &amp;c., to be examined;
                    after a few minutes, when the ball has attained to the temperature of the blast,
                    it is quickly withdrawn and dropped into the copper-calorimeter previously
                    filled up to a mark with water, which is well stirred up before setting the
                    movable scale and subsequently after the ball is dropped in, so as to equalize
                    the temperature. Usually the calorimeter holds a pint of water, the copper being
                    of such a weight that its thermal capacity is equal to - <hi rend="subscript">
                    5</hi> ⅛ of a pint of water. With an instrument that has been “calibrated”
                    (i.e., the error of each scale indication determined by previous experiments at
                    accurately measured temperatures), the writer’s experience is that very
                    concordant and accurate results may be obtained <hi rend="italic">by an expert
                    operator working in precisely the same way as that employed in the calibration
                    of the instrument,</hi> but that very considerable errors are apt to be
                    introduced if the instruments as sold are employed without such corrections
                    being made, and if the times which elapse during the withdrawal of the heated
                    ball from the blast main and its dropping into the water are at all unequal, so
                    that different amounts of heat are lost by atmospheric cooling before the ball
                    reaches the water. Moreover, with use the balls become lighter, and the
                    temperature indicated is then too low.</p>
                <p>The other Siemens pyrometer depends on the alteration of the dectrical resistance
                    of a platinum wire when heated. The current from a suitable battery is divided
                    into two branches, one of which passes through the experimental wire and the
                    other through a counterbalancing resistance consisting of another wire which is
                    not heated, the two branches again meeting in one conducting wire which
                    completes the circuit. If the two counterbalancing wires are at the same
                    temperature, equal amounts of current will flow through each branch, the
                    resistance of the conductors, &amp;c., in each branch other than the two wires
                    being equal; but if one wire be hotter, less current will . flow through that
                    branch as compared with the other in proportion as the temperature is more
                    elevated. By determining electrically the difference between the amounts of
                    current in the two branches, a means is afforded of calculating the temperature
                    to which the hotter wire has been raised. In the newest form of instrument (fig.
                    22) a pair of ingeniously constructed voltameters is employed as the
                    current-difference measurer, one being in each branch of the compound circuit,
                    so that by reading off the volumes of gas evolved in the two, and referring to
                    specially constructed tables, the temperature of the heated wire is at once
                    known. In order to apply this to the measurement of the temperature of blast
                    mains, furnaces, &amp;c., the wire to be heated is wound spirally upon a
                    porcelain cylinder, which is then enclosed in a protecting iron tube; the ends
                    of the platinum wire are connected with thick copper leading wires insulated by
                    kaolin, &amp;c.,atthe hot part of the tube, and by ordinary gutta percha,
                    &amp;c., at the other end. An equal amount of the same copper-wire is included
                    in the second branch, usually by carrying three wires through the hollow iron
                    tube,—one to convey the current before branching (the division taking place near
                    the heated end), the other to convey the current through the branch containing
                    the heated wire, and the third for the current in the other branch to t&gt;ass
                    through; in this way errors through the unequal length and mating of the copper
                    conductors in the two branches are avoided. Very accurate measurements are
                    obtainable with instruments of this class when newly arranged; but it is not
                    always certain that the resistance of a given platinum wire will remain constant
                    after long-continued heating or interrupted exposure to high temperatures,
                    &amp;c.; in consequence it is requisite that the actual resistance after cooling
                    of the heated wire should be verified from time to time, and the numerical
                    values in the instrumental tables suitably adjusted when any alteration has
                    taken place, otherwise serious errors may be introduced.</p>
                <p>For temperatures above 800° or 900° C. a peculiar pyrometer has been proposed by
                    Lamy <hi rend="italic">{Comptes Rendus,</hi> lxix. 347), based upon the
                    connexion between the amount of dissociation of calcium carbonate and the
                    pressure and temperature to which it is subjected; a glazed porcelain tube
                    closed at one end with some fragments of marble and calcspar is filled with
                    carbon dioxide gas and connected with a mercurial manometer; on placing the end
                    of the tube containing the calcspar on the furnace to be examined, the extra
                    pressure due to the evolved carbon dioxide is read off on the manometer, and the
                    temperature thence deduced by a table; on cooling, the evolved gas is reabsorbed
                    by the partially causticized lime.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Tuyeres.—</hi> The heated blast passes into the furnace through
                    nozzles or <hi rend="italic">tuyeres</hi> supplied from an annular or horseshoe
                    shaped tube carried round the lower part of the furnace at an elevation of a few
                    feet above them by means of slanting tubes at right angles to the ring known as
                    “swan necks” or “goosenecks.” Usually the annular tube is carried by the columns
                    supporting the superstructure by means of suitable braces or gibbets, and
                    communicates with the blast main at a point as near to the superheater as
                    possible, slide valves being provided for each goose neck so that any one of the
                    tuyeres can, when necessary, be shut off without stopping the supply of blast to
                    the others; when more than one furnace is supplied from the same hot main, a
                    similar valve is provided in the branch from the main leading to each furnace.
                    In order to adjust the nozzle of the tuyere accurately to the tuyere hole in the
                    hearth wall, a sliding telescope joint is often inserted between the nozzle and
                    the end of the goose neck, the lowest portion of the nearly vertical part of
                    which is provided with a tubulus closed with a hollow stopper, the hollow of
                    which is covered with a plate of mica; by looking through <pb break="no"

                    the furnace interior is obtained, whilst by removing the stopper a jet of hot
                    blast rushes out, by means of which the temperature can be ascertained by
                    holding rods of zinc, &amp;c., in the jet; or the ball of a Siemens pyrometer
                    can be introduced into the tuyere through the orifice.</p>
                <p>In the early days of the hot blast it speedily became manifest that unless the
                    tuyere nozzles were artificially cooled they became so rapidly eaten away that
                    practically the hot blast was inapplicable; to remedy this the “water tuyere”
                    was invented by Condie. This simply consists of a nozzle with double walls, the
                    outer one forming a “jacket” round the inner one or nozzle proper, water being
                    allowed to circulate through the space between the walls. Another way of
                    effecting the cooling is by bending a coil of wrought iron piping into a conical
                    spiral (fig. 23), placing this in the cavity of a mould furnished with a core,
                    and casting round it a hollow cone of cast iron, so that by connecting the
                    projecting ends of the coil with a water main and escape pipe respectively a
                    continual circulation of water is kept up through the coil, whilst the blast
                    passes through the central cavity. Sometimes bronze and especially
                    “phosphor-bronze” nozzles are employed; these have the advantage that the molten
                    pig iron as it runs down inside the furnace does not adhere to them so readily
                    as it does to iron tuyeres. The tuyeres are generally arranged symmetrically in
                    a horizontal plane round the base of the furnace, this effects an equal
                    distribution of blast, an∣ facilitates regular working. With small-sized furnace
                    such as are used in various parts of the Continent (witl charcoal as fuel), two
                    tuyeres only are ire quently used; with larger ones three, four or five are
                    usually employed, the diamete of the orifice of the nozzle being greater th
                    greater the furnace; thus whilst some: inches diameter suffices with the smalle
                    furnaces, 4, 5, 6, and even 8 inch nozzles ar ) used with the larger furnaces,
                    especially iι America <hi rend="italic">(e.g.,</hi> at Pittsburg), and when th
                    number of tuyeres is small. In other case a larger number of tuyeres, sometimes
                    a many as eight, are substituted for increase« dimensions, so as to enable the
                    requisit amount of air to pass into the furnace with out unduly increasing the
                    pressure of th blast, which varies from 2 to 50 percent of an atmosphere <hi
                    rend="italic">(fe.,</hi> from about half aι inch to 15 inches of mercury,
                    representing from 4 oz. to 7⅜ ft per square inch), th lightest pressure being
                    employed in smal charcoal furnaces, and the heaviest in th English hard coke
                    large furnaces and th American anthracite furnaces, especially th· latter, on
                    account of the tendency of tin anthracite to disintegrate and so plug up th&lt;
                    passages between the lumps of ore, &amp;c. Th∣ pressure of the blast in ordinary
                    1arg&lt; English furnaces, such as those of the Cleve land district, usually
                    averages about 4 t( 4 ’ 5 ft per square inch, equivalent to abou one-third of an
                    atmosphere, or some 10 inche! of mercury.</p>
                <p>When the nozzle of a tuyere gets injured oι burnt through, the water intended to
                    keep it coo is apt to find its way into the furnace. As long as the quantity of
                    water thus introduced is small, the only effect is a reduction of temperature
                    opposite to the tuyere owing to the heat absorption in the conversion of th«
                    water into steam and the reaction of the water vapour on the red hot coke,
                    forming carbon oxide and hydrogen (the presence of extra hydrogen thus formed
                    also modifies to some extent the chemical actions taking place in the upper part
                    of the furnace in a direction rather the reverse of economical as regards
                    consumption of fuel); if, on the other hand, a large volume of water is suddenly
                    introduced, and especially if by a “slip” (or sudden jerky motion downwards of a
                    mass of material that had previously more or less ‘ ‘ scaffolded ”) it is forced
                    into the mass of molten cinder and pig in the hearth, or, what amounts to the
                    same thing, it the cinder and molten pig are suddenly forced or splashed up by
                    the slip, a sudden explosive generation of steam (and probably decomposition
                    into oxygen and hydrogen, or formation of iron oxide and free hydrogen) takes
                    place, sometimes giving rise to serious accidents. Why contact with vitreous
                    matter (such as cinder, &amp;c.) should cause a more explosive formation of
                    water vapour or gases than contact with metal is unknown, but probably the cause
                    is the same as that in virtue of which a piece of sodium in contact with λvater
                    only will evolve hydrogen quickly but not explosively, whereas if the sodium
                    touch glass, glazed crockery, &amp;c., and water simultaneously, a violent
                    explosion often occurs. In foundries and during the refining of iron (§ 23), if
                    water be thrown on the surface of the molten or semi-fused metal, and a piece of
                    solid cinder or slag be mechanically carried under the surface of the hot metal,
                    a more or less loud explosion often occurs, sometimes sufficiently violent to
                    produce fatal consequences and do much damage (Menelaus); on the other hand, in
                    cold blast furnaces where water tuyeres are not used, explosions of this class
                    never happen, although in all kinds of furnaces explosions may occur due to
                    admixtures of air and blast furnace gases being formed when the blast is cut off
                    for tapping, &amp;c., and then being fired on putting on the blast again. This
                    class of accident is usually guarded against as far as possible by means of
                    appropriately constructed valves in the gas main, &amp;c. Sudden violent
                    mechanical squirting out of molten pig or cinder by a slip inside the furnace
                    sometimes occurs with serious consequences; but this is a different thing from
                    (though often combined with) the effect of water being carried suddenly into
                    contact with the cinder, <pb break="no"

                    the liability to explosions from this effect of water, Lloyd has patented a
                    peculiar tuyere into which the cooling water is injected in the form of spray or
                    fine jets all over the outer surface of an inner conical tube through which the
                    hot air passes, as well as over the inner surface of an outer covering cone, so
                    that in case of the end of the tuyere being burnt away the volume of water
                    injected into the furnace is much lessened, as owing to the incline backwards of
                    the lowest part of the cone (the axis being horizontal) most of the water runs
                    out <hi rend="italic">away from</hi> the furnace instead of being forced into it
                    by the pressure of the head of water as in the ordinary coil tuyere. When the
                    water supplied is muddy, or is apt to deposit matter on warming or standing,
                    there is a liability to stopping up of the holes through which the fine jets of
                    water pass; to rémedy this Plum modifies the aιτangement by making the water
                    pass through a slit or against a sheet of metal so as to spread it out into
                    fan-shaped jets delivered against the nose of the tuyere and the upper half of

                    in America for the reception of the cinder consists of a series of iron boxes
                    placed in a water tank on a turn-table, the object being to quicken the
                    solidification of the cinder and get it out of the way more rapidly. In order to
                    cast the pig iron into convenient marketable forms, the ground in front of the
                    tapping hole is made into a <hi rend="italic">pigbed,</hi> by arranging it at a
                    gentle slope from the tapping hole and covering it with loam or sand. A channel
                    is dug in this with a spade, &lt;fcc., leading down the slope in a right line
                    from the tapping hole; and at right angles to this side channels are dug, the
                    ground sloping laterally away from the main channel; from each side channel
                    moulds are made to spring, prepared by pressing into the yielding sand wooden
                    blocks some 2 or 3 feet in length, and in section like a capital D, the convex
                    side (on which is embossed or engraved the particular mark or brand of the
                    iron-works) being downwards. When the furnace is tapped the rivulet of molten
                    metal running down the main channel is first directed into the lowest row of
                    moulds, and when these are full the supply is shut off by plunging a spade
                    coated with fireclay into the channel at <hi rend="italic">a</hi> (fig. 24), so
                    as to fill up the second row of moulds, and so on successively until only cinder

                    the tapping is performed only once in twelve hours; in others a cast is made
                    every eight hours or even more frequently; of course the oftener the furnace is
                    tapped the less the size of the pigbed required. Occasionally the molten metal
                    is run into waggons lined with firebrick serving as reservoirs supplying with
                    fused pig Bessemer converters conjoined with the smelting furnaces; so that the
                    molten cast iron is run directly into the converters and finished off without
                    ever solidifying before the completion of the steel-making process. Sometimes
                    the metal is cast into pigs in iron moulds instead of a sand bed.</p>

                    production of malleable iron), the blast furnace cinder is apt to contain an
                    undue proportion of iron, these additional substances being usually much more
                    compact in their texture than ores, and at the same time more fusible, so that
                    their complete reduction is often not effected in the time during which they are
                    traversing the furnace. Since these slags are usually highly contaminated with
                    phosphorus and sulphur, they are only employed as a rule in conjunction with
                    ores yielding the commoner qualities of iron, furnishing “cinder pig,” which is
                    often wholly white, and less carbonized and more impure than other kinds ot
                    white iron. The accompanying analyses illustrate the composition of the cinder
                    produced in furnaces smelting various kinds of ore.</p>
                <p>17. <hi rend="italic">Utilization of Cinder.—</hi> When the cinder does not
                    contain too much lime or calcium sulphide, it often forms a material of moderate
                    hardness and durability suitable for road metal; but frequently it is of but
                    little value for this purpose, owing to its friability and tendency to fall to
                    pieces on exposure to air and moisture. By casting the molten cinder (when of
                    the requisite amount of durability) into rectangular blocks, a good substitute
                    for building stone is produced; in other cases, by the addition of alkaline
                    silicates, a serviceable coarse bottle glass can be obtained. Vitreous cinders
                    also serve for the preparation of a variety of “mineral wool,” a filamentous
                    substance something like spun glass producible by blowing air or steam through
                    the molten cinder, and useful for packing the jackets of steam pipes, boilers,
                    &amp;c., to avoid loss of heat, and superior for this purpose to organic
                    substances in being not liable to char or burn. Certain kinds of cinder which
                    approximate to cements in composition may be utilized in the manufacture of
                    hydraulic mortars, Portland cement, &amp;c., by heating together with lime or
                    hydraulic limestone; according to J. Huck, if the powdered slag be stirred up in
                    a tank with dilute hydrochloric acid (containing some 17 per cent, of actual
                    acid, HC1), sulphuretted hydrogen is evolved, and a partly gelatinized mass is
                    produced by the decomposition of the silicates; this when washed, drained,
                    dried, and ground to fine powder, and mixed with finely powdered ordinary slag
                    so as to constitute about 10 per cent, of the mixture, affords a cement capable
                    of use for all sorts of work as well under water as above it, and equal in
                    quality to the best cements in ordinary use. Bricks for building purposes may be
                    made from suitable kinds of cinder by grinding it to a coarse powder, moistening
                    and mixing with a little lime, and strongly compressing in moulds by machinery;
                    the brick sets in a few days to a hard stone-like mass; some cinders will thus
                    set without addition of lime by merely grinding up fine, moistening, and
                    compressing. In order to facilitate the grinding, C. Wood has patented the
                    following process: the molten slag as it runs from the furnace is received on a
                    slowly revolving horizontal table and cooled by a jet of water (fig. 25), which
                    causes it to disintegrate into comparatively small fragments which are much'more
                    readily pulverized than the compact blocks formed when the molten slag runs into
                    a receptacle and there solidifies; or it is reduced to a kind of sand by running
                    it into water kept in agitation by a peculiar machine, the sand being a
                    moderately useful manure for certain ’soils, <hi rend="italic">Journal I. and S.
                    Inst.,</hi> 1873, 186, and 1877, 443; and <hi rend="italic">Journal Soc.
                    Arts,</hi> May 14, 1880 (vol. xxviii. p. 576). At the Sclessin Works, Liège,
                    slag sand is made without any machinery at all by simply making the stream of
                    molten slag run into a constant-running jet of water issuing obliquely from
                    behind; the slag thus disintegrates spontaneously into small fragments. Many
                    kinds of cinder, however, are of so little value for any of these purposes that
                    they constitute a wholly waste product, the getting rid of which in the cheapest
                    way possible is a desideratum.</p>
                <p>18. <hi rend="italic">Collection of Waste Gases.—</hi> To M. Aubertot of the
                    department of Cher belongs the credit of having first attempted to utilize the
                    gases escaping from blast furnaces, in 1811; a brick kiln being erected on the
                    top of the furnace, the flame was allowed to pass in and so burn the bricks; the
                    calcination of lime and the heating of the chests containing charcoal and iron
                    bars for steel cementation was effected by him in the same way. In later years
                    steam boilers were heated in much the same way; about 1840, at the Rustrel
                    furnaces (department of Vaucluse), the device was in use of drawing off the
                    gases by means of a tube and burning them underneath the boilers placed, not on
                    the top of the furnace, but in any convenient place even though at some
                    distance. The use of the waste gases for heating the blast on this principle was
                    patented in England by J. Palmer Budd in 1845. A few years later George Parry of
                    Ebbw Vale adapted an old arrangement for distributing equally the charges
                    introduced into the furnace (by shooting the materials on to a conical surface
                    at the mouth of the shaft) so as to form a kind of valve, closing the furnace
                    entirely when shut and allowing the gases to pass out completely into a tube
                    conveying them to the places where they were to be burnt, and at the same time
                    allowing the charge to be introduced almost instantaneously when opened. This
                    “cup and cone” arrangement is represented in fig. 26.</p>
                <p>By simply lowering the cone (counterbalanced) the materials shoot off it into the
                    furnace; by immediately raising it the furnace is again closed; on account of
                    its simplicity and ease in working it has been very largely adopted, especially
                    as it facilitates the proper distribution of materials inside the furnace by
                    making them glide off the slanting conical surface so as to be deposited at the
                    sides of the shaft and not at its centre; the effect of this is to tend to make
                    the upper surface of the mass concave instead of convex, and in consequence the
                    lighter coke or charcoal tends to roll down the slope towards the centre
                    somewhat more than the heavier ore and flux, so that the central portion of the
                    mass of materials in the shaft is somewhat richer in fuel than the sides; if the
                    furnace is full nearly to the throat and of considerable width, the surface will
                    be crater-shaped,—the heavier ore, &amp;c., accumulating in the circular crater
                    ridge, and the lighter coke rolling down inwards towards the centre, and
                    outwards towards the side of the shaft. As the materials sink the outermost
                    layers are retarded by friction against the sides <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit13newyrich/page/n323/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0913-0323-0308"/> of the shaft, so that they have a tendency to
                    fall over inwards during descent and produce intermixture; in this way a much
                    more nearly uniform degree of porosity of the whole mass (and consequently of
                    action of the ascending gases) is brought about than would be the case were the
                    materials introduced through a narrow funnel so as to forai a convex-surfaced
                    heap in which the ore would accumulate in the centre. Sometimes the cup and cone
                    arrange-- ment is modified by making the cone to rest <hi rend="italic"
                    >upon</hi> the inner and lower edge of the hollow in the cup, so that the
                    introduction of fuel is accomplished by raising the cone instead of lowering it,
                    the object of this being to diminish the height of the furnace by the space
                    through which the cone would otherwise sink when lowered.</p>
                <p>With this arrangement the materi ils run into the furnace in a direction sloping
                    towards the centre instead of away from it, sliding inwards along the converging
                    sides of the cup. To avoid the central accumulation of fuel and the lateral
                    preponderance of “burden” (ore and flux) thus promoted, an inverted annular
                    funnel is suspended underneath the lower orifice of the cup, so that the falling
                    substances impinge upon this and slide off again with a motion towards the
                    circumference of the shaft just as they do from the cone itself in the ordinary
                    arrangement.</p>
                <p>Prior to the introduction of the cup and cone, a form of tunnelhead in which no
                    valve or cone exists was employed, represented in fig. 27. A hollow annular
                    chamber BB is built in the upper portion of the stack, communicating by arched
                    cavities A, A, A with the shaft, and also with the exit gas main C; a
                    considerable fraction of the gases then passes out through the arched cavities
                    when the materials are heaped up to the level of the charging door D. With small
                    furnaces the wall between the shaft and the chamber B is made of cast or wrought
                    iron; in some cases the gas has been collected through a central tube in the
                    axis of the shaft supported by groins springing from the shaft, the ore,
                    &amp;c., being charged through the annular opening between this tube and the
                    shaft. Arrangements of this kind are still used in Sweden. In Coingt’s gas
                    collector the central tube is combined with a modification of the cup and cone
                    arrangement. Langen’s arrangement (figs. 28, 29) is a somewhat similar
                    combination, the cone being made into a bell with perforated top, the edges of
                    the perforation being turned over inwards <hi rend="italic">bb</hi>; the bell
                    rests <hi rend="italic">upon</hi> the cup <hi rend="italic">aa,</hi> the turned

                    be raised so that the charge in the cup falls into the furnace, sliding down the

                    rend="italic">fg</hi> are provided, the latter being ordinarily supported by the
                    pressure of the gases, but falling by its own weight when the gas pressure is
                    relieved by raising the bell, so as to close the top of the gas shaft, the

                <p><hi rend="italic">Composition of Waste Gases.—</hi> In general terms the escaping
                    gases may be said to be the nitrogen of the blast mixed with variable
                    proportions of carbon oxide and dioxide, and usually small quantities of free
                    hydrogen; when raw coal is the fuel, the proportion of hydrogen is greater, and
                    carburetted hydrogens are also present. The main sources of hydrogen when coke
                    and charcoal are used as fuel are probably the hydrogenous matter in the fuel,
                    and the moisture contained in the blast and in the materials as water of
                    hydration not expelled until they reach a part of the furnace sufficiently high
                    to cause the water vapour to react whilst still nascent on the carbon present,
                    forming carbon oxide and hydrogen (see § 10).</p>
                <p>Various solid substances are mechanically carried up with the gases, these having
                    in many instances been vaporized at the lower levels, condensing again in the
                    relatively cooler portions of the furnace as finely divided particles. This
                    especially applies to zinc oxide (formed by the oxidation of zinc vapour
                    generated by the reduction of zinc compounds in the ores) and to compounds of
                    the alkali metals, and gives rise in the latter case to a destructive fluxing
                    action upon the brick-work of the upper portion of the furnace and to a
                    complication in the chemical changes ensuing in the furnace; for the solid
                    floating particles are more or less intercepted and filtered out, as it were,
                    from the ascending stream of gases by the materials in the upper part of the
                    furnace, and are thus brought back again to the lower level, so that an
                    accumulation in the furnace of alkali metals is produced which ultimately causes
                    the actual quantity of alkaline compounds in the furnace to bear a very
                    considerable proportion to the iron present, although the amount of potash and
                    soda in the ore flux and fluel is originally only trifling as compared with the
                    iron. Those portions of the suspended solid matters which are not thus retained
                    in the furnace by condensation on the materials are more or less deposited in
                    the gas flues, and the heating stoves, &amp;c., in which the gas is burnt,
                    sometimes causing considerable inconvenience, and rendering it necessary to
                    clean out the deposits from time to time. To avoid this clogging, the fume is
                    sometimes washed out of the gases by jets of water in the form of spray before
                    they pass on from the downcast pipe to the stoves; an arrangement of this
                    description applied to the Lucy furnace (Pittsburg, U. S. ) has worked well. The
                    following analyses represent the composition of the fume deposited in the gas
                    flues of various furnaces :—</p>

                <p>Amongst the alkaline salts thus deposited are considerable amounts (under certain
                    circumstances) of potassium and sodium cyanides (§ 19); this circumstance
                    appears to have misled Professors Bunsen and Playfair into the belief that <hi
                    rend="italic">cyanogen gas</hi> is occasionally one of the normal constituents
                    of blast furnace gases as they escape at the top, the cyanides being more or
                    less deposited in the collecting tube employed, and decomposed by the carbon
                    dioxide and moisture present, with the production of hydrocyanic vapour, which
                    on . analysis gives the same numbers as the same bulk of a mixture of hydrogen
                    and cyanogen in equal volumes; it is noteworthy that cyanogen has never been
                    found by any other analyst. The following analyses indicate the general
                    character of the waste gases escaping at the top of blast furnaces smelting
                    various ores:—</p>

                <p>The precise relative amounts of carbon oxide and dioxide that accompany the
                    proper working of any particular furnace are governed by a variety of
                    circumstances, many of which have been carefully investigated by Percy, Bunsen
                    and Playfair, Vathaire, Tiinner, Ebelmen, Scheerer, and others, and more
                    especially by Lowthian Bell, with the present writer’s cooperation <hi
                    rend="italic">(Chemical Phenomena of Iron Smelting),</hi> with the general
                    result that the amount of heat produced in the furnace by the conversion of the
                    fuel (coke or charcoal) into carbon oxide and dioxide, together with that
                    introduced by the blast, is equal to the sensible heat carried out by the
                    escaping gases and the molten pig and cinder, together with an amount constant
                    for given conditions, but otherwise variable within certain limits, representing
                    the sum of the heat absorptions during the various physical and chemical changes
                    going on in the furnace, and the loss of heat from the furnace walls by
                    radiation and conduction; so that for given sizes and shapes of furnace, given
                    ores and fluxes, and production or given kinds of pig iron and cinder, the
                    amount of carbon oxide relatively to the carbon dioxide in the escaping gases is
                    regulated only by the proportion of fuel burnt, and the temperature of the
                    issuing gases; this latter being also constant, the greater the amount of coke
                    burnt per ton of iron run the more carbon oxide exists in the waste gases and
                    the less carbon dioxide, and <hi rend="italic">vice versa.</hi> There is always
                    a natural limit, however, to the extent to which the quantity of carbon monoxide
                    can be reduced and that of carbon dioxide increased in any given furnace under
                    any given conditions (as to nature of ore, &amp;c.) by diminishing the amount of
                    fuel relatively to the burden; as this limit is being approached and passed, the
                    pig iron begins to deteriorate in quality, first being less graphitoidal or
                    “grey” in character, then becoming entirely white iron of a less carbonized
                    character than good pig of the kind; finally a large fraction of the iron is
                    wholly unreduced, and passes into the cinder as ferrous oxide (silicate),
                    producing a strongly marked “scouring cinder,” and greatly diminishing the
                    yield. The reason for this is simply the natural character of the complex
                    chemical changes and reactions involved in the working of the blast furnace
                    (dealt with in detail in § 19).</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Poisonous Effects of Blast-Furnace Gases.—</hi> Carbon oxide
                    being, as is well known, a poisonous gas, rapidly producing death when inhaled
                    even in small quantity (as when badly ventilated rooms are warmed by charcoal
                    braziers, &amp;c., or when a considerable escape of coal gas—containing usually
                    a few parts per cent, of carbon oxide—takes place into the air of the room), it
                    results that unless care be taken serious effects may be produced by the
                    inhalation of the waste gases from the blast furnace. Several fatal occurrences
                    due to this cause have taken place, one of the most remarkable of which was the
                    death of Mr Truran, manager of the Dowlais iron-works, through the escape into
                    his office of the gases from the gas main, which was of brickwork, and newly
                    constructed underground. Besides carbon oxide, the waste gases often contain
                    perceptible quantities of potassium cyanide disseminated through them as dust;
                    the effect of moisture and carbon dioxide upon such air is to impregnate it with
                    vapour of hydrocyanic acid (prussic acid); in some of the cases of poisoning by
                    waste gases the cyanide was believed to be the chief deleterious agent.</p>
                <p>19. <hi rend="italic">Chemical Changes taking place in the Blast Furnace.</hi>
                    —At the level of the tuyeres, the entering blast comes in contact with a mass of
                    incandescent coke through and over which molten cinder and pig iron are dropping
                    and running; the almost instantaneous effect upon the air consequently is to
                    transform the oxygen into carbon oxide either at once or through the two
                    well-known reactions :—</p>
                <p>C + O <hi rend="subscript"> a</hi> =CO <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> (1),</p>
                <p>CO <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> + C =2Cυ (2).</p>
                <p>If a hole be drilled through the walls of a furnace at the tuyere level, and the
                    issuing gases collected (or, what is much the same thing, if the blast be shut
                    off from one goose neck and the plug taken out so that the pressure of gases
                    inside the furnace forces gas out at the orifice),'it is invariably found that
                    the amount of carbon dioxide present in the gases is inconsiderable or nil,— the
                    composition of the gases being essentially a mixture of carbon and ’nitrogen
                    with a little hydrogen (either derived from the moisture in the blast being
                    converted into hydrogen and carbon oxide, or from the hydrogen of the coke first
                    burnt to water vapour and then immediately reconverted into hydrogen and carbon
                    oxide). Besides the carbon oxide due to these causes, there is also a small
                    amount of that gas arising from the molten iron and cinder accumulated in the
                    hearth, owing to the reaction of the dissolved carbon on the last traces of iron
                    oxide disseminated through the pig and dissolved in the cinder; so that at the
                    tuyere level there naturally is a little more oxygen relatively to the nitrogen
                    than that corresponding to the oxygen of the original air and moisture in the
                    blast, viz., a mixture of about 35 volumes of carbon oxide and 65 of nitrogen.
                    In passing through the mass of materials in the furnace, the carbon oxide
                    becomes more or less converted into carbon dioxide, reducing the iron ore in
                    virtue of the change expressed in general terms by the equation <hi
                    rend="italic">zC0 + Ye</hi><hi rend="italic subscript"> x</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >0</hi><hi rend="italic subscript"> ν</hi><hi rend="italic">=zC0</hi><hi
                    rend="italic subscript"> i</hi><hi rend="italic">+ Ye</hi><hi rend="italic

                    rend="italic">. . .</hi>. (3); so that, were this the sole action taking place,
                    at successive levels upwards the amount of carbon in the gases would remain
                    constant relatively to the nitrogen, whilst the oxygen therein would increase.
                    The actual changes, however, are far more complex than this. Thus, commencing
                    with the top of the furnace, and proceeding downwards, when raw limestone is
                    used as flux, it gives off carbon dioxide as it gets heated, thereby increasing
                    both carbon and oxygen in the gases; during the passage downwards of the ore in
                    the blast furnace it finds itself continually exposed to a heated atmosphere
                    containing carbon oxide and dioxide; the first effect of the gases upon the
                    newly introduced ore is simply to heat it up, but as soon as the outer portions
                    of the lumps have attained a temperature of something like 200° C. (dependent on
                    the physical character of the ore), which practically is almost immediately
                    after introduction, reduction of the ferric oxide present commences, the carbon
                    oxide of the gases becoming converted into carbon dioxide in accordance with
                    equation 3. Simultaneously, however, the fuel introduced is more or less acted
                    upon: if raw coal be not used, but coke or charcoal, as is most frequently the
                    case, the effect of exposing this to an atmosphere containing carbon dioxide is
                    to cause (when the temperature is sufficiently high) the occurrence of the
                    reaction between the carbon dioxide and the carbon of the fuel expressed by
                    equation 2. The temperature at which this change begins to take place to any
                    considerable extent depends on the physical condition of the carbon, as does
                    also the rate at which it goes o∏j which is also modified by the amount of
                    carbon dioxide present in the gases relatively <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit13newyrich/page/n325/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0913-0325-0310"/> to the other constituents; the reaction is not
                    sensible with hard coke at temperatures lower than 300°, whilst at 400° and
                    somewhat upwards it is not marked; at 500° and 600°, however, it goes on pretty
                    rapidly, the more so the less hard and dense the coke, charcoal acting much more
                    readily under similar conditions than, coke. Accordingly as the iron ore and the
                    fuel gradually sink in the furnace and become hotter, they tend to affect the
                    composition of the gas in opposite ways, the former decreasing the carbon oxide
                    and increasing the carbon dioxide, and <hi rend="italic">vice versa</hi> with
                    the latter. The rate of reduction of iron oxide under constant circumstances is,
                    however, a diminishing one, inasmuch as the reduced particles cover up the
                    unreduced ones and prevent their being so readily acted on; so that, whilst on
                    descending into a hotter region the rate of reduction of the ore is at first
                    increased owing to increase of temperature, by and by the rate of removal of
                    oxygen as it sinks ceases to increase and ultimately diminishes. Long before
                    anything like complete reduction is brought about, however, other changes are
                    brought into play which greatly modify the actions. As soon as the iron ore is
                    partially reduced, it begins to react on the carbon oxide in the way indicated
                    by the equation</p>

                    ><p>According to Griiner <hi rend="italic">(Comptes Rendus,</hi> 1871, 28) this
                    reaction is 3FeO + CO = C + F eO^, and does not commence until the iron ore is
                    deoxidized to some considerable extent, at least on the outer surface of the
                    lumps of ore.</p></note> Again, as soon as metallic iron in a spongy form is
                    produced, it reacts on the carbon dioxide, thus—</p>
                <p>αFe + 2∕CO <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> =∙Fe <hi rend="subscript"> x</hi> O <hi
                    rend="subscript"> i</hi>, + 2∕CO (5); whilst very probably a parallel reaction
                    takes place with lower oxides of iron not completely reduced to the metallic
                    state, these actions being practically reciprocal to those in virtue of which
                    carbon oxide reduces to ferric oxide, first to a lower oxide and then to metal.
                    Yet again, when carbon and iron oxides are heated together, there takes place a
                    dhange virtually reciprocal to that in virtue of which carbon is deposited from
                    carbon oxide (equation 4),—carbon oxide and dioxide gases being formed, and the
                    iron oxide being more or less reduced in virtue of the reactions</p>

                    rend="subscript"> y</hi>-ι (7).</p>
                <p>The ultimate result then is that before the ore and fuel have descended far they
                    are subjected to a number of opposing forces: so far as the ore is concerned,
                    the carbon oxide in the gases surrounding it and the deposited carbon in contact
                    with it tend to remove oxygen by reactions 3, G, and 7, whilst the carbon
                    dioxide in the gases and the reaction causing deposition of carbon from carbon
                    oxide tend to reoxidize it by reactions 4 and 5: the fuel and carbon oxides in
                    the gases on the other hand are analogously affected; the reaction of the carbon
                    dioxide on the fuel, 2, tends to gasify the latter (the action being more rapid
                    with charcoal than with coke—Lowthian Bell, also Akermann), and that of the
                    carbon oxide on the partly reduced iron ore setting free carbon, 4, to reverse
                    this action. The actions of the iron and its oxide on carbon, and on carbon
                    oxide and dioxide, also are opposed, some tending to increase the carbon oxide,
                    5 and 6, and some to decrease it, 4, and others to affect similarly the carbon
                    dioxide, viz., 3 and 7 to increase it, and 5 to decrease it. In consequence, at
                    any given level of the furnace a sort of compromise is arrived at amongst all
                    these varied oxidizing and reducing influences, the net or resultant chemical
                    action being that, whilst a portion of the hard coke of the fuel is gasified,
                    and reciprocally a portion of finely divided amorphous carbon precipitated from
                    the gases, the iron is partially but not wholly reduced. On the whole, then, as
                    the ore sinks in the furnace, it becomes hotter and hotter and more and more
                    deoxidized, but owing to the oxidizing influences at work it does not part with
                    all its oxygen until it has descended some considerable distance to a point
                    where the temperature is about sufficient to fuse it; at this stage the last
                    portions of oxygen are removed, partly by the precipitated amorphous carbon,
                    partly by the alkaline cyanides accumulating in the furnace, and the almost
                    completely reduced metal melts, dissolving as much of the amorphous carbon in
                    contact with it as it can take up under the circumstances; simultaneously the
                    silicious and earthy matters present also fuse, forming cinder. The reducing
                    influences at work here also cause the deoxidation of some of the silica
                    present, whilst manganese, phosphorus, and sulphur compounds, &amp;c., are also
                    more or less reduced and taken up by the fusing iron. When the proportion of
                    fuel relatively to the burden is diminished, a larger amount of incompletely
                    deoxidized ore reaches the hearth, the result of which is that, as the silicious
                    and earthy matters fuse, they dissolve some of the iron oxide before it has time
                    to become reduced by the deposited carbon, giving a ferruginous cinder, whilst
                    this carbou is used up in completing the reduction more rapidly than would
                    otherwise be the case; the pig iron formed is less highly carbonized than
                    before, becoming white instead of grey, partly owing to the diminution in the
                    quantity of dissolved carbon, and partly because the temperature of the hearth
                    is lowered, and there is less time for graphite to separate in cooling.</p>
                <p>The formation of alkaline cyanides and their reaction on the imperfectly reduced
                    iron oxide is brought about as follows: in the upper part of the furnace a crust
                    of alkaline carbonates, &amp;c., carried up as fume by the escaping gases (§
                    18), is deposited on the surface of the materials, and so is brought down again
                    to the hearth, where the nitrogen of the blast and carbon act on it conjointly,
                    forming (for potassium carbonate) potassium cyanide, thus</p>
                <p>K <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> CO <hi rend="subscript"> 3</hi> + N <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 2</hi> + 4C = 2KCN + 3CO .</p>
                <p>The exact nature of the reaction of potassium cyanide on the imperfectly reduced
                    iron oxide with which it finds itself in contact is not known, but it is
                    probable that potassium oxide and iron cyanide are formed, the latter becoming
                    decomposed into iron, carbon, and free nitrogen, and the former being carried
                    away by the escaping gases and deposited as potassium carbonate in the upper
                    part of the furnace, so that where the cyanide is formed (mainly at or near the
                    tuyere level) there is an evolution of carbon oxide and a disappearance of
                    nitrogen, whilst a little higher up there is a reevolution of nitrogen; that is,
                    whilst at the tuyere level and thereabouts the carbon and oxygen in the gases
                    are raised, relatively to the nitrogen, considerably above the amount due simply
                    to the blast becoming transformed into carbon oxide and nitrogen, a little
                    higher up the amounts of carbon and oxygen appear to diminish relatively to the
                    nitrogen; not that they actually do diminish in quantity, but that the evolution
                    of nitrogen from the cyanide decomposition causes their amounts to be lessened
                    relatively to the total nitrogen. Thus the following numbers are calculated from
                    some of Lowthian Bell’s observations with an 80 foot furnace using coke and
                    calcined Cleveland ironstone, the gases being obtained by drilling holes through
                    the furnace wall at the different levels, and collecting the issuing gas; the
                    amount of carbon in the gases is manifestly greater at the tuyere than that due
                    to the blast; for some feet it apparently diminishes owing to the cyanide
                    reaction, and then remains almost constant till near the top, where it increases
                    from the expulsion of carbon dioxide from the flux. The oxygen again is
                    considerably in excess of that due to the blast at the tuyeres, but at a
                    somewhat higher level it apparently decreases, whilst higher up still it
                    increases again owing to the reduction of the ferric oxide and the evolution of
                    carbon dioxide from the limestone.</p>

                <p>Precisely similar results are calculable from the analyses of Tiinner, Ebelmen,
                    and others who have examined the composition of the gases at different levels of
                    the blast furnace; the variations in the amounts of carbon and oxygen relatively
                    to the nitrogen at the lower levels in all cases are of such a nature as to
                    indicate that the amount of decomposition of iron cyanide with evolution of
                    nitrogen is very considerable, <hi rend="italic">i.e,,</hi> that the reduction
                    of iron oxide by alkaline cyanides takes place to an extent constituting a very
                    considerable fraction indeed of the total amount of reduction.</p>
                <p>The amount of alkaline cyanides disseminated through the gases of a furnace at
                    different levels varies inversely with the height above the tuyere; thus, in the
                    course of Lowthian Bell’s experiments, the following analyses were made by the
                    present writer of the substances dissolved by water through which known large
                    volumes of the gases were aspirated, being drawn from the different levels into
                    a large gasometer,—the weights being given in grammes per cubic metre of gas (at
                    0° and 760 mm.), and the experiments being all made within a short time of one
                    another (all on the same day) :—</p>

                <p>In the furnace examined the quantity of gases at a few feet above the tuyere
                    level per unit weight of pig iron made would be about 6 parts by weight, so that
                    per 100 grammes of pig the gases would weigh about 600 grammes, occupying about
                    0 ’ 45 cubic metre. When the amount of cyanogen combined as cyanides
                    disseminated through the gases was 20 grammes (equivalent to 50 grammes of
                    potassium cyanide) per cubic metre (a quantity often exceeded), the potassium
                    cyanide per 100 grammes of pig would consequently be about 22 <hi rend="italic"
                    >5</hi> grammes, or about ¾ of the weight of the pig iron, and consequently
                    about ⅜×⅜=⅜ roughly of the oxygen in the form of ferric oxide in the ore
                    originally used; hence evidently the influence exerted by the combined cyanogen
                    upon the removal of the last portions of oxygen must have been very considerable
                    indeed, especially as the cyanides that escape in the gases from the hearth
                    probably represent considerably less than the total amount generated there, a
                    considerable proportion being used up in deoxidizing the iron oxide <hi
                    rend="italic">pari passu</hi> with its formation. That this is so has indeed
                    been urged long ago by Bunsen and Playfair, who found that the gases drawn from
                    a perforation 2 feet 9 inches above the tuyere of the Alfreton furnace contained
                    cyanogen compounds equivalent to from 8 to 10 grammes of potassium cyanide per
                    cubic metre of gas, much smaller amounts than those above mentioned, but greater
                    than those found on some Other occasions when the alkaline substances contained
                    in the fume consisted chiefly of carbonates.</p>
                <p>The chief source of the alkalies which form the cyanides is the coke used as
                    fuel, but the ore and flux also usually contain small quantities; when a fumace
                    is newly blown in, the amount of cyanides is necessarily very small; but a very
                    few weeks’ use suffices to cause an accumulation of a quantity sufficient to
                    exert a marked influence on the chemical actions taking place, whilst a somewhat
                    longer period brings the accumulation πp to the final working average attained
                    when the alkaline compounds mechanically carried off in the fume, and escaping
                    altogether from the furnace through not being intercepted and filtered out by
                    the substances in the upper part, together with those in the cinder, just equal
                    the alkalies brought in by the fuel and burden jointly. It is highly probable,
                    although not absolutely demonstrated, that when charcoal is used as fuel the
                    formation of alkaline cyanides is promoted, owing to the increased quantity of
                    potassium carbonate in the ash of the charcoal as compared with coke; and that
                    this is one of the reasons why the consumption of carbon in the form of charcoal
                    in the Styrian, American, and Swedish furnaces is often less per ton of iron
                    made than that of coke in even the best of the large English furnaces,—the
                    greater ease with which the ores are reduced as compared with English ones
                    being, at any rate in certain cases, another circumstance diminishing the
                    quantity of fuel requisite.</p>
                <p>A large number of direct observations as to the progressive changes undergone by
                    the minerals in descending through the furnace have been made, more especially
                    by Ebelmen, Tiinner, and</p>
                <p>Lowthian Bell, with the general result of showing that the changes as a whole are
                    substantially those above described; as the iron ore sinks, it becomes
                    deoxidized at a.rate which at first gradually increases, the temperature rising;
                    but by and by the reduction ceases to increase in rate, and would probably
                    almost stop were the inner portions of the lumps as much reduced as the outer
                    portions. Neither direct experiments on the ores in the furnace, nor laboratory
                    experiments, nor the results deducible from the examination of the composition
                    of the gases at different levels indicate that under the conditions of the blast
                    fumace interior complete deoxidation of the ore ensues until the level of the
                    hearth is reached and the iron begins to fuse,—the agents completing the
                    deoxidation being partly the carbonaceous matter of the solid fuel, but to a
                    much greater extent the finely divided carbon precipitated from the carbon oxide
                    in the upper part of the furnace, and the alkaline cyanides.</p>
                <p>20. <hi rend="italic">Development and Appropriation of Heat in the Blast
                    Furnace.—</hi> The sources of heat in the blast furnace are two in number, viz.,
                    the heat brought in by the hot blast, and that generated by the combustion of
                    the fuel. The former of course varies considerably with the nature of the
                    heating arrangement and with the actual weight of blast employed per unit weight
                    of iron smelted; thus, if the weight of air used be 5 ’ 5 times that of the pig
                    iron made (llOcwts. of blast per ton of pig), if its temperature be 500° C., and
                    the average specific heat of its components 0 ’ 23, the heat brought in per unit
                    weight of pig made will be 5 ’ 5 × 500 × 0 ’ 23 = 632 ’ 5 heat units, the weight
                    of the pig iron being the unit of weight; and similarly in other cases. The heat
                    generated by the combustion of the fuel, again, depends, first, on the amount of
                    fuel burnt and the proportion of inert matters (ash) in it and other
                    circumstances modifying its heat of combustion, and, secondly, on the relative
                    amounts of carbon oxide and dioxide formed.</p>
                <p>In transforming 1 part of amorphous carbon into carbon dioxide, the heat
                    evolution (the materials and products being all at the ordinary temperature) is

                    somewhat from those of Vathaire and Bell, but not to any very material extent.
                    The general result of these observations is that, with the large English
                    furnaces used in smelting Cleveland ironstone with coke and limestone, about
                    3850 is the amount of heat required on an average per unit of weight of pig iron
                    made for the various furnace requirements, and that in even the most
                    economically working furnaces the quantity of carbon contained in the issuing
                    gases in the form of carbon dioxide <hi rend="italic">does not exceed one-third

                    of the carbon that does escape as dioxide, about one-fourth, is originally
                    introduced as carbon dioxide contained in the flux (in the illustrative example,
                    given above, 0Ό82 was contained in the flux out of 0 ’ 326 escaping as dioxide),
                    so that only about three-fourths is derived from the fuel; whence it results
                    that even under the most favourable conditions, rarely met with in practice with
                    this class of ores, not more than ⅜ × or 25 per cent, of the carbon of the fuel
                    is ultimately burnt to dioxide, tho remaining 75 per cent, being burnt to carbon
                    oxide, thus giving an effective heat development of 0 ’ 25 × 8000 + 0'75 X 2400
                    = 3800 instead of 8000; <hi rend="italic">ue.,</hi> the “duty” actually
                    performed by the fuel is only f⅜⅜⅜, or 47 ’ 5 per cent, of the possible maximum
                    amount; so that if the amounts of heat brought in by the hot blast, and carried
                    out in the waste gases, are approximately equal (which is the case when ordinary
                    cast iron stoves are used, delivering blast at temperatures near 450°), it
                    finally results that, to produce the heat requisite for the various furnace
                    requirements (amounting on an average to 3850), an amount of carbon must be
                    burnt equal to ff⅛⅞ or 1Ό13 times the weight of the pig iron made. Taking
                    average coke to contain 7 per cent, of moisture and ash, and, consequently 93

                    be requisite to produce the heat necessary for the various furnace requirements;
                    or the surplus heat will be carried out in the waste gases, they being at a

                    proportion of carbon dioxide being formed and a larger one of carbon oxide. As
                    to what does actually take place in such a case, opinions are somewhat divided;
                    for, whilst most iron masters maintain that a sensible diminution in fuel
                    requisite per ton of iron is always occasioned by employing a hotter blast,
                    others (especially Bell) consider that their experience proves that in certain
                    cases, <hi rend="italic">e.g.,</hi> with Cleveland ore, no actual saving in fuel
                    accompanies the use of blast at temperatures above about 500° (see § 21).</p>
                <p>The results obtained by Bell with blast-furnaces using Cleveland ironstone and
                    coke are applicable, with appropriate modifications, to furnaces employing
                    different ores and fuel. For instance, Crossley found <hi rend="italic">{Journal

                    the fact that in order to make very grey Bessemer pig a larger quantity of coke
                    was employed than would suffice to make forge iron, viz., about 2 cwts. per ton
                    extra; so that forge iron could be run in the same furnace with an expenditure
                    of about 211 cwts., or 1Ό825 parts of coke per unit weight of pig. Other things
                    remaining the same, this would represent an amount of total carbon burnt equal
                    to about 0’97 per unit weight of pig, which must, therefore, be burnt in the

                    is contained as dioxide; presumably this is due either to the smaller height of

                    charcoal in American furnaces is always greater, indicating a smaller proportion
                    of carbon dioxide ultimately formed.</p>
                <p>As far as the data at present extant go, it does not appear that in any furnace
                    yet constructed burning coke, charcoal, anthracite, or coal, upwards of 40 per
                    cent, of the carbon in the issuing gases is, on an average, contained as
                    dioxide, the remainder being oxide, although somewhat larger amounts are
                    occasionally found as exceptional occurrences. Admitting that ⅜ of the carbon of
                    the fuel is burnt to dioxide and ·| to oxide, the heat evolution per unit of
                    carbon burnt would be ⅛ × 8000 + ⅜× 2400 = 4640 instead of 8000, which would be
                    developed were all burnt to dioxide; that is, the “duty” actually performed by
                    the fuel would be 58 per cent, of the possible maximum amount; so that even in
                    such a furnace the consumption of fuel would be at least l⅛χ⅛= 1'72 times the
                    <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit13newyrich/page/n329/mode/1up"

                    combustion be effected. If, however, the issuing gases be so burnt in heating
                    the blast that more heat is brought into the furnace than is carried out by the
                    waste gases, the excess is virtually obtained by more perfect combustion, though
                    not actually so burnt inside the furnace; whilst, if the gases are also employed
                    to raise steam for the blowing engines and lifts, &amp;c., the fuel thus saved
                    virtually is equivalent to a diminution in the blast furnace consumption; for,
                    were perfect combustion obtainable in the furnace, extra fuel would have to be
                    burnt outside for these purposes.</p>
                <p>These remarks apply <hi rend="italic">a fortiori</hi> to furnaces in which coal
                    is employed as fuel instead of coke or charcoal. The heat of combustion of
                    average coal (after allowing for ash and supposing it to be burnt to carbon
                    dioxide and water <hi rend="italic">vapour)</hi> may be taken as about 8300 (see
                    § 10); hence to afford sufficient heat for the requirements of a furnace
                    smelting average Cleveland ironstone, viz., 3850, only ⅜¾⅞⅛ = 0 <hi
                    rend="superscript"> ,</hi> 464 parts of coal would be requisite, could complete
                    combustion be ensured, or 9∣ cwts. per ton of pig (assuming the sensible heat
                    carried out by the waste gases and brought in by the blast to be equal). The
                    actual consumption in furnaces using raw coal is, however, several times this
                    amount,—30 cwts. being a low estimate in such cases, whilst 40 and even 50 cwts.
                    of coal per ton of pig made is not an infrequent consumption: thus even with
                    Feme’s self-coking furnace (§ 12), which reduced the consumption of coal from 52
                    <hi rend="italic">‘5</hi> to 33'5 cwts. per ton of pig, the consumption was
                    upwards of three times the theoretical amount; with anthracite-consuming
                    furnaces, such as those used in America, the consumption of fuel varies from 25
                    cwts. per ton of pig in the largest and best constructed furnaces to 40 cwts. or
                    so in the older and smaller furnaces, the consumption being as a rule, however,
                    somewhat less than that of more bituminous raw coal in the English open-topped
                    furnaces. The reason for the extra fuel consumption in raw eoal furnaces is
                    simply that the nature of the chemical reactions taking place in the upper part
                    of the furnace, especially the action of heat alone upon the coal, necessarily
                    causes the evolution of much free hydrogen, carburetted hydrogen, and carbon
                    oxide, which escape unburnt, thus preventing the consumption of the fuel to the
                    maximum advantage: where the gases are collected and burnt, this loss would not
                    be material were it not that ordinarily the heat obtainable from the gases is
                    far in excess of that requisite to raise steam for blowing and lifting the
                    burden to the furnace top, &amp;c. These reasons are also to a great extent
                    operative with anthracite as compared with coke. On the other hand, the smaller
                    weight of charcoal ordinarily requisite to smelt a given ore is partly due to
                    the more ready action of carbon dioxide on charcoal than on coke forming carbon
                    oxide, so that virtually the ore is partly reduced by the carbon of the charcoal
                    (this being converted into carbon oxide, which deoxidizes the ore) to a greater
                    extent with charcoal than with coke; <hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> the charcoal
                    is more completely oxidized, and the ore is more deoxidized at the top of the
                    furnace and less at the bottom than is the case <hi rend="italic"
                    >{caeteris</hi><hi rend="italic">paribus)</hi> with coke, so that a smaller
                    weight of charcoal ultimately performs the same work as a larger quantity of
                    coke. The larger amount of alkalies in charcoal, producing more cyanides,
                    probably also aids in the more rapid reduction relatively to the weight of fuel
                    used.</p>
                <p>In a prize essay, Professor Habets has given formulae for calculating the value
                    of a given weight of iron ore of given composition, the price of the pig iron
                    made from it, and the quantities of ore and limestone requisite to produce a
                    unit of weight of pig, &amp;c. (see abstract in <hi rend="italic">Journ. I. and
                    S. Inst.,</hi> 1877, 225), and has also arranged formulae for calculating the
                    amount of fuel that ought to be required for the smelting of such ores, &amp;c.,
                    assuming that the duty actually performed by the fuel is 48 per cent, of the
                    possible maximum amount. In these calculations slightly different values are
                    taken for certain of the heat requirements from those given above; thus for the
                    reduction of pig iron (containing carbon, silicon, &amp;c. ) the total heat
                    consumption is taken as 1984, the amounts assumed by Bell, Crossley, and Tiinner
                    as above described being respectively 1931, 1871, and 1670; that carried out by
                    the molten pig is taken at 260 for cold working, 270 for medium, and 285 for
                    hot, Bell’s figure (and Vathaire’s) being 330, whilst Tiinner takes 340 from
                    Rinman’s observations; and the loss by radiation (presumably including the
                    tuyere water) is taken as 400 (Bell = 349—deduced by the present writer from a
                    round general average result by difference; Crossley — 359; Tiinner=192, the
                    furnace being a much smaller one in this latter case), and so on throughout; but
                    on the whole Habets’s formulae are based on much the same valuations as those
                    above cited. The instances given above, however, indicate that the results
                    obtainable with one class of ores, fuels, &amp;c., are only applicable to
                    another class with considerable latitude of variation, and that it is
                    impracticable to fix a hard and fast line as the limit of economy of fuel
                    universally applicable. Where, however, the fuel is burnt differently (to less
                    advantage, for instance, so that, instead of one part of carbon giving 0 <hi
                    rend="superscript"> -</hi> 48 of the total heat production as “duty,” it only
                    gives say 0 <hi rend="superscript"> -</hi> 40), the formulae of Habets will
                    still be applicable, only requiring the application of a coefficient (~°=l <hi

                <p><hi rend="italic">' Temperature of Blast Pumαce at Various Levels.—</hi> Many
                    observations of the rate of increase of temperature from the mouth of the
                    furnace have been made by Tiinner, Ebelmen, and Lowthian Bell. When fresh
                    materials have been just introduced cool into the furnace, of course they
                    intercept heat from the escaping gases, acting precisely like the brickwork
                    stacks of a Siemens regenerative furnace; this effect, however, cannot be
                    carried so far as to prevent the escaping gases from passing out at an average
                    temperature which, if not elevated, is at least sensible,—the actual temperature
                    varying with the conditions obtaining. Since heat is generated by the reduction
                    of ferric oxide by carbon oxide, more heat being evolved by the oxidation of the
                    carbon than is absorbed in the reduction of the iron oxide, roughly in the ratio
                    of 3 to 2, it results that there is always a source of heat in the upper part of
                    the furnace; and, unless fresh materials can be supplied sufficiently rapidly to
                    keep the escaping gases always at a given low temperature by their direct
                    cooling effect, the temperature must rise by the reduction of the ore. A
                    condition of equilibrium as to temperature is consequently finally arrived at
                    when the sums of the generations of heat by chemical action at each and every
                    particular level, and of the absorptions of heat by direct communication to the
                    fresh charges added from time to time, balance one another; when this condition
                    of things is arrived at the temperatures of the escaping gas, and of the
                    substances generally at each level, become constant, or rather would do so were
                    the fresh materials added continuously instead of intermittently, and were the
                    action of the furnace absolutely uniform. The circumstances which regulate the
                    most advantageous way in which fuel can be burnt, <hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi>
                    the economy of fuel in the furnace, consequently regulate the temperature of the
                    escaping gases, which accordingly is variable with the quantity of fuel burnt
                    per unit of iron smelted, with the size and shape of the furnace, the character
                    of the ore employed, &amp;c. Under particular conditions, especially when a
                    large mass of fresh materials has been added, the escaping gases may be so cool
                    that the aqueous vapour present is condensed into mist, whilst the hand may be
                    placed in the gases without being burnt; ordinarily, however, the temperature at
                    the mouth averages 200° or 300° C., and with small furnaces and difficultly
                    reducible ore requiring a large fuel consumption may be much higher. One great
                    effect of increasing the height of furnaces smelting clay ironstone <hi
                    rend="italic">{e.g.,</hi> Cleveland ore) is the reduction of the amount of fuel
                    requisite owing to the cooling influence exerted upon the temperature of the
                    escaping gases which pass off, thereby leaving in the furnace heat which
                    otherwise would have to be provided by burning more fuel. Of the numerous

                    of this class, and the conclusions to be drawn from them, by H. Μ. Howe, is
                    given in the <hi rend="italic">Trans. Amer. Inst. Mining Engineers,</hi> 1876;

                <p>21. <hi rend="italic">Conditions Regulating Economy of Fuel and Cost of
                    Production.—</hi> It is evident from the data given in the preceding section
                    that, when the amount of cinder formed is less, a smaller quantity of fuel will
                    do the work of iron smelting, the amount of heat absorption for the variable
                    requirements being lessened the less limestone is causticized and the less hot
                    cinder flows out of the furnace. Evidently also, the hotter the blast and the
                    cooler the issuing ga^es, the less fuel must be burnt to generate the particular
                    amount of heat requisite for a given furnace working under given conditions as
                    to quality of ore, &amp;c.; whilst the more carbon is burnt to carbon dioxide
                    and the less to carbon oxide the less total carbon is requisite for the same
                    end. As regards the possibility of diminishing fuel consumption by the use of
                    richer ores and less flux, this is largely a matter of local circumstances; when
                    there is a choice possible between two deposits of ore, one richer than the
                    other, and each equally good in other respects, the cost of smelting the richer
                    ore will evidently be somewhat less than that of working the other; as regards
                    the other circumstances, it is by no means a matter of indifference in reference
                    to cost of production whether the more economical conditions be attended to or
                    not; thus, in the case of the 48 and 80 foot furnaces referred to in the last
                    section, the difference between 22 ’ 3 and 28 ’ 8 cwts. of coke consumed per ton
                    of iron involves a very considerable difference in cost of production. It is
                    calculated that the increased size of furnaces used in England at the present
                    day, as compared with those in use some thirty or forty years ago, represents an
                    average saving of fuel equivalent to about 50 per cent, of the weight of the pig
                    iron made in coal, <hi rend="italic">ie.,</hi> a saving of 10 cwts. of coal per
                    ton of iron. The saving effected by the use of waste gases for heating the
                    blast, although less than this, still represents an enormous aggregate: in the
                    Cleveland district alone the saving in coal from this cause is calculated to
                    amount to upwards of 1,000,000 tons annually.</p>
                <p>To some little extent the amount of fuel consumed is variable with the rate at
                    which the furnace is driven; that is, if a given quality of pig is produced when
                    the furnace is making 300 tons per week with a given coke consumption (the fuel
                    being burnt under the most favourable conditions practicable), and the furnace
                    be then driven at a higher speed so as to make 400 tons, either a little more
                    coke must be added relatively to the burden, or else there will be a tendency to
                    make a less strongly marked crystalline pig; instead of producing the coarsest
                    crystallized iron (No. 1 grey pig), this quality will sink to the less largely
                    crystalline numbers (Nos. 2, 3, or 4), or even to mottled or white iron. If,
                    however, the fuel is not burnt to the maximum possible advantage in the first
                    instance, increasing the rate of production may under certain circumstances not
                    only not cause an increase in the fuel consumption, but may even slightly
                    diminish it, by lessening the amount of heat lost by radiation, &amp;c.,
                    relatively to the metal produced. Everything remaining the same, decreasing the
                    fuel relatively to the burden decreases the quality of the iron run, and <hi
                    rend="italic">vice versa;</hi> with Cleveland ironstone an extra consumption of
                    half a cwt. or less of coke per ton of pig suffices to raise the quality of iron
                    run one number in the scale, <hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> from No. 4 to 3, from
                    3 to 2, or from 2 to 1. According to Crossley <hi rend="italic">(loe. cit.)</hi>
                    about 2 cwts. of coke per ton of pig corresponds to the difference between
                    running white iron and grey Bessemer pig, the ore smelted being Askam haematite
                    and Fisher Red Bay ore. Tiinner states <hi rend="italic">(loc. citi)</hi> that
                    at Neuberg, with a blast at 200°, from 15 ’ 4 to 15 ’ 6, cwts. of charcoal were
                    used per ton of white iron, but 23 to 24 cwts. per ton of grey iron, making a
                    difference of some 8 cwts. per ton, or four times the amount given by Crossley;
                    at Heft, with a blast at 200°, 12 <hi rend="superscript"> -</hi> 6 to 14 cwts.
                    of charcoal were formerly required per ton of white iron, and 20 cwts. and
                    upwards per ton of grey iron, making a difference of more than 6 cwts. per ton,
                    or upwards of three times Crossley’s figure. Although a variation in the amount
                    of fuel burnt under constant conditions denotes a correlative variation in the
                    temperature of the hearth (No. 1 iron being actually hotter as it flows from a
                    furnace in regular work than No. 4, for instance), yet the influence thereby
                    produced on the chemical composition is, according to Lowthian Bell’s
                    experiments, not marked, at any rate so far as Cleveland pig is concerned, the
                    differences between various specimens of different numbers not being greater
                    than those between various specimens of the same numbers,—the difference in the
                    crystallinity of the pig being in fact more probably ascribable to the
                    circumstance that the hotter the iron the longer is the time taken to solidify,
                    and the more completely is the exfoliation of the graphite and the
                    crystallization upon it of the remaining iron, &amp;c., effected, than to
                    differences of actual constitution. On the other hand, it is a matter of usual
                    opinion, if not of invariable experience, that highly crystalline grey Bessemer
                    pigs are richer in silicon than others, and that this is due to the higher
                    temperature of the hearth facilitating reduction of silicon; again, it is
                    usually considered that white irons are apt to contain more sulphur than grey
                    irons made from the same ore; this circumstance, however, is possibly rather due
                    to differences in the average composition of ore smelted and amount of flux
                    added than simply to variations in amount of fuel consumed; thus diminishing the
                    amount of lime added as a flux below a certain point often increases the sulphur
                    in the pig, so that upwards of 1 per cent, may be present, when with more lime
                    the quantity would be only one or two tenths per cent., the iron being white in
                    the first case and grey when more lime is employed.</p>
                <p>As regards the temperature of the blast, the fact that heating the blast enabled
                    iron to be made with much less fuel consumption than was requisite with cold
                    blast was recognized immediately after Neilson’s discovery or invention; but it
                    soon became also manifest that a deteriorating effect was often produced upon
                    the iron smelted from certain kinds of ore by the use of the hot blast, due to
                    the higher temperature attained in the hearth facilitating the reduction of
                    phosphorus, sulphur, and especially of silicon. The advocates of the very highly
                    heated blast obtainable by means of the Whitwell stove consider that, as the
                    heat is obtained from the waste gases at a comparatively nominal cost, the more
                    heat can be thus introduced into the furnace the better, the saving in fuel
                    being directly proportionate to the increase in blast temperature; it would seem
                    from Bell’s observations, however, that the advantages thus obtainable are not
                    always quite so great as appears at first sight to be the case. If less fuel be
                    burnt in the furnace, a less absolute weight of blast per given amount of pig
                    run will be requisite, and consequently a higher proportionate temperature must
                    be given to the blast to enable it to introduce the heat equivalent to the fuel
                    thus saved; for each successive diminution of fuel to the extent say of 1 per
                    cent, an increase in temperature of blast will be requisite, the rate of
                    increase not being constant, but accelerating at a rapid rate; so that finally
                    an increase in blast temperature of 100° from 1100° to 1200° only represents
                    about half the amount of heat introduced into the furnace that would be
                    introduced by raising the blast from 300° to 400% The advantage of highly
                    heating the blast then is not directly proportionate to the temperature attained
                    as regards saving of fuel, but something less; according to Bell, practical
                    experience shows that with certain ores, <hi rend="italic">e.g.,</hi> Cleveland
                    ironstone, the effect of highly superheating the blast to temperatures much
                    above 500° is not to render any considerable saving of coke practicable, but
                    mainly only to raise the temperature of the issuing waste gases. Other iron
                    masters, however, dissent from this view, and consider that by the use of a
                    blast heated to 700° and upwards by a Whitwell stove, instead of. to 450° or
                    500° by the older iron stoves, a distinct saving in the amount of coke requisite
                    to produce a ton of pig iron from Cleveland ironstone is <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit13newyrich/page/n331/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0913-0331-0316"/> effected; so that, instead of requiring an amount
                    of coke to be consumed equal in weight to about 1 ’ 09 times that of the pig
                    iron made (nearly 21f cwts. per ton), which as stated in the previous section is
                    the minimum practical average consumption possible <hi rend="italic">when the
                    amount of heat brought in by the blast about equals that carried out by the
                    waste gases,</hi> a smaller amount of fuel will suffice, from 0 ’ 95 to 0 ’ 90
                    parts of coke (19 and 18 cwts. per ton) only being necessary with blast heated
                    to 700° and upwards by a Whitwell stove, the heat carried out by the waste gases
                    being less than that brought in by the blast by an amount equal to that which
                    would otherwise have been generated by the fuel saved. With ores other than
                    Cleveland ironstone the same kind of result is obtained; not only in England and
                    Wales, but also in France, Germany, Switzerland, America, and elsewhere, the
                    Siemens-Cowper and Whitwell stoves have been extensively adopted on account
                    first of the saving of fuel effected by them, and secondly of the greater
                    regularity and efficiency in working.</p>
                <p>On the other hand there is no doubt that increasing the height of a furnace
                    smelting calcined Cleveland ironstone from 48 to 80 feet causes a considerable
                    saving in fuel; as shown in the previous section, the increased height acts
                    partly by permitting the gases to escape at a lower temperature, and partly by
                    enabling the fuel to be burnt with the formation of a smaller relative
                    proportion of carbon oxide and a larger one of carbon dioxide than is the case
                    with the smaller furnace. When, however, a still greater height is given to the
                    furnace, a further saving in fuel and larger relative production of carbon
                    dioxide do not seem to occur, furnaces of 90 and 100 feet in height not
                    exhibiting any marked advantages over 80-foot furnaces working under the same
                    conditions, so far as consumption of fuel is concerned. Even if Bell’s views as
                    regards the non-apparent advantage of increasing the blast temperature above
                    500° C. with the furnaces smelting Cleveland ore experimented on by him be
                    admitted to apply in all cases where this ore is used, it does not follow that
                    they are applicable to other furnaces smelting different kinds of ore, nor does
                    it follow that 80 feet in height is the limit beyond which no visible saving is
                    effected in all cases; thus for instance with a furnace smelting (at Consett) a
                    mixture of Cleveland ore and haematite in such proportions that about half the
                    iron made came from each ore, a distinct saving of coke was found to accompany
                    the substitution ot Whitwell stoves giving blast at about 720° for iron stoves
                    giving blast at about 450°; whereas with the less heated blast the coke
                    consumption was 2275 cwts. per ton of iron, with the hotter blast it was only 18
                    cwts., the conditions, character of ore and flux used and pig produced, &amp;c.,
                    being pretty nearly the same, the furnace being 55 feet in height in each case.
                    Again, on rebuilding such a furnace (for the purpose of using the same mixture
                    of ores) to a height of about 70 feet, it was found that the increased
                    dimensions, so far from producing the beneficial effects which such a change
                    would have given had Cleveland ore only been used, introduced such
                    irregularities in working that the height had to be reduced to the former
                    amount, 55 feet or so. Similar results have also been found with furnaces using
                    Lancashire haematite only; thus a Barrow furnace built to* the height of 75
                    feet, and using Cowper stoves, worked so badly that it was reduced to 61 feet,
                    when it worked well. Analogous results were also obtained at Workington, a
                    70-foot furnace working much better when cut down to 55 feet; in America also it
                    has been found that charcoal furnaces, increased materially above the original
                    height, worked irregularly until the height was reduced again, when the working
                    again became good. With easily reducible Belgian ores furnaces of 50 to 60 feet
                    in height are found to giγe the best results both as to quantity of iron run and
                    as to economy of fuel. On the other hand, an increase in height from 45 to 60
                    feet in furnaces smelting Staffordshire ores was found to cause an average
                    saving of upwards of 10 cwts. of coal per ton of iron (Plum, <hi rend="italic"
                    >Journal I. and S. Brisk,</hi> 1871, ii. 227), whilst two furnaces at Stanhope
                    (New Jersey) using magnetic ore, one 80 feet high and of 16,400 cubic feet
                    capacity, the other 55 feet high and of 9200 cubic feet capacity, differed by
                    several cwts. in the amount of coal requisite to produce a ton of pig, the
                    difference being in favour of tne larger furnace; similarly at Glendon, U.S.,
                    two furnaces, 72 and 50 feet in height and 11,900 and 4800 cubic feet capacity
                    respectively, differed by 3 to 4 cwts. of coal per ton of pig, the taller
                    furnace requiring the least fuel (F. Firmstone, <hi rend="italic">Trans. Am.
                    Journ. Mining Engineers).</hi></p>
                <p>With charcoal furnaces smelting grey iron, increasing the blast temperature from
                    about 200° to 400° or 500° C. causes a marked saving of fuel; but the utility of
                    heating the blast above 300° or even a somewhat lower limit for such furnaces
                    when making white iron is regarded by Tiinner as extremely doubtful: thus he
                    states <hi rend="italic">(Journal I. and S. Inst.,</hi> 1873, 442) that charcoal
                    furnaces at Neuberg which used 23 to 24 cwts. of charcoal per ton of grey
                    Bessemer pig (and only about 15⅛ for white iron) when the blast was at 200°,
                    only required 19 to 20 cwts. per ton of grey pig when the blast was heated to
                    500°, representing a saving of some 4 cwts. per ton of charcoal; similarly at
                    Heft the charcoal consumption was 20 cwts. and upwards per ton of first class
                    grey Bessemer pig with blast at 200 <hi rend="superscript"> a</hi> ∙, and only
                    17 to 18 cwts. with blast at 350° to 400“ C., representing a saving of at least
                    2⅛ cwts. of charcoal per ton of pig. Analogous results have also been recorded
                    as obtained with Carinthian furnaces, a saving of 25 to 30 per cent, in the
                    charcoal used accompanying the heating of the blast to 500° or 600° instead of
                    the much lower temperature formerly employed; similarly with Swedish charcoal
                    furnaces smelting bog ores, the use of hot blast at 350° instead of cold blast
                    producing a saving in fuel estimated as averaging one-third, or 33 per cent, of
                    the larger* amount, and the employment of blast at 200° effecting a saving of

                    smaller consumption of fuel in the Wrbna charcoal furnaces and others using
                    certain Austrian ores as compared with English coke furnaces appears, from the
                    results of Tiinner, quoted in the last section, to be mainly due to the smaller
                    amount of slag produced, and the consequently diminished furnace requirements, a
                    portion of the diminution being due to the somewhat larger formation of carbon
                    dioxide relatively to the carbon oxide in the escaping gases; with other ores
                    producing more cinder, the quantity of charcoal used per ton of iron run does
                    not seem to be materially less than the amount of coke employed with English
                    furnaces, so far as comparisons can be instituted.</p>

                    that the blast furnace is an instrument in which it is impossible completely to
                    utilize the calorific power of the fuel burnt. Owing to the nature of the com·,
                    plex reactions regulating the resultant chemical changes taking place in the
                    furnace, a considerable proportion of the fuel inevitably must escape as carbon
                    oxide, and it is not practicable to restore to the furnace the whole of the heat
                    thus not utilized by employing the waste gases to heat up the blast, although a
                    portion of this heat may thus be saved. Thus, in the case of average Cleveland
                    ironstone, the 3850 units of heat per unit of weight of pig requisite for the
                    various items of furnace consumption would be obtained by the combustion of less
                    than 0 <hi rend="superscript"> -</hi> 5 part by weight of carbon (representing
                    10 cwts. of carbon or less per· ton of pig, <hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> about
                    10 ’ 5 cwts. of average coke per ton of pig), could all the carbon be burnt to
                    carbon dioxide; whilst for ores containing less earthy matter, and hence
                    requiring less flux and producing less cinder, considerably smaller amounts
                    would be required, in some cases not mor? than 7 or 8 cwts. per ton. In
                    practice, even with the most economical arrangements at present known, the
                    consumption of fuel is largely in excess of the minimum quantity thus
                    theoretically requisite, the coke used varying from 18 or 19 cwts. in the most
                    favourable cases to 25 and even 30 cwts. per ton of pig under less economical
                    conditions.</p>
                <p>A portion'of the excess of fuel thus burnt may be utilized in generating steam by
                    burning the waste gases under the boilers. Bell calculates that somewhat upwards
                    of 1400 heat units per unit weight of pig iron were thus utilized in the works
                    serving as the chief basis of his inquiries, <pb break="no"

                    water being raised to 100° in a hot well (by the waste steam) and simply
                    converted into steam at 45 lb pressure (non-condensing engines used). Adding
                    this to 3850, a total of 5250 is obtained as heat actually accounted for in
                    smelting average Cleveland ore when the steam power is obtained solely from
                    waste gases as fuel, representing consequently about ⅛⅜⅞⅜ = θ'656 parts of
                    carbon, say 0 ’ 7 parts of coke, or 14 cwts. per ton. Hence even when the
                    consumption of coke is 18 cwts. per ton of pig (below which even with the most
                    highly heated blast continuous production never seems to have been effected,
                    whilst usually a considerably greater amount is used), a large waste of heat
                    through imperfect combustion below the boilers, and radiation, &amp;c.,
                    therefrom, is occasioned. <hi rend="italic">A fortiori</hi> the same argument

                <p>When compared with other modes of burning fuel in metallurgical operations,
                    &amp;c., however, the blast furnace does not seem to be so wasteful as many of
                    these appliances; thus Grüner calculates the following values as approximately
                    the percentages utilized of the total heat capacity of the fuel employed in
                    various kinds of furnaces :—</p>

                <p>The <hi rend="italic">rate of production</hi> iu a blast furnace is, up to a
                    certain extent, variable with its dimensions; but no well marked correlative
                    increase appears to have been effected in the make of furnaces of considerably
                    upwards of 15,000 or 20,000 cubic feet capacity above that of furnaces of these
                    dimensions. The quality of the ore smelted also largely affects the rate, the
                    furnace being of such dimensions as to give the maximum saving of fuel
                    practicable, and the least crushing of the ore by its own weight, together with
                    the minimum tendency to scaffolding, slips, and other practical inconveniences;
                    thus, whilst from furnaces smelting Cumberland and North Lancashire haematite an
                    output of 600 and even 800 tons per week has been accomplished, from 400 to 500
                    tons per week is the usual result with large furnaces smelting clay ironstone,
                    such as that of the Cleveland district. Somewhat smaller yields than these are
                    obtainable from furnaces of less capacity.</p>
                <p>Charcoal furnaces usually make more pig for a given amount of cubic capacity than
                    when coke, anthracite, or raw coal is employed as fuel: thus, whilst some
                    Styrian charcoal furnaces have been made to produce for every 1000 cubic feet
                    capacity from 110 to 130 tons weekly (the capacity being only 500 to 1200 cubic
                    feet), and whilst the Swedish and Norwegian and some American charcoal furnaces
                    of 1000 to 3000 cubic feet capacity produce per 1000 cubic feet 50 to 70 tons
                    weekly, the large English coke blast furnaces of 15,000 to 20,000 cubic feet and
                    upwards usually produce only 15 to 30 tons weekly per 1000 cubic feet. Those of
                    the coke, anthracite, and coal burning furnaces of Europe and America of
                    somewhat less capacity than these largest sizes usually produce somewhat more
                    than 20 to 30 tons weekly per 1000 cubic feet; but in many cases this is done at
                    the expenditure of a greater amount of fuel than that employed in the larger
                    furnaces (z.e., after making allowance for the difference in the amount of flux
                    added, and cinder produced, &amp;c. ). This is not the case with the European
                    charcoal furnaces, for in some of these the consumption of fuel is not greater,
                    and in other cases is notably less, per ton of iron made than in the largest
                    English coke-employing furnaces, even after making these allowances. In many
                    American charcoal furnaces, however, notwithstanding that a purer ore is smelted
                    than that used in some of the European charcod furnaces, the consumption of
                    charcoal appears to be notably higher, approaching 18 and 19 and even 20 cwts.
                    of charcoal per ton of iron instead of 15 to 17 cwts.; still, as compared with
                    coke, these charcoal furnaces ordinarily consume a smaller amount of fuel.
                    According to Àkermann the charcoal used in America is usually very much more
                    dense than that employed in the Swedish charcoal furnaces, so that a bushel
                    sometimes represents some 30 per cent, more of weight of fuel. With charcoal as
                    fuel it does not appear that an increased rate of driving the furnace (by
                    putting on more blast) necessarily causes an increase in the fuel consumption;
                    indeed, the opposite result has been observed in certain cases, at least to a
                    certain extent, the cause being the relatively smaller loss ot heat by
                    radiation, &amp;c., from the furnace. For any given furnace and ore, &amp;c.,
                    there is a particular rate of driving which gives the minimum fuel consumption:
                    a more rapid rate requires more fuel because the gases have not time to effect
                    their full action on the ores, and less carbon dioxide is formed; a slower rate
                    causes more loss by radiation, &amp;c., relatively to the output. Up to a
                    certain extent it is often advantageous to use a little extra fuel, and increase
                    the rate of production beyond the rate that would correspond to the minimum fuel
                    consumption; which is probably the reason why in many instances the fuel
                    employed per ton of Iron is somewhat larger than that found to be requisite in
                    other analogous cases, where the rate of production is somewhat lower; the exact
                    point at which the advantages of increased rate of production are
                    counterbalanced by extra cost for fuel, and extra wear and tear, &amp;c.,
                    necessarily varies in each particular case.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Cold Blast as compared with Hot.—</hi> In reference to the
                    employment of cold blast for the production of iron, the saving in fuel
                    occasioned by the use of heated air has been practically proved to be so great
                    that excepting for certain special brands of iron the use of hot blast has
                    almost entirely superseded that of cold; the evidence in support of the alleged
                    deterioration in quality thereby caused is, however, not so conclusive as that
                    in behalf of the economy produced. With a cold blast the mass of fuel in front
                    of the tuyeres is visibly much less, brightly incandescent than that in a hot
                    blast furnace, being comparatively black, indicating considerable local
                    refrigeration, and hence probably differences in the amount of silicon, sulphur,
                    phosphorus, &amp;c., reduced in the hearth; but analyses of hot and cold blast
                    pig irons made from the same ore do not always show such marked differences as
                    might be anticipated; opinions are in fact somewhat divided even at the present
                    day on this point, but such of these opinions as admit of being checked by
                    figures usually incline to the non-existence of any material difference between
                    the English pig irons produced from a given ore, flux, and fuel .by cold and hot
                    blast respectively. On the other hand, it was for many years after Neilson’s
                    patent was taken out a matter of belief, especially in Wales, that the increased
                    impurity of the pig made with hot blast necessitated so much more labour and
                    expenditure of fuel in puddling, to give a wrought iron equally good with that
                    made by cold blast, as to render the actual saving doubtful; whilst with certain
                    Swedish charcoal irons of the highest brands, <hi rend="italic">e. g.,</hi>
                    Dannemora iron from magnetite, cold blast is still adopted on the ground that
                    experience has shown a marked deterioration in the character of the iron
                    produced when the blast was heated. With other similar Swedish and Norwegian
                    brands, on the other hand, a heated blast is in use, it being considered that no
                    perceptible deterioration in quality is thereby occasioned; this remark equally
                    applies to the Styrian and Carinthian furnaces employing Eisenerz and Lolling
                    spathic ores, and to those at Fullonica where the Elba specular ore is smelted;
                    Tiinner states that the use of hot blast for Eisenerz charcoal iron production
                    in no way necessarily produces any deterioration in quality; and Bell is of the
                    same opinion so far as English irons made with hot blast up to 500° C. are
                    concer ned. In many cases the superiority of cold blast over hot blast iron
                    alleged to exist, as shown by chemical analyses, and more especially by
                    mechanical tests, is really due to the fact that the ores used for the two are
                    not identical, the cold blast metal being made from a purer quality. In fact,
                    the notion that cold blast iron is vastly superior to hot seems to have been
                    originally to a considerable extent the result of a trade manoeuvre; thus the
                    ironstone of the Scotch coal-fields near Glasgow being of a refractory nature
                    required the consumption of a much larger amount of fuel with cold blast than
                    did the more easily reducible South Wales ores; but with hot blast a much
                    greater saving in fuel was produced with the Scotch than with the Welsh ore; as
                    early as 1834 Dufrenoy (director-general of mines, France) specially
                    investigated the relative advantages of hot and cold blast with these two ores,
                    and found that, whilst with the Scotch ore the saving produced at the Clyde
                    works by heating the blast to about 320° by an expenditure of 8 cwts. of coal
                    per ton of iron was (after allowing for this 8 cwts., and taking into account
                    the coal used for the blowing engines) equivalent on the whole to a diminution
                    of coal consumed from 153 to 59 cwts. of coal per ton of iron,<note

                    Royal Society of Edinburgh in 1835 a paper “On the Application of the Hot Blast
                    in the Manufacture of Iron,” in which he stated that at the Clyde works, prior
                    to the end of 1829. the average consumption of coke (45 parts of which were <pb
                    corresp="kp-eb0913-0333-0318" xml:id="pbn9142"/> obtained from 100 of raw coal)
                    was equivalent to 8 tons 1⅛ cwt. per ton of pig (8'06 per unit of pig iron) when
                    cold blast was used; in 1830, when hot blast was used with the same coke as
                    fuel, the consumption was reduced to an amount equivalent to 5 tons 3∣ cwts. (5
                    ’ 16 per unit of pig); and in 1833, when a hotter blast and actual raw coal were
                    employed, the consumption was only 2 tons 5⅛ cwts. per ton of pig (2 ‘26 per
                    unit of pig), this being exclusive of 8 cwts. of coal used in heating up the
                    blast, making a total of 2 tons 13⅛ cwts. (2.66 per unit of pig),—figures
                    substantially the same as those of Dufrenoy, representing a reduction in fuel
                    consumption nearly in the ratio of one to threê-parts of Scotch coal used (as
                    coke) with cold blast and Scotch ore. Much the same figures have also been given
                    by Mushet: thus he states that in 1797 with cold blast the consumption of coal
                    at the Clyde works was 7 tons 3 cwts. per ton of pig (7'15 per unit), whereas in
                    1839 with hot blast it was only 2 tons 3⅜ cwts. (2.175 per unit). On the other
                    hand during the course of a lawsuit entered upon by Neilson to enforce his
                    patent rights, attempts were made to show that the alleged saving in fuel due to
                    the hot blast was really owing to other causes; and subsequently similar views
                    have been urged, perhaps with not wholly disinterested motives; thus Truran
                    states in his work that at Dowlais the coal consumption per ton of iron was
                    reduced to the following extent between 1791 and 1831 by improvements other than
                    the use of hot blast, cold blast being used throughout, with the following

                    95 per unit of pig iron made, the saving with the Welsh ore similarly
                    represented a reduction in consumption at the Plymouth Works, Merthyr Tydvil, of
                    from 53 to 36 cwts., or from 2 ’ 65 to 1 <hi rend="superscript"> -</hi> 80 per

                    with the Welsh one when cold blast was used, he would have a decided advantage
                    over the latter when hot blast was employed. Accordingly it became a matter of
                    advantage to the Welsh smelter to decry hot blast metal, because its manufacture
                    gave him less profit relatively to smelters in other districts than that of cold
                    blast metal.</p>
                <p>Even at this early period, consequently, it was manifest that the advantages
                    derived from a given modification of plant and processes attainable with one
                    class of ore were not necessarily producible with another class; Dufrenoy found
                    that the furnaces of La Guerche, smelting an impure ore containing 42 per cent,
                    of iron, derived little or no benefit by the substitution of hot air for cold;
                    the fuel used in each case amounted to some 25 cwts. per ton, and the only
                    discernible advantage derived from the hot blast was that the resulting iron
                    became grey instead of white, doubtless from the higher temperature of the
                    issuing pig enabling the graphite to separate more readily whilst cooling and
                    solidifying. Iron masters, however, have often failed to appreciate the truth of
                    the proposition that what is advantageous for one ore may not necessarily be so
                    for another; and in consequence very different estimates of the value of new
                    processes and improvements have frequently been made, some condemning them
                    wholly, because under the circumstances of their own particular experience no
                    remarkable advantages accrued; others regarding them as universally beneficial,
                    because under the different conditions of their experience a distinct advantage
                    was gained. The early history of the Bessemer process for producing malleable
                    iron and semi-steel direct from pig by decarbonizing it by blowing air through
                    it affords a good illustration of this point, the process being at first
                    considered by some a complete success, and universally applicable, good metal
                    having been made by them from certain kinds of pig iron (naturally almost free
                    from sulphur and phosphorus); whilst others regarded it as a failure because the
                    less pure pig experimented on by them yielded only an inferior product.</p>

                    for upwards of a century and a half that when articles of cast iron of not too
                    great thickness are imbedded in powdered iron oxide (a pure red haematite as
                    free as possible from earthy matters, smithy scales, or some analogous
                    substance) and then kept at a red heat for some days (three or more according to
                    the thickness), a diminution is produced in the amount of carbon contained, so
                    that the cast iron becomes more or less converted into soft iron. When the
                    action is pushed to the extreme all or almost all of the carbon is removed, that
                    in the outer layers disappearing first, but no material diminution in the amount
                    of phosphorus, silicon, sulphur, or manganese is produced;<note anchored="true"

                    </table></note> if the heating is not continued long enough to remove all the
                    carbon, that which remains is found in the innermost layers which constitute a
                    core of more or less decarbonized cast iron, with an outer skin of malleable
                    iron. Owing to the non-removal of constituents other than carbon, it is
                    essential to the production of a good malleable metal that a tolerably pure cast
                    iron should be employed in the first instance: unless the articles are thin, so
                    that there is no considerable inner core of cast iron, they will not bear
                    forging so as to weld them, the concussion fracturing the brittle core; on the
                    other hand, the removal of the carbon from the outer skin renders this so much
                    less readily fusible than cast iron that articles so treated <hi rend="italic"
                    >(e.g.,</hi> melting pots and crucibles) will bear a very much higher
                    temperature than cast iron vessels, especially if the core is almost wholly
                    decarbonized; whilst a much greater degree of toughness and power of resisting
                    fracturing influences is communicated. Accordingly this method of preparing
                    cheap small malleable iron articles by casting and subsequently decarbonizing is
                    largely employed, the goods produced being known as “run steel”; whilst even
                    with much larger castings, such as the propellers of screw steamers, the method
                    is often adopted, especially in combination with “case hardening” or conversion
                    of the outermost layer of all into steel by a subsequent process <hi
                    rend="italic">(vide infra).</hi> Although the process was described in 1722 by
                    Réaumur, patents for it have been subsequently taken out, <hi rend="italic"
                    >e.g.,</hi> by Lucas in 1804, and Brown and Lennox some half century later.</p>
                <p>In order to carry out the conversion of cast iron into malleable iron in this
                    way, the articles to be treated are packed in cast or wrought iron chests in
                    iron oxide powder; the chests are then stacked one above another in a kind of
                    reverberatory furnace, and gradually heated up to a red heat, which is
                    maintained for the requisite time, after which they are annealed by slow
                    cooling; with charcoal pig pretty free from silicon, sulphur, and phosphorus,
                    and with fuel in the furnace free from any large quantity of sulphur, a soft but
                    tough, tenacious, and readily malleable skin is produced; if, however<pb
                    break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit13newyrich/page/n334/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0913-0334-0319"/>, the heating is continued, for some time after
                    the whole of the carbon originally present has been removed, the articles become
                    brittle, owing to the formation of oxide of iron disseminated through the mass,
                    just as copper, bronze, and analogous substances are rendered brittle through a
                    similar cause. This circumstance, together with the known character of the
                    chemical actions of carbon dioxide on iron and carbon at a red heat, indicates
                    the nature of the processes taking place during the decarbonization: the ferric
                    oxide and the heated air in contact with it first oxidize the carbon in the
                    outermost film to carbon dioxide; this then passes inwards by the process of
                    “occlusion” (gradual solution of gases in solids), and reacts upon the carbon of
                    the next layers in accordance with the equation</p>
                <p>CO <hi rend="subscript"> a</hi> + C = 2CO, the carbon oxide thus formed first
                    becoming dissolved in the iron, and subsequently when the iron is saturated
                    therewith gradually diffusing outwards, becoming converted into carbon dioxide
                    as soon as it comes in contact with either the ferric oxide of the packing or
                    the partially oxidized iron of the outer film, which, when free from carbon,
                    reacts on the carbon dioxide, thus</p>
                <p>2∕C0 <hi rend="subscript"> a</hi> + icFe = Fe <hi rend="subscript"> x</hi> O <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 2</hi>, + j∕CO.</p>
                <p>In the outermost layers, accordingly, there is always a tendency to the formation
                    of iron oxide in virtue of this reaction, and simultaneously a tendency to the
                    reduction of this oxide by the agency of the carbon oxide which is being formed
                    in the interior layers anti travelling outwards; as long as this latter action
                    keeps the former in check, the accumulation of iron oxide in the outer layers
                    does not take place to such an extent as to deteriorate materially the tenacity
                    of the malleable iron skin; but, when the carbon of the core has been so
                    completely removed that the supply of carbon oxide from the interior almost
                    ceases, the formation and accumulation of iron oxide in the outer layers goes
                    on, rendering them more or less brittle. In the inner layers the removal of
                    carbon by the penetration of the dissolved carbon dioxide and its reaction on
                    the carbon ^is continually progressing, the decarbonization gradually creeping
                    inwards, as it were, until finally the innermost central part becomes
                    decarbonized also. The non-removal of silicon, sulphur, and phosphorus during
                    the process is due simply to the fact that these elements are not acted upon by
                    the occluded carbon dioxide as the carbon is, and consequently not being
                    oxidized cannot be eliminated. The iron oxide used becomes partially reduced
                    during the operation; in order to make it fit for use over again, it is
                    moistened with a solution of sal-ammoniac and exposed to the air in order to
                    rust and so reoxidize it. The whole process is in effect an exact inversion of
                    the chemical changes taking place during the manufacture of blister steel from
                    malleable iron by the process of cementation (see § 32), and differs from the
                    ordinary puddling method for the purification of cast iron in this salient
                    respect that in the latter case the formation of oxide of iron by the effect of
                    heated air, and its direct addition in the form of “fettling,” give rise to the
                    production of a fluxed mass, in which is incorporated a notably larger amount of
                    oxide of iron, which reacts on the carbon, sulphur, silicon, and phosphorus,
                    oxidizing them and converting them into products which are either gaseous and
                    escape (carbon and sulphur dioxides), or are non-metallic and fusible, and hence
                    separate from the iron as a fused slag or cinder.</p>
                <p>23. <hi rend="italic">Refining, Fining, and Puddling of Cast Iron.—</hi> In order
                    to convert large masses of pig iron into wrought iron, a large variety of
                    methods have been and to some extent are still employed, differing from one
                    another in certain details; they may, however, be classified under two chief
                    heads, viz., those in which the iron is more or less completely fluxed by heat
                    in contact with the solid fuel used, by means of a blast of air on much the same
                    principle as an ordinary smith’s forge, and those in which the treatment of the
                    iron is effected in a chamber separate from that in which the fuel is burnt when
                    solid fuel is employed, or in which gaseous fuel is used in the first
                    instance.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Charcoal Finery. —</hi> Prior to the invention of puddling, the
                    conversion of cast into wrought iron was uniformly effected by a process which,
                    though differing markedly in certain details in different countries, yet in all
                    cases essentially consisted of exposure to an oxidizing atmosphere and agitation
                    until practically all the carbon and silicon, &amp;c., is removed. As the iron
                    becomes purer its fusibility lessens, so that ultimately it collects into pasty
                    semi-solid masses which when united together form a “ball,” which is taken out
                    and forged into a “bloom.”</p>
                <p>Of the different kinds of finery in use some fourteen principal modifications
                    have been enumerated by Tiinner, divisible into the three classes of
                    “Einmalschmelzerei” (single fusion process), “Waffenschmiede” (Walloon process),
                    and “Aufbrechschmiede” or “Deutscheschmiede” (breaking up process, or German
                    process). Of these most have been virtually out of date for years past; a few,
                    however, are stiff in use, but like the puddling process are rapidly giving way
                    to modern soft steel or ingot iron making processes, the use of malleable weld
                    iron being on the whole rapidly decreasing, at least relatively to that of
                    “steel” and fused iron. A single illustration of one of these processes (termed
                    by Tiinner the English Walloon process) will suffice: as carried out in Sweden
                    in what is somewhat inappropriately termed the <hi rend="italic">Lancashire
                    hearth,</hi> this differs slightly from the method as used in South Wales, the
                    chief difference being that in the former case the pigs are melted down and the
                    whole operation finished in the same furnace (saving that the rough blooms
                    produced are reheated in a second furnace for further hammering), whilst in the
                    latter the pig is melted in a separate hearth, in fact is passed through a sort
                    of “tunning out” fire or refinery before it reaches the finery proper; the bed
                    of this latter is “brasqued” or lined with charcoal powder moistened and rammed
                    in, and so forcibly compressed. The tuyeres are directed downwards, so that the
                    blast impinges more or less directly upon the fused metal. The effect of the
                    blast upon the metal broken up and stirred amongst charcoal heaped over it is
                    gradually to cause the formation of iron oxide and silica, with oxidation of the
                    carbon and other impurities, so that finally the metal used becomes changed into
                    two separate substances, viz., a pasty mass of spongy residual purified metal,
                    and a bath of fluid cinder mainly composed of ferrous silicate; the former is
                    ultimately removed as a ball and hammered into rough slabs, and finally after
                    reheating forged into bars, &amp;c.; in the production of “charcoal plates” (for
                    tinplate making), the first rough forged slabs are cut into pieces termed
                    “stamps,” which are then reheated in a reheating furnace termed a “hollow fire”
                    on a mass of the same kind of metal forged into a shovel shape, the blades of
                    the shovel and the mass of stamps piled on it being then forged into a slab,
                    which is virtually a much bigger blade; this is doubled upon itself to ensure
                    equality of the two sides, welded, cut off from the shank, and rolled into bars
                    and plates, &amp;c. In Sweden the metal is usually forged by hammering
                    throughout and not rolled at all. For inferior iron plates this process has been
                    used with the substitution of coke for charcoal and of less pure pig for the
                    better qualities used for the finer plates; but puddled iron has for the most
                    part long superseded that made in a coke-fired finery for general purposes.</p>

                    applicable to all methods by which impure iron is purified, is in practice
                    restricted to one particular operation practised as a preliminary stage in the
                    puddling process, viz., melting pig iron on a hearth such as that shown in figs.

                    combustion being urged by a blast of air, which also partially oxidizes the
                    iron, both as it melts and subsequently; the molten mass when the operation is
                    complete is either run out into moulds, chilled by throwing water on to it (the
                    solidified upper surface being removed as a rough cake), or tapped into a
                    separate similar open furnace or into a puddling furnace, in which the
                    conversion into malleable iron is finished.</p>
                <p>The effect of this first treatment is materially to reduce the percentage of
                    total carbon, and almost entirely to remove the silicon present, the latter
                    forming a slag with the oxidized iron together with more or less of the ash of
                    the fuel; when the metal from the refinery is cast, it solidifies as “white
                    iron” destitute or nearly so of graphitoidal carbon. Sometimes the removal of
                    carbon and silicon is accelerated by adding to the fluxing pig mill scales or
                    other tolerably pure readily fusible iron oxide; lime is also sometimes added,
                    with the intention of either partially removing sulphur present in the pig or
                    preventing its further absorption from the fuel.</p>
                <p>A modification of the refinery has been introduced by Parry specially applicable
                    to the direct treatment of the molten metal from the blast furnace; the molten
                    pig being tapped straight into the refinery hearth, a jet of superheated steam
                    is made to play upon its surface (the temperature being maintained by an air
                    blast in addition); the oxidation of the iron is then rapidly effected, with
                    evolution of hydrogen from the decomposition of the steam; in this way a notable
                    saving in fuel is said to be effected. In South Wales a coke refinery has been
                    largely employed to partially purify the iron subsequently finished in an
                    ordinary puddling furnace; this refinery or <hi rend="italic">running-out
                    fire</hi> is a rectangular hearth with two or more tuyeres delivering blast
                    slanting-wise downwards upon the surface of the fused metal, which is simply
                    introduced as pig piled up on the hearth alternately with layers of coke, melted
                    down, and kept fused with the blast playing on its surface for some time. Owing
                    to the partial removal of silicon, &amp;c., in this previous treatment, the
                    subsequent puddling develops less cinder, and accordingly is sometimes distin-

                <p><hi rend="italic">Puddling.—</hi> In the “dry puddling” process (which, as
                    compared with the “pigboiling” process, is so little used that the generic term
                    “puddling” is much more frequently employed to indicate the latter operation
                    than the former), the iron which has passed through the refinery is placed on
                    the bed of a reverberatory furnace together with a certain amount of mill cinder
                    or other fettling, and melted down in a somewhat oxidizing atmosphere, the
                    result of which is the formation of a fluxed mixture of pig iron and iron oxide;
                    this is well stirred, whilst the flame keeps it fluid, so that the iron oxide
                    gradually reacts on the carbon, silicon, phosphorus, and sulphur present,
                    oxidizing them and converting them either into gases which escape, or oxides
                    which by uniting with ferrous oxide form a readily fusible slag. As this process
                    goes on, just as in the charcoal finery, the consistency of the mass alters, the
                    whole thickening firstly to a porridge-like substance and finally to a mixture
                    of pasty solid lumps partly of coherent spongy malleable iron and partly of
                    fluxed slag, mechanically adherent thereto, and dripping from the spongy mass
                    when this is lifted. When the proper consistency is reached the iron is said to
                    “come to nature”; the spongy mass is then raked together with the iron rabble or
                    stirring rod employed, and formed into a rough loosely coherent “ball,” which is
                    worked as described in § 25. The use of the refinery conjoined with the dry
                    puddling process has almost ceased in England; certain brands of Yorkshire iron,
                    however, of high reputation, are still prepared in this way. The superiority of
                    the metal is largely due to the carefulness with which the plates and bars
                    finally prepared are made; the puddled bars are broken into fragments, and each
                    piece carefully examined as to its fracture, the crystalline portions being
                    worked up separately from the fibroid portions which yield the better plates; by
                    piling, reheating, and rolling, &amp;c., the fragments are worked into bars,
                    which are again piled and rolled into plates. Cold blast pig is preferred for
                    certain of these brands.</p>
                <p>In the “pigboiling” process, or puddling <hi rend="italic">par excellence</hi> as
                    now understood, the main differences as compared with the preceding are that raw
                    pig iron is used in the first instance instead of refined pig, so that the
                    purification takes longer owing to the greater amount of impurity to be removed,
                    and, in consequence of this and of the larger amount of fettling used, a much
                    larger amount of slag or “tap cinder” is formed; in other respects the operation
                    is much the same. The furnace is usually lined in the first instance by melting
                    down and partially oxidizing scrap iron on the bed so as to make a firm
                    foundation; “bulldog” or roasted tap cinder, mainly consisting of ferric oxide
                    and silica, also forms a material largely used, the upper surface being finished
                    off with a layer of a smooth unctuous variety of haematite or with “blue billy”
                    (§ 5) or some other variety of ferric oxide.</p>
                <p>In order to facilitate the removal of phosphorus and sulphur in the puddling
                    forge, numerous chemical reagents have been employed incorporated with the mass
                    by stirring. Thus common salt and manganese dioxide have been recommended by
                    Schafhäutl, chlorides of phosphorus, arsenic, and sulphur being said to be
                    formed and volatilized, whilst manganese is communicated to the iron, and by its
                    oxidizing action whilst becoming oxidized itself promotes the purification;
                    moreover it renders the slag more fusible. Henderson employs a mixture of
                    titaniferous iron ore and fluor spar, whereby fluorides of phosphorus, silicon,
                    &amp;c., are said to be evolved. Good results are said to be produced by the
                    employment of fluorides (cryolite or fluor spar) as a flux in puddling. Sherman
                    recommends iodide of potassium; according to Siemens, who carefully tried the
                    Sherman process at the Landore works, no appreciable diminution is produced in
                    the amount of sulphur and phosphorus by the addition of the iodide even in some
                    considerable quantity both during the ordinary process of puddling and in a
                    steel converting furnace, and the same kind of negative result has also been
                    testified to by others, notably Snelus <hi rend="italic">{Journal I. and S.
                    Inst.,</hi> 1871, ii. 181), and also by Euverte after full trial at Terre Noire.
                    On the other hand, trials of the Henderson process appear to indicate that it
                    causes a more rapid purification than ordinary puddling; thus in experiments
                    made at Blochairn Works, Glasgow, the following percentages of phosphorus were

                <p>Parry has proposed after puddling in the ordinary way to recarbonize the iron by
                    melting it along with coke and a little lime, &amp;c. (to avoid sulphuration as
                    much as possible), in a cupola furnace, and then to puddle a second time; the
                    phosphorus being considered by him to be reduced in each puddling operation to
                    about one-fifth of the original amount, the double puddling would convert even a
                    moderately phosphorized pig into a tolerably pure bar iron. Very good iron has
                    thus been made from highly phosphorized pig on a moderately large scale (some 80
                    tons).</p>

                    furnace introduced by Cort in 1784 differs from those in use at the present day
                    only in one essential par ticular, viz., that whereas Cort used a bed of sand on
                    which to run the metal fused previously in a running-out fireplace, the modern
                    furnace as improved by Rogers some half century ago has a bed of iron plates
                    cooled by air spaces underneath and covered with roasted scrap iron or with
                    “bulldog,” on to which the metal is heaped, having been previously refined or
                    not according as the dry puddling or pig boiling process is used. The
                    substitution of iron bottoms and a firm bed for the loose sand effects a great
                    saving in iron through the formation of much less silicious cinder, and a great
                    saving in time on account of repairs to the bed being much less frequently
                    required; moreover, a much greater degree of purification from phosphorus is at
                    the same time brought about.</p>

                    number of patterns of puddling furnaces differing one from the other in details
                    have been constructed by various inventors; the limits of the present article as
                    to length forbid that these should be minutely discussed.</p>
                <p>Instead of using solid coal or coke as fuel for the puddling forge, gas is
                    equally applicable, i.e., such as is described in § 10. In order to apply at
                    will an oxidizing or a reducing atmosphere, it is only requisite to regulate the
                    supply of air (usually hot blast) to the reverberatory furnace in which the gas
                    is used. In Silesia gas puddling furnaces have been long in use, consisting of
                    producers in which coal is burnt by means of a number of small jets of air
                    forced in at the base of a square brick chamber some 5 feet in height, the top
                    of the chamber being level with the bridge of an ordinary reverberatory furnace,
                    the producer taking the place of the firegrate. In this way a mixture of
                    nitrogen and carbon oxide with more or less hydrogen and carburetted hydrogens
                    from the distillation of the coal results, the combustion of which in the
                    reverberatory is effected by blowing a series of jets of heated air from a row
                    of tuyeres arranged horizontally, or from a long narrow horizontal slitshaped
                    tuyere, across the issuing gases so as to form something like a gigantic
                    blow-pipe, or series of parallel blow-pipe flames, which are somewhat inclined
                    downwards so as to impinge on the substances in the bed of the furnace. Similar
                    arrangements have been adopted elsewhere; thus in Carinthia gas-fired puddling
                    furnaces are in use where wood is the fuel, the producer and furnace proper
                    adjoining one another, and the combustion of the gas being completed in the
                    furnace by a jet of blast from a tuyere inclining somewhat downwards; the blast
                    is moderately heated by being made to circulate through flues under the furnace
                    bed, thus also cooling the brickwork; the pigs to be puddled are previously
                    heated up to near their fusing point by the waste gases from a previous
                    operation, being placed in a chamber just beyond the hearth. The waste gases
                    have also been employed to heat the air blast by placing a pistolpipe or other
                    equivalent kind of stove between the furnace and the chimney. Several furnaces
                    for thus utilizing the waste heat have been introduced, in England in
                    particular; J. Head describes under the name of the “Newport furnace” a somewhat
                    analogous arrangement, a dry steam jet being used in connexion with the
                    airblast; a great diminution in consumption of fuel is thus said to be produced
                    <hi rend="italic">{Journal I. and S. Inst.,</hi> 1872, p. 220).</p>
                <p>The Siemens regenerative furnace as applied to puddling consists essentially of a
                    furnace fired by the gases from a Siemens gas producer heated (along with the
                    air requisite to burn them) by means of Siemens regenerators (§ 10). The chief
                    difference between this form of furnace, represented by fig. 33, and the
                    Carinthian gas furnaces is that the flame does not enter at one end and issue at
                    the other, but leaves the furnace at the same end as that at which it enters,
                    circulating in the furnace, and thereby leaving the other end free for access by
                    means of an ordinary door. According to Siemens the loss of weight between pig
                    and puddled bar did not exceed 2 per cent, on an average of six months’
                    continuous working, whilst the consumption of coal (including the reheating
                    furnace) was 30 Cλvts. 3 qrs. 8 lb per ton of <hi rend="italic">finished wire
                    rod</hi> (3 cwts. of ordinary fettling being used per ton of iron).
                    Modifications of the Siemens furnace have been adopted in various iron-works
                    differing more or less in detail, but not greatly in general principle; thus the
                    Ponsard furnace (§ 40) and the Swindell furnace mainly differ in having the
                    producer placed close to the furnace so that the gases are used directly without
                    passing through the regenerators, which are only used to heat the air. The total
                    fuel used in a Swindell puddling furnace in a large American works on a four
                    months’ average was 2024⅛ lb of slack per ton of yield in iron (2240 lb), or 0 ’
                    904 per unit of iron; the furnace, however, was not at work at night, so that a
                    greater consumption of fuel was occasioned than would have been with double
                    shifts of workmen. Kosmann has made a careful comparison <hi rend="italic"
                    >{ΡreussicherZeitschr.f.</hi><hi rend="italic">Berg-, Hütten-, und
                    Salinenwesen,</hi> 1870, 145) between the effects and relative economy of
                    puddling in the ordinary manner and in a Siemens regenerative gas puddling
                    furnace, arriving at the conclusion that the latter is preferable in all cases
                    where an extremely high heat is required, and where the fuel is of bad quality
                    and unsuited for use in the ordinary way, or when a fixed temperature and
                    particular constant quality of flame are required for any length of time. If,
                    however, these conditions are not required, there is little advantage in the
                    Siemens furnace over the ordinary one, whilst the latter admits of waste heat
                    being utilized for heating boilers, &amp;c. The waste of iron is nearly equal in
                    the two cases, the ordinary furnace being slightly at a disadvantage; thus the

                <p>Besides the gases generated from coal, various other kinds of fuel for puddling
                    furnaces are sometimes employed; thus petroleum and coal tar have been used in
                    American works, as also has the natural gas from the Pennsylvanian oil wells,
                    and that produced by partially burning damp sawdust (see § 10).</p>
                <p>24. <hi rend="italic">Machinery for Saving Labour in Puddling.—</hi> In order to
                    diminish the amount of laborious and exhausting work performed by the puddler,
                    various mechanical contri vances have been introduced from time to time, mostly
                    consisting of an ordinary rabble or some similar stirrer to which motion is
                    communicated by machinery, in such a way as to move it (with some amount of
                    guidance on the part of a workman) more or less in the same way as the puddler
                    would use it. Fig. 34 represents one of this class of mechanical rabbles known
                    as <hi rend="italic">Withamjs machine rabble</hi> applied to a double puddling
                    furnace. <hi rend="italic">Dormoy</hi> ’ <hi rend="italic">s rabble</hi> (figs.
                    35, 36) differs from others of this class in being worked by rotation like a
                    hair-brushing machine; the tool being made to revolve very rapidly (300 to 500
                    turns per minute for white iron and 800 to 1000 for grey pig) gives the metal
                    such an impulse that it gyrates horizontally round the bed, continually renewing
                    the surface in contact with the atmosphere; this is further aided by making the
                    end of the rabble to carry a disk, which is replaced by a short twisted point
                    when the metal comes to nature; only for the final balling is a hand-worked
                    rabble requisite. According to Paget <hi rend="italic">{Journal I. and 8.
                    Inst.,</hi> 1872, 338) one fettling serves for forty charges worked in this way;
                    an increase of 30 per cent, in the yield is effected, with an expenditure of
                    only 0 ’ 552 parts of coal perunit of wrought iron made (11 ’ 4 cwts. per ton);
                    the puddler is but little fatigued, although charges are worked off much more
                    rapidly, whilst sulphur and phosphorus are so well eliminated that inferior
                    brands of pig produce iron equal to good charcoal iron. Numerous other
                    mechanical rabbles and analogous appliances have been introduced by various
                    inventors; reports on the working of several of these (Witham’s, Griffith’s,
                    Stoker’s, Wilson’s, &amp;c.), and on the construction and performance of several

                    flame was directed from the front. Practically none of these machines ever came
                    much into use. A considerable measure of success, however, has attended the
                    improved form of rotary puddling furnace invented by Danks of Cincinnati, and
                    represented in fig. 37.</p>
                <p>The fuel is burnt in an ordinary fireplace, a blast B being admitted under the
                    bars and another over them A, level with the firing hole, so that by regulating
                    the two streams of air the atmosphere can be kept reducing or oxidizing at will.
                    A circular chamber or drum 0 is supported on massive friction rollers and
                    arranged so that its axis is about level with the top of the bridge; at the
                    other end is a movable terminal shaped like the frustum of a cone D, supported
                    by chains or rods from a crane so that it can be swung on one side if required,
                    thus serving as a door; this is connected by a lateral tube with the flue; a
                    small orifice E closed by a stopper allows the interior of the furnace to be
                    viewed when at work. The movable end being swung on one side and the blast
                    turned off, the pigs are introduced at the end, and the terminal replaced; on
                    turning on the blast and causing the drum to rotate slowly the pig is melted and
                    incorporated with the fettling, &amp;c., by the rotation; motion is communicated
                    by means of a large external cog wheel F gearing into a pinion. Through a small
                    cinder hole G the fluid slag is drawn off. The main difficulty experienced by
                    previous inventors was to obtain a furnace lining that would last for any length
                    of time, silicious bricks and analogous substances being used by them; this
                    difficulty was overcome by Danks in the following way. The iron external drum is
                    cased inside with firebrick, or preferably a cement composed of crashed ore and
                    lime; a fusible iron ore such as hammer slag or mill scale is then introduced
                    and melted down, the drum being slowly rotated; the rotation being stopped, the
                    melted mass collects as a pool at the lowest level; large irregular lumps of an
                    infusible ore (American iron mountain ore in preference, or Marbella lumps when
                    this is not attainable) are then thrown into the pool; the cooling effect of
                    these soon sets the liquid mass, which then acts as a cement, binding the lumps
                    to the lining. This operation is repeated several times, so that finally the
                    whole inside is lined, the pool being formed in a new place each time. The
                    performance of the Danks puddler was very fully investigated a few years ago by
                    a special commission of the Iron and Steel Institute, whose various reports are
                    given in the <hi rend="italic">Journal of the I. and S. Inst,</hi> for 1872 (see
                    also <hi rend="italic">ibid.,</hi> 1871, i. 258); the general results of the
                    experiments being that the production from the rotator is several times that
                    from a hand furnace using the same pig, and that a larger yield of iron is
                    obtained, more being in fact taken out of the furnace than is put in as pig, the
                    surplus arising from the reduction of the fettling; moreover, with suitable
                    fettling the quality of iron produced is always at least equal to that yielded
                    by the hand furnace, and is usually much superior owing to the more complete
                    elimination of phosphorus due to the less “acid” nature of the slag; the
                    consumption of fuel per ton of iron made is much about the same, but usually
                    somewhat less with the rotator than with the hand furnace; thus whilst something
                    like 21⅜ cwts. of pig were required to give a ton of wrought iron by the hand
                    process, slightly less than 18f sufficed with the Danks furnace; <hi
                    rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> 100 parts of wrought iron were obtained from 107 <hi
                    rend="italic">'5</hi> and from 93 ’ 6 parts of pig in the two processes
                    respectively. It is to be noticed, however, that further practical experience
                    has not altogether confirmed the results of the commission, and that so far as
                    England is concerned the advantages derived from mechanical puddling by the
                    Danks machine (and also by others subsequently introduced) have not proved as
                    great in actual practice as the success of the machine in America at first
                    seemed to indicate would be the case in other countries^</p>
                <p>In order to avoid the damage done to the lining by introducing solid pigs, Wood
                    proposes to granulate the iron by means of a machine somewhat analogous to his
                    slag granulator (§ 17), whilst fusion of the pigs in a separate furnace or
                    cupola has also been often employed, the molten metal being then tapped into the
                    rotary puddler.</p>
                <p>A large number of modifications of Danks’s furnace and many other more or less
                    analogous rotating arrangements for puddling have been subsequently constructed
                    by various inventors; thus Williams (Pittsburg, United States) makes the
                    rotating chamber of the Danks furnace to be separated from the combustion
                    chamber a little way, the flame being led in through a movable flue analogous to
                    that at the chimney end, so that access to both ends of the rotator is
                    possible.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>See <hi

                    far end is cooled by water or steam; the fuel employed is gaseous, the generator
                    being immediately in front of the furnace; mechanical arrangements of special
                    character are also applied for the purpose of charging and discharging the
                    furnaces. The rotating chamber rests on friction wheels which are made to turn
                    by an engine instead of having an external cog wheel affixed to the drum itself
                    as in Danks’s machine. For drawings of the machine and further details see <hi

                <p><hi rend="italic">Spencer's rotating furnace</hi> (fig. 38) is shaped like a
                    rhombus reversing on a horizontal axis, supported at the end by disks
                    perpendicular to the axis of rotation; the transverse vertical section is
                    square, two sides being parallel to the axis, the other two, though parallel to
                    each other, being pitched slightly diagonal, so that in revolving a throw is
                    communicated to the charge from bridge to Hue during one half of the revolution,
                    and <hi rend="italic">vice versa</hi> during the other half. The flat sides
                    allow the rotator to be readily fettled; they are made of troughs filled with
                    molten tap cinder, the ends being made up of bricks also of cast tap cinder, the
                    whole put together and cemented with molten tap; in one side is the door for
                    removing the ball when it has come to nature. The pig is melted in a cupola
                    before running in; in about five minutes the boil commences, and it lasts about
                    ten minutes, the operation being finished in other ten, when the ball is
                    extracted, and quickly removed on a bogie to the hammer and rolls.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Crampton's furnace</hi> has a similar construction, with the
                    additional modification that the flame is produced by coal dust and air (§ 10)
                    instead of solid fuel (fig. 39). A is the revolving chamber supported on
                    friction rollers C, C; B is the refractory lining, and D a movable flue piece,
                    supported upon a pivot D' so as to wheel round when required into the position
                    indicated by the dotted lines; it is kept in place against the furnace by the
                    screws <hi rend="italic">d, d</hi> when the operation is proceeding. By means of
                    the injecting pipe G a jet of mixed air and small coal is blown into the
                    furnace; this pipe is adjustable so that the flame can be directed into the
                    furnace in different ways as required; when a number of furnaces are worked
                    together from one central air and coal reservoir, each one is fed by a pipe G'
                    radiating from the reservoir. By means of little doors ∕,∕ different parts of
                    the opening F in the flue piece through which the jet enters can be closed at
                    will. A water jacket surrounds the rotator fed through the two-way cock H with a
                    stream of water circulating as indicated by the arrows entering by the pipe I,
                    and passing through the jacket JJKLL to the exit pipe N, after which it passes
                    to the flue piece D (by means of a flexible tube), and there circulates through
                    another analogous jacket, finally emerging by a pipe and running into a chamber
                    <hi rend="italic">d'</hi> at the base of the pivot and thence to the drain. The
                    wearing joints 0, 0 of the furnace and flue which rub together are iron rings,
                    directly in contact with the water (forming the ends of the jackets); these are
                    renewable when required. In fettling the furnace either oxide of iron bricks
                    moulded to fit the furnace are built in and then baked <hi rend="italic">in
                    situ,</hi> and fettled in much the same way as Danks’s furnace (viz., melting
                    fusible ores or cinder, and throwing in irregular lumps of ore, splashing the
                    cinder over the far end in so doing so as to cover it); or hammer slag, &amp;c.,
                    is melted on the bare iron casing, and lumps of ore are thrown into the fused
                    substance so as to be thereby cemented to the casing; or a thin firebrick lining
                    maybe built in and the fettling then put on. Owing to the cooling action of the
                    water-jacket when the furnaceis in use, the bricks are never melted down, and
                    even a fluid cinder applied directly to the iron plates in the first instance
                    without bricks of any kind is completely prevented from fluxing; in the same way
                    the far end gets spontaneously fettled by the consolidation of the cinder
                    splashed against it. According to Crampton’s description of the furnace (from
                    which the above account is abridged— <hi rend="italic">Journal I. and S.
                    Inst.,</hi> 1874, 384), in puddling 130 cwts. of pig 147J cwts. of hammered iron
                    were ultimately produced, with an expenditure of 70 cwts. of coal, <hi

                    charges, the coal consumption was70 ’ l per cent, of the wrought iron (14 <hi

                    phosphorus yielded wrought iron containing only traces.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Hoxνson and Thomas's Rotary Machine.—</hi> The chamber is made
                    up of two cones of wrought iron fixed base to base, lined with bricks made of
                    ferric oxide and previously well-baked, ilmenite or haematite or any refractory
                    ore being suitable. The fireplace communicates with an annular space surrounding
                    the neck of the chamber nearest to it by a tube, so that any air which would
                    otherwise be drawn in by the draught at the opening between the grate bridge and
                    revolver is drawn over to the fire and not into the chamber. In order to
                    withdraw the ball, and introduce anew charge, the revolver is mounted on a
                    carriage (supporting the friction rollers), so that by running the carriage
                    backwards or forwards, in a direction perpendicular to the axis, access is had
                    to the interior through the ends, or the chamber is again put into position.</p>

                    bowl-shaped bed which revolves on a vertical axis by machinery, the sides and

                    inserts his rabble at the working door, and has simply to hold it in position to

                    to the rabble and fitting into a cavity in the doorplate. When the metal begins

                    (the bottom being double), the water flowing away again through the hollow
                    shaft; in a later modification, a mechanical rabble capable of rotary or
                    reciprocating motion is also attached.</p>

                    differs from the preceding ones only in that, while the revolving hearth rotates
                    on an axis not perfectly vertical (as also previously used by Maudes-</p>
                <p>ley), the axis is mounted on a carriage, so that when required for repairs the
                    whole hearth can be withdrawn. Fig. 62 represents the furnace with this
                    modification that, instead of an ordinary fireplace being employed, a Siemens
                    regenerator and Siemens gas producer are used in connexion with the Pernot
                    hearth, the arrangement being intended for steel melting by the Siemens-Martin
                    process rather than for puddling (see § 40). According to Petin <hi
                    rend="italic">{Joum. I. and S. Inst.,</hi> 1874, 143) the fuel consumption with
                    the Pernot hearth as compared with the ordinary puddling furnace is considerably
                    less (the fuel being burnt in the same kind of fireplace in each case), whilst
                    the loss in puddling is also less; thus per unit of wrought iron the following
                    figures were obtained during the puddling of nearly 300 tons of fine iron and 50
                    tons of ordinary iron (leaving out of account the saving of labour) :—</p>

                    furnace, this has a pan-shaped hearth rotating upon an oblique axis; the
                    obliquity of this can be adjusted to any required angle within certain limits,
                    so as to admit of the ball being tilted out when the operation is over, the
                    furnace bed having both a rotary and a tilting movement. The source of heat is
                    like that of a Crampton’s furnace, with this difference that instead of using
                    coal dust a gas and air jet like a compound blowpipe of enormous magnitude is
                    employed. Details of the construction and working are given in the <hi

                    obtained from a given kind of pig will vary. Many of the machines for puddling
                    above mentioned, and of the more or less analogous ones invented by Menessier
                    Jones, Gidlow and Abbott, Bouvart, and others, are reported by their inventors
                    to answer far better in this respect than ordinary hand-puddling furnaces, in
                    particular as regards the removal of phosphorus; so that with Cleveland pig, for
                    instance, containing 1 <hi rend="superscript"> ,</hi> 5 to2 ’ 0 percent, of that
                    element, whilst the hand-puddle bars usually contain about 0 ’ 5 per cent, of
                    phosphorus, only 0 ’ 2 and 0 ’ l per cent, and even less is contained in the
                    machine-puddled metal.</p>
                <p>This result has been traced in some instances to the use of fettling materials
                    containing but little silica; the production of a comparatively non-silicious
                    cinder greatly facilitates the oxidation and removal of phosphorus (as in the
                    “basic” Bessemer process,— § 37); whilst, conversely, well-puddled iron, if left
                    in contact with a highly silicious cinder, is capable of removing phosphorus
                    therefrom and taking it up again. Based on this principle, several processes
                    have been proposed for more or less completely dephosphorizing pig iron either
                    during puddling or previously thereto; among them may be mentioned the
                    following.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Bell</hi> ’ <hi rend="italic">s Processes.—</hi> Lowthian Bell
                    has proposed to desiliconize the pig by blowing Tor a few minutes in a Bessemer
                    converter, and then to transfer to a puddling furnace and finish the operation
                    therein so as also to eliminate phosphorus; in case the metal contains so much
                    phosphorus as to come to nature before a sufficient amount of that impurity is
                    removed, spiegeleisen or other carbonized iron free from phosphorus is added to
                    the partially blown metal, so as to prolong the operation of puddling, and
                    consequently to enable a larger amount of phosphorus to be removed; or the too
                    rapid expulsion of the carbon may be prevented by blowing into the converter
                    along with the blast carbonaceous matter, such as ground coke or charcoal,
                    &amp;c. Partially refined metal thus prepared charged into the furnace in the
                    fluid state causes much less injury to the lining than ordinary pigs, especially
                    when used solid, and consequently with a good deal of sand adherent to them; and
                    the process has the additional advantage of diminishing the time during which
                    the furnace is required for each puddling heat, so that the yield per furnace is
                    increased, whilst the quality of themetai is also improved; thus when Cleveland
                    pig was treated by blowing for five minutes in a Bessemer converter, and the
                    fluid metal then puddled, the phosphorus in the final product was reduced to 0 ’
                    3 per cent., whereas when puddled in the ordinary way it amounted to 0 <hi
                    rend="superscript"> ,</hi> 5 per cent, and upwards.</p>
                <p>The same result as regards partial purification of the pig irou can also be
                    produced in a more simple way and to a greater extent by “washing” molten pig
                    iron with iron oxide (ore, cinder, &amp;c.) in a fused state, the two being
                    agitated together at a temperature sufficiently low to prevent the iron from
                    being heated much above its fusing point; under these circumstances the greater
                    portion of ⅛e phosphorus present is oxidized and removed, whilst only a fraction
                    of the carbon is oxidized, although at higher temperatures the carbon is rapidly
                    oxidized; to effect this either a rotating or an oscillating puddling furnace
                    can be employed, or preferably a special arrangement consisting of a trough of
                    boiler plate closed at the ends and covered with a brick arch and lined with
                    purple ore at the bottom and sides; the trough rests on a horizontal axis, so
                    that it can oscillate like the beam of an engine; hence any material placed
                    inside is continually rolled or made to flow from one end to the other and back
                    by the oscillation. The trough is about 12 feet long, 3 wide, and 3 high; the
                    interior being red hot and the oxide introduced (either fluid or sufficiently
                    hot to melt when in contact with fused pig iron), the pig is run in, and
                    oscillation kept up for about ten minutes, when the partially purified metal is
                    tapped out and puddled in the ordinary way; during the oscillation the metal and
                    oxide travel altogether some 700 to 900 feet backwards and forwards from one end
                    to the other. In this way a pig containing much phosphorus is almost wholly
                    dephosphorized, as, for example, in the following instance.</p>

                    is in principle very much the same as Bell’s method, the phosphorus being
                    oxidized by fused iron oxide, only at a much higher temperature than that used
                    by Bell. Wedding describes the process as carried out at Essen thus: the pig is
                    melted in a 13 foot cupola with coke (taking an hour and a half), and is then
                    tapped into a modified Pernot hearth (§ 40) covered with a layer of fluxed ore
                    almost a foot thick, melted on at a very high temperature; before every heat
                    from 1500 to 1700 fi&gt; of ore, heated until sintered, are added before the
                    iron is tapped from the cupola. At first the furnace is made to revolve twice
                    only in a minute, but later the speed is increased to five revolutions per
                    minute. In from five to ten minutes the phosphorus is almost completely removed,
                    the point when this is the case being indicated by the formation of jets of
                    carbon oxide; prior to the formation of these, the carbon percentage is barely
                    altered, although the phosphorus is acted upon rapidly. Finkiner gives the

                    said to increase the rate of removal of phosphorus whilst diminishing that of

                <p><hi rend="italic">Smyth</hi> has proposed to refine pig iron by blowing in a
                    Bessemer converter or analogous specially constructed vessel with a blast

                    caustic soda, these chemicals being introduced in a special piece of apparatus
                    or “generator” somewhat analogous to an ordinary spray producer, and the
                    partially refined metal being subsequently puddled in the usual way. A number of
                    experiments made by Maynard at Gorton (near Manchester) indicated that the
                    advantages of the process were hardly in proportion to the extra cost thereby
                    entailed so far as the purifying action is concerned; but there is an advantage
                    in the use of petroleum as a means of obtaining the high temperature in the
                    converter or “receiver” used by Smyth requisite to keep the blown metal in
                    fusion and prevent “skulls” forming when it is run out into a casting ladle, in
                    cases where the iron has not the requisite amount of silicon present to enable
                    it to generate this heat with the use of air alone (see § 27).</p>

                <p><hi rend="italic">Eaton’s Process {Drown’s Process).—</hi> In connexion with the
                    history of the dephosphorization of pig iron, and its conversion into steel, the
                    experiments of Eaton (of Brooklyn, N. Y. ) are of interest; in 1860 he patented
                    the production of steel by the fusion together of cast iron and alkaline
                    carbonates or by the exposure of the cast iron to the decarbonizing and
                    purifying action of these salts in a fused state. No practical use seems to have
                    been made of the process. Recently the subject has been investigated by Drown,
                    who finds that cast iron plates immersed in melted sodium carbonate for several
                    days become converted into malleable iron to a greater or lesser depth by a
                    process substantially the same as that occurring when iron oxide is used as the
                    “cementing” agent (§ 22), so far as the removal of carbon is concerned, but
                    differing in that silicon and phosphorus are also largely oxidized and removed.
                    Thus the following analyses represent the purifying effect of a seven days’

                <p>25. <hi rend="italic">Machinery and Appliances employed in the Manufacture of
                    Malleable Iron.—</hi> When a ball has been prepared in the puddling furnace, it
                    consists of a loosely coherent spongy mass of iron of doughy consistency with
                    fluid slag filling up all the interstices and dripping from it. The first thing
                    to be done with it is to hammer or squeeze it into a somewhat more compact mass
                    or bloom, the fluid slag being thus to a considerable extent removed; the mass
                    is then further hammered or rolled into rough bars, by which time it has so far
                    cooled down that before it can be further manipulated it must be again heated up
                    to welding heat; previously to this heating it is cut up into slips which are
                    “piled” on one another and “fagoted” together with iron wire, and after being
                    heated up again are hammered into a bloom and rolled or otherwise worked into
                    bars, plates, rods, &amp;c., as required. For very coarse bars piling and
                    reheating is not always necessary; but for the better qualities of “merchant
                    iron” these operations are carefully gone through, often more than once; the
                    size of the piles, the way in which the separate portions are arranged in them,
                    and the mode of rolling, &amp;c., depending on the form ultimately desired; thus
                    the arrangement is somewhat different when ψ iron is intended to be made from
                    that adopted for plates, and so on; the pile being made in the former case
                    pyramidal or somewhat ∣ shaped, in the latter of rectangular section.</p>
                <p>Formerly the balls were squeezed by an “alligator” or “crocodile” squeezer such
                    as that represented in fig. 40, and were then “shingled” by shingling hammers,
                    such as the “tilt” hammer (where the hammer forms a lever with the fulcrum in
                    the middle, a cam pressing upon one end serving to depress that end and raise
                    the other which carries the head) and the “helve” hammer (where the fulcrum is
                    at one end, the lifting cam being at the other, and the hammer head between the
                    two, as near the cam as possible, fig. 41); these arrangements were usually
                    worked by water-power. With the increased use of steam-power more powerful
                    squeezers were employed. Fig. 42 represents Brown’s revolving squeezer, the ball
                    being made to pass between two rotating cams which flatten it out, and
                    subsequently between the second of these and a third which carries the operation
                    further; in more powerful machines of the kind a larger number of cams still is
                    employed. Fig. 43 represents another form of rotary squeezer, in which, by the
                    friction of the revolving inner wheel C (studded with blunt projecting teeth)
                    the ball D is urged onwards from A where it enters to E where it leaves, and is
                    consequently flattened out and squeezed by the pressure between C and the outer
                    circle BB. The use of the steam hammer, however, has now largely superseded
                    these arrangements for the produce of handpuddling furnaces; for larger masses
                    hydraulic squeezers are often used; thus Siemens employs an hydraulic compressor
                    in which three or more hydraulic rams simultaneously advance horizontally to the
                    ball in radial directions, the ball being mounted on a turntable, so that when
                    the rams retire it can be shifted round so as to present fresh surface to the
                    rams; after lateral compression, a vertical ram or screw descends upon the ball
                    so as to compress it in a new direction. For the large balls obtained in tue
                    Danks furnace, &amp;c., a powerful squeezer is used, in principle analogous to
                    Brown’s (fig. 42), having two rollers at the base revolving in the same
                    direction, and a large eccentric or cam geared to them and also revolving in the
                    same direction, the end being hammered up by a horizontal steam hammer when the
                    pressure forces the metal outwards.</p>
                <p>Fig. 44 represents a single-acting hammer after Nasmyth’s construction (Cave’s

                    case the movable part works vertically and carries a heavy hammer head at the
                    lower end, underneath which is a massive anvil resting on a solid foundation. In
                    the case of single-acting hammers, the steam pressure is only employed to lift
                    the hammer head, the fall being simply that due to gravity; much greater force
                    of impact is gained in double-acting hammers, where the steam is admitted on
                    each side of the piston alternately, in the one case lifting the head as with
                    the single-acting hammer, in the other adding to the force of gravitation by its
                    pressure. By suitably working the valves the blow maybe modified or arrested at
                    any desired stage; a cushion of steam being left underneath the piston by
                    closing the exhaust valve before the stroke is complete, the force of the blow
                    is deadened; so that a variable amount of impact can be imparted, it being
                    possible for an expert hammerman to crack a nut without injuring the kernel, and
                    at the next stroke to exert the full power of the machine. It is this
                    adaptability that renders the steam hammer preferable to the old helve and tilt
                    hammers, the blows from which could not be readily modified during the shingling
                    of a given ball; whilst the ball is excessively pasty and spongy immediately
                    after taking from the puddling furnace, comparatively light blows suffice to
                    shape it into a bloom, the mass being dexterously turned about on the anvil by
                    means of suitable tongs during the forging; the force of the blow is then
                    greatly increased so fas to squirt out the fused slag on all sides in a shower
                    at each stroke, and forge the bloom into a compact mass; in this way the steam
                    hammer acts as both squeezer and helve hammer combined. Hammer blocks or “tups”
                    of from 1 to 3 tons weight usually suffice for ordinary puddling furnace work,
                    and lighter ones still for various kinds of smelting and forging work; but when
                    large masses have to be forged for special purposes, <hi rend="italic"
                    >e.g.,</hi> thick armour plates, large crankshafts, coils for large guns, jfcc.,
                    much heavier tups are used, weighing many tons; thus in Krupp’s works a 50-ton
                    hammer is in use with a 10-foot stroke, the anvil weighing upwards of 180 tons,
                    whilst at Creusot an 80-ton hammer with a fall of 5 metres (about 16 feet) is
                    employed. The striking faces of both anvil and tup are usually removable,
                    sliding sideways by dovetails into the body of the tup and the anvil block
                    respectively. For certain classes of work curved faces are employed, instead of
                    plain ones; so that a roughly cylindrical bar can be forged by appropriate
                    manipulation.</p>
                <p>A duplex horizontal modification of the vertical steam hammer is sometimes used
                    (Ramsbottom’s hammer), consisting of two opposed hammer blocks running on wheels
                    or rollers and meeting one another; the forging being placed between the two is
                    struck by both simultaneously. In one form of this double horizontal hammer the
                    two tups are actuated by the same piston, each being attached thereto by a link
                    rod so that both necessarily approach and recede at equal ratio; in another form
                    two pistons are employed, the steam valves of each being worked simultaneously
                    by the controlling lever. For forging small articles such as bolts, screws,
                    &amp;c., special machines are in use, striking a large number of blows per
                    minute, the hammer heads and anvil blocks being moulded or curved into the
                    appropriate forms so as virtually to form dies; the blows are usually struck by
                    means of cams lifting the hammersand bending strong springs which force the
                    hammer back when the-cams release them. See also <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Hammer,</hi> vol. xi. p. 425.</p>
                <p>For bending into shape large masses of metal such as thick armour plates that
                    have to be curved to the ship’s side, powerful hydraulic presses are employed;
                    by means of the same appliances large weldings of metal that cannot readily be
                    hammered on account of the shape can be readily made; thus, for welding the
                    spokes and tyres of iron and steel wheels and the like operations, hydraulic
                    forging, squeezing, welding, and bending machines are found to be eminently
                    satisfactory. Crank axles thus bent are said to be stronger than ordinary forged
                    ones.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Polling Hills.—</hi> After the bloom has been forged more or

                    xml:id="kp-eb0913-0344-0329"/> a pair of stout cast iron rollers, usually with
                    roughened surfaces, which are made to revolve synchronously but in opposite
                    directions by suitable gearing; the opposed faces of the rolls which meet the
                    bloom between them are consequently moving in the same direction; by these
                    “roughing rolls” the bloom is squeezed out into a rough irregular long plate or
                    slab, much as a lump of dough is by a cook’s rolling pin; this is passed through
                    another pair of rolls with smoother surfaces, which draw the mass out into a
                    thinner bar or slab. Instead of having the two sets of rolls arranged one in
                    front of the other, they are often placed one above the other; the bar after
                    passing in one direction between one pair is returned again through the other
                    pair. Instead of four roller's, only three are generally used (forming a
                    “three-high train ”), the bar passing above the middle one whilst travelling in
                    one direction and below it when passing the reverse way. The “puddle bar” or
                    “muck bar” thus obtained in the form of elongated slabs of from 4 to 18 inches
                    wide, and half an inch to 2 inches thick, according to the size to which it has
                    been reduced, is then cut up into lengths of some few feet, several of which are
                    piled one on the other, reheated, and rolled down again into another bar or slab
                    of superior quality (No. 2).</p>
                <p>For thick plates the pile is made much heavier than for thinner bars; two puddle
                    bar wide slabs are used for the top and bottom of the pile, between which are
                    arranged thinner bars, either of puddle bar or No. <hi rend="italic">2;</hi> the
                    pile being heated to a welding heat is first passed between roughed rolls to
                    consolidate it, then through other pairs of smooth rolls in succession, the
                    space between each pair being successively less and less so as to elongate the
                    bar and diminish its section at each passage, much as wire is in wire drawing;
                    this is usually effected by grooving the rollers used for the last few rolling
                    stages so that the rolls are almost in contact with one another saving where
                    grooved. Fig. 46 illustrates two kinds of successions of grooves used for
                    rectangular bars in a “two-</p>
                <p>high” train, and fig. 47 those for rails in a “three-high” train on A. Thomas’s
                    system. The bars are turned one quarter round at each passage, so that the
                    pressure may be exerted alternately compressing and extending each component
                    layer of bars in the pile, and thus developing a more uniform texture.
                    Sometimes, in reducing the pile to the larger-sized bar which is ultimately sent
                    through the “finishing train” of grooved rolls, a combination set of rolls is
                    employed, consisting of one horizontal pair of rolls and one vertical pair just
                    behind it, so that the mass is compressed both laterally and vertically
                    simultaneously (fig. 48). The “housings,” or stout cast-iron supports for the
                    rollers, are arranged with a slot so that the gunmetal bearings for the axles of
                    the rollers can be raised or lowered by means of a powerful adjusting screw, and
                    in this way the distance between the rolls is regulated, and consequently the
                    thickness of the bar rolled out. In order to facilitate this adjustment the
                    bearings of the upper roller are sometimes attached to a frame with a
                    counterpoise, and connected with a hydraulic ram so as at will to bring the
                    movable roll nearer to or further from the other; in this way one pair of
                    rollers can be made to do the work of several rectangular grooves. Sometimes two
                    pairs of horizontal rolls are arranged one just in front of the other, so that
                    the size of the bar passing from the hinder pair is still further reduced by
                    passing through the front pair, which are a little closer together and revolve
                    more rapidly. When very thick plates are rolled, the direction of rotation of
                    the rolls is reversed instead of returning the plate back again, special ‘ <hi
                    rend="superscript"> t</hi> reversing engines” being used for the purpose. For
                    special kinds of work, such as rolling taper iron <hi rend="italic">(e.g.,</hi>
                    the movable tongues of railway “points”), a peculiar lifting arrangement is
                    applied to the upper roll, so that as the metal passes between the distance
                    apart is varied. When an hydraul ic ram is employed to vary the distance apart
                    of the rollers, this is simply effected by adjusting the ram so that the
                    distance apart of the rolls is the minimum requisite, and opening a small
                    discharge valve for the water when the bar is introduced; as the bar passes
                    through, the water is ejected in a regular stream through the discharge valve,
                    the rate being so adjusted that as the bar travels through the distance apart of
                    the rolls gradually increases; by closing the valve the distance apart remains
                    constant, so that after rolling a taper end the rest of the bar can be rolled of
                    uniform section. With a “two-high” <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit13newyrich/page/n345/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0913-0345-0330"/> train not reversed at each successive passage,
                    the bar is lifted by hand or otherwise to the top of the top roller, which then
                    guides it back to the side from which it started, after which it is put through
                    the next groove, and so on; this causes loss of time, and prevents the bar being
                    rolled so many times before it cools; accordingly for thin plates or rods of
                    small section the three-high train is always used (or some more complex
                    analogous combination of rollers). As a rule the speed of rotation of the rolls
                    is less the heavier the plate, &amp;c., rolled; for very thick armour plates (of
                    which sizes up to 20 and 30 tons are sometimes rolled) a comparatively small
                    number of revolutions per minute suffices; for thin rod a much larger number up
                    to several hundreds; from 80 to 100 revolutions is about the usual speed for
                    rolling rails and similar heavy bars, 50 or 60 being employed for very thick
                    ones, 120 to 150 for lighter bars, and considerably more rapid speeds for very
                    thin bars, rods, and wire. Space will not permit of descriptions of the details
                    of various kinds of rolling-mill plant, &amp;c., introduced in different works,
                    and more especially of numerous American improvements in this direction,
                    particularly those of Messrs Fritz; for descriptions of these, the technological
                    journals, &amp;c., of the last few years must be consulted.</p>
                <p>For rolling tires a peculiar arrangement of comparatively small rolls is
                    employed; the ingot after having a hole punched through it (or cast in a thick
                    ring if of molten “ingot metal ”) is subjected to a kind of rolling action
                    between two surfaces, one inside the ring and the other outside, so that the
                    circumference of the ring is gradually extended and its thickness diminished,
                    whilst the flange is simultaneously formed.</p>
                <p>When thin rods of rectangular section are required <hi rend="italic">(c.g.,</hi>
                    nail rod), they are often made by rolling out a bar into a long wide thin plate,
                    which is then passed through a “slitting mill” consisting of a pair of steel
                    rollers with deep grooves, the projecting portions of the one fitting into the
                    grooves of the other, but not reaching to the bottom of the grooves. These
                    projecting portions act as revolving shears, so that the plate is “slit” as it
                    passes into thin rods, the width of which is regulated by the width of the
                    grooves; after passing through the machine these are straightened by hand.</p>
                <p>In order to cut puddle bars into lengths for piling, powerful shears are
                    employed. Fig. 49 represents one form of double shears worked by a reciprocating
                    lever actuated by an eccentric; fig. 50 represents a much more powerful form of
                    guillotine shears. A massive plate B with a terminal shearing edge AA works
                    slowly up and down in guides by means of eccentrics C, C, C on the shaft D; this
                    cutting edge passes just in front of a similar one permanently fixed to the
                    guide posts. The plate to be sheared is supported on a table <hi rend="italic"
                    >aa</hi> in front of the shears, running backward and forward upon a little
                    railway; whilst the upper cutting edge is elevated, the plate is quickly run
                    into position, and as the cutting edge descends is sheared across, the cut-off
                    portion dropping down; as the cutter ascends again the plate is turned round or
                    pushed forward, so as to bring under the cutter the portion to be sheared at the
                    next down stroke. The same kind of machine serves for cutting boiler plate .to
                    any required dimensions, and for shearing purposes generally. Substituting a
                    solid steel plunger for the cutting edge, the machine becomes a punching
                    machine, the plate to be punched being supported on a travelling table, and the
                    spot where the rivet-hole, &amp;c., are to be pierced being brought under the
                    end of the punch whilst the latter is raised. A powerful fly-wheel is requisite
                    whenever the plate to be sheared or punched is massive. For cutting ‘ ‘ crop
                    ends ’ ’ off hot or cold railway bars after rolling so as to reduce them to a
                    uniform length, an arrangement analogous to a travelling table is used, urged
                    forward by an eccentric, a toothed wheel and screw, or a chain and axle,~&amp;c
                    , fig. 51; on this the bar FF is placed against stops B, B, and the table then
                    moved forward (as represented in the figure by means of the handle G actuating
                    an eccentric on the axis AA) so as to bring the bar gradually against the pair
                    of rapidly revolving circular (usually toothless) saws C, C worked by a band and
                    pulley E, and thrown out of gear by shifting the band to the “idle pulley” D
                    when required; to prevent the saws from becoming overheated, the lower portions
                    dip into water troughs as they revolve. A single circular saw revolving 5000
                    times a minute (with a circumferential velocity of about 300 miles per hour) has
                    been used for this purpose. For obliterating file marks, reducing to roughly
                    plane surfaces, cutting slots, smoothing, and many other purposes for which
                    grindstones, &amp;c., were formerly employed, emery wheels made of pulverized
                    emery cemented together with calcium silicate are often used with great
                    advantage.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Cold Rolling.—</hi> In the ordinary processes of rolling iron
                    plates and rods, &amp;c., the metal is at a high temperature so as to be
                    softened by the heat; when cold iron is similarly rolled the compression thereby
                    produced gives a much greater stiffness and elasticity: thus Fairbairn found
                    that an increase in strength in bars from 60,746 lb per square inch before
                    rolling to 88,230 after was thus effected. Whipple (of the U. S. navy) finds
                    that in sheet iron the tenacity is thus increased by 60 and even 100 per cent,
                    of the original value, and Thurston has recently found analogous results both as
                    to increase in tenacity and power to resist strains and in the modulus of
                    elasticity. The process is largely in use in America, being carried out by
                    rolling the bars, &lt;fcc., out to a little larger dimensions than the finished
                    metal is intended to have; they are then “pickled” in dilute hydrochloric acid
                    to dissolve off the film of oxide from the surface, passed through limewater to
                    neutralize the adherent acid, and finally rolled many times in succession
                    between grooves of great smoothness, so cut as only to compress portions and not
                    the whole of the circumference at each passage through the rolls. For a
                    description of the appliances used in cold rolling as carried out at the works

                <p>For straightening and planishing circular steel bars such as shafting rods,
                    &amp;c., a peculiar machine is sometimes used, consisting of a pair of revolving
                    disks with bevelled faces, which compress the rod slightly between them, at the
                    same time rotating it and traversing it forwards (and, by reversal, backwards)
                    by one continuous movement, so that all parts of the surface are equally
                    operated on, and the bar leaves the machine circular, straight and
                    bright-surfaced.</p>

                    &amp;c.; the description of these would take up more space than can be given
                    here.</p>
                <p>A marked feature in most American iron-works is the general handy, compact, and
                    efficient nature of the machinery of all kinds, and the use of various
                    physical-exertion-saving contrivances and arrangements for ventilation and
                    cooling of workshops, &amp;c., many of which appliances are not so frequently to
                    be met with on the eastern side of the Atlantic, more especially in England. The
                    general arrangement and planning out of works, moreover, is usually far superior
                    to that of the older British works, which have gradually grown to their present
                    dimensions, and consequently have not been systematically laid out as a whole.
                    In consequence of attention to such details as these, the output of finished
                    material from a given amount of plant is frequently considerably greater in
                    America than would be attained in other countries, whilst the labour required is
                    not proportionately increased; thus the largest makes of Bessemer metal from a
                    given converter ever registered have been attained in American works; and so in
                    other instances. To a considerable extent the same remarks apply to Continental
                    establishments, at any rate to many of those of more modern arrangement; of late
                    years, however, the spirit of competition and other influences have rendered it
                    imperative upon the British ironmaster to pay more regard to such matters than
                    was formerly the case, and to adopt many American and Continental improvements
                    in details,—experience having opened his eyes to the fact that it is possible
                    for other nations, though less naturally favoured as to ores and fuel, to
                    compete successfully with him, and undersell him, not only as to foreign trade,
                    but even in the case of English contracts for iron work for home use.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">reheating furnaces</hi> employed to heat up to a welding
                    temperature the piles intended to be rolled are essentially low reverberatories,
                    much resembling puddling furnaces, in which the atmosphere is kept as little
                    oxidizing as possible; notwithstanding, a certain amount of slag is formed from
                    the fusion of the oxide of iron coating the bars and its union with silica from
                    the furnace bed when of sand, as is often the case; ferric oxide ores (“dry
                    bottoms ”) are preferable, yielding less cinder and causing less waste in
                    consequence, whence the name. To avoid introduction of air, the doors for
                    introducing and withdrawing the piles are banked up with small coal, &lt;fcc.
                    Gas forms a most suitable fuel, and various forms of gas-fired reheating
                    furnaces have been introduced: thus in Sweden Eckman’s gas reheating furnace has
                    been in use many years, consisting of a chamber in which charcoal is partially
                    burnt by an air blast so as to form impure carbon oxide, which passes by a tube
                    into the reheating furnace and is there burnt. Siemens regenerators applied to
                    reheating furpaces have also been frequently employed, and with good results,
                    either with his gas producers or with other forms of gas generator; at Munkfors
                    the Lundin gas producer (using damp sawdust, § 10) is employed. Another form of
                    reheating gas furnace is the Ponsard furnace (see § 40). The chief advantage of
                    gaseous fuel for reheating furnaces is that the atmosphere can be much more
                    exactly regulated so as to be non-oxidizing, thus avoiding waste by “cutting”
                    <hi rend="italic">lf.e.,</hi> oxidizing) the piles; independently of which,
                    moreover, a saving in cost of fuel consumed is effected; thus Holley states
                    that, in reheating Bessemer ingots or ordinary blooms in Siemens furnaces, 350
                    to 400 lb of coal are used to the ton, whilst the ordinary fires would consume
                    800 to 1000 lb. On the other hand, if the waste heat from the reheating furnace
                    is used to generate steam, the saving in fuel that would otherwise have to be
                    burnt for the purpose just about equals the difference in fuel consumption
                    between the Siemens and the ordinary reheating furnaces.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">’</hi><hi rend="italic">Frieds retort reheating anol puddling
                    furnace</hi> (fig. 52) is a sort of combination of a gas producer and an
                    ordinary puddling furnace; the firegrate is supplied with fuel which has been
                    heated in a low tower surmounting the grate by the waste gases circulating in a
                    flue round the tower; in this way the coal is coked, the gases passing to the
                    fireplace; a blast is introduced under the fire bars so as to burn the coke and
                    produce a large body of flame of reducing character owing to the admixture of
                    hydrocarbons from the coking process in the tower; the blast is heated by
                    passing through a chamber surrounded by the waste-gas flue; by regulating it the
                    atmosphere can be made more or less reducing at pleasure. The saving of fuel
                    effected is said to amount to about one-third of that which would be required in
                    an ordinary puddling furnace, whilst when arranged as a reheating furnace a
                    still greater saving is produced.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Utilization of Waste Heat.—</hi> In all iron works the amount
                    of heat escaping from the puddling and reheating furnaces (except when
                    regenerative) is enormously in excess of the amount actually utilized; to
                    economize this waste heat to some extent, it is usual to employ the exit gases
                    for raising steam, or for heating the air blast, or both. The actual amount of
                    fuel employed in the operations of puddling and reheating (apart from that
                    corresponding to the motive power) varies within wide limits according to the
                    quality of the pig iron used in the first instance and the mode of operating
                    adopted. When the coke refinery is employed a consumption of coke to the extent
                    of 15 to 30 per cent, of the weight of the pig iron used usually suffices to
                    produce a refined metal, which is then convertible into puddle bar with an
                    expenditure of coal about equal to or somewhat exceeding that of the puddle bar
                    made; where particular manipulation requiring the working of only small batches
                    at a time is practised, <hi rend="italic">e.g.,</hi> in some of the West
                    Yorkshire iron-works, the consumption of fuel is often much larger, amounting in
                    some cases to nearly double the weight of pig iron treated originally. In the
                    ordinary pig boiling process, according to the purity of the metal, something
                    between 100 and 150 parts of coal per 100 of puddle bar, and sometimes even
                    more, are usually requisite, but considerably smaller amounts are said to be
                    used with some of the more recently invented kinds of furnaces. Analogous <pb

                    other fuel is employed, due allowance being made for its different calorific
                    power. For reheating furnaces in which coal is burnt, the consumption of fuel is
                    usually in excess of 50 per cent, of the metal ultimately rolled for each time
                    it is reheated. The yield of puddle bars from a given quantity· of pig varies
                    somewhat with the quality: in spite of some of the iron oxide of the fettling
                    being reduced, the weight of malleable iron (cinder being deducted) finally
                    obtained in hand furnaces is always somewhat less than that contained in the pig
                    iron used; the latter averaging say 94 or 95 per cent, of iron, the yield of
                    puddle bar may be said to run from 88 to 92, averaging about 90 per cent. Before
                    an ordinary class of iron ore is converted into gocd bar iron there is in
                    practice requisite a consumption of coal (or of its equivalent in coke, taking
                    say 3 parts of coke to represent 5 of coal) to about the following extent per
                    100 parts of malleable iron finally obtained, that is, when each operation is
                    conducted about as economically as is practicable on the large scale :—</p>

                <p>In reference to this last item the consumption of puddle bar varies much with
                    circumstances; a considerable fraction of the final iron is obtained in the form
                    of mill scale, which is not lost, being utilized in the puddling forge, or for
                    smelting, &amp;c.; the rest is obtained in the form of cuttings, “crop ends,”
                    and “scrap” of various kinds, often not very largely inferior in value to the
                    bar iron.</p>
                <p>26. <hi rend="italic">Puddled Steel and Natural Steel.—</hi> If in the operation
                    of converting pig iron into malleable iron by puddling in a reverberatory
                    furnace the process be stopped before the decarbonization is complete (the
                    temperature of the furnace being a little lower, so that the partial
                    solidification of the mass on decarbonization—“coming to nature”— takes place
                    more easily), the resulting metal is a more or less carbonized iron, which, when
                    prepared from pig free from any large quantity of sulphur and phosphorus, is
                    susceptible of many of the applications to which steel is put. Considerable
                    skill in manipulation is necessary in order to obtain anything at all
                    approaching to a uniform product, the tendency being towards the production of a
                    mass with lumps of soft wholly decarbonized iron, and sometimes of but little
                    decarbonized pig irregularly distributed through it. This is best overcome by
                    conducting the decarbonization more slowly and at a somewhat lower temperature
                    than is usually done in ordinary puddling, and using less fettling and a less
                    oxidizing atmosphere. A manganiferous pig is almost essential to the obtaining
                    of a good product, first because the oxidation of the manganese gives a more
                    fluid slag, and secondly because the small quantity retained by the product
                    decreases the injurious effects of sulphur, phosphorus, &amp;c., on the physical
                    properties of the metal.</p>
                <p>The manufacture of puddled steel in England is now but small, the Bessemer and
                    Siemens-Martin processes having largely superseded it. Occasionally, however,
                    substances apparently consisting of badly puddled iron, and possessing some
                    degree of hardening power, are sold under the name of steel; but, not having
                    been fused so as to give uniformity of composition, these products are incapable
                    of being ιιsed advantageously for purposes for which the elasticity and
                    capability of resisting wear and tear possessed by good steels are essential.
                    The want of a definite understanding as to whether the term ‘ ‘ steel” is
                    nowadays to be understood as implying that the product has been completely fused
                    (as maintained by some, see § 3) or not leads occasionally to disputes and
                    lawsuits, when inferior kinds of “puddled steel,” or badly decarbonized puddled
                    iron, are supplied under the terms of a contract which simply mentions “steel”
                    as the character of the metal to be supplied, without precisely stating its
                    nature, quality, or properties, or the mode of its production.</p>
                <p>On the Continent, puddled steels made from pig of pure qualities so far as
                    sulphur and phosphorus are concerned are more extensively employed. Schilling
                    has examined the relative rates at which carbon, silicon, phosphorus, and
                    sulphur are eliminated from the pig irons of Gittelde and Zorge in a charcoal
                    steel-puddling forge at Zorge (Hanover), obtaining the results given in the
                    following table:—</p>

                <p><hi rend="italic">Natural steel</hi> is to refined pig iron (§ 23) in the inverse
                    relation that puddled iron is to puddled steel: the last is derived from pig
                    iron by stopping the decarbonization at a stage before it is complete; the first
                    is obtained by carrying the refining process somewhat further than the stage
                    usually attained in the refinery. The forge or hearth used for natural steel
                    making is substantially like that employed for refining, a brasqued bottom of
                    charcoal dust being put on, and the pig iron melted down and gradually
                    decarbonized by the conjoined action of an inclined blast blowing downwards upon
                    it and of the cinder floating above it; if the decarbonization is carried too
                    far a little fresh pig is added to recarbonize the whole. The details of the
                    manipulation (upon the mode of performance of which the character of the
                    resulting product depends) vary in different localities; thus Tiinner describes
                    five distinct modifications practised in Siegen, Tyrol, Carinthia, and Styria;
                    save in these districts the manufacture of this class of steel is but small. The
                    bars ultimately formed from the blooms are usually hammered out by hand
                    entirely, and not machine rolled at all. For further details see Percy’s <hi

                    of steel making does not, strictly speaking, belong to the class of methods now
                    under discussion, being a combination-process consisting of two parts :—one the
                    Bessemer process proper, of which the essential feature is the conversion of
                    cast iron into wrought iron by the method (due to Bessemer) of forcing air
                    through the molten mass so as to burn out the carbon; the other (due to Mushet)
                    consisting of the conversion of the molten wrought iron thus obtained into steel
                    by mixing with it a suitable proportion of fused carbonized iron containing
                    manganese, in the form of spiegeleisen or ferro-manganese; this combination
                    process is discussed more fully in § 36.</p>

                <p>The decarbonizing and desiliconizing of iron by the action of an oxidizing
                    atmosphere is the essential feature of the processes of refining pig iron (§ 23)
                    and of making natural steel (§ 26); but prior to 1855 these processes had only
                    been applied to the partial purification and decarbonization of pig iron, the
                    air being blown <hi rend="italic">over</hi> the surface of the fused metal; and,
                    in consequence of the comparatively slow rate of oxidation of carbon and silicon
                    thus brought about, the use of fuel to melt the iron and to keep it in fusion
                    was essential.</p>
                <p>On September 15, 1855, an English patent was granted to Gilbert Martien of
                    Newark, New Jersey, U.S., for the purpose of partially purifying cast iron by
                    passing streams of air or steam “through and amongst the melted metal as it
                    flows from a blast furnace” or the remelting furnace, the object being
                    apparently, not to convert pig iron into wrought iron and to supersede the
                    puddling furnace, but simply to act as an adjunct to the refinery. Shortly
                    after, Parry made experiments at Ebbw Vale on a process substantially the same
                    as this. On October 17, 1855, Bessemer took out his first patent for “forcing
                    currents of air or of steam, or of air and steam, into and among the particles
                    of molten crude iron or of remelted pig or refined iron, until the metal so
                    treated is thereby rendered malleable and has acquired other properties common
                    to cast steel, and still retaining the fluid state of such metal, and pouring or
                    running the same into suitable moulds,”—i.e., for converting cast iron into cast
                    steel. A succession of patents for various improvements was taken out during the
                    next few months, in the course of which the use of steam was dropped, certain
                    particular appliances described, and the production of malleable iron as well as
                    steel claimed. It was speedily found, however, that the production of steel of
                    uniform quality from English pig irons was impracticable, owing to the
                    difficulty in stopping the blowing operation at exactly the right moment to
                    produce the desired degree of carbonization, and that the production of
                    malleable iron was equally an unsuccessful manufacturing operation, because if
                    the “blow” continued a little too long, the product was “burnt iron,” containing
                    oxide disseminated through it which rendered it brittle; whilst if the metal
                    were underblown it was hard and steely. Again, contrary to expectation in view
                    of the knownaction of the puddling process, the oxidation of the copper,
                    sulphur, and phosphorus contained in the pig iron was found to be so faintly
                    marked that practically the resulting “semi-steel” contained the whole of these
                    impurities originally present in the pig iron employed. Accordingly the value of
                    the new process, of which the highest expectations were at first formed, was
                    speedily found to be really but small, notwithstanding the various successive
                    improvements patented by the inventor during 1855 and 1856; towards the end of
                    the latter year, however, the difficulty was solved and the whole process
                    rendered practical and readily controllable by Mushet, who patented the
                    improvement in use to the present day of decarbonizing the iron by completely
                    blowing it, and then adding melted spiegeleisen in known quantity so as to
                    carbonize the total mass to any definite required extent, and also to introduce
                    manganese into the composition, thereby diminishing the injurious effects of
                    sulphur, phosphorus, &amp;c., on its physical qualities,—the character of the
                    metal being further regulated by choosing for the operation haematite pig, or
                    some other kind, containing only minute amounts of sulphur, copper, and
                    phosphorus. Mushet’s patent right, however, was allowed to lapse through neglect
                    to pay the requisite fees in the third year; and in consequence his name is all
                    but forgotten in connexion with his improvement on Bessemer’s own process, the
                    combination being ordinarily termed “Bessemerizing.” Details as to the practical
                    working of the combination process are given in § 36.</p>
                <p>It is to be here remarked in connexion with the Bessemer process proper (the
                    blowing) that, whilst the difficulties in the way of preparing uniform products
                    with English irons have led to the entire abandonment of the production of iron
                    or steel thereby in England, the method is still in use to some extent in
                    Sweden, at Seraing, and elsewhere, the proper moment when the blow should cease
                    being determined by rapidly sampling and testing the metal, or by the colour of
                    the slag. In Sweden the charges of metal blown at one operation are occasionally
                    much smaller than those usually employed elsewhere where the combination-process
                    is adopted, whilst the converters in use are sometimes of the fixed pattern
                    adopted by Bessemer in his earlier experiments, now mostly superseded for the
                    spiegeleisen process by the movable converters swinging on trunnions described
                    in § 36; in the newer Bessemer works, however, the most improved methods and
                    arrangements are in use.</p>
                <p>In the John Cockerill Works (Seraing) it has been found practicable to ensure the
                    continuous production of pig in the blast furnaces of sensibly constant
                    composition, Algerian and Spanish ores being employed. From these, pig of the
                    annexed composition is smelted and ran direct into the converters without
                    solidifying; 23 '5 parts of limestone per 100 of ore are employed together with
                    coke (containing 8 to 10 per cent, of ash) in the proportion of 22 cwts. per ton
                    of pig.</p>

                <p>Owing to the considerable amount of manganese present in the pig, sufficient of
                    that metal remains unoxidized in the blown product to render it unnecessary to

                <p>As regards the general character of the blowing operation, it is noticeable that
                    the generation of heat by the oxidation of silicon and carbon is so large that
                    without the use of any fuel at all the metal is not only kept melted but
                    increases considerably in temperature, so that it remains fluid whilst the
                    decarbonization goes on, instead of becoming pasty and almost solid as it does
                    in the puddling forge when “coming to nature.” The nature of the gaseous
                    products on blowing a considerable mass of metal, say 5 tons, is somewhat
                    different during the different stages of the process. At first when the metal is
                    at a relatively lower temperature, a considerable amount of carbon dioxide is
                    formed, together with carbon oxide, but later on, when the temperature is much
                    higher, little but carbon oxide is produced. During the early stages, moreover,
                    the amount of oxygen (combined as oxides of carbon) is much less relatively to
                    the nitrogen than in ordinary air, showing that much of the silicon and
                    manganese present are being oxidized; whilst in the latter half of the blow,
                    when the silicon and manganese have largely become oxidized, the amount of
                    oxygen in the issuing gases is much larger, nearly equal to that present in air.

                <p>From these analyses Snelus calculates that 43 per cent, of the total carbon
                    oxidized in this blow was converted into CO <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi>, and 57
                    percent. into CO. It hence results that a considerable development of heat
                    attends the operation, especially with irons moderately rich in silicon’as well
                    as carbon. Taking the heat of combustion of caτbon to CO as 2400, of carbon to
                    CO <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> as 8000 (§ 20), and of silicon to SiO <hi

                <p>or an evolution of 300 <hi rend="italic">'2 per</hi> unit weight of metal blown.
                    Analogous but somewhat different values are calculable with irons of different
                    composition, or with blows so conducted that less carbon dioxide is formed. The
                    mean specific heat of the resulting fused metal and slag is probably somewhere
                    near to 0 '20 (at the ordinary temperature the specific heat of iron is 0 <hi
                    rend="superscript"> ,</hi> 1138, Regnault; the specific heat is probably greater
                    as the temperature rises, and, judging by analogy with water, greater in the
                    fluid state than in the solid; the specific heat of the slag at the ordinary
                    temperature is higher than that of iron, but its mass is much less); hence,
                    pursuing the above calculation, the heat evolution would suffice to raise the
                    temperature of</p>
                <p>300’2</p>
                <p>the metal -θy=about 1500° C. above its initial temperature, were all the heat
                    applied to that purpose. This is not the case, however, for the containing
                    vessel or converter has also to be heated up, and the waste gases carry off a
                    notable amount of heat with them, whilst radiation and the cooling effects of
                    the air on the converter also take up a considerable fraction of the heat; on
                    the other hand, however, a certain amount of iron becomes oxidized, thus
                    increasing the heat development; if 5 per cent, of metal be thus oxidized, the
                    heat of oxidation being taken as somewhere near to 1200 per unit of weight of
                    metal oxidized, the heat evolution due to this will be <hi rend="subscript">
                    τ</hi> ⅞ <hi rend="subscript"> 7</hi> × 1200 = 60'0, or about ⅜ of that due to
                    the joint oxidation of the carbon and silicon. Similarly manganese, if present,
                    becomes oxidized with evolution of heat; on the whole it is calculated by
                    Jordan, Âkermann, Snelus, and others who have specially examined this subject,
                    that with the kinds of pig iron usually employed at the present day, and with
                    the size of converters used (holding 5 tons and upwards of metal), the net
                    amount of heat actually employed in heating up the metal is sufficient to raise
                    its temperature by at least 600°; so that if the initial temperature of the
                    fused pig is about 1400°, that of the blown metal is at least 2000°, being above
                    the melting point of platinum; with highly silicious pig the temperature
                    attained is notably higher than with metal containing less silicon.</p>
                <p>When the blowing has gone on for a short period, so that the iron has become
                    perceptibly raised above its initial temperature, a reaction commences between
                    the iron oxide or silicate already formed and the as yet unoxidized carbon,
                    giving rise to the evolution of gas with a sort of effervescence; this stage is
                    technically termed the “boil.” The precise period at which it is marked varies
                    with circumstances, a longer time elapsing from the commencement of the blow
                    when the iron is relatively cooler at first, and also when it is richer in
                    silicon,—in the former case because the temperature requisite to produce the
                    effervescent action is not reached until a longer time has elapsed, and in the
                    second because the more oxidizable silicon is chiefly affected first, and the
                    effervescent action of iron oxide, &lt;tc., on the dissolved carbon only
                    commences when the silicon is to a considerable extent oxidized.<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>In all probability the reason
                    why the silicon is first affected is simply because more heat is evolved in the
                    formation of silicon dioxide than of carbon oxide, so that if carbon were burnt
                    to carbon oxide silicon would probably react upon it, thus—</p><p>2CO + Si = 2C
                    + SiO,</p><p>Since the heat of combustion of a unit of weight of carbon to CO is
                    about 2400, afid that of silicon to SiO7800, the transformation 9 V Ί 2 y 240∩
                    indicated by the above equation would evolve 7800 ————</p><p>28</p><p>= 5743
                    units of heat per unit of weight of silicon,—a tolerably high value, indicating
                    a considerably strong tendency towards the occurrence of this
                    transformation.</p></note> During the earlier part of the boil, whilst the
                    silicon and manganese still present are being oxidized, a greyish or whitish
                    kind·of smoke issues from the converter, consisting of minute particles of slag,
                    manganese oxide, &lt;fcc., mechanically diffused through the gases. When
                    practically all the silicon, carbon, and manganese have been oxidized, and the
                    oxidizing action of the blast is concentrated on the iron, the colour of the
                    smoke emitted changes to brown, and the iron becomes “burnt” or “overblown”; if
                    to such metal containing much iron oxide diffused throughout it molten
                    spiegeleisen be added, as in the after part of the Bessemer-Mushet process (§
                    36), the effervescence or “boil” due to the reaction of this iron oxide on the
                    carbon of the spiegeleisen takes place with almost explosive violence.</p>

                <p>Analogous figures have been obtained by various other observers; the results as a
                    whole show that during the first few minutes of the blow the silicon and
                    manganese mainly are oxidized, raising the temperature; during this period the
                    carbon is also being oxidized, but not so rapidly as during the next interval
                    whilst the boil is proceeding, a result also indicated by the analyses of the
                    gases evolved <hi rend="italic">(supra).</hi> The oxidation of the silicon,
                    however, may not be complete even when the whole of the carbon has been burnt
                    out, especially if highly silicious pig was used in the first instance; thus
                    steels containing 0 ’ 5 and upwards of unoxidized silicon have been found to be
                    formed; when excessively soft steel is required, so that but little spiegeleisen
                    (or preferably ferro-manganese) is added to the blown metal, the presence of
                    this silicon is not only not injurious, but is desirable as it diminishes
                    “honeycombing”; but with ordinary “Bessemer steel” containing several tenths per
                    cent, of carbon, the presence of this amount of silicon is almost fatal to its
                    value, silicon <hi rend="italic">conjointly with carbon</hi> producing
                    brittleness to a marked extent. Accordingly it is of importance to blend a
                    highly silicious pig with another kind containing less silicon, or to add to the
                    highly silicious pig crop ends and scrap metal, so as to avoid the presence of
                    too much silicon in the steel ultimately produced; this intermixture when
                    judiciously performed also avoids certain practical difficulties attending the
                    use of pig containing too high or too low an amount of oxidizable matter other
                    than iron; in the former case the temperature attained during the blow is
                    excessive, so that on casting the final steel (after adding spiegeleisen, see §
                    36) in iron moulds these are partly fused and destroyed; in the former case the
                    temperature attained is not high enough to keep the metal fluid whilst pouring
                    into the moulds, in which case it more or less solidifies in the casting ladle,
                    forming a “skull,” whilst the slag partially solidifies in the converter and
                    gradually chokes it. In practice it is usually found desirable to have not less
                    than 2 and not more than 3 per cent, of silicon in the metal before blowing, so
                    as to avoid these difficulties; when the pig is melted in a cupola there is
                    always a liability to loss of silicon and carbon during the fusion through
                    oxidation, thus impoverishing the iron in combustible matter and risking the
                    formation of skulls, owing to the metal not becoming hot enough during the
                    blowing to remain fluid whilst casting; on the other hand, when the metal is run
                    in from the blast furnace direct (by means of an intermediate ladle) there is a
                    liability to variation from time to time in the quality of the pig; this
                    difficulty can be overcome by carefully regulating the working of the furnace.
                    Durfee has proposed to tap the blast furnace into large gas-fired heaters in
                    which the metal is kept melted for a sufficiently long time to determine its
                    character<pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit13newyrich/page/n350/mode/1up"

                    case may be being then added to give the requisite composition.</p>
                <p>According to Stead the rate at which silicon is oxidized in the converter
                    relatively to carbon is somewhat different according as the temperature attained
                    is extremely high or comparatively low. In the latter case the silicon is wholly
                    eliminated before the carbon disappears, even when the original amount was
                    large, say 3 per cent, silicon and 3 ’ 5 of carbon; in the former case, however,
                    the relative rate of oxidation of the silicon is less rapid, so that the carbon
                    becomes oxidized before the last traces of silicon have disappeared. Thus the
                    curves illustrated in fig. 53 indicate the percentages of carbon and silicon
                    contained in the metal in different stages of the blowing, the dotted lines
                    representing the former and the continuous lines the latter, the abscissae
                    representing times and the ordinates percentages. Just at first the carbon
                    percentage slightly increases owing to oxidation of metal and silicon and their
                    removal as slag; but by and by the rate of carbon removal becomes rapid, whilst
                    the rate of silicon removal is a maximum at first and gradually diminishes, more
                    rapidly at the higher temperature.</p>
                <p>Attempts have been frequently made to use the spectroscope as a means of
                    determining the moment when the last portions of silicon and carbon have become
                    oxidized; but it is very doubtful whether the indications of the character of
                    the flame as seen by the unaided eye are not as a general rule practically at
                    least equally valuable with those of the spectroscope, and much more readily
                    attainable. At any rate, the spectroscope is but little used in actual
                    manufacturing practice in England; on the Continent, however, its use is
                    somewhat more frequent.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"

                    ores) the instrument is all but useless. With certain kinds of pig the progress
                    of the decarbonization can be readily judged by the colour of the slag; the
                    peculiar roar of the blast alters slightly in character when the decarbonization
                    is complete, so that an experienced hand can judge by the sound alone when the
                    operation is about finished. For details of apparatus, &lt;fcc., see § 36.</p>
                <p>The slag formed during the blowing usually approximates in composition to the

                    this respect differing from the tap cinder of the ordinary puddling forge, which
                    is much more basic. This arises from the highly silicious nature of the lining
                    of the converter (see § 36).</p>
                <p>It has been proposed by Snelus to utilize the gases discharged from the
                    converter, especially during the latter half or so of the blow, in the same way
                    that blast furnace gases (which they closely resemble in general composition, §
                    18) are utilized; the practical difficulties are, however, considerably greater
                    than in the case of the blast furnace, chiefly on account of the much higher
                    temperature of the converter gases and the intermittent character of their
                    generation during a series of blows; but stoves for heating the blast for the
                    cupolas used in melting the spiegeleisen, &amp;c., have been successfully heated
                    in this way, the flame being applied in much the same way as that obtained from
                    blast furnace gases. For the description of a method used for this purpose in
                    Sheffield, see a paper by C. B. Holland, <hi rend="italic">Journal I. and S.

                    closely allied to that of Bessemer’s, the oxidizing gases used to decarbonize
                    the pig iron being blown <hi rend="italic">through</hi> the fused mass so as to
                    produce either a semi-steel, a harder steel, or something approaching malleable
                    iron, according to the amount of carbon oxidation effected,—the gases employed
                    being, not ordinary air, but the mixture of nitrogen, nitrogen oxides,
                    and.oxygen evolved by the action of heat upon sodium nitrate. This salt is
                    packed at the bottom of the converting vessel (usually a vertical cylinder of
                    iron lined with firebrick) to the extent of about 10 per cent, of the weight of
                    the pig to be treated, and covered over with a perforated cast iron plate; the
                    pig, previously melted in a separate furnace, is run into the converter; the
                    heat melts the sodium nitrate and causes an evolution of gas, at first
                    comparatively slow, but gradually increasing in violence as the perforated iron
                    plate melts, until a rapid ebullition of the whole mass takes place; after a few
                    minutes the reaction is over; the partly decarbonized fluid mass is then run
                    into ingot moulds (if the mass operated upon is sufficiently large to render the
                    product fluid enough) or otherwise removed from the converter, conveniently by
                    detaching the bottom portion, which is made removable purposely; the masses of
                    “crude steel” are then reheated and rolled, or melted in crucibles, so as to
                    produce either bar or crucible steel as required.</p>
                <p>Unlike the Bessemer process, Heaton’s method brings about a sensible diminution
                    in the quantity of phosphorus present. In all probability this is due to the
                    alkalinity of the cinder owing to the soda from the nitrate, this acting like
                    the lime lining to the converter in Thomas and Gilchrist’s modification of the
                    Bessemer process (§ 37); it is evident, however, that the character of the
                    resulting product depends on the uniformity of the pig iron used, and the amount
                    of nitrate of soda employed. The practical difficulties in the way of carrying
                    out the process on the large scale, and of securing uniformity of product, and
                    the non-entire removal of phosphorus, have prevented this method from seriously
                    competing with the other leading steel-making processes; but a number of
                    experimental trials made on a moderately large scale have demonstrated the
                    possibility of obtaining a good class of useful steel by its means. According to
                    Griiner the elimination of phosphorus becomes almost imperceptible if the cinder
                    formed contains upwards of 30 per cent, of silica produced by the oxidation of
                    the silicon in the pig.</p>

                    as being a typical development of the earliest crude apparatus for extracting
                    iron from its ores, represented in almost its simplest form by the rough clay
                    furnace used for the first stage of wootz making (§ 35), and by the analogous
                    small furnaces in use in Burmah, Madagascar, Borneo, &amp;c.; with various
                    modifications it is still in use in different localities, e.y., the Pyrenees,
                    Corsica, and especially in some parts of America and Canada. In principle all
                    these forges may be considered as a more or less enlarged blacksmith’s or

                    fuel; the blast being applied, partly by the direct action of the ctrbon, partly
                    by the carbon oxide generated, the iron <hi rend="superscript"> -</hi> ore is
                    gradually reduced to a spongy mass of metal which by stirring is gradually
                    agglutinated into a ball which is removed and worked into bars, &amp;c. The
                    Pyrenean forge essentially consists of a silicious stone bottom (covered over
                    with a “brasque”of charcoal powder rammed down), with a tuyere inclining
                    downwards, as indicated in fig. 54; the front part of the forge is filled up
                    with the ore to be reduced, and the hinder part with charcoal, and the whole
                    coated over with a layer of moist mixed fine ore and charcoal dust <hi
                    rend="italic">(greillade)</hi> to moderate the combustion. A gentle blast is at
                    first applied, and the formation of flame channels throughout the mass avoided
                    by putting on more <hi rend="italic">greillade</hi> wherever any flame of
                    magnitude appears on the surface:</p>
                <p>in this way the ore gets largely reduced to spongy metal by the carbon oxide; a
                    portion is only reduced to ferrous oxide, and this unites with the silicious
                    gangue, forming a fusible cinder which, bathing the mass of spongy metal,
                    prevents its becoming highly carbonized; finally, the blast being increased and
                    the whole contents of the hearth being gradually stirred together, the reduced
                    metal becomes agglomerated into spongy masses. According to the way in which the
                    materials are manipulated, the resulting iron is more or less steely in
                    character: a slow and prolonged reduction facilitates the carbonization of the
                    metal, yielding a product containing 0 ’ 5 per cent, of carbon and upwards; a
                    more rapid blast, and one impinging more directly on the bath of melted cinder
                    and spongy metal at the base of the hearth, produces a softer and far less
                    carbonized iron. Even after well working under the hammer until fibrous in
                    texture, the bars produced are apt to be non-homogeneous, steely portions being
                    irregularly interspersed. Owing to the non-addition of flux, a great waste of
                    metal is produced by the formation of cinder containing usually some 30 per
                    cent, and more of iron as silicate; the exact amount of loss of course varies
                    with the ore employed, being less the purer the ore and the more open its
                    texture, so that reduction takes place more readily; for this reason brown
                    haematites of not too compact texture are the ores preferably worked by the
                    Catalan forge, the expulsion of water on first heating leaving the residual
                    oxide in a condition in which it is more readily attacked by the reducing agents
                    than is the case with nearly anhydrous compact red haematites, &amp;c.</p>
                <p>In various places where the Romans smelted or reduced iron from different kinds
                    of ore by processes substantially the same as this, large accumulations of
                    highly ferruginous cinders exist, <hi rend="italic">e.g.,</hi> in the Forest of
                    Dean, Elba, Spain, &amp;c.; many of these contain sufficient iron to be capable
                    of being profitably smelted in the blast furnace either alone or admixed with
                    other ores, being frequently quite as rich as average Cleveland clay ironstone
                    after roasting; they usually approximate in composition to the orthosilicate

                <p>The Catalan forges of the south of Europe are usually of such dimensions as hold
                    from 3 to 10 cwts. of ore; those formerly in use in Austria, and to some extent
                    still in America <hi rend="italic">(β.g.,</hi> the Champlain forge), have the
                    blast heated to a greater or lesser extent by the waste flames from the forge,
                    which are made to heat a serpentine through which the blast is blown, thereby
                    causing a considerable saving in the amount of charcoal required, sometimes
                    amounting to about 20 per cent, of the quantity requisite with cold blast when
                    the blast temperature averages about 300° (Sterry Hunt). The titaniferous iron
                    sand smelted at Moisie in similar forges is much less easily reducible than most
                    other ores, and consequently consumes a much larger amount of fuel in
                    proportion; owing to the almost complete absence of sulphur and phosphorus, a
                    very fine quality of iron can be produced therefrom. The American bloom- -ery
                    processes, whilst resembling in general principles the old European Catalan
                    forge methods, differ considerably therefrom in working details, mode of
                    construction of hearth, dimensions, &amp;c. An account of them and the ores

                    to the metallic state by carbon and carbon oxide, it has been attempted by many
                    inventors to effect this reduction on a larger scale and in separate apparatus,
                    the spongy metal thus obtained being employed either to form malleable iron by
                    heating to a welding heat and hammering, &amp;c., or to produce steel by fusion
                    in crucibles with carbonaceous matter or intermixture with fused cast iron (free
                    from any considerable quantity of sulphur and phosphorus) so as to reduce the
                    percentage of carbon to any required limits in proportion as more or less spongy
                    non-carbonized metal is employed. This latter application comes rather into the
                    category of processes described later on (§ 36 <hi rend="italic">et</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">seq.)</hi> than into the class at present under discussion; its
                    employment has met with some considerable degree of success in one form or
                    another,—which can hardly be said of the former methods of working up the spongy
                    metal, at least from a commercial point of view.</p>
                <p>Some of the earliest experiments in this direction were made about 1837 and 1840
                    by Clay,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>For details of

                    whilst since then and even quite recently several attempts have been made to
                    prepare either iron or steel by operations substantially of the same description
                    by Gurllt, Larkin (who reduces very pure fine magnetic ore by heating with
                    charcoal powder, separates the spongy metal by a magnet, and fuses it with
                    spiegeleisen in crucibles), Renton (of Cincinnati and Newark), Henderson (of
                    Glasgow), Yates, and Snelus, who utilizes the “Gherstonofer” furnace used for
                    burning pyrites smalls in vitriol making, substituting powdered iron ore for the
                    pyrites, and a reducing atmosphere for the hot air employed to oxidize the
                    pyrites and burn off the sulphur. Moderately large scale experimental trials in
                    this direction have been made by Chenot, and subsequently by Siemens and by
                    Blair of Pittsburg. Chenot’s reducing furnace was essentially a series of
                    vertical conical retorts heated externally, the ore (Bilbao, Sommorostro, or
                    other ores containing but little sulphur and phosphorus) being either mixed with
                    carbonaceous matter and the mixture heated in the retorts, or else being placed
                    therein alone whilst a mixture of carbon oxide and nitrogen (prepared by blowing
                    air through incandescent charcoal) was passed through them; from time to time
                    the reduced spongy metal was drawn off at the base of the retorts into covered
                    iron boxes, so as to prevent reoxidation as much as possible, and then heated in
                    a charcoal hearth and made into a ball when pasty. It is mainly in this last
                    stage that the practical difficulties of the process are encountered: if the
                    sponge be not powerfully compressed into comparatively solid blocks, an enormous
                    waste by oxidation during the balling is produced; in any case, as it is
                    practically impossible to continue the reduction of the ore in the first stage
                    sufficiently long to remove all oxygen from it (the time requisite and the cost
                    of fuel being then excessive), a great waste of iron ensues. These difficulties
                    have hitherto proved fatal to the commercial success of the process; but it has
                    been shown conclusively that a very good iron may be produced by its means,
                    provided sufficiently pure ore be used.</p>
                <p>The same causes of failure for the most part apply to the earlier methods of
                    Clay, and the subsequent ones of Gurllt, Renton, Yates, Snelus, and Blair, which
                    in principle are all much the same, the nature of the apparatus employed in
                    producing the spongy iron being the main difference in the various processes
                    respectively. Chenot’s attempts to produce steel from the reduced spongy iron
                    answered no better, commercially speaking, than the malleable iron manufacture
                    from that source; the sponge was simply compressed into small blocks after being
                    mixed with charcoal powder, or after being moistened with melted resin, tar, or
                    fatty matters, and heated to char the organic matters, and then melted up in
                    crucibles. The <pb break="no"

                    of carbonization, the cost, and the impurity of the resulting steel (unless
                    excessively pure ores were used) rendered the process practically a failure.
                    Fig. 55 indicates the apparatus used by Blair for the production of spongy iron.
                    A is the reducing chamber into which the ore is placed along with about 5 per
                    cent, of lime, which is found to accelerate the reduction considerably, so that
                    a charge can be worked off in about a fifth of the time that would otherwise be
                    requisite. Through this chamber a current of carbon oxide and nitrogen is led,
                    produced in the gas generator B; ore and fuel are supplied from time to time
                    through the respective hoppers <hi rend="italic">g, g.</hi> The escaping gases
                    pass away through the flue <hi rend="italic">deh,</hi> a valve <hi rend="italic"
                    >f</hi> being applied so that part of the gas can be passed back again through
                    the producer so as to keep the action from going on too quickly. From time to
                    time tho reduced metal is withdrawn by the slide <hi rend="italic">n</hi> from
                    the cooling-box <hi rend="italic">kk,</hi> which is surrounded by a water jacket
                    to facilitate the cooling of the spongy iron.</p>
                <p>Siemens has attempted to apply a modification of the spongy iron process to the
                    manufacture of steel, the spongy metal from a mixture of ore and carbonaceous
                    matter heated in a revolving furnace being dropped into a bath of melted pig
                    metal; this method, however, was found to give unsatisfactory results, first
                    because the spongy iron would not readily dissolve in the molten pig but floated
                    on its surface, and secondly because sulphur was taken up by it from the gases
                    during its reduction; accordingly the precipitation method described below was
                    adopted in its place.</p>
                <p>Dupuy has recently proposed a direct process worked as follows: the ore to be
                    reduced is mixed with carbon, and the mixture placed in £in annular vertical
                    cylinder of sheet iron some 3 feet high, the outer diameter of the cylinder
                    being about 20 inches, and the inner diameter 7 or 8 inches; a number of these
                    masses are arranged on the coke floor of a reverberatory furnace; after heating
                    for some hours the reduced metal and the sheet iron coatings cako together so
                    that the masses can be removed and hammered and squeezed to muck bar, cut up,
                    piled, and reheated and rolled into plates, bars, &amp;c.; or they may be fused
                    down on the open hearth into steel. It is claimed that by this treatment the
                    metal takes up not more than one-fourth of the phosphorus contained in the ore
                    instead of practically the whole as when smelted in the blast furnace; thus the
                    ore of the Republic Mine of the Lake Superior district and the metal made from
                    it by Dupuy’s process gave the following numbers (Dupuy, <hi rend="italic"

                <p>The inventor considers that the phosphorus compounds do not become largely
                    reduced in the process owing to the incomplete fusion of the metal during the
                    reduction, the phosphates remaining blended with the cinder; as he states that
                    the process works much better when alkalies, in quantity and kind determined by
                    analysis of the ore, are added to the mixture before reduction, presumably the
                    non-reduction of phosphorus is due to the “basic” nature of the cinder.</p>
                <p>31. <hi rend="italic">Siemens Precipitation Process.—</hi> About the most
                    successful of the methods for producing iron or steel direct from the ore at one
                    operation is that designated by Siemens the “precipitation process” <hi
                    rend="italic">(fjhem. Soc. Journal,</hi> 1873, p. 661); although it is doubtful
                    whether this can yet be said to have completely emerged from the conditions of
                    experimental trial as to the best conditions for competing with other methods in
                    regard of cheapness of production, yet its practical success is demonstrated by
                    its having been worked commercially not only in England but also in America. The
                    principle of the process is essentially the fusion by means of an intensely
                    heated “regenerative” furnace of the ore to be reduced with a suitable flux
                    (lime, aluminous ore, &lt;fcc.), and the reaction upon the fused substance of
                    heated anthracite or hard coke forming the covering of a lower bed in the
                    furnace (fig. 56), onto which the fused ore is allowed to flow from the upper
                    bed. Under these circumstances the solid carbon <hi rend="italic"
                    >precipitates</hi> iron from the fluid in the same way that iron precipitates
                    copper from copper sulphate solution (saving that in the latter case no gases
                    are evolved as complementary products); the iron agglutinates together into a
                    pasty ball immersed in a fluid bath of cinder; when the operation is
                    sufficiently advanced the ball is removed and shingled into blooms or made into
                    steel by dropping it into a mass of fused pig iron, in which it rapidly
                    dissolves. The cjnder thus produced contains much iron,—usually at least 15 per
                    cent., and sometimes upwards of 40 per cent In an improved form of process, the
                    double bed is dispensed with and a rotary furnace substituted(figs. 57,58), much
                    resembling Siemens’s puddling furnace, save that the combustion chamber is
                    rotative; the ore and flux are introduced and melted; small coal of the size of
                    nuts is then shovelled in, when a rapid evolution of carbon oxide results, so
                    that it is unnecessary to introduce more than a little gas from the gas
                    regenerative heater, but mainly only heated air to burn the evolved carbon
                    oxide; when the reduction is nearly complete, the fluid cinder is drawn off and
                    the spongy metal balled by quick rotation for a short time. In this way,
                    according to Siemens, a ton of iron may be reduced with <pb break="no"

                    and a ton of cast steel made with about 40 cwts. of coal; whilst even though the
                    ore and fuel may contain considerable amounts of sulphur and phosphorus, the
                    “precipitated” iron is almost chemically pure. The temperature requisite in this
                    process being excessive, the bricks of which the furnace is con structed must be
                    of the most infusible material possible; a particular kind of silica brick
                    consisting of crushed quartz and about 2 per cent, of lime mixed together and
                    moulded into bricks answers better than alumina (bauxite) bricks.</p>

                <p>In order to reduce ferric oxide to metal, the heat consumption perunit weight of

                    by one part of slag by weight, and the cinder to amount to 50 per cent of the

                    utilized, 75 per cent being wasted through incomplete combustion, gases leaving
                    at a higher temperature than 300°, and radiation, &amp;c., still reduction would
                    be accomplished by an expenditure of only 25 cwts. of coal per ton of iron. By a
                    somewhat different mode of calculation Siemens arrives at much the same result
                    <hi rend="italic">{Chem. Soc. Journal,</hi> 1873, p. 677), viz., that about 6
                    <hi rend="superscript"> -</hi> 4 cwts. of carbonaceous matter should
                    theoretically suffice to reduce a ton of iron in the precipitation furnace; and
                    hence that about 25 per cent of the heat actually capable of being generated is
                    actually utilized. This high “duty” (as compared with other operations of the
                    iron industry, especially with the blast and puddling furnaces conjointly)
                    arises from the circumstance that whilst the reaction is proceeding carbon oxide
                    is copiously evolved from the materials, and this is burnt in the furnace itself
                    by admitting air and very little other gas so as to keep up the temperature
                    almost without extraneous fuel; the carbon dioxide produced by the combustion,
                    being <hi rend="italic">above</hi> and not in contact with the reacting
                    substances, does not in any way interfere with their action, in which respect
                    the process of reduction in the precipitation furnace markedly differs from that

                            of highest quality is there described as being about 3 Ό parts per unit
                            of iron (60 cwts. per ton), of which quantity about one-third is
                            assigned to the rotator, the remainder being used in the reheating
                            furnaces.</p><p>Within the last twelvemonth Holley has communicated to
                            the American Institute of Mining Engineers the results obtained with a
                            large rotating furnace set up at Tyrone, Pennsylvania, to produce
                            material for open hearth steel furnaces by Siemens’s direct process. The
                            charges λvere-ore (containing about 50 per cent, of iron) 2000 lb;
                            reducing coal 600 to 700 lb; limestone 250 lb; scale and cinder 800 lb.
                            The yield of blooms was 1600 to 1700 lb per charge, or 80 to 85 per
                            cent, of the metal contained in the ore; nineteen operations per week
                            producing 14 tons of blooms were made, the producer coal being 3800 lb
                            per ton of blooms. The total coal consumption was thus on an average
                            near to 4600 lb per ton.</p><p><hi rend="italic">Jones’s Process.—</hi>
                            A peculiar process, in principle somewhat analogous to the Siemens
                            precipitation method, has been proposed by F. F. Jones <hi rend="italic"
                            >(Joum. I. and S. Inst.,</hi> 1873, 251), consisting of à cupola furnace
                            into which ironstone slag and coke or other fuel is charged, an air
                            blast being applied so as to melt the ores by the heat developed by the
                            combustion of the fuel; another blast is then turned on through a second
                            set of tuyeres directed downwards obliquely towards the bottom of the
                            hearth, the jet of gas thus introduced being the mixture of carbon oxide
                            and nitrogen produced by blowing air through a second cupola full of
                            coke only after the fashion of the Tessié du Motay gas producer (§ 10);
                            by this means rapid reduction of the iron oxide is brought about, the
                            process being a sort of inverted Bessemer blow, oxygen from fused oxide
                            being burnt out by a stream of carbon oxide instead of carbon being
                            burnt out from fused cast iron by a stream of air. Carbon is taken up by
                            the metal thus produced to the extent of several tenths per cent., but
                            it is remarkable that silicon is not thus reduced. Phosphorus is largely
                            present in the resulting metal if contained in the materials
                            used.</p><p>VII. Conversion of Malleable Iron into Steel by direct
                            Carbonization.</p><p>32. <hi rend="italic">Cementation Process.—</hi> It
                            has been known for a long period, some two centuries at least, that when
                            wrought iron is enveloped in powdered charcoal and heated to redness for
                            a long time it gradually becomes carbonized and converted into steel,
                            the deposition of carbon commencing at the outside and gradually
                            penetrating inwards in precisely the same way as that in which the
                            decarbonization of iron proceeds in the manufacture of malleable cast
                            iron (§ 22), a longer time being consequently requisite for the
                            carbonization of thicker than of thinner bars; the name of the inventor
                            of the process, however, has been forgotten. In the middle of the 16th
                            century it was known that when a bar of wrought iron was kept immersed
                            for a long time in molten cast iron it gradually became acierated by
                            taking up carbon from the cast iron; this process is clearly closely
                            allied to cementation in solid carbon, and was probably the forerunner
                            thereof; very likely it was in the first instance an accidental
                            observation; it was described as being in actual use about that period
                            by various writers, notably Biringuccio in 1540 and Agricola <hi

                <p>1561, p. 341). Early in the 18th century Réaumur investigated the character of
                    the process, and found that under similar conditions a bar of iron of 0 <hi
                    rend="superscript"> ,</hi> 2 inch in thickness was carbonized in six hours to
                    the same extent as another bar of the same metal of 0 ’ 45 inch in thickness in
                    about thirty-six hours. The crude “blister steel” produced by the cementation
                    process (so termed from its blistered surface) is often simply cut into pieces,
                    piled, heated to a welding heat, and forged, when it is converted into “shear
                    steel or this process is repeated, when it becomes “double shear steel but when
                    a perfectly homogeneous product is required it is melted in crucibles, when it
                    becomes “cast steel this process was introduced by Huntsmann about 1740. The
                    nature of the chemical changes taking place during cementation have been often
                    regarded as somewhat uncertain; but there seems to be little room for doubt that
                    the action in the ordinary cementation process is mainly due to the occlusion of
                    carbon oxide (formed by the action of the air in the pores of the charcoal) in
                    the iron, and its decomposition by the metal into carbon and an iron oxide,
                    which is subsequently again reduced by a second portion of carbon oxide,
                    thus—</p>

                    rend="italic">yCO2t</hi> the two changes going on simultaneously. The escaping
                    carbon dioxide, which penetrates through the metal less readily than does carbon
                    oxide, and hence is apt to accumulate in certain parts, is probably the cause of
                    the blistering of the surface of the steel often observed, especially with
                    puddled bars containing small quantities of ferrous silicate disseminated
                    through them; Percy has shown that fused homogeneous metal free from
                    interspersed slag does not give rise to blisters on cementation. Certain
                    hydrocarbons, <hi rend="italic">e.g.,</hi> paraffin vapour and coal gas, will
                    carbonize iron heated therein, and the manufacture of steel by cementation in
                    the latter has been patented by Macintosh <hi rend="italic">(vide infra).</hi>
                    Probably in these cases the carbon comes from the direct splitting up of the
                    hydrocarbon, with elimination of hydrogen; but possibly the acieration is due to
                    carbon oxide present in the coal gas or formed from the paraffin vapour,&amp;c.,
                    by the action of iron oxide disseminated through the bars or adherent to their
                    surface. Many cyanogen compounds, especially ferrocyanide of potassium, when
                    applied to iron in a heated state convert it exteriorly into steel (case
                    hardening), and it has in consequence been supposed that nitrogenous substances
                    are essential to the carbonization of iron by cementation, and that nitrogen is
                    an essential constituent of steel. The evidence in behalf of this is, however,
                    at present unsatisfactory·; on the other hand, charcoal rich in alkalies, or a
                    mixture of charcoal powder with a little lime and soda, will carbonize iron
                    submitted to cementation therein more rapidly than charcoal more free from
                    alkalies; and, as these conditions are those favourable to the formation of
                    alkaline cyanide from the nitrogen of the air, there is some reason for
                    supposing that the carbon in the steel formed under such circumstances (like
                    that produced in case hardening by means of ferrocyanide) is more or less
                    derived either from cyanogen separated from the cyanide and occluded by the iron
                    and gradually decomposed with formation of carbon, or from some other reaction
                    of iron upon the cyanide. Accordingly nitrogenous organic matter, such as animal
                    charcoal, leather, horn, &amp;c., is often mixed with the charcoal used for
                    cementation with a view to facilitating the conversion into steel by the
                    formation of gaseous carbon compounds with the simultaneous presence of
                    nitrogenous vapours.</p>
                <p>• The theory that carbon oxide is the source of the carbon com· municated to
                    wrought iron during cementation, appears to have been first propounded by Leplay
                    in 1846 <hi rend="italic">(Ann. deChim.</hi><hi rend="italic">et</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Phys,</hi> [3]xviL 221), at a time when the properties of metals
                    and other bodies in absorbing gases (i. <hi rend="italic">e.,</hi> the phenomena
                    of <hi rend="italic">occlusion)</hi> had not been so well studied as they have
                    been subsequently. Leplay appears to have considered that the carbon oxide
                    splits up <hi rend="italic">directly</hi> into carbon and carbon dioxide, the
                    latter becoming again transformed into carbon oxide by the surrounding charcoal,
                    and to have left out of consideration the intervention of the iron in becoming
                    alternately oxidized and reduced. Other chemists have considered that by direct
                    contact with carbon combination of the iron therewith takes place, the carbon
                    thus taken up by the outer layer quitting that and combining with the next
                    layer, and so gradually travelling inwards, the outer layer recombining with
                    more carbon as fast as it parts with carbon to the under layer, and so on
                    throughout; the carbon thus traversing the iron by a process somewhat akin to
                    that by which a drop of mercury in contact with a piece of gold (or certain
                    other metals) gradually passes into and permeates the mass,—this being in short
                    a kind of capillary action exerted upon a solid substance. Percy’s observation
                    <hi rend="italic">(Metallurgy,</hi> “Iron and Steel,” p. 109) that charcoal
                    after being intensely ignited will not carbonize iron when air is excluded by
                    means of hydrogen (although it will do so to some extent if still containing
                    matters capable of being driven off by heat) negatives the possibility of the
                    carbon being taken up <hi rend="italic">by direct contact</hi> by this
                    hypothetical kind of chemical union between solids, or solvent action of one
                    solid on another; it may be that carbon deposited on the outer layer by the
                    chemical action of the iron on carbon oxide, cyanogen compounds, carburetted
                    hydrogen, &amp;c., permeates inwards by this supposed diffusive process; but the
                    known phenomena of the absorption of gases by colloid bodies, diffusion,
                    dialysis, occlusion, &amp;c., as elucidated by Graham and his followers, render
                    it wholly unnecessary to suppose that any such action takes place, and do away
                    with all experimental grounds for supposing that it can take place. In order to
                    carry out the process of cementation, the bars of iron are placed in a firebrick
                    box or chest several feet long, layers of charcoal and iron being alternately
                    piled in until the box is filled, when a luting of fireclay or of the sandy
                    ferruginous mud produced in grinding and polishing steel articles after
                    manufacture, termed “wheel swarf,” is applied so as to close up the upper part
                    of the box and prevent access of air; two or more such chests are then arranged
                    under the arched roof of a chamber erected over a fireplace in such a way that
                    the flames from the fire pass under and lap round the sides of the chests, and
                    impinge upon the roof, the gases escaping through orifices in the roof into a
                    conical chimney built over the whole,—the chamber constituting in fact a kind of
                    furnace somewhat like a glass house or pottery kiln, the flame passing upwards
                    from the bed instead of laterally from a fireplace at the side as in the
                    ordinary reverberatory furnaces. Trial bars are arranged in the mass of charcoal
                    in such positions that they can be withdrawn from time to time, and the progress
                    of the operation examined by fracturing the bars after cooling, and seeing when
                    the core of malleable iron disappears; from seven to ten days’ heating according
                    to the amount of carbonization required (averaging about 1 per cent.) is
                    generally allowed, with a total charge of some 10 to 20 tons of iron in the
                    furnace. When the requisite carbonization is attained the fire is raked out and
                    the chests allowed to cool; the blister steel is then either melted down into
                    cast steel, or converted into shear steel by piling and forging, &amp;c.</p>
                <p>According to Boussingault a material diminution in the amount of sulphur present
                    takes place during cementation; thus he found malleable iron specimens
                    containing 0 <hi rend="superscript"> -</hi> 012 to 0Ό15 per cent, of sulphur
                    yielded steels containing only 0Ό05 to 0 ’ 006 per cent, of sulphur. Indications
                    in the same direction but not to so great an extent have also been observed by
                    others; no noticeable effect, however, is produced on the silicon, phosphorus,
                    or manganese originally present, as far as the irregular way in which traces of
                    cinder are always interspersed throughout bars of wrought iron will permit
                    conclusions to be drawn. The following analyses indicate the effect of
                    cementation on Swedish bar irons :—</p>

                <p>In consequence of the phosphorus originally present remaining unchanged, only the
                    purest brands of iron as free as possible from these ingredients are converted
                    into cementation steel, often known as “tool steel,” commanding a high price in
                    consequence of its physical properties, the most valuable of which are
                    enormously deteriorated by minute quantities of sulphur and phosphorus. The
                    process of cementation in an atmosphere of coal gas as patented by Macintosh of
                    Glasgow consists of exposure of the bars of iron hanging vertically in a
                    cylindrical chamber, the walls of which are kept <pb break="no"

                    surrounding it, a gentle stream of well-desulphurized coal gas being allowed to
                    pass through the chamber. The expense of the process seems to have been the
                    chief bar to its adoption, as steel of excellent quality can readily be made by
                    it from good malleable iron.</p>
                <p>33. <hi rend="italic">Cast Steel.—</hi> The crucibles or “pots” used for steel
                    melting are usually made of refractory fireclay, often with an admixture of
                    graphite, which not only communicates a greater degree of infusibility, but also
                    diminishes the decarbonization which partial access of air unavoidably brings
                    about during melting; they are of such size as to hold from 40 to 60 δ&gt; of
                    steel, and occasionally more, even up to nearly a cwt., especially in certain
                    American steel works. As a rule a pot that has served for three successive
                    meltings in a coke-fired furnace is so much damaged as to be unsafe for a
                    fourth; and with inferior kinds of clay two meltings or even one only are
                    allowed; with superior pots and gas-fired furnaces four, five, and even six
                    heats are attainable with ease and safety. After annealing, the crucibles are
                    heated red hot and then placed in the melting furnace on fireclay stands, round
                    which and the pots coke is piled, two pots being usually fixed in the same
                    “melting hole,” but sometimes more. When the pots are white hot the steel in
                    small lumps is introduced by lifting up the cover and pouring the pieces down a
                    long iron funnel; the covers being replaced and the fire made up, after some two
                    or three hours the steel is fluid; but if cast immediately it is found that a
                    much larger quantity of gas separates during solidification, rendering the steel
                    porous, than is evolved if the metal is <hi rend="italic">dead-melted,
                    i,e.,</hi> allowed to remain melted for an extra half hour or more, presumably
                    from the reaction of the iron oxide interspersed throughout the steel upon the
                    carbon evolving carbon oxide during the earlier period, this evolution
                    subsequently ceasing, owing partly to the reduction of the oxide and partly to
                    its floating up to the top of the fused mass as scoriae. According to Bessemer
                    the chief part of the “dead melting” effect of the extra time allowed in fusing
                    steel for the molten metal to stand in the furnace after fusion is brought about
                    is due to the reduction of a little silicon from the crucible materials,
                    &lt;fcc., the presence of that element greatly diminishing the tendency to
                    evolution of gas during solidification (see § 44). When the pots are withdrawn
                    and the casting made (frequently from the contents of many pots combined
                    together), they are replaced in the melting holes before they cool, and used
                    over again, a somewhat smaller quantity of metal being introduced for the second
                    melting (and less still for the third), in order to prevent the surface of the
                    fused scoria being at the same level as before, the pots being chiefly attacked
                    at that place. About 3 ’ 5 parts of coke are required for 1 of mild steel
                    melted, and somewhat less for harder steels, which melt more easily.</p>
                <p>The Siemens regenerative furnace (§ 10), fed with gas from a producer, can be
                    very advantageously employed instead of the older coal or coke-fired furnaces.
                    In such a steel melting furnace (fig. 59) the fusion chamber generally contains
                    some two dozen pots, and is constructed in the form of a trench with overhanging
                    sides, which are arched both horizontally and vertically to keep them from
                    sinking in whilst in use. The floor is covered with finely ground hard coke,
                    which burns away but slowly and does not flux or indurate, thus giving a firm
                    foundation for the pots, which are set in a double row along the centre of the
                    chamber; the upper roof of the chamber consists of firebrick tiles or frames
                    filled with firebrick capable of being slid off separately by means of levers or
                    handles attached to each, so as to permit of the introduction and withdrawal of
                    the pots. The inventors state that the lining of a furnace of this description
                    will last from fifteen to twenty weeks without repair, working day and night,
                    whilst four to five weeks is the ordinary life of a coke-fired fiιrnace; that
                    the pots will stand four, five, and sometimes even ten successive meltings
                    instead of two or three; and that, whilst 3 to 4 tons of hard coke are requisite
                    in coke-fired furnaces per ton of steel melted, 15 to 20 cwts. of much inferior
                    slack burnt in a gas producer will furnish enough fuel to melt a ton of steel on
                    the regenerative principle <hi rend="italic">(Chcm. Soc. Journal,</hi> 1868, p.
                    276). The precise amount of fuel used in actual practice is somewhat variable,

                    (the heat requisite for drying the pots being included). A good deal of the
                    saving in fuel is dependent on the character of the pots employed, the best
                    pots, which will stand several successive meltings, causing considerable
                    economy, in that the fuel requisite to heat up new pots (starting comparatively
                    cold) is saved, the fusion being effected in much less time, averaging from
                    two-thirds to three-fourths of that requisite for new pots. Various
                    modifications of the Siemens regenerative steel melting furnace have been
                    introduced by other inventors; thus the Swindell furnace has been used to a
                    considerable extent in America.</p>
                <p>34. <hi rend="italic">Case Hardening.—</hi> Thia operation is essentially the
                    reverse of that by which cast iron is converted into malleable iron (§ 22). In
                    the latter the carbon is gradually removed, the outer portion being first
                    affected; in the former carbon is added to the exterior layer of a malleable
                    iron article so as to give it great hardness, strength, and power of resisting
                    wear and tear by superficial conversion into steel. As applied to larger
                    articles in which the steely coating is required to be of more than just
                    perceptible thickness (0 ’ 1 to 0 <hi rend="superscript"> -</hi> 3 inch), the
                    operation is essentially that of cementation, the iron articles being packed in
                    an iron chest or box in charcoal reduced to very coarse powder (burnt or charred
                    leather, hoofs, bones, &lt;fcc., answering best), and then heated to a red heat
                    for a sufficient length of time (some four to six hours for a coating of steel
                    of 0 ’ 1 inch or so in thickness) either judged by past experience or by
                    withdrawing trial pieces from time to time, and breaking them so as to ascertain
                    to what depth the acieration has proceeded. When this is effected the chest is
                    withdrawn from the oven or furnace and the articles chilled by taking them out
                    whilst still hot and quenching in water or oil, &amp;C., so as to harden the
                    exterior coating. Since the steel exterior is thus rendered too hard for working
                    with ordinary tools, the articles to be treated must be as far as possible
                    finished before case hardening, so as only to require cleaning and polishing
                    subsequently.</p>
                <p>Sometimes a portion only of an iron object is required to be case hardened. In
                    this case a coating of loam or clay, &amp;c., is applied to that part of the
                    object not required to be hardened, and gradually dried on so as to form a
                    jacket; this prevents the ready access of carbon and carbon oxide to the
                    covered-up part, and hence hinders or entirely prevents acieration thereat;
                    instead of a clay coating moulded on, a roughly made loose iron jacket may be
                    made from iron tube or sheet iron, &amp;c., and the space between the two
                    surfaces filled in with clay well rammed in. In certain cases the article is
                    case hardened as a whole, those portions required to be of malleable iron being
                    made too large; after acieration the whole is annealed, and the softened steely
                    coating filed or lathed off from these portions, and the whole then heated and
                    hardened.</p>
                <p>When only a thin coating of steel is required, it is unnecessary to acierate by
                    packing in charcoal; the iron to be hardened is heated to redness and then
                    sprinkled with powdered ferrocyanide of potassium either by itself or mixed with
                    other saline substances; the salt fuses and carbonizes the surface of the metal
                    to such an extent that after hardening the exterior film is usually hard enough
                    to resist a file. Sometimes goods are cast in the first instance (for cheapness
                    of manufacture) and then heated in haematite, &amp;c., so as to convert them
                    into malleable iron to a greater or lesser extent, the outer film being finally
                    case hardened by ferrocyanide; so that occasionally cast iron as an inner core,
                    malleable iron as an exterior coating, and steel as an outermost film are met
                    with in the same article. For axles, shafts, and other portions of machinery apt
                    to encounter sudden strains which would snap a solid hard steel mass, but where
                    certain portions (bearings, &amp;c. ) are required to be as hard as possible to
                    diminish wear and friction, the local case hardening of the parts required to be
                    hard is frequently practised; and in this way certain of the advantages of both
                    hard steel and wrought iron are combined.</p>
                <p>For case hardening rails Dodd’s process has given good results; as practised some
                    years ago by the North-Eastern Railway Company, charcoal, soda ash, and
                    limestone crushed small were mixed together in the proportion of 1 cwt. of the
                    first to 1 stone of each of the others, and charged into the case hardening
                    furnace between successive tiers of rails. The rails remained in the furnace
                    sixty hours; when taken out they were covered with sand till cold. The cost of
                    the process amounts to about 12s. 6d. per ton (Lowthian Bell); but when the
                    rails are of ordinary puddled malleable iron, a certain degree of brittleness is
                    communicated. With rails from Danks’s machine puddled iron the carbonization was
                    found to extend inwards for nearly a quarter of an inch, the percentages of
                    carbon in each successive <hi rend="subscript"> τ</hi><hi rend="superscript">

                    applicable to the cast steel prepared by fusing cementation steel in crucibles,
                    is often applied to denote various other somewhat different substances (also
                    fused in crucibles), cementation cast steel being often designated “Huntsmann’s
                    steel,” from the name of its inventor. About the beginning of the present
                    century Mush et patented the production of a crucible steel by the direct
                    carbonization of malleable iron by the fusion together in crucibles of bar or
                    scrap iron and “a proper percentage of carbonaceous matter”; and also the
                    production of a similar product direct from the ore by substituting the ore for
                    the malleable iron and increasing the amount of reducing matter. This latter
                    process (which is substantially the method of assaying iron ores in crucibles by
                    the dry method on a somewhat larger scale, and with less reducing matter) had
                    been previously patented in 1791 by Samuel Lucas, whilst substantially the same
                    process was again patented in 1836 by Hawkins. But little steel, however, was
                    made by this process until 1839, when Heath patented the use of what he termed
                    “carburet of manganese” as an ingredient in making crucible steel, this
                    substance being prepared by heating together manganese dioxide and carbonaceous
                    matter. It being speedily found that the same result was produced whether this
                    heating together of the manganese, dioxide, and carbonaceous matter was
                    previously carried out, or whether these materials were separately added to the
                    contents of the crucible and the whole melted together, the validity of the
                    patent was vigorously contested, the utility of the manganese thus introduced
                    into the resulting mass as a means of partially correcting the deleterious
                    effects of sulphur and phosphorus being speedily apparent, and the possibility
                    of the production of useful qualities of steel from even inferior iron being
                    rapidly recognized as a valuable improvement. This Mushet-Heath process of
                    fluxing together in crucibles malleable iron and steel scrap, powdered charcoal,
                    and manganese oxide or spiegeleisen is still used to some extent; the cast steel
                    thus produced is apt to be somewhat vesicular and porous; to overcome this when
                    bars are required the ingots are reheated and hammered or rolled, either with or
                    without cutting and piling; the character of the cast steel is largely variable
                    with the proportions of malleable iron and iron already carbonized that are
                    used. Siemens or open hearth steels have of late years largely superseded this
                    class of products.</p>
                <p>When blister steel is judged to be somewhat deficient in carbon, and is converted
                    into cast steel by fusion, the amount of carbon present in the cast steel can
                    often be increased by adding carbonaceous matter to the fragments of steel with
                    which the crucibles are filled,—the additional carbon being taken up precisely
                    as in Mushet’s process of date 1800. The same effect is produced to a slight
                    extent by employing a considerable quantity of blacklead in the crucible
                    composition, the graphite being then directly dissolved during the fusion. The
                    Chenot process of steel making (by fusion in crucibles of spongy iron and
                    carbonaceous matter) has been already adverted to (§ 30); Parry took out a
                    patent in 1861 for converting puddled iron into steel by fusing it with coke and
                    fluxes in a kind of cupola furnace so as to recarbonize the metal; by modifying
                    the blast and proportion of fuel employed it is possible to produce either steel
                    or cast iron containing 2 per cent, and upwards of carbon (§ 23). Apparently the
                    cost of the fuel required for this process and other circumstances have
                    prevented it from materially competing with the Bessemer and Siemens
                    steel-making processes.</p>

                    with a bamboo nozzle terminating in a clay tube, forming a rough tuyere. After
                    the fire has been urged for some hours the contents of the furnace are removed
                    by partially breaking down the front, in the form of a rough porous ball or
                    bloom of partially melted metal, which is then cut into pieces and charged into
                    a crucible (made of clay mixed with a small quantity of charred rice husks)
                    together with the wood of <hi rend="italic">Cassia auriculata,</hi> chopped into
                    little fragments; each crucible holds about a pound of metal, and is covered
                    over with a few green leaves, preferably of <hi rend="italic">Asclepius
                    gigantea</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Convolvulus laurifoHus,</hi> a clay cover
                    being made by ramming in soft clay and drying gently. A number of these
                    crucibles (some twenty or twenty-four) are then piled up in a clay furnace
                    furnished with a bellows something like the original smelting furnace, the
                    interstices being filled with charcoal. After some two lιours ’ heating the
                    steel is fused; the crucibles are then removed and allowed to cool, and the
                    melted cakes extracted by breaking away the clay. If the operation has been
                    successful, the cakes are smooth-surfaced, with radiating striae; such cakes
                    when remelted in larger quantities furnish an extremely fine quality of steel;
                    when the conversion of the iron into highly carbonized steel is incomplete, the
                    cakes are imperfectly melted down, and consist more or less largely of fritted
                    lumps of metal not carbonized sufficiently to fuse; such cakes yield only an
                    inferior steel when remelted. In order to forge the steel the natives heat the
                    cakes in a charcoal bellows-forge for some hours to a temperature short of
                    fusion, and then hammer them out by hand into bars; these are welded together by
                    forging to wedge-heads, tying together with wire, sprinkling with borax, and
                    quickly heating and hammering till united; the long preliminary heating
                    partially decarbonizes the steel, so as to make the final product less like a
                    steely cast iron. When properly prepared, the temper which this steel will take
                    is magnificent; it is said that sabres of such steel with an edge sharp enough
                    to cut gossamer like a razor can be dashed with the full strength of a man’s arm
                    against a stone wall, or used to cut in two a bar of wrought iron, without
                    having the cutting edge injured in the least degree if the swordsman be only
                    sufficiently expert.</p>

                    aluminium; this probably existed as cinder disseminated through the mass, as

                <p>VIII. Methods of Steel Production essentially CONSISTING OF COMBINATIONS OF THE
                    PRECEDING Processes, more or less pure Malleable Iron BEING PRODUCED IN ONE WAY,
                    AND CARBONIZED Iron in another, and the two being blended to form Steel.</p>
                <p>36. <hi rend="italic">The Βessemer-Hudιet Process and its Precursors.—</hi> It
                    has been known since the beginning of the 18th century at least that steel could
                    be prepared by fusing together in crucibles cast and wrought iron; thus the
                    operation was performed in 1722 by Reaumur employing the heat of an ordinary
                    forge; whilst in the production of wootz it must have been observed centuries
                    ago that by continued heating the badly prepared cakes (consisting partly of
                    fused steel and partially of unfused&gt; iron) frequently resulting from the
                    first crucible operation could be fused into one mass of somewhat less hard
                    steel than that produced at first in the more successful operations. The
                    possibility of producing steel by fusing together a malleable and a carbonized
                    iron is evidently a simple deduction from the processes whereby a steel is
                    produced by the direct addition of carbon to malleable iron, <hi rend="italic"
                    >e.g.,</hi> those of Mushet and of Heath (§ 35). Accordingly a few years after
                    the latter patented the use of “carburet” of manganese, he proposed</p>
                <p>(1845) a method for making steel on a larger scale than crucible operations would
                    permit, viz., by fusing in a cupola pig iron, running this into the bed of a
                    steel-making furnace, into the upper part of which the malleable iron was
                    introduced in bars so as to be heated up by the waste heat and gradually pushed
                    forward so as to dissolve, as it were, in the molten pig with formation of
                    steel. This method is described by Siemens as being one which would doubtless
                    have led to complete success had the regenerative principle been known to Heath,
                    so as to enable him to obtain the requisite intensity of heat and absence of
                    cutting draught essential to the proper combination together by fusion of the
                    wrought and carbonized iron without oxidation; it is substantially one of the
                    forms of steel making by means of the open hearth or regenerative processes now
                    in use, and known collectively as Siemens or Siemens-Martin processes (see §
                    39). Other patents, amounting substantially to. the same combination of wrought
                    and cast iron by fusion so as to form steel, have been subsequently taken out by
                    Price and Nicholson (1855), Gentle Brown, and Attwood (1862); a particular
                    combination of this class patented by Mushet in 1855 (consisting of the addition
                    to molten Bessemer blown decarbonized iron of fused spiegeleisen) has proved of
                    the highest practical value (§ 27), notwithstanding that the non-removal of
                    phosphorus and sulphur to any marked extent in the ordinary blowing process
                    render it applicable to certain kinds of pig iron only; the recently invented
                    “basic” process, however, bids fair to overcome this difficulty (see § 37).</p>
                <p>The earliest form of converter patented by Bessemer, October 17, 1855, consisted
                    of a rectangular furnace with firebars at the side instead of at thebottom, so
                    that a number of crucibles could be heated therein, each furnished with a
                    tapping hole at the bottom, and a pipe dipping to the bottom of the fused metal
                    inside, through which air was to be blown, or a mixture of air and steam, the
                    former causing the temperature to rise, the steam having a cooling effect.. Two
                    months later another patent was taken out, the use of a spherical or egg-shaped
                    vessel of iron lined with firebrick and supported by axes being the main
                    novelty. In May 1856 a fixed vertical cylindrical vessel, with blast pipes at
                    the base and a tapping <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit13newyrich/page/n359/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0913-0359-0344"/> hole, was patented; not till some time later,
                    however (after the introduction of Mushet’s improvement of adding spiegeleisen),
                    was the present form of converter arrived at, consisting of a pear-shaped or
                    bottle-shaped vessel with tuyeres at the base, and supported upon axes, one of
                    which being hollow serves as the tube by means of which the blast is
                    communicated to the tuyeres, whilst the vessel can be rotated into any desired
                    position round the axis (fig. 60); the use of hydraulic power to work the
                    converter into position, and to manipulate the ‘ ‘ ladle” into which the
                    finished metal is run so as to be poured from it into moulds, soon followed.
                    Subsequently various improvements in details of arrangement and construction of
                    the plant have been introduced, notably by Holley in certain American works in
                    the first instance; amongst these may more particularly be noticed the use of
                    somewhat longer converters (fig. 61), with movable bottoms, so that, as the
                    tuyeres wear out (which occurs much more rapidly than does the destruction of
                    the lining), new previously constructed bottoms can be introduced without
                    entailing large loss of time, whilst the greater length diminishes less by
                    splashing and forcible ejection during the boil; the effect of these
                    improvements is to increase the possible output from a given plant by at least
                    50 per cent. At first it was usual to melt the pig iron in a separate
                    reverberatory furnace and then to run it into the converter; a cupola furnace
                    (saving much fuel) was then substituted, a little lime being added to diminish
                    its tendency to sulphuration; in this way scrap of all kinds can be utilized,
                    being melted down with fresh pig in a cupola furnace much more readily than in a
                    reverberatory, and being less decarbonized and desiliconized in so doing, which
                    is somewhat important (§ 27). Where the blast furnaces are not too far from the
                    converters, the molten pig is often run direct from the furnace into the
                    converter without solidifying into pig and remelting, an intermediate ladle
                    running on a railway being employed instead of a long gutter, which would cool
                    the metal too much and be otherwise impracticable. In some few Swedish works the
                    old immovable cylindrical converter is still employed, the metal being tapped
                    out into a ladle from which it is run into the ingot moulds, but in most works,
                    even in Sweden, movable converters are now in use. The spiegeleisen usually
                    added subsequently is melted in another smaller cupola; in some few works
                    however, <hi rend="italic">e.g.,</hi> in Styria, spiegel is not used, but when
                    the charge is blown some more of the original pig is added; in others Bessemer’s
                    original process is adhered to (§ 27); the use of this method, however, is
                    comparatively limited, the combination process being usually adopted in
                    preference. When ferro-manganese is used instead of spiegeleisen, it is usually
                    not melted, but simply heated in a suitable vessel by the waste flame of the
                    converter, and emptied into the casting ladle together with the blown metal so
                    as to intermix the two, the ferro-manganese fusing as soon as it comes in
                    contact with the blown metal.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Converters.—</hi> The improved form of converter in use at the
                    present day is indicated by fig. 61. It consists of a vessel in shape resembling
                    a claret bottle with the neck somewhat shortened and slightly bent over
                    sideways; this is made of stout boilerplate, lined internally with “ganister,” a
                    kind of sandstone possessed of peculiar physical properties, more especially of
                    the power of binding together to a compact non-crumbly excessively infusible
                    mass when ground to powder, moistened, and finally exposed to a high
                    temperature. The base of the bottle is removable, being kept in position by
                    bolts and nuts; this being removed, a core is fitted concentrically within the
                    shell, and the moistened ganister rammed lightly in; sometimes the shell is also
                    made of two parts thus treated separately and afterwards bolted together. The
                    bottom is double, constituting an air chamber or “blast Lox,” the top portion of
                    which is a perforated cast iron plate, into which are fitted tuyeres consisting
                    of slightly conical elongated bricks or plugs perforated longitudinally with
                    holes (between 0'15 and 0 ’ 3 inch diameter) and fixed in at the thicker end;
                    these are composed of a mixture of fireclay and ganister, the space between them
                    being filled up with ganister, so that the inner bottom is substantially the
                    same as the lining sides of the converter, only perforated by a number of holes.
                    The total number of orifices through which the blast thus comes is considerable,
                    in order to spread it into numerous streams, the actual number varying with the
                    size of the converter; fora 5-ton converter a dozen or more tuyere bricks, each
                    perforated with about as many holes, are usually employed. The lower plate of
                    the air chamber is removable for the purpose of examining the tuyeres from time
                    to time without removing the entire bottom.</p>
                <p>The different portions of the vessel being put together, and the joints well
                    grouted with ganister slip, the whole is gently dried by lighting a small coke
                    fire inside, and by and by increasing this, the blast being turned on gently
                    until the whole vessel is thoroughly dry and hot, when it is ready to receive a
                    charge of molten pig. The blast is communicated to the blast-box by a curved
                    tube reaching thereto from the hollow trunnion box, inside which one of the
                    trunnions of the converter lies; the other trunnion has a cogged wheel or pinion
                    attached, by means of which the vessel can be rotated, a toothed rack gearing
                    into the pinion and being worked directly by a hydraulic press or ram; the rack
                    and press were formerly arranged horizontally, but now are usually placed
                    vertically or slantwise to save space. By means of an automatic valve the blast
                    is shut off when the converter is in an inclined position, so that the level of
                    the mouth is not lower than the tuyere hole then lowest; in this position the
                    molten metal is run in, the elevation of the tuyere holes preventing it from
                    running into them; whilst erecting the converter by means of the rack and pinion
                    before the tuyeres sink below the molten mass, the blast is turned on at a
                    pressure of some 1 '5 atmospheres or more (21 lb per square inch and upwards);
                    the pressure due to the column of molten metal being less than this, the air is
                    forced through it without it being possible for the fused matter to run down
                    into the blast-box. A large hood over the mouth of the converter and connected
                    with a chimney or flue prevents the flame and ejected matter from being
                    scattered about and injuring the workmen.</p>
                <p>The ganister preferred for lining is a peculiar silicious deposit found under a
                    thin coal-seam near Sheffield, of almost conchoidal fracture, therein differing
                    from ordinary sandstones, and containing a few tenths per cent., or sometimes a
                    little more, of lime and about the same amount of alumina, with small quantities
                    of iron oxide and alkalies, the rest being silica; analogous substances,
                    however, are found in various other localities, <hi rend="italic">e.g.,</hi> in
                    the Yorkshire, Northumberland, South Wales, and Shropshire Coal Measures. A
                    well-prepared lining carefully repaired every few days will last several months,
                    and even upwards of a year; the bottoms, however, wear away much more rapidly,
                    the tuyeres either becoming melted or dissolved away by the oxidation of the
                    iron in their vicinity, the oxide produced exerting a marked solvent action on
                    the fireclay and ganister bricks; hence the advantage of Holley’s removable
                    bottoms. A damaged bottom can be removed and a new one put in its place, the
                    joint being made up by ramming in ganister into the crevice whilst screwing up
                    the bolts, without stopping the action of the converter for any lengthened
                    period; whilst with the older vessels it was requisite to cool down somewhat,
                    knock out the damaged tuyere bricks, replace them by others, and ram in ganister
                    between them from the inside, and finally to heat up again by an internal fire
                    before use,·—the whole process causing much delay and waste of fuel, especially
                    as the renewal of some at least of the tuyere bricks is requisite every few
                    blows. In some American works, <hi rend="italic">e.g.</hi>, Bethlehem, instead
                    of a rammed ganister lining, one composed of blocks of a peculiar sandstone is
                    employed, set in ganister as mortar for the joints.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Subsidiary Appliances.—</hi> The precise mode of aιτangement of
                    Bessemer plant varies in different works, but usually two converters are
                    arranged to be worked together, one casting ladle being used for the pair,
                    worked by a crane. In most of the European works the two converters are on
                    opposite sides of the casting ladle, so that a <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit13newyrich/page/n360/mode/1up"

                    be used for running ingots into moulds, being occupied by the converters; in
                    most American works the two converters are placed side by side, so as to leave a
                    larger space for the casting bed when the metal is not used direct from the
                    blast furnace. A range of cupolas is fitted up at a convenient distance, some
                    larger for melting the pig, some smaller for the spiegeleisen; the molten metal
                    is either run out from these direct into one or other of the converters through
                    a shoot or gutter of iron lined with fireclay and sand, or is tapped into an
                    intermediate collecting ladle, and when the requisite quantity is collected run
                    rapidly into the converter either by “tipping” the ladle over so that the metal
                    runs out together with some little amount of slag floating on its surface, or by
                    means of a tapping hole at the bottom. This latter arrangement allows the
                    charging of the converter to be more quickly effected; when the iron is tapped
                    directly from the blast furnace into the converter by means of an intermediate
                    ladle, the cupolas are of course unnecessary, save those for melting the
                    spiegeleisen. The blast is generated by an ordinary blowing engine, but at a
                    considerably greater pressure than that used for blast furnaces, 20, 25, and
                    even 30 lb per square inch pressure being employed. The casting ladle into which
                    the contents of the converters are emptied by tilting them up sufficiently when
                    the operation is finished is a large iron bucket lined with clay with a hole at
                    the bottom filled up with a perforated firebrick, into which fits a stopper
                    consisting of a stout iron rod covered with a thick fireclay tube to protect the
                    ro&lt;l from the fused steel; when the ladle is full of molten metal, and the
                    hole is closed by the stopper, the ladle’is swung round by means of a crane over
                    the ingot moulds (of cast iron); the stopper is then lifted, when the fused
                    steel runs out, the scoriae floating on the top of the metal being thus retained
                    and pure steel only poured. Sounder ingots are obtained by running the metal
                    into a cavity communicating by firebrick tubes with the bottoms of the moulds,
                    so as to fill them from below, than by filling them from above directly.
                    Detailed descriptions of the plant employed in various first-class American
                    Bessemer works are given by Holley and Lenox Smith in a series of articles in
                    <hi rend="italic">Engineering,</hi> 1877 and following years.</p>
                <p>The mode of carrying out the operation is briefly as follows :— the charge of pig
                    iron being ran into the converter, this is swung back into the vertical
                    position, the blast being automatically turned on in so doing; when the blowing
                    is at an end, the converter is turned into a nearly horizontal position, the
                    blast being thereby shut off; a weighed quantity of fused spiegeleisen is then
                    ran in, and the total contents of the converter forthwith poured into the
                    casting ladle; formerly the converter was erected for a few seconds and the
                    blast blown through to mix the spiegeleisen and blown metal, but that is now
                    found to be unnecessary. The ingots are finally reheated and passed through the
                    rolling mills after forging so as to reduce them to rails, bars, plates,
                    &amp;c., as required, the machinery for this purpose being identical in
                    character with that employed for malleable iron (§ 25).</p>

                    history of the puddling process, especially the improvement effected by Rogers
                    in substituting bottoms of iron coated with fettling of iron oxide for the sand
                    bottoms originally used by Cort, and also the various experiments that have been
                    made during the last dozen years or so both on puddling by machinery and
                    refining and purifying iron, the general conclusion deducible seems to be that
                    when phosphorized metal is in presence of iron oxide in a fused state, or of a
                    melted mixture of iron oxide and ferrous silicate containing an amount of the
                    latter not above a certain limit, the tendency of the phosphorus is to become
                    oxidized and converted into phosphate, which separates in the cinder, leaving a
                    purer iron; whilst on the other hand if the cinder is mainly silicate,
                    especially of the metasilicate or <hi rend="superscript"> w</hi> acid” type (R
                    <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> O, SiO <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi>), the tendency
                    is rather the other way, part of the metallic iron becoming oxidized whilst the
                    phosphate is reduced, thus communicating phosphorus to the remaining iron.<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>An instructive experiment on
                    this point has been made by Pourcel, A quantity of metal (3 tons) containing 2

                    in a Siemens-Martin hearth, the scoriae removed, and the atmosphere made highly
                    oxidizing (hot air alone passing); in fifteen minutes jets of carbon oxide were
                    formed, and some of the silicon and iron was oxidized, forming a cinder
                    containing no phosphorus. The bath was then heated up again and the cinder
                    removed; and after some silico-manganeisen (10 per cent, silicon, 20 per cent,
                    manganese) had been added, the oxidation by air alone was proceeded with; at
                    first no carbon oxide was liberated (indicating the preferential oxidation of
                    silicon), but after fifteen minutes more the jets reappeared; the cinder now was
                    found to contain phosphates, the percentage of phosphorus in the metal having

                    now made much less powerfully oxidizing by turning on the gas supply as usual;
                    in fifteen· minutes the phosphorus had disappeared from the cinder, and was
                    wholly taken up again by the iron, which now contained 0 ’ 50 per cent, as at
                    first,—showing that prolonged contact with the silicious cinder enabled metallic
                    iron (containing more or less carbon) to reduce the phosphate of this cinder,
                    thus inverting the operation effected during the rapid oxidation of iron set up
                    in the first part of the experiment.</p></note> Accordingly, in the modern
                    ordinary puddling process, especially when machine puddling and regular
                    mechanical agitation are substituted for hand labour, and when plenty of
                    fettling of ferric oxide (not largely silicious) is employed, and in Bell’s and
                    Krupp’s purification processes, phosphorus is largely removed from the pig;
                    whilst on the other hand in the older method of puddling on sand bottoms and in
                    the ordinary Bessemer blowing process the first action of the oxygen of the
                    blast is concentrated rather on the silicon than on the iron (at least so far as
                    the ultimate chemical change is concerned), and in consequence a highly
                    silicious cinder results, so that removal of phosphorus by oxidation becomes
                    impracticable; this result, moreover, is intensified by the nature of the lining
                    material (ganister) used for the converters; similarly, in the Heaton process
                    phosphorus is sometimes removed to a considerable extent and sometimes not,
                    according as the soda produced by the decomposition of the nitrate and the iron
                    oxide formed modify the character of the slag produced by the oxidation of the
                    silicon and formation of silicates, rendering it of an “acid” or “basic”
                    silicious character. Again, according to Riley, when the whole of the iron is
                    reduced in the blast furnace, so that the cinder contains none, or practically
                    none, the pig contains all the phosphorus present; but if the cinder contains
                    unreduced iron to any extent, it also retains a proportionate amount of
                    phosphorus, being then much more basic. The temperature also seems somewhat to
                    influence the reaction of iron oxide on phosphorus and of iron on phosphate; the
                    higher the temperature the more pronounced apparently is the tendency of the
                    metal to retain phosphorus, <hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> the less is the
                    tendency of the phosphorus to oxidize and separate from the metal. Guided by
                    these considerations, Snelus took out a patent in 1872<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>The idea of employing calcareous and other
                    basic linings to furnaces used for the purification of iron by methods other
                    than the pneumatic process of Bessemer is of considerably older date than 1872;
                    thus such substances were used years ago by Siemens and Chatelier in the
                    earliest experiments on the open-hearth process (§ 39), bauxite being
                    extensively employed then, and also in Siemens’s subsequent direct precipitation
                    process. The use of lime in puddling has often been tried as an addition to the
                    fettling, whilst in the Siemens ore process limestone is usually added as a
                    flux.</p></note> for the use of lime or limestone <pb break="no"

                    that when a “basic” lining of this description was substituted for ganister a
                    removal of phosphorus to a greater or lesser extent was actually brought about
                    in the converter just as it is in the puddling furnace; for some few years,
                    however, this method was not applied on a commercial scale, but subsequently the
                    subject was again examined by Thomas and Gilchrist, who finally succeeded in
                    reducing the principles of Snelus’s patent to successful practical operation,
                    finding that by the use of a “basic” lining to the converter, and especially the
                    addition of a small amount of lime, or lime mixed with “blue billy” or some
                    other form of iron oxide such as mill scale, to the charge together with the
                    continuance of the blow for some short period after the decarbonization is
                    complete, the elimination of phosphorus (even from highly phosphorized pig,
                    containing 1 <hi rend="superscript"> ,</hi> 5 to 2Ό per cent, of phosphorus)
                    could be very largely effected, some 80 to 90 per cent, at least of the total
                    phosphorus present becoming oxidized and converted into phosphates, this action
                    chiefly taking place during the “after blow”; provided that the cinder is
                    sufficiently basic, the iron does not oxidize during this after blow as it does
                    in the ordinary “acid lined” converter process. Owing to the success of these
                    operations, the “basic” process has been more frequently spoken of as the
                    “Thomas-Gilchrist process” than as being what it substantially is, the principle
                    of Snelus’s earlier patent in a somewhat but not very largely modified form.
                    Warned probably by the disasters of previous inventors, the rival competitors
                    for the honour (and profit) of the practical production of ingot metal of fair
                    quality from phosphorized pig have coalesced and united their forces, instead of
                    opposing one another in costly litigation.</p>
                <p>Processes based upon the general principle of making the cinder of the Bessemer
                    converter more or less “basic,” but considerably different in details from the
                    basic lining method of Snelus, Thomas, and Gilchrist, have been proposed at one
                    time or another by various inventors; thus, in the earlier patents of Bessemer
                    himself, the admixture of steam with air in the blowing operation was included,
                    whilst steam had been previously employed as an adjunct in the refinery, the
                    action being the formation of iron oxide (with evolution of hydrogen). Somewhat
                    analogous uses of steam have been subsequently proposed by others, in some cases
                    the phosphorus being alleged to be evolved as phosphoretted hydrogen (?), <hi
                    rend="italic">e.g.,</hi> in Bull’s process, in which the ordinary air blowing of
                    a Bessemer converter or the effect of an oxidizing blast in a Siemens hearth,
                    &amp;c., on cast iron is first used to remove silicon and carbon, and then a jet
                    of steam used to remove phosphorus. The direct incorporation of oxide of iron
                    (blue billy, &amp;c. ) alone with the material (by blowing into the converter
                    along with the blast) has also been proposed by Pettitt ( § 24), the object in
                    all cases being to assist the formation of phosphate, and thereby remove
                    phosphorus from the iron by making the cinder highly basic.</p>
                <p>During the oxidation of phosphorus a large amount of heat is evolved, so that the
                    temperature rises during the after blow just as it does during the oxidation of
                    silicon. According to various experimenters the heat of combustion of phosphorus
                    is a little short of 6000, so that, as that of silicon is near to 8000, 4 parts
                    of phosphorus are thermally about equivalent to 3 of silicon. Hence if a pig
                    containing 2 per cent, of silicon will furnish sufficient heat to keep the blown
                    metal and slag fluid, the same result will be attained by means of a pig
                    containing about 0 ’ 5 per cent, of silicon and 2Ό per cent, of phosphorus, <hi
                    rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> if the radiation loss be the same, and also the
                    diminution in heat evolution due to separating the non-metal from the iron,<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>The experiments of Troost and
                    Hautefeuille show that this is not the case, the heat evolution during the union
                    of silicon and iron being much less than that taking place when phosphorus and
                    iron combine together; so that considerably more than four parts of phosphorus
                    would be requisite to produce the same amount of heat as three of silicon if
                    both non-metals are severally combined with iron.</p></note> as well as the
                    fusibility of the slag. In actual practice the “basic” method is found to take a
                    little longer time than the ordinary “acid” blow, so that the radiation loss is
                    a little greater; the calcareous cinder too is somewhat less fusible than the
                    ferrous silicate cinder of the ordinary ganister-lined converter <hi
                    rend="italic">; so</hi> that a practical inconvenience is apt to be occasioned
                    owing to the frothy mass of imperfectly fused cinder formed foaming up to the
                    mouth of the converter and there solidifying, whilst the greater extent of the
                    foaming causes more material to be ejected than is usual with the ordinary
                    converters. To remedy this, it has been proposed to add the basic matter in a
                    highly heated or even molten state, and to make the air used for blowing
                    traverse a chamber filled with coke on to which petroleum is allowed to drop, so
                    that combustible vapours are blown into the converter along with the air, thus
                    raising the temperature considerably, and preventing the blocking of the
                    converter-mouth by solidification of cinder, and the production of metal too
                    little heated to remain fluid during the pouring of the ingots, and consequently
                    solidifying in the ladle forming a “skull.” Wilks finds that the action of this
                    arrangement is very satisfactory and effective in preventing “cold blows” from
                    occurring. The same result is also producible by means of coal dust or other
                    freely divided combustible matter blown in along with the blast.</p>
                <p>With silicious pig iron the lining is apt to be attacked by the silica formed
                    during the first part of the blowing operations; this is partly but not wholly
                    avoided by the addition of heated lime to the charge. Harmet has proposed, and
                    at Witkowitz attempts have been made, to blow phosphorized and siliciuretted pig
                    successively in two converters, one acid-lined for removing silicon and carbon,
                    and the other basic-lined to get rid of the phosphorus, the blown metal being
                    transferred from the one to the other; much cooling of the metal was thus
                    produced, and the operation was prolonged some fifteen minutes, so that the
                    method was speedily abandoned.</p>
                <p>According to Tiinner, in order to produce 100 parts of pure ingots of blown metal
                    122'5 parts of pig are requisite with “basic” converters, and only 118 <hi
                    rend="superscript"> ,</hi> 7 with the ordinary “acid” ones (waste in remelting
                    being included in each case; when the metal is used direct from the blast
                    furnace, only 112 parts are required with acid converters); hence an extra loss
                    of nearly 4 per cent, of metal is experienced in the basic process. The
                    following analyses, by Miiller, of specimens taken during a prolonged
                    investigation at Hörde illustrate the non-removal of phosphorus and sulphur
                    during the earlier part of the blow, and indeed their slight increase (in
                    percentage amount) owing to the oxidation of manganese, silicon, and carbon; and
                    also the rapid removal of phosphorus during the after-blow :—</p>

                <p>The phosphoric anhydride in the basic process slag appears to exist as calcium

                    any formed by fusion with sodium chloride, whilst sulphurous acid solution

                <p><hi rend="italic">Basic Lining Material.—</hi> Some of the earliest of Bessemer's
                    experiments (made at Dowlais) on his air-blowing process were made with a
                    converter lined with Stourbridge firebrick, and in this vessel a Bessemer metal
                    was made which contained only minute quantities of carbon and silicon, and much
                    less phosphorus than the batches subsequently prepared from the same
                    phosphorized Welsh pig in other converters lined with ganister, the non-success
                    of which substances as commercial products (owing to their brittleness due to
                    the phosphorus present) ultimately led to the use of haematite and other
                    phosphorus-free pig only for Bessemerizing. Without doubt the superiority of the
                    earliest samples was due to the less silicious character of the brick lining.
                    The lining materials used by Snelus in his experiments on the subject were lime
                    and limestone, especially magnesian limestone; those first employed by Thomas
                    and Gilchrist were crushed limestone and sodium silicate solution added so as to
                    moisten the limestone, which was then rammed into the converter like ganister.
                    Bricks made of a limestone containing some aluminous silicate and fired at a
                    very high temperature were then employed, but were found to be subject to
                    disintegration by moisture when kept in stock; magnesian limestone bricks
                    containing a littje silica and alumina similarly prepared answered much better.
                    Riley has found that freshly burnt pretty pure magnesian limestone mixed with
                    about 10 or 15 per cent, of crude petroleum can be rammed into converters or
                    moulded by hydraulic pressure into bricks, the substance in either case becoming
                    compact and hard upon firing, so as to present a very durable lining material.
                    Instead of petroleum, crude shale oil, resin oil, or tar may be used to moisten
                    the lime. The bricks thus prepared do not slake or disintegrate on keeping, or
                    even if immersed in water, provided they have been fired at a high temperature;
                    in this case they contract slightly, whereas if only comparatively slightly
                    heated they do not materially diminish in volume on firing.<note anchored="true"

                <p>38. <hi rend="italic">The Uchatius Process.—</hi> In the process of puddling (§
                    23) the oxidation of the carbon and other impurities oi the pig iron is
                    essentially effected by oxide of iron incorporated mechanically with the fluxed
                    mass, and derived either from the oxidation of part of the iron of the pig, or
                    from the fettling, or both. By fusing down in crucibles a mixture of small
                    fragments of pig iron and ferric oxide of tolerable purity in suitable
                    proportions it might therefore be expected that the percentage of carbon of the
                    iron would be reduced so that a steel would result, a portion of the iron oxide
                    added becoming simultaneously reduced to the metallic state; this experiment was
                    actually made by Reaumur upwards of a century ago; the reaction forms the
                    foundation of the Uchatius process, patented in 1855. In order to obtain a
                    usable steel, the iron oxide employed should also contain manganese oxide; the
                    product of the continued roasting of a manganiferous spathic ore answers well.
                    Independently of the costliness of crucible operations, however, as compared
                    with other modes of production, the method is open to objection on the score of
                    the practical difficulty in exactly regulating the degree of carbonization of
                    the resulting steel, and also in its requiring a tolerably pure pig iron in the
                    first place, so that, like the Bessemer process.proper, it is unsuited for the
                    production of steel from many classes of iron. The method has, however, been
                    employed on a manufacturing scale in Sweden, the non-phosphorized charcoal
                    smelted from Swedish magnetite being employed along with some of the crushed
                    ore; whilst a modification of the process, in which an open hearth heated by a
                    regenerative furnace is employed instead of crucibles, has been employed of late
                    years by Siemens (see § 39), and is usually known as the “ore process” for open
                    hearth steel making. At Wikmans-hytta in Sweden a few years ago various
                    qualities of steel were prepared from the richest Bispberg mine ores stamped
                    fine and intermixed with pig iron granulated by running into a rapidly revolving
                    wheel in a water tank. Only hard steel for miners’ picks, cutting tools, razors,
                    dies, &lt;fcc., were thus prepared, containing 0 ’ 7 to 1 ’ 3 per cent, of
                    carbon, about 50 B&gt; being melted in each crucible at one operation; the
                    crucibles lasted longer than in ordinary cast steel making, usually for some
                    half dozen heats.</p>
                <p>Rostaing effected the granulation of the iron by running the melted pig on to a
                    rapidly revolving horizontal cast iron disk, so that the liquid was scattered
                    around (by centrifugal action) in globules which solidified into a kind of iron
                    shot; these being sifted into tolerably uniform sizes admitted of the production
                    of a more nearly homogeneous metal than would otherwise have been obtained. The
                    principles of Uchatius and Rostaing’s patents, however, were long previously
                    known and even patented; thus in 1761 J. Wood obtained a patent for reducing
                    iron “into small grains (according to art) by pouring it into water upon a wheel
                    or roller turned briskly round,” and for decarbonizing the granulated metal by
                    fusing with various fluxes, &amp;c., including iron cinder, scales, and scoriae;
                    whilst Mushet has described, as being in use long ago at Cyfartha, a method of
                    granulating iron by pouring on to a revolving horizontal stone in a water trough
                    molten pig iron, stating that the granulated metal was fused with oxide of iron
                    in the form of bloomery cinders, and thereby rendered less easily fusible and
                    capable of welding,— in short, that it was decarbonized to a greater or lesser
                    extent.</p>
                <p>The method of purification or refining of pig iron proposed by Bell (§ 24) is
                    substantially the Uchatius process applied on a large scale and at a somewhat
                    lower temperature, with mechanical agitation and interruption at a certain
                    stage. By stopping the process when the action has only gone on sufficiently
                    long to oxidize the majority of the silicon and phosphorus without materially
                    affecting the carbon, a refined cast iron is produced; whilst, were somewhat
                    more carbon removed by longer action, a kind of Uchatius steel would result.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Ellershausen'</hi><hi rend="italic">s process</hi> consisted in
                    running molten pig iron upon a bed of iron oxide, sprinkling ore on the surface,
                    and running on another layer of pig iron, and so on until a mass of alternate
                    layers of pig and oxide is formed; on heating this the pig gradually becomes
                    decarbonized, the reaction being in fact a kind of modification of the
                    “malleable cast iron” process described in § 22. Finally the mass is forged and
                    rolled. The results obtained were not uniformly satisfactory, whilst the fuel
                    consumption was found to be large; accordingly the method never became anything
                    much more than an experimental process.</p>
                <p>39. <hi rend="italic">The Siemens-Martin Process.—</hi> As already stated, this
                    process in its original form is substantially the method patented by Heath in
                    1845, with the addition of the use of a regenerative furnace, and of certain
                    improvements in the working details, &amp;c., the effect of which jointly is
                    just to convert a practically useless process into a most valuable working
                    method. Fig. 5 represents the kind of furnace employed. Since the date of
                    Heath’s patent the fusion of steel by means of a fan blast in an open hearth
                    (under a layer of molten glass to protect from the oxidizing action of the flame
                    which was the main cause of failure in Heath’s original process) was
                    experimented upon by Sudre and a commission from the French emperor (consisting
                    of Deville, Beaulieu, and Caron) at the Montataire ironworks, with the result of
                    showing that, whilst the operation could be readily effected and a good tool
                    steel prepared, the practical difficulties in the way, especially the corrosion
                    of the furnace and the great cost of the requisite fuel, rendered the process
                    commercially of but little value. In 1863, however, Chatelier attempted to
                    prepare cast steel by puddling a good pig iron so as to form a very mild puddled
                    steel, and then fusing it, not in crucibles, but on ’ the hearth of a furnace
                    containing molten pig and fitted on the regenerative principle. To enable the
                    hearth to resist the high temperature it was composed of a bed of bauxite, a
                    material highly suitable, so far as infusibility and the absence of injurious
                    ingredients are concerned, but open to the objection of not indurating properly,
                    and consequently becoming dislodged and floating up to the surface of the fused
                    mass; this inconvenience was subsequently remedied by mixing the bauxite with a
                    1 per cent, solution <hi rend="italic">oi</hi> calcium chloride, moulding the
                    paste into bricks, and calcining them, whereby a highly refractory coherent
                    bottom can be obtained. Siemens, however, prefers <hi rend="italic">{Chem. Soc.
                    Journal·</hi><pb break="no"

                    particular degree of fusibility (such as that from Gornal near Birmingham, or
                    Fontainebleau sand with an admixture of about 25 per cent of common red sand);
                    this, being introduced dry into the furnace in a layer of about an inch in
                    thickness, is fritted by increasing the heat up to a full steelmelting
                    temperature; another similar layer is then introduced and fritted down again,
                    and so on until the hearth is made into a shallow basin sloping towards the
                    tapping hole. The experiments of Chatelier not being attended with the desired
                    success in the first instance, the subject was taken up by E. &amp; P. Martin,
                    who subsequently introduced certain improvements in details, such as the use of
                    particular fluxes to cover the surface of the molten metal, the application of a
                    <hi rend="italic">separate furnace</hi> for heating the iron before introducing
                    it into the melting chamber, the employment of particular brands of iron,
                    &amp;c.</p>
                <p>Under the names of “Siemens process” and “Siemens-Martin process” are usually
                    included several different modifications. In what may be called the older or
                    original process, which was essentially the combination of pig iron and
                    malleable iron fused together in a regenerative furnace hearth, the same kind of
                    difficulty was met with that nearly proved fatal to Bessemer’s original process,
                    viz., that it is difficult if not impracticable to make sure of obtaining any
                    required degree of carbonization of the resulting steel, so that the finer
                    classes of steels cannot readily be thus made; for rails, however, the process
                    has been largely adopted. Much the same way of overcoming the difficulty was
                    adopted in the Siemens-Martin process as was used by Mushet, thus giving the
                    second modification, viz., making the atmosphere slightly oxidizing, and
                    continuing the heating until the metal is decarbonized, when the required amount
                    of carbon is added in the form of spiegeleisen or ferro-manganese, and the steel
                    forthwith cast. This modification is consequently substantially the refining
                    process formerly adopted as a preliminary stage to puddling (§ 23) carried out a
                    great deal further (so as wholly to decarbonize the metal) at a much higher
                    temperature, and differs from the Bessemer blowing process mainly in this that
                    the oxygen requisite to burn off the carbon and oxidize silicon, &amp;c., is
                    made to play <hi rend="italic">over</hi> the surface of the fused mass instead
                    of passing <hi rend="italic">through</hi> it. The decarbonization is carried out
                    in precisely the same way (so far as principle is concerned) as that by which
                    the oxidation of lead and base metal is effected in the ordinary process of gold
                    and silver cupellation in an oxidizing atmosphere at a high temperature. These
                    modifications, of which the second is now much the more largely adopted, are
                    generally referred to as the “Siemens-Martin” process, or “Martin process.” A
                    third modification is substantially the Uchatius process carried out in a
                    regenerative hearth instead of a crucible; this is known as the “Siemens
                    process” or “ore process,” and consists in melting haematite pig, or other pig
                    iron free from sulphur and phosphorus, and then adding in small quantities at a
                    time an equally pure ore until a sample taken out from time to time does not
                    harden on plunging into water whilst still red hot; to the fused iron
                    spiegeleisen, &amp;c., is then added as before; in this way a somewhat larger
                    quantity of steel is obtained from a given amount of pig, the ore becoming
                    partly reduced whilst oxidizing carbon and silicon, &amp;c.; but this advantage
                    is counterbalanced by the greater wear and tear owing to the larger amount of
                    cinder formed and its corrosive action on the brickwork, and by the necessity
                    for using somewhat more fuel. A fourth modification consists in a sort of
                    combination of the Martin method and the ore process, the pig and scrap,
                    &amp;c., being fused together and the decarbonization being then effected, not
                    by oxidation by the gases alone, but by that together with ore added to the
                    mass.</p>
                <p>When Siemens’s precipitation process (§ 31) is used, or when the ore is reduced
                    to spongy metal in a rotating furnace, &amp;c. (§ 30), the resulting iron is
                    readily converted into steel by simply adding it instead of malleable scrap to
                    the fused pig in the above process,— spongy metal when thus employed being made
                    up into a sort of ball by stirring it up with fused magnetite, and the whole
                    added to the fused pig; another variety of combination of “ore process” and
                    ordinary Siemens-Martin process is thus obtained, the finishing up of the metal
                    by adding spiegeleisen, &amp;c., in known quantity when complete decarbonization
                    has been effected being the same in all cases. An analogous modification is that
                    of Blair, who first prepares spongy iron by reducing the ore in much the same
                    fashion as in Chenot’s process (§ 30), and then fuses it up in a regenerative
                    furnace with more or less pig to give a fluid bath to begin with.</p>
                <p>In the ordinary working of the process when ore is not used, the materials
                    employed are pig iron (free from sulphur and phosphorus) and malleable scrap of
                    various kinds, together with scrap and waste Bessemer steel, crop ends of rails,
                    &amp;c. The pig being melted and the malleable iron raised to nearly a white
                    heat (either in a separate furnace or by the waste gases before passing to the
                    regenerator), the latter is gradually added to the former until the whole is
                    liquid; the heating is then continued, the flame being made somewhat oxidizing
                    so as to gradually decarbonize the metal, until a sample of the metal drawn and
                    cooled in water is scarcely hardened thereby; at this stage the metal is
                    virtually molten decarbonized iron, all silicon, manganese, and carbon having
                    been removed by oxidation. To give the requisite steel character, a definite
                    quantity of spiegeleisen is added (or of ferro-manganese when a larger relative
                    percentage of manganese is desired, or in certain cases of silico-manganeisen
                    when silicon is wanted to be present), and the whole cast into ingots. Pig iron
                    alone can be used in the first instance, only then a longer time is requisite to
                    effect decarbonization. The following analyses by A. Willis illustrate the
                    relative-rates at which the oxidation of manganese, silicon, and carbon is
                    effected, the quantity of the last not suffering any material diminution until
                    the others have almost disappeared :—</p>

                <p>When pure ores are used in the ore process, no appreciable alteration takes place
                    in the percentage of sulphur in the pig and scrap, but if sulphates <hi
                    rend="italic">(e.g.,</hi> barium sulphate) be present in the ore, the resulting
                    steel contains more sulphur than the pig and scrap used to the extent of about
                    30 per cent, of the sulphur present in the ore (Willis). When ferro-manganese is
                    used to finish the process and prepare a soft steel, the requisite quantity of
                    ferro-manganese is heated up either on the bed between the hearth proper and the
                    regenerators on which the materials are heated up by waste heat or otherwise
                    without fusion; when spiegeleisen is used, the requisite quantity may either be
                    added in the same way, or fused in a cupola and then added; burning out of more
                    or less carbon and manganese is always a possibility where a cupola is used,
                    wherefore when possible the spiegeleisen is fused in the hearth itself or its
                    adjuncts. In order to obtain the best castings at Terre Noire, the decarbonized
                    metal is treated with siliconeisen, and then allowed to remain for some twenty
                    minutes in as nearly neutral an atmosphere as possible, so that cinder may
                    completely be separated by gravitation and the reaction of the silicon on the
                    carbon oxide may be complete (§ 44); the ferro-manganese is then added, and the
                    casting proceeded with.</p>
                <p>In the Siemens-Martin process (where ore is not used) the yield of steel finally
                    obtained is somewhat below the weight of metal originally employed, owing to
                    oxidation; in the ore process, on the other hand, a larger weight of steel is
                    ultimately obtained than that of the metal used, owing to the reduction of iron
                    from the ore. The consumption of fuel per ton of ingot steel is, however,
                    somewhat higher in the ore process, owing to the larger quantity of slag.
                    According to Gautier a considerable loss of fuel results if the gas producers
                    are not placed close to the steel furnaces, even to the extent of one-third in

                <p>In order to avoid the necessity of decarbonizing completely the metal and then
                    recarbonizing by addition of spiegeleisen or ferromanganese, which is
                    practically entailed by the difficulty experienced in finding out the exact
                    composition of the partially decarbonized metal at any given stage of the
                    operation, it has been proposed by Ryder to sample the steel and cast the sample
                    into a small ingot of definite size and shape, and then to determine the
                    magnetic qualities developed in the ingot by the influence of a powerful
                    electromagnet, using a particular apparatus devised for the purpose. In this way
                    a fairly correct estimate of the amount of residual carbon is obtained,
                    rendering it unnecessary to prolong the operation of decarbonization further
                    when the test shows that an amount is present sufficient to give a steel of the
                    required quality on addition of a known amount of ferro-manganese. In the
                    inventor’s hands the method has been found to work successfully, enabling the
                    open hearth operations to be considerably shortened as to duration. An improved
                    form of apparatus for the purpose has also been described by Wattenhofem</p>

                    supported by an iron frame, mounted on the top of a slightly inclined nearly
                    vertical axis, and running on wheels upon a rail or guide supported on a stout
                    bogie (fig. 62). When in position the hearth is just under a dome or roof, which
                    is perforated with orifices for the entrance and exit of the <pb break="no"

                    regenerators; as the furnace revolves the liquid metal always forms a pool at
                    the lowest portion, but any solid matter is carried round, alternately rising
                    above the pool and being plunged beneath it; the effect of this is greatly to
                    facilitate melting down and also considerably to shorten the time requisite for
                    oxidizing out the carbon. At the required stage of decarbonization the blast and
                    gas supply are shut off, the spiegeleisen or ferro-manganese added, and the

                <p>The metal used per unit of ingot steel was 1Ό6, the output being about 21 tons
                    per day of twenty-four hours, the conversion taking about seven hours per
                    charge. In English works where the Siemens process (“ore process ”) is used with
                    fixed hearths the yield of steel is somewhat in excess of the metal used
                    originally, but the time of working is inferior to that just mentioned, the
                    yield with 5-ton furnaces being only some 14 tons per twenty-four hours.</p>
                <p>Holley states that the removable Pernot furnaces set up in America (especially at
                    Springfield, where 20-ton hearths have been recently erected) are highly
                    satisfactory, especially as regards the ease with which repairs can be made; the
                    hearth can be run out on Saturday night, and is cool enough to repair on Sunday;
                    firing up being commenced on Sunday night, the furnace is ready for the usual
                    charge on Monday forenoon. Krupp’s dephosphorizing pro cess is adopted to purify
                    the pig before finishing in the Pernot hearth, the metal being run from the
                    melting cupolas into the Krupp washing furnace, and thence into the steel
                    furnace by means of a ladle. Essentially the Pernot furnace is an ingenious
                    combination of various previously well-known principles, the rotating circular
                    bed having been previously used not only for puddling iron, but also for
                    roasting ores, and the withdrawing can·iage having also been employed previously
                    in the manufacture of armour plates, whilst the inclined axis had also been
                    previously used.</p>

                    essentially a combination of the Pernot furnace with the Bessemer converter,
                    consisting of a hearth movable about an obliquely vertical axis (figs. 63, 64).
                    Instead of rotating round and round on this axis, the hearth D only moves
                    through half a revolution; when in one position (as indicated in fig. 63) the
                    surface of the molten metal is above the level of a series of tuyeres O fed by a
                    blast pipe LMN; under these circumstances the apparatus performs the functions
                    of a Bessemer converter, the blast passing <hi rend="italic">through</hi> the
                    molten metal; when it is half turned round, the tuyeres are raised above the
                    surface of the metal and the blast is shut off, so that it then becomes an
                    ordinary Siemens open hearth. The air blast is introduced, as in the Bessemer
                    converter, through a hollow axis of rotation; the hearth is fixed, as in the
                    Pernot furnace, upon a carriage or bogie K, so that it can be withdrawn and the
                    metal tapped out at the tapping hole P. A gas producer A is attached, the gases
                    from which are burnt as they are formed without cooling by passing through a
                    long pipe, &lt;fcc., or heating by a regenerator; the air used to burn them,
                    however, is heated by a regenerative arrangement consisting of a pair of
                    chambers H filled with brick stacked in a peculiar way; through one chamber the
                    waste flame passes by the flue EFG, heating it up; through the other one used
                    alternately the air passes reaching the furnace by the flue CC. F is a chamber
                    in the waste gas flue for the deposition of solid suspended matters, dust,
                    &amp;c., from the blowing operation<pb break="no"

                    heating up the blast, the waste gases escape at a much higher temperature than
                    with a Siemens regenerator; accordingly they may be advantageously utilized to
                    produce steam.</p>
                <p>According to Perissé (from whose paper— <hi rend="italic">J</hi><hi rend="italic
                    superscript"> r</hi><hi rend="italic">ourn, I. and S. Inst.,</hi> 1878, 459—the
                    cuts, figs. 63 and 64 are taken) the average duration of a blow and subsequent
                    operations in a 5-ton furnace is five to six hours when the metal is charged
                    cold, whilst six to eight operations may be made in twenty-four hours when it is
                    previously melted in a spare hearth; 250 kilos (about 5 cwts.) of Mons coal were
                    consumed per hour, or about 6 tons per twenty-four hours for 20 tons and upwards
                    of production (charged cold), or for 30 to 40 tons (charged with fluid metal).
                    Phosphorus is not materially eliminated, because, as in the ordinary Bessemer
                    and Siemens-Martin hearths, there is a silicious flux always present, owing to
                    the nature of the lining; this objection, however, is readily remediable by
                    simply using a “basic” lining (§ 37), when more or less complete
                    dephosphorization results, just as is the case with the Pernot hearth when a
                    large amount of fussd iron oxide is added, as in Krupp’s dephosphorizing
                    process.</p>
                <p>By omitting the movable bed, and substituting the ordinary fixed bed of a
                    reheating furnace, the Ponsard forno-convertisseur becomes changed into the
                    Ponsard reheating furnace; the advantages of this form of arrangement over that
                    of Siemens’s reheater are said to be considerable saving of cost in construction
                    and capability of producing steam by the waste heat.</p>

                    proportion, so as to communicate a known amount of carbon (and also of

                    ordinary way in a blast furnace, a large fraction of the manganese is not
                    reduced, but passes away in the cinder; by using a larger amount of fuel
                    relatively to the burden, however, the quantity of manganese reduced and
                    obtained in the pig iron is increased; the hotter the blast the greater the
                    richness in manganese of the pig, at least with the ores used in the Siegen

                    These higher manganiferous irons show little or no magnetic action.</p>
                <p>During the early period of the development of the fused steel industry, the
                    richer manganeisens (containing 15 per cent, and upward of manganese) used for
                    crucible steels were themselves prepared in crucibles, the term
                    “ferro-manganese” being applied to these products, “spiegeleisen” indicating the
                    less manganiferous pig containing some 6 or 7 per cent, of manganese prepared in
                    the blast furnace; subsequently, however, the blast furnace spiegeleisens of
                    commerce were prepared much richer in manganese than formerly, whilst
                    ferro-manganese of 30 and upwards per cent, of manganese came into use prepared
                    by Henderson’s method, viz., by reducing upon the open hearth of a Siemens
                    furnace a mixture of manganese carbonate (obtained from bleaching powder
                    residues or “still-liquor ”) and ferric oxide in presence of excess of carbon, a
                    neutral or slight reducing flame being employed. The furnace bottom is made of
                    coke ground up and consolidated, so as virtually to form a large carbon shallow
                    crucible or basin,—the finely divided mixture being put in and the temperature
                    raised to a low red heat for some hours. A metallic sponge is obtained which
                    subsequently runs down to a regulus when the temperature is raised to a full

                    exerted by silica; if much of that substance be present the product is
                    comparatively poor in manganese, a green slag (mainly manganese silicate) being
                    formed; a very high temperature too is essential; of late years blast furnace
                    manganeιsens have almost superseded these open hearth products. Alloys
                    containing 25, 50, 75, and even more per cent, of manganese are usually employed
                    in the manufacture of so-called extra soft steels (or more properly fused
                    irons), the use of spiegeleisen being in such cases inadmissible inasmuch as too
                    high a degree of carbonization would be effected if sufficient spiegeleisen were
                    added to communicate as much manganese as is desired to be present; thus at

                    are added to 100 of the decarbonized product from the Siemens-Martin hearth or
                    Bessemer converter, thus communicating some 0 <hi rend="superscript"> -</hi> 7
                    per cent, of manganese with less than 0Ί per cent of carbon; whereas were
                    spiegeleisen used at 8 per cent, manganese only, either the carbon percentage
                    λvould be far too great, or the manganese λvould be too low to give the
                    particular physical qualities required. For the manufacture of spiegeleisen the
                    franklinite of New Jersey (essentially a compound of ferric oxide with oxides of
                    zinc and manganese) has been long utilized, being first heated with anthracite
                    so as to reduce and distil off most of the zinc (the vapour of which is allowed
                    to oxidize, the resulting oxide being collected), and then smelted in small
                    blast furnaces with anthracite and limestone flux with a large excess of fuel
                    (about three times the weight of spiegeleisen run or more).</p>

                    best results are obtained when a certain quantity of manganese remains unreduced
                    and escapes in the slag, which should have about the following composition to
                    give the best results :—</p>

                <p>Much more richly manganiferous metals than this have been obtained in the blast
                    furnace by W. G. Ward (Cartersville, Georgia) by simply increasing the amount of
                    lime added, and employing a smaller burden; in this way ferro-manganese of
                    upwards of 50 per cent, has been manufactured readily, about three-fifths of the
                    manganese in the charge being reduced. Analogous metals have been obtained by
                    many other smelters; thus specimens of ferro-manganese containing upwards of 80
                    per cent, of manganese and prepared in the <hi rend="subscript"> o</hi> blast
                    furnace were exhibited in the Paris exhibition. According to Akermann, to
                    produce ferro-manganese of 85 per cent, in the blast furnace is a matter of no
                    great difficulty, but the consumption of coke is about four times greater than
                    that required for common pig iron, whilst the daily output is only about
                    one-fourth of that of the latter. No advantage attends the production of
                    manganeisen of upwards of about 80 percent., but rather the contrary, richer
                    metal being very brittle. It is noteworthy that, notwithstanding the use of much
                    more fuel in a furnace smelting rich manganeisen, the escaping gases do not
                    contain more carbon oxide than (and often not as much as) those of an ordinary
                    blast furnace, the extra oxygen in the carbon dioxide escaping coming from the
                    higher oxides of manganese employed as manganese ores. A description of the
                    older modes of producing spiegeleisen in Germany is given in a report by Wiborg
                    to the Swedish iron office <hi rend="italic">{Jern-Kontorets Annalcr,</hi> 1870;
                    also in abstract in <hi rend="italic">Journal I. and S. Inst.,</hi> 1872,
                    138).</p>
                <p>When lime fluxes are employed, it is indispensable that they should not contain
                    phosphorus; thus the spiegeleisen prepared in New Jersey from franklinite was
                    found to contain phosphorus to a decidedly prejudicial extent when oyster shells
                    were employed as flux, but ceased to do so when good limestone was used instead.
                    It is noteworthy, however, that when a highly manganiferous iron is smelted a
                    considerably larger preparation of phosphorus finds its way into the cinder and
                    less into the pig than is the case when the resulting pig contains less
                    manganese; and the same remark is also largely true of sulphur.</p>
                <p>According to several chemists and metallurgists as the percentage of manganese in
                    manganeisen increases, so, roughly speaking, that of carbon decreases; so that
                    whilst spiegeleisen of 7 or 8 per cent, manganese usually contains some 4 or 5
                    per cent, of carbon and sometimes more, ferromanganese of 20 per cent, manganese
                    contains much less carbon, and when the manganese attains to 30 per cent, and
                    upwards the carbon becomes diminished to something below 1 per cent., being
                    often as low as 0 ’ 4 or even 0 ’ 25 per cent. (Henderson). Others, however,
                    have obtained diametrically opposite results; thus Riley and Grüner both find
                    that the carbon percentage increases <hi rend="italic">pari passu</hi> with that
                    of manganese. The peculiar large mirror-like crystals from which the term
                    “spiegeleisen” (mirror iron) is derived are not exhibited by ferro-manganese
                    containing large amounts of manganese.</p>
                <p>By mixing finely divided iron (sponge, filings, turnings of cast or wrought iron
                    or steel, &amp;c.) with finely powdered ores of manganese, tungsten, or
                    titanium, or with quartz in suitable quantity, moistening with dilute acid or
                    ammoniacal solution, and compressing into lumps, hard masses are formed (after
                    standing a few hours) which can be heated to a red heat without breaking up. By
                    melting these in a small cupola furnace with a crucible or hearth of alumina,
                    magnesia, or lime, or of hard carbon and a tuyere letting in a hot blast just
                    above the top of the hearth, manganeisens and siliconeisens containing up to 75
                    per cent, of manganese or 22 per cent, of silicon, or iron-tungsten or
                    iron-titanium alloys, or ternary alloys can be readily produced <hi

                <p><hi rend="italic">Silicoηciseη.—</hi> In order to produce highly silicious iron,
                    according to Jordan, the main conditions are that the blast shall be extremely
                    hot, the furnace not driving rapidly, and that the charge whilst containing much
                    silica shall be highly aluminous and not markedly calcareous. An accident at the
                    Heardt iron-works, Dusseldorf, necessitated the shutting off of the majority of
                    the blast, three tuyeres instead of six being used, and the pressure being
                    reduced from 15-18 to about 10 centimetres of mercury <hi rend="italic"
                    >{i.e.,</hi> from about 3 1 to 1'9 lb per square inch); the blast became highly

                    1, the coke being 42 cwts. per ton of iron. Under these conditions a pig was run
                    containing silicon 7 9, phosphorus 0 ’ 72, and carbon 2 ’ 60 per cent. Analogous
                    results as regards increased percentage of silicon on decreasing lime and
                    increasing alumina relatively to the silicon have been observed in various other
                    instances. Troost and Hautefeuille consider that the presence of alkaline
                    silicates in the furnace promotes the siliconizing of the iron,—the alkali
                    metals formed at a high temperature by the reduction of the alkalies reacting
                    whilst still nascent on the silica, and thus reducing it; a mixture of potassium
                    carbonate, charcoal, iron <pb break="no"

                    affords a cast iron containing 15-16 per cent, of silicon and nearly 3 per cent,
                    carbon; lime or calcium silicate on the other hand removes silicon from
                    silicious iron when the two are melted together. It is a matter of usual belief
                    that silicon expels sulphur from pig iron; at any rate the conditions most
                    favourable to production of highly silicious pig are not so favourable to the
                    presence of sulphur, and hence grey silicious pig is much less sulphurized than
                    white pig made from the same materials. According to Riley the greater the
                    percentage of silicon in siliconeisen the smaller is the amount of carbon
                    present, so that when 15 or 20 per cent, of silicon is present the carbon is
                    reduced to a very small amount <hi rend="italic">Silicon-</hi><hi rend="italic"

                    methods of making rich spiegeleisens by increasing the amount of silica present
                    and using large amounts of fuel. For the purpose of preventing “blowholes” in
                    cast soft steels containing but little carbon, an alloy containing about 8 per
                    cent, of silicon, 14-15 of manganese, and about 1 ’ 3 per cent, of carbon, has
                    been extensively used at Terre Noire. The steel thus produced gave the following

                    termed, is closely allied to manganeisen; the capabilities of this substance for
                    the most part yet remain undeveloped, but the effect of the chromium is
                    analogous in some respects to that of manganese, in others to that of carbon,
                    communicating a fine close texture with hardness and brittleness when present in
                    any quantity. Chromeisens containing 10 per cent, and upwards of chromium have
                    been prepared by crucible operations, and of somewhat less richness in the blast
                    furnace from ores containing a notable amount of chrome ironstone; Sergius Kern
                    obtained a very hard chromeisen containing 74 per cent, of chromium and 25 of
                    iron by heating chrome ironstone and charcoal powder in graphite crucibles. The
                    Tasmanian Iron Company produced from Tasmanian ores a pig containing some 6 or 7
                    per cent, of chromium and 4 of carbon; • according to Riley a mixture of this
                    pig with ordinary haematite pig (half and half) would not puddle well, being
                    incapable of welding and forming a bloom on account of the thick cinder; with
                    less chromeisen (one-tenth) the puddling period was prolonged; a little of the
                    chromium remained unoxidized in the iron without materially _ affecting its
                    qualities; at first the ordinary grey pig melted whilst the chromium pig
                    remained unfused. By melting chromium pig containing upwards of 0 <hi
                    rend="superscript"> ,</hi> 2 per cent, of sulphur with ferro-manganese, the
                    sulphur becomes almost entirely eliminated, the resulting product only
                    containing 0 ‘035 per cent.; on adding it (in a fused state) to blown Bessemer
                    metal a product was obtained not at all resembling good manganiferous Bessemer
                    steel, as it crumbled under the hammer at a red heat. The experience of a
                    Sheffield firm as to the tempering qualities of chromium steel has been very
                    unsatisfactory; and Boussingault states that he was unable to give to iron any
                    of the useful properties of steel by adding chromium unless carbon were also
                    present; on the other hand, it has been stated that in America mining tools made
                    of chromium steel have been found to be more durable than any others, the
                    tempering being readily managed. Yet again, R. Brown finds that by adding
                    potassium dichromate to blown Bessemer metal or other varieties of steel a
                    certain amount of chromium is reduced and counteracts the evil effects of
                    phosphorus, steel so made being capable of being bent and twisted cold even
                    though containing as much as 1 per cent, of phosphorus; thus samples of steel so
                    prepared gave the following numerical results <hi rend="italic">(Joum. I. and S.

                <p>42. <hi rend="italic">Hardening, Tempering, and Annealing of Steel.—</hi> It has
                    been already stated (§ 3) that the characteristic property of steel as
                    distinguished from malleable iron is that when heated red hot and suddenly
                    cooled (by plunging into cold water, oil, mercury, &amp;c.) it becomes hardened
                    to a greater or lesser extent, and rendered more or less brittle and also
                    elastic; when the steel thus hardened is heated red hot and cooled slowly, on
                    the other hand, it loses this acquired hardness and becomes soft and malleable
                    again; this inverse process is strictly termed “softening” or “annealing.” The
                    generic phrase “tempering” is usually applied to mean a combination of the
                    hardening and annealing processes practically applied to all steel goods in
                    order to give such a degree of hardness as will best fit them for resisting wear
                    and tear, conjoined with the minimum possible of brittleness,—this being
                    effected by first hardening them by heating to a red heat and suddenly cooling,
                    and then heating up again to a somewhat lower temperature and allowing to cool
                    slowly. According to the temperature to which the hardened steel has been heated
                    before annealing, so is the diminution in the hardness effected by the process;
                    and the particular resultant combination of hardness with toughness and
                    elasticity is spoken of as the “temper” of the steel. Occasionally, however,
                    this latter phrase is applied in somewhat different senses; thus steels of
                    different carbon percentages are sometimes said to differ in temper irrespective
                    of whether they have actually been hardened and annealed or not; the term
                    “tempering capacity” or “hardening capacity” would better express the idea.
                    Sometimes again, especially amongst “practical” men and workmen, the phrase “to
                    temper a tool” is understood as signifying simply to harden it; whilst on the
