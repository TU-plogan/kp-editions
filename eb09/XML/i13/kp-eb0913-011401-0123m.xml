                <p>I. <hi rend="smallcaps">Cuneiform.</hi><hi> INSCRIPTIONS</hi> in characters
                    sometimes termed cuneiform or wedge-shaped, sometimes arrow-headed, have been
                    found throughout a large part of western Asia,—in Persia and Babylonia, Assyria
                    and Media, Armenia and Mesopotamia. The names given to the characters are
                    derived from their form, as some of them resemble the points of arrows, though
                    most have the appearance of wedges, thicker at one end than at the other. This
                    appearance is due to the fact that the characters were originally impressed upon
                    moist clay by a metal stylus, and the form consequently assumed by them was
                    subsequently imitated by the engraver upon stone and metal. The characters were
                    primarily pictorial, but in course of time the outlines of the primitive
                    pictures came to be alone preserved, while the nature of the writing materials
                    caused curves to become angles, and rounded lines straight ones.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Varieties of Cuneiform Writing.—</hi> The original home of the
                    cuneiform system of writing was either Elam or Babylonia, the inventors of the
                    hieroglyphics in which it originated being the ancient Accadian population of
                    Chaldea. It passed from the latter to a number of other nations, undergoing at
                    the same time a variety of modifications. It was first borrowed by the Semitic
                    settlers in Babylonia and Assyria, and from them it was handed on to the
                    Turanian tribes of India, the Alarodians of ancient Armenia, and the Aryans of
                    Persia, while the Turanian inhabitants of Elam or Susiania preserved the system
                    as it had been in use among the Accadians of Chaldea.</p>
                <p>In Babylonia, Assyria, Susiania, and Media the forms of the characters underwent
                    several changes at successive periods, the tendency in each case being to
                    simplify the characters by dropping superfluous wedges. In Babylonia we have to
                    distinguish between the archaic, the linear, the hieratic, and the later forms
                    of the characters. The archaic forms are principally found on bricks and
                    cylinders of the Accadian epoch (before 2000 <hi rend="smallcaps">b,c.),</hi>
                    and are the oldest forms of the characters of which we have contemporary
                    specimens. The linear forms were in use at the same time, and are marked off
                    from the archaic forms by being written in continuous lines instead of a series
                    of wedges, and sometimes also by a closer resemblance to the original pictures
                    from which they were derived. The hieratic forms were mainly employed between
                    the overthrow of the Accadian power (about 1700 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.)</hi>
                    and the 8th century <hi rend="smallcaps">b,c.,</hi> more especially for
                    contracts and similar documents. The later forms may be seen on the monuments of
                    Nebuchadnezzar and his successors, a further modification of them being used for
                    the Babylonian transcripts of the Persian cuneiform inscriptions. In Assyria
                    also we may classify the characters as archaic, hieratic, and later (or
                    Ninevite), though the forms they assumed in Assyria were not identical with
                    those used in Babylonia which we have called by similar names. The hieratic
                    forms were mainly employed in Assyria for ornamental or religious purposes, and
                    may be compared with our own black letter. In Susiania the archaic forms of the
                    characters lingered to the last, though in the northern part of the country
                    simplified forms were in use. In Media a considerable difference may be observed
                    between the peculiar forms of many characters in the older inscriptions of
                    Mai-Amir and the forms borne by them in the Protomedic transcripts of the
                    Persian monuments. The Armenian or Vannic characters were the same as those of
                    Assyria, except that where one line or wedge had to be drawn across another, it
                    was broken into two. But this was to prevent the stone from breaking at the
                    point of section.</p>
                <p>It will be noticed that the cuneiform characters were employed to express very
                    different languages. The Accadian, like the allied dialects of Susiania and
                    primitive Media, was agglutinative, and probably belonged to the Ural-Altaic
                    family of speech; Assyrian and later Babylonian were Semitic; Persian was East
                    Aryan; while the Armenian of Van seems to claim affinity with that Alarodian
                    group of tongues of which Georgian may be regarded as the modern
                    representative.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">The Origin and Development of the Cuneiform System of
                    Writing.—</hi> As already stated, the cuneiform characters were in their origin
                    pictorial. In many cases it is possible to restore the primitive hieroglyphics
                    or ideographs by the help of the archaic and linear Babylonian forms, and a
                    fragment of a clay tablet has been discovered on which the pictorial originals
                    of a few characters are given. In order to restore the primitive pictures, it is
                    frequently necessary to turn a character upon its side, from which we may infer
                    that the ideographs were once written vertically like Chinese. Thus &lt;( J&gt;-
                    <hi rend="subscript"> j</hi> the ideograph of “an eye,” is plainly a
                    representation of the eye in a vertical position.</p>
                <p>The primitive pictures denoted either objects or ideas, the latter being
                    represented metaphorically by the picture of one or more objects. “Life,” for
                    example, was expressed by the picture of a growing flower, “a month” by placing
                    the numeral xxx. within the circle of the sun, which symbolized the day. But the
                    same picture might denote more than one idea or object. Thus the circle of the
                    sun represented not only “the sun” and “the day,” but also “light,”
                    “brilliance,” and the like; and a pair of legs represented the ideas of “going,”
                    “w·alking,” and “running.” By combining two or more ideographs together, fresh
                    ideas might be symbolized to an almost infinite extent; “drinking,” for example,
                    is denoted by placing the three drops which denoted water within the picture of
                    the mouth, “language” by substituting the tongue for the three drops of water,
                    and “a tear” by setting the ideograph of water before that of the eye.</p>
                <p>Out of this early picture-writing there soon grew a syllabary. Accadian was an
                    agglutinative language, which was already largely affected by phonetic decay,
                    the result being that on the one hand the same word might be used indifferently
                    for noun, verb, and adverb, as in English, while on the other hand the loss of
                    final sounds had reduced a great part of the vocabulary to the condition of
                    monosyllables. Ideographs consequently came to be associated with the sounds of
                    the words which they primarily or most usually represented, and these words were
                    mostly monosyllabic. Thus the ideograph of “month” <hi rend="italic">(itii)</hi>
                    was known as <hi rend="italic">id</hi> or <hi rend="italic">it,</hi> that of
                    “going” <hi rend="italic">(dun)</hi> as <hi rend="italic">du,</hi> that of
                    “drinking” as <hi rend="italic">nak,</hi> that of a “tear” as <hi rend="italic"
                    >ir.</hi></p>
                <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit13newyrich/page/n126/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0913-0126-0115"/>
                <p>But the same object or idea was frequently expressed by more than one name, while
                    each of the ideas represented by a single sign was naturally denoted by a
                    different word. Hence the same ideograph, or character, as we may now term it,
                    had varying pronunciations assigned to it according to its meaning and use; the
                    ideograph of the “sun,” for instance, was called, not only <hi rend="italic"
                    >ut</hi> or <hi rend="italic">ud</hi> (for <hi rend="italic">utu),</hi> but also
                    <hi rend="italic">par</hi> (for <hi rend="italic">para), tarn, lakh,</hi> and
                    <hi rend="italic">khis.</hi> Thus the ideographs, as soon as they came to appeal
                    to the ear as well as to the eye, were necessarily polyphonous.</p>
                <p>A further step in advance was now taken. An ideograph continued to represent the
                    pronunciation of the word for which it originally stood even when it no longer
                    represented the word itself; that is to say, the pronunciation of the word it
                    denoted became attached to it as a mere phonetic value. This important
                    innovation, which amounted to a change of the old picture-writing into a
                    syllabary, must have taken place at an early period in its history. Though
                    native proper names, which were always significant, could be written
                    ideographically, it was necessary to find some other way of denoting foreign
                    proper names, which had no meaning in Accadian. The pronouns, moreover, must
                    have been a difficulty from the first, and the fact that these are invariably
                    represented in Accadian, not by ideographs, but by characters used phonetically,
                    indicates a very early date for the employment of the characters to represent
                    syllabic sounds as well as ideas. This is borne out by the existence of several
                    compound characters, in which the second element denotes only the pronunciation
                    of the words for which they stand. The picture of a corpse, for example, had the
                    phonetic value of <hi rend="italic">bat,</hi> since <hi rend="italic">bat,</hi>
                    meant “corpse” and “death” in Accadian; but, as <hi rend="italic">bat</hi> also
                    signified “a fortress,” the ideograph of “corpse” was inserted within the
                    ideograph of “enclosure,” not because there was any relationship between the
                    ideas of “death” and “fortress,” but to indicate that the character which meant
                    an enclosure was to be interpreted as signifying “a fortress,” and to be
                    pronounced <hi rend="italic">bat.</hi> So, too, the usual word for “going” was
                    <hi rend="italic">dun</hi> or <hi rend="italic">du</hi>; but there was another
                    word <hi rend="italic">ara</hi> or <hi rend="italic">ra</hi> with the same
                    meaning, and when the latter was intended to be read the fact was pointed out by
                    attaching the character which had the phonetic value of <hi rend="italic"
                    >ra</hi> to the ideograph which expressed the idea of “going.”</p>
                <p>While the characters could thus be used as mere phonetic symbols, some few of
                    them could be employed, on the other hand, for the language of the eye only.
                    These were the determinative prefixes and affixes, such as the eight-rayed star,
                    which represented a deity, or the shaded circle, which denoted a country or
                    place. Their original use seems to have been to mark out those groups of
                    characters which had to be read phonetically, and not as ideographs.</p>
                <p>Like the lexicographers of China, the lexicographers of Accad attempted to
                    classify and arrange the characters of their syllabary. Every character received
                    a name of its own, so that literary works could be copied from dictation. A list
                    of primary characters was first drawn up, each of which was named from the
                    object it originally represented. The remaining characters were regarded as
                    compounds, and divided into two classes. The first class consisted of characters
                    which differed from the primary ones in having extra wedges, the second class of
                    those that were reallycom-pounds. This classification of the syllabary must have
                    been completed at a very remote date, since the analysis of many of the compound
                    characters can only be explained by the forms they bear in archaic Babylonian,
                    and in some cases even the archaic Babylonian forms are not sufficiently
                    primitive. We may gather from this some idea of the epoch to which the invention
                    of the cuneiform system of writing reaches back.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">The Transmission of the Cuneiform Characters.—</hi> As far back
                    as the second millennium <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> Semitic tribes were in
                    possession of a part of Chaldea. Duigi, the son and successor of the first
                    Accadian monarch of whom we have contemporaneous record, has left us an
                    inscription in which the cuneiform system of writing is adapted to the
                    expression of a Semitic language. By the 17th century <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >b.c.</hi> the Accadian language seems to have been wholly superseded by Semitic
                    Babylonian and its northern dialect Assyrian. Along with other elements of
                    civilization, the Semites received the cuneiform system of writing from their
                    predecessors, and in the process of transmission the transformation of the old
                    picture-writing into a syllabary was completed. The Accadian words represented
                    by the characters when used as ideographs became phonetic values, and, since the
                    same ideograph usually represented several different words, almost every
                    character was polyphonous. It is true that some of these Accadian words, and
                    even some of the phonetic values borne by the characters in Accadian, were
                    rejected by the Semites, but on the other hand new phonetic values attached
                    themselves to a few of the characters derived from the Semitic pronunciation of
                    the latter when employed ideographically. For the Semites continued to use the
                    characters on occasions ideographically as well as syllabically.</p>
                <p>A greater extension was also given to the employment of determinative prefixes;
                    the name of an individual, for instance, is always preceded by an upright wedge,
                    the names of a country and a city by the ideographs which stand for these two
                    ideas. The reader was assisted towards knowing when a character was used as an
                    ideograph by the employment of phonetic complements, that is to say, characters
                    which denoted the last syllable of the word intended to be read. Thus, when the
                    ideograph , “to conquer,” is followed by the syllable <hi rend="italic">ud,</hi>
                    we may infer that it must be pronounced <hi rend="italic">αcsud,</hi> “I
                    conquered,” or some other person of the past tense of the same verb.</p>
                <p>The real difficulty the cuneiform syllabary offers to the decipherer is not the
                    polyphony of the characters, but one which would not have been felt by the
                    Assyrians themselves. Accadian and Assyrian phonology did not always agree, and
                    in borrowing the Accadian system of writing the Assyrians had to adapt the
                    sounds of their own language, as best they could, to the phonetic symbols of
                    another. Consequently no distinction in writing is made between final <hi

                <p>The Assyrians continued to follow the example of the Babylonians in writing on
                    clay, but they also made use of papyrus and stone. This literature on clay is
                    very extensive, and embraces every branch of study known at the time. For an
                    account of it see <hi rend="smallcaps">Babylonia,</hi> vol. iii. p. 191.</p>
                <p>The learned court of Assur-bani-pal in the 7th century <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >b.c.</hi> amused itself with essays in Accadian composition, the extinct
                    language of primitive Babylonia standing in much the same relation to the
                    Assyrians that Latin does to us. But literary Assyrian itself was fast becoming
                    an artificial dialect. The Aramaean alphabet was introduced into Nineveh at
                    least as early as the 8th century <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.,</hi> and, though
                    Nebuchadnezzar and his successors continued to employ the cuneiform syllabary,
                    the conquest of Babylon by Cyrus was a blow from which the old mode of writing
                    never recovered. The literary dialect and the characters in which it was
                    inscribed were more and more disused, and finally disappeared altogether.
                    Commercial tablets, however, dated in the reigns of the earlier Arsacid princes,
                    <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit13newyrich/page/n127/mode/1up"

                    Oppert’s identification is correct, a deed of sale, now in the Zurich museum,
                    and written in cuneiform characters, is dated in the fifth year of Pacorus, the
                    contemporary of Domitian.</p>
                <p>The Assyrian syllabary was borrowed by the Armenians and Minnians of Lake Van in
                    the reign of a certain king named Lutipri in the 9th century <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> The characters both in form and use are identical
                    with those of Nineveh, except that the Armenians rejected the polyphony of the
                    Assyrian syllabary, and with one or two exceptions used each sign with one
                    phonetic value only.</p>
                <p>After the occupation of Armenia by the Aryans, the use of the cuneiform character
                    seems to have been discontinued, and no “Vannic” or Armenian cuneiform
                    inscriptions are known to exist of later date than the 7th century <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi></p>
                <p>The example set by the Armenians seems to have been soon followed by their
                    Turanian neighbours in Media. The earliest specimens of the so-called Protomedic
                    (or Amardian) syllabary are to be found in the inscriptions of Mai-Amir and
                    Sherif Khan. The syllabary of Nineveh appears to have been again the source from
                    which the new script was borrowed. As among the Armenians, polyphony was
                    rejected, a few ideographs only were used, and a selected number of characters
                    employed. The Protomedic transcripts of the Persian inscriptions are written in
                    this syllabary. In Susiania or Elam the archaic Babylonian form of cuneiform
                    continued in use up to the last.</p>
                <p>It was reserved for the Aryans of Persia to discover the ultimate capabilities of
                    the cuneiform system of writing by reducing its characters to an alphabet of
                    forty letters. These were divided into two classes, those with an inherent vowel
                    <hi rend="italic">a,</hi> and those which were followed by <hi rend="italic"
                    >u</hi> and <hi rend="italic">i.</hi> At the same time all superfluous wedges
                    were thrown away, and the forms of the characters thus simplified as much as
                    their pronunciation. Dr Oppert has pointed out the principle upon which the
                    formation of this new alphabet was carried out. Some one meaning was selected
                    among those a character might bear when used as an ideograph, and this was
                    rendered by its Persian equivalent. The initial sound of the latter was the
                    alphabetic value henceforth represented by the character. Thus “time of life,”
                    <hi rend="italic">'Zaya</hi> in Persian, was contracted into and made to
                    represent ⅛ (a, w). A few ideographs were retained along with the alphabetic
                    characters. The Persian cuneiform alphabet, called “Assyrian letters” by
                    Herodotus, seems to have been invented in the early part of the reign of Darius,
                    and, being confined to monumental purposes, soon fell into disuse.</p>
                <p>Possibly the reduction of the cuneiform syllabary into an alphabet was suggested
                    by a previous acquaintance with alphabetic writing. In the Persian inscriptions
                    the words are divided from one another by an oblique wedge. A similar division
                    of words is found in one or two Assyrian inscriptions.</p>

                <p>An account has already been given (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Alphabet)</hi> of the
                    derivation of the Phoenician alphabet from the hieratic alphabet of the Egyptian
                    papyri of the middle empire. No early monuments written in it have as yet been
                    found; the first known examples belong to a time when the alphabet had been
                    widely spread and a literature had long existed. At this time we find the
                    alphabet divided into two branches, the Phoenician and the Aramaean, the first
                    being again subdivided into archaic and Sidonian. The last two are chiefly
                    distinguished by the form of the <hi rend="italic">φ</hi><hi rend="italic
                    subscript"> f</hi> which is angular in the first and rounded in the second.</p>
                <p>The earliest inscription in the Phoenician alphabet known to us is the stele of
                    Mesha, king of Moab, found at Dhibân and belonging to the 9th century <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> In this Mesha relates that after the death of Ahab
                    his god Chemosh enabled him to shake off the yoke of. Israel, to drive the
                    Gadites out of Ataroth, and to fortify Kir-hareseth, Aroer, Horonaim, Dibon, and
                    other places. The language of the inscription differs only dialectically from
                    Hebrew.</p>
                <p>To the same form of the alphabet belong most of the Phoenician inscriptions on
                    the engraved gems brought of late years from Assyria and Babylonia, among which
                    may be mentioned a cone with the image of a “golden calf” and the names Shemaiah
                    and Azariah (innrø p 1Π <hi rend="superscript"> ,,</hi> ycκ⅛Ι. The Aramaic
                    legends on the bilingual lion-weights of Nimrud, which date from the reign of
                    Tiglath-Pileser II. (745-727 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi>) downwards, also
                    belong to the same form of the alphabet. With these inscriptions may be classed
                    the Phoenician inscription on a bowl lately restored by M. Clermont Ganneau,
                    which mentions a King Hiram, and had been brought with other merchandise from
                    Phoenicia to Cyprus, where it was found. Of later date are the <hi rend="italic"
                    >graffiti</hi> scratched on the legs of the colossi at Abu-Simbel in Nubia by
                    Phoenician travellers or mercenaries.</p>
                <p>The most important monument of the Sidonian period of the Phoenician alphabet is
                    the sarcophagus of Eshmun’azar, son of Tabnith (1 Tennes), “king of the
                    Sidonians,” which is probably of the Gth century <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi>
                    It may, however, be later. The inscription upon it states that Eshmun’azar had
                    restored the ruined temples of Sidon, and prays the gods to preserve to that
                    city the possession of “Dor, Joppa, and the rich cornlands in the plain of
                    Sharon.” Other noteworthy monuments of the same period are the so-called “Second
                    Sidonian Inscription,” which records the installation of a subordinate “king of
                    Sidon” by a “king of the Sidonians” of Phoenicia; the inscriptions from Citium
                    in Cyprus of King Pumyathon and his father Melecyathon in the 4th century <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">b.c.,</hi> as well as the bilingual Phoenician-Greek and
                    Phoenician-Cypriote inscriptions from the same island, the Phoenician-Cypriote
                    inscription of Melecyathon having furnished Mr George Smith with the key to the
                    Cypriote syllabary; together with six inscriptions from Athens and two from
                    Malta; and the three inscriptions found by M. Renan at Umm’-el-Awâmid on the
                    Phoenician coast.</p>
                <p>The numerous dedicatory inscriptions found on the site of Carthage are written in
                    what is termed the Punic development of the Sidonian alphabet; all apparently
                    belong to the Greek period. The most important Punic inscription is the tariff
                    of sacrifices found at Marseilles in 1845, an abridged edition of which was
                    discovered on the site of Carthage by Mr Davis in 1860. The regulations
                    contained in it have a striking analogy to many of those of Leviticus. Its date,
                    however, cannot be very early, since it makes no mention of human sacrifices.
                    The Punic alphabet was the source of those of Numidia and Boetica, where
                    inscriptions have been found.</p>
                <p>The series of Aramaean inscriptions begins with the dockets on Assyrian
                    contract-tablets of the age of Tiglath-Pileser II. and his successors, when
                    Nineveh and Carchemish became the chief centres of trade in western Asia. To the
                    same period may be assigned an interesting gem from Babylonia inscribed ∏τ∏ny ∏n
                    ΠB&gt;p2⅛ as well as the cylinder of the eunuch Achadban, son of Gebrod, from
                    Babylonia, and the cone of Hadrakiâ, son of Hurbad, from Nineveh. As already
                    observed, the inscriptions on the Assyrian lion-weights, though in the archaic
                    Phoenician form of the alphabet, are Aramaic in language. Passing over the
                    engraved stones of the Achaemenian epoch, we may notice the famous bronze lion
                    of Abydos, belonging probably to the 5th century <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.,</hi>
                    on which an Aramaic legend is written. Of considerably later date is the

                    in characters which resemble those of the Aramaean papyri of Ptolemaic Egypt.
                    The alphabet of the latter, however, is still more closely represented by
                    certain funereal monuments found in Egypt with Aramaean inscriptions, the best
                    known of which is the inscription of Carpentras, which records the death of a
                    priestess of Osiris.</p>
                <p>Starting from the 1st century <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.,</hi> the ruins of
                    Palmyra and Taiba have furnished us with a large number of inscriptions in the
                    Aramaic dialect of the locality. MM. de Vogué and Waddington alone have
                    discovered more than a hundred of them. Most of them are written in what may be
                    termed uncial characters, but there are a few in a cursive hand. Among the
                    persons mentioned in them is Odeinath (Odenatus), the husband of Zenobia.
                    Palmyrene inscriptions have been met with in Africa and Rome, and a bilingual
                    one (in Palmyrene and Latin) has lately been found at South Shields.</p>
                <p>Professor Sachau has recently discovered two inscriptions in Old Syriac
                    characters, one at Zebed, near Palmyra, accompanied by Greek and archaic Arabic
                    transcripts, and the other among the early Christian tombs of Edessa.<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>The inscription at Zebed was
                    first noticed by Dr Bischoff. The letters seem to be derived from an Aramaic
                    alphabet. Some of them resemble the enigmatical characters on gems from
                    Diarbekir and the neighbouring district, published by Dr Mordtmann in the <hi
                    rend="italic">Z. D. Μ. G.,</hi> xxxi. 4 (1877).</p></note></p>
                <p>Passing over an Aramaic legend found by Μ. de Saulcy on a sarcophagus of the
                    tombs of the kings at Jerusalem, and the coins of the kings of Edessa, we may
                    notice the Mendaite inscription of twenty lines discovered in a tomb at
                    Abu-Shadr in southern Babylonia, and first explained by Dietrich. It probably
                    belongs to the 4th or 5th century. Inscriptions in Western Aramaic have been
                    found in the Hauran. Among these is one on a tomb at Sueydeh, raised by Odeinath
                    to his wife Hamrath in the time of Herod, the Great, accompanied by a Greek
                    transcript. Six other inscriptions of the same period come from the temple of
                    Siah; one of them is dedicated to the god Katsiu, the Zeus Kasios of the
                    Greeks.</p>
                <p>The Hauran, more particularly the neighbourhood of Bozra, has also yielded a
                    number of Nabathean inscriptions, written in a sort of Aramaic running hand.
                    Nabathean inscriptions have further been found at Umm ’ er-Russas in Moab, and
                    at Petra, as well as on the coins of Aretas and other Nabathean princes. But
                    they are specially numerous on the rocks of Sinai, where they were scratched by
                    pilgrims in the 3d and 4th centuries of our era, and were first deciphered by
                    Beer. They consist for the most part of proper names, preceded or followed by
                    the word <hi rend="italic">shâlom,</hi> “peace.” The Aramaic dialect of these
                    inscriptions is tinctured by Arabisms, among which may be mentioned the use of
                    the article <hi rend="italic">el.</hi> Two Nabathean inscriptions have been
                    discovered at Pozzuoli, where, as we learn from the Acts, there was a Jewish
                    colony.</p>
                <p>The Nestorian Syrians carried their language and letters as far even as China.
                    The celebrated inscription of Si-gan-fu is written in good Estrangelo of the 8th
                    century. A Hebrew inscription has also been found at Khaï-fong-fu.</p>
                <p>Ancient Hebrew epigraphy is poorly represented. The earliest Hebrew inscriptions
                    are three from Siloam, one of which is addressed to “Baal of the temple,” a
                    fragment found in the streets of Jerusalem by Μ. Vernes, and a boundary stone
                    discovered by Μ. Ganneau near Gezer. The royal names on the pottery found near
                    the foundations of Solomon’s temple are not Hebrew, but Phoenician. The
                    Maccabean period has left us several inscribed monuments and coins. The oldest
                    are the epitaph of eight members of the priestly family of Hezir (1 Chr. xxiv.
                    15) on the Doric tomb of St James at Jerusalem, the beginning of an inscription
                    on a monument to the north-west of Jerusalem, and an inscription on the
                    sarcophagus found by De Saulcy in the tomb of the kings, which probably belongs
                    to a female relative of Helen, queen of Adiabene, in the 1st century of our era.
                    Other early inscriptions have been copied in Galilee, especially in the
                    synagogues of Kefr-Bereim as well as in the Jewish catacombs on the Via
                    Portuensis at Rome. From the 10th century onwards the Jewish cemeteries in
                    Spain, Italy, the south of France, Turkey, and Egypt enable us to trace the
                    history of Hebrew writing up to the close of the Middle Ages; and Professor
                    Ascoli has lately drawn attention to the inscriptions in the Jewish cemetery of
                    Venosa, which enable us to fill up the gap that had previously existed between
                    the memorials of the 10th century and those of the 4th. We must not forget also
                    the exorcisms, written in a dialect allied to that of the Mishna on bronze bowls
                    found at Babylon by Sir A. H. Layard, or the sepulchral inscriptions collected
                    by Firkowitz in a Karaite cemetery of the Crimea, dated sometimes from the
                    creation, sometimes from the capture of Samaria. The latter belong to the 9th
                    and following centuries, though the discoverer falsified the dates of many of

                <p>Arabic epigraphy begins with the rise of Islam. . Two systems of writing were
                    used concomitantly, the Cufic or uncial, and the Neski or running hand, neither
                    of which, however, can be derived from the other. The earliest inscriptions yet
                    known are two sepulchral ones, the first of which has been published by
                    Wetzstein, Waddington, and De Vogué, while the other has lately been discovered
                    by Sachau at Zebed. A Cufic inscription, dated 693 <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >a.d.,</hi> has been copied by De Vogué, at Jerusalem, and the old cemetery near
                    Assuan contains a large number of similar inscriptions, some of which, as
                    deciphered by Count Amari, contain the names of the companions of the prophet.
                    Unfortunately this cemetery has never been thoroughly examined. Mention may also
                    be made of Cufic inscriptions at Bozra, in Sicily, and elsewhere. Inscriptions
                    in Greek and Neski Arabic have been found at Damascus, Tiberias, and other
                    places, one of which is dated 696 <hi rend="smallcaps">a.d.,</hi> while others
                    are even older.</p>
                <p>Passing to the north, we find the rocks of the desert of Safa (south-east of
                    Damascus) covered with graffiti written in peculiar characters which long defied
                    decipherment. About six hundred and eighty of them have been copied. Μ. Halévy,
                    however, has now succeeded in reading them (see <hi rend="italic"
                    >Journal</hi><hi rend="italic">Asiatique,</hi> Jan.-Feb., 1877, and <hi

                    mostly the productions of Thamudite soldiers in the Roman army. The alphabet
                    turns out to be intermediate between the Phoenician and the Himyaritic. The
                    Himyaritic is the name usually given to the form of the Phoenician alphabet used
                    in southern Arabia. Here a considerable number of pre-Islamitic inscriptions
                    have been found, belonging partly to the kingdom of Sabâ, partly to that of Ma’n
                    or the Mineans, where a dialect allied to that of Hadramaut was spoken. Many of
                    them contain the names of kings, while most make us acquainted with various
                    deities, among others ’Athtar, the equivalent of Ashtoreth. The Himyaritic
                    alphabet was carried to Abyssinia, where it became the Ghe’ez or Ethiopie
                    syllabary. The earliest specimens of Ethiopie writing are two inscriptions of
                    King Tazêna copied by Riippell on the monuments of Axurn, which belong to the
                    5th century.</p>
                <p>Inscriptions in still undeciphered characters, some of which resemble those of
                    the Himyaritic alphabet, though the larger number is more closely related to the

                    copied (in 1880) by Professor Robertson Smith on the rocks of Taif near Jeddah.
                    (Compare the inscription from the neighbourhood of El-Wijh given by Wellsted,
                    ii. 189.) Captain Burton has also found an inscription in characters not unlike
                    the Himyaritic, in the Wady Intaysh, with which he compares two semi-Nabathean
                    inscriptions from Wady Unayyid copied by Dr Wallin, and an inscription at Mecca

                <p>The inscriptions of India are very numerous and of great variety. They are found
                    upon rocks, pillars, and buildings, in caves, topes, and temples, and on plates
                    of copper. These last are grants of land made by kings for religious purposes,
                    and they are historically valuable because they contain, not only the name of
                    the grantor, but a more or less complete list of his predecessors. Implicit
                    reliance cannot be placed on these documents. Vanity has sometimes led to the
                    invention of an illustrious ancestry. So far back as the old lawgiver Manu,
                    punishments were denounced upon the forgers of grants, and plates that are
                    palpable forgeries have been discovered.</p>
                <p>The oldest and most important of the inscriptions are the religious edicts of
                    King Piyadasi, who is styled <hi rend="italic">Devanam-piya</hi><hi rend="italic
                    subscript"> i</hi> “the beloved of the gods.” Their date is clearly proved to be
                    about 250 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> This Piyadasi is now by universal
                    consent admitted to be identical with the great Maurya king Asoka, grandson of
                    Chandra-gupta, whose identification by Sir W. Jones with Sandrakoptos or
                    Sandracottus, the ally of Seleucus Nicator, is the cornerstone of that very
                    tottering structure, Hindu chronology. The first published inscription of
                    Piyadasi was copied from a stone column 42 feet high, and known as the <hi
                    rend="italic">Lat</hi> or pillar of Firoz Shâh, a sultan who, about the middle
                    of the 14th century, conveyed it to Delhi from a village in the hills about 250
                    miles distant, and re-erected it as an ornament to his capital. The same monarch
                    brought from Meerut and re-erected near his palace another similar column, but
                    this was thrown down by an explosion in the year 1719, and, although it has
                    lately been raised again, it is so much mutilated that scarcely half of the
                    inscription remains. A copy of the inscription on the first of these columns was
                    published by Captain Hoare in the <hi rend="italic">Asiatic Researches</hi> in
                    1801. It was a subject of great curiosity and speculation, but it baffled all
                    attempts to decipher it until the year 1837, when the acute sagacity of James
                    Prinsep surmounted the difficulty.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>He found the key to it by a very happy guess. He was engaged
                    in copying some short inscriptions engraven upon the pillars of a temple at
                    Sânchi, ħnd he observed that, although each inscription was in the main
                    different, all of them terminated with the same two letters. Knowing that devout
                    Buddhists were in the habit of making votive offerings of pillars, rails, and
                    ornaments to their temples, and of inscribing upon them a record of the gift
                    with the name of the donor, Mr Prinsep assumed that the oft repeated two letters
                    represented the word <hi rend="italic">dAnαrn,</hi> “gift,” and this surmise
                    proved to be correct. He thus obtained the consonants <hi rend="italic">d</hi>
                    and <hi rend="italic">n,</hi> and as the name preceding the word <hi
                    rend="italic">ddnarn</hi> must necessarily be in the genitive case, this fact
                    made him master of the letter <hi rend="italic">s.</hi> He used this key with
                    such ardour and success that in the course of a month he was able to make a
                    transliteration and translation of the whole inscription.</p></note> This
                    particular alphabet having been first discovered on and translated from a <hi
                    rend="italic">Lat,</hi> or pillar inscription, obtained the name of the “<hi
                    rend="italic">Lat</hi> alphabet,” but the name “Indian Pâli” is now generally
                    preferred.</p>
                <p>The mystery of the alphabet being thus penetrated, the longer and more important
                    rock inscriptions were taken in hand. Two versions were then known, one at
                    Girnâr in Kâthiâwâr, the other discovered and copied by Kittoe at Dhauli in
                    Orissa, at the extreme opposite side of India. Dr Wilson of Bombay and Captain
                    Postans furnished Prinsep with copies of the former, and he collated the two
                    versions. He then transliterated them in modern characters, and with the help of
                    a pandit he rendered them into English. Not long afterwards Prinsep’s brilliant
                    discoveries were brought to a close by his untimely death in April 1840.</p>
                <p>In the year 1836 Μ. Court, an officer in the service of Ranjit Singh, the ruler
                    of the Punjab, made known the existence of a rock inscription at Kapur-di-giri,
                    west of the Indus, and not very far from Attock. Subsequent explorations show
                    that the rock is really situated in the village of Shâhbâz-garhi. No copy was
                    obtained until October 1838, when the traveller Masson most carefully and
                    perseveringly made a calico stampage and an eye copy. These he presented to the
                    Royal Asiatic Society, whose acute and laborious secretary, Edwin Norris,
                    proceeded to make a reduced copy of the calico stampage. This inscription was
                    not in the Lât character, but in that now known as the Bactrian Pâli or
                    Ariano-Pâli, which bears strong indications of a Phoenician origin. The Lât
                    alphabet or Indian Pâli is written, like the character of the Sanskrit, from
                    left to right; the Ariano-Pâli runs from right to left. This character had
                    previously been found on the bilingual coins of the Greek kings of Bactria, the
                    obverse of which bore a Greek legend, and the reverse had some letters which
                    proved to be a rendering of the same in Ariano-Pâli. Masson first detected the
                    connexion between the two legends, and Prinsep following up his suggestion soon
                    settled the value of several of the Ariano-Pâli letters. Similar discoveries
                    were made simultaneously by Lassen in Germany. The letters so discovered were
                    available as keys for the interpretation of the Shâhbâz-garhi inscription, but
                    only as keys, for the inscription contained many dubious and unknown characters,
                    and, unlike the alphabet of the Indian Pâli, it possessed numerous compound
                    letters. It was in the process of copying that Norris, like Prinsep, hit upon a
                    clue. He remarked a frequently repeated group of letters, and he came to the
                    conviction that these represented the words <hi rend="italic">Devdnam-piya,</hi>
                    He made known this opinion <hi rend="italic">(J. R. A. S.,</hi> viii. 303), and
                    gave a copy of a short separate part of the inscription to a young student,
                    afterwards Professor Dowson, who accepted the reading. Knowing that these words
                    were the oft repeated title of Piyadasi in the Girnâr inscription, Mr Dowson
                    proceeded to make a comparison of the two and discovered their identity. The
                    whole inscription eventually proved to be a third version of Asoka’s edicts. In
                    the year 1850 a fourth version was discovered and copied, though it was not made
                    public, by Mr (now Sir Walter) Elliot, at Jaugada near Ganjam in Orissa, about
                    50 miles south of Dhauli. Lastly, a fifth copy was discovered by Mr Forrest
                    early in 1860, at Khâlsi, west of the Jumna, about 15 miles from Masιiri or
                    Mussooree. The late Captain Chapman («7. <hi rend="italic">R. A. S.,</hi> xiii.
                    176) brought from Ceylon a copy of a small fragment of rock inscription, and in
                    this the words Devânam-piya are distinct, but the copy was made by eye and is
                    unintelligible. These inscriptions show the extent of Asoka’s influence, if not
                    of his direct empire. Their <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit13newyrich/page/n130/mode/1up"

                    Himâlayas, the extreme east and west of the centre of India, and presumptively
                    Ceylon, where it is known from other sources that Asoka ruled. The inscription
                    of Shâhbâz-garhi is the only one in the Ariano-Pâli character, the others are in
                    the Lât or Indian Pâli alphabet. The language of all of them is a Prâkrit or a
                    sort of Pâli, the immediate descendant of Sanskrit, but bearing marks of a long
                    process of detrition. There are dialectical differences in the different
                    versions, and there are also divergences of spelling, as <hi rend="italic">ldja
                    = raja, dipi = lipi,</hi> &amp;c. The Khâlsi inscription differs from the other
                    Indian Pâli versions in having two of the three distinct sibilants of the
                    Sanskrit, while the others have only one. The inscriptions at Girnâr, Khâlsi,
                    and Shâhbâz-garhi consist of fourteen distinct edicts; those at Dhauli and
                    Jaugada omit three of them, but add two new ones, which, being written apart,
                    are known as the “detached edicts.”</p>
                <p>When Prinsep and his pandit made their translations, they had before them only
                    the two versions of Girnâr and Dhauli. On the publication of the Shâhbâz-garhi
                    version Professor H. H. Wilson made a comparison of the three, and brought out
                    an amended translation which was certainly an improvement upon Prinsep’s; but he
                    was far from satisfied with his performance, and declared it “open to'
                    correction on every page.” The learned and critical Burnouf subsequently studied
                    them, and made fresh translations of parts, which again marked an advance, but
                    he declared that “personne ne peut se flatter d’arriver du premier coup à
                    l’intelligence définitive de ces monumens difficiles.” Professor Kern of Leyden
                    has since worked upon them, and his method is turning the language back into
                    Sanskrit and then translating into English. This process only carries out more
                    systematically that of the previous translators. They all interpreted the
                    inscriptions through Sanskrit, making use of such knowledge of Pâli and the
                    other Prâkrits as they possessed or could acquire. The translations are
                    acknowledged to be imperfect and unsatisfactory, and no great improvement can be
                    expected through Sanskrit alone. The words vary greatly in form from their
                    Sanskrit originals, and some changes of meaning and construction no doubt
                    accompanied their alterations in form. Comparative philology, in tracing back
                    the modern tongues of India through the Prâkrits to the Sanskrit, will probably
                    throw fresh light upon the language of the inscriptions, and make more perfect
                    translations possible. All the known inscriptions of Asoka are now accessible to
                    the student. General Cunningham, the Archaeological Surveyor of Hindustan, has
                    published the first volume of his <hi rend="italic">Corpus</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Inscriptionum Indicarum,</hi> in which he has given carefully corrected
                    facsimiles, with parallel transliterations, of the five versions and all
                    published translations. Mr Burgess also has published an excellent collotype of
                    the Girnâr version, with transcriptions and translations, in his <hi
                    rend="italic">Archaeological</hi><hi rend="italic">Survey of</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Käthiäwdr.</hi> Asoka was a convert to Buddhism, but his edicts
                    bear few distinctive marks of that or any formal religion, and they are entirely
                    free from vaunts of his power and dignity. They inculcate a life of morality and
                    temperance, a practical religion, not one of rites and ceremonies. They
                    proscribe the slaughter of animals, and they enjoin obedience to parents,
                    affection for children, friends, and dependants, reverence for elders, Buddhist
                    devotees, and Brahmans, universal benevolence, and unreserved toleration. They
                    would seem to have been set up at a time when there were few differences between
                    Buddhists and Brahmans, and their apparent object was to unite the people in a
                    bond of peace by a religion of morality and charity free from dogma and ritual.
                    One of the edicts provides for the appointment of missionaries to spread the
                    religion. The thirteenth edict refers to Asoka’s foreign relations. It mentions
                    the Greek king Antiochus, and refers to some connexion through him with four
                    other kings, Ptolemy, Antigonus, Magas, and Alexander, or, to quote the words of
                    the Shâhbâz-garhi version, “Antiyoke nama Yona-raja parancha tena Antiyokena
                    chaturo ∣∣∣∣ rajane Turamaye nama Antikini nama Maka nama Alikasandare nama.”
                    The four strokes are numerals, equivalents of the word <hi rend="italic"
                    >chaturo</hi> (four), and in the Khâlsi version the numerical sign used is +.
                    Prinsep and his pândit gave a confused rendering of this edict, but no one else
                    has attempted to translate it. There has been some difference of opinion as to
                    the identification of these Greek kings, but the most approved names are
                    Antiochus Theos of Syria, Ptolemy II. of Egypt, Antigonus of Macedonia, Magas of
                    Cyrene, and Alexander II. of Epirus, 253-251 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi></p>
                <p>Besides the five great inscriptions of Asoka, there are six other rock
                    inscriptions consisting of single edicts, three of which, found at Sahsarâm,
                    Rùpnâth, and Bairât are the same, but the last is imperfect. Dr G. Bühler has
                    translated them. A second and different inscription at Bairât has been
                    translated by Wilson, Burnouf, and Kern. These separate edicts are not found
                    among the fourteen, but they are of similar style and spirit. Two of them have
                    the distinction of being dated thus: “256 [years have elapsed] since the
                    departure of the Teacher,” <hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> since the death of
                    Buddha, the time of which has been variously assigned to 544 and 478 <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> In these two edicts Asoka, after stating that he had
                    been “a hearer of the law” more than thirty-two years and a half, adds, “I did
                    not exert myself strenuously. But it is a year and more that I have entered the
                    community of [ascetics].”</p>
                <p>The pillars erected by Asoka would appear to have been numerous, but only a few
                    now remain. Six of these, at Delhi (2), Allâhâbâd, Lauriya (2), and Sânchi, are
                    inscribed. Five of them present in a slightly variant form the text of a series
                    of six edicts that were promulgated by Asoka in the twenty-seventh year of his
                    reign, 236 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> These pillar inscriptions, which are
                    beautifully cut, are not repetitions of those on the rocks, but they are of
                    similar purport. The pillars at Delhi and Allâhâbâd have since been covered,
                    wherever space was left, and even between the lines of Asoka’s inscription, with
                    records and scribblings of later dates. The only one of consequence is the
                    inscription of Samudra-gupta on the Allâhâbâd pillar. The “iron pillar” of Delhi
                    belongs to a later age, and its inscription is dated 1052 <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >a.d.</hi></p>
                <p>In immediate succession to the rock and pillar inscriptions of Asoka come the
                    inscriptions of the caves and rockcut temples. There are caves in Bihâr,
                    Cuttack, and elsewhere with inscriptions showing that they were constructed by
                    Piyadasi or Asoka. Soon after these, about the 2d century <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >a.d.,</hi> come the caves at Khandagiri in Cuttack, over which there is an
                    important but much defaced inscription. It records the construction of the caves
                    by a king Aira of Kalinga, a convert from Brahmanism to Buddhism, and it gives
                    glimpses of his religious and beneficent life that make its defacement a matter
                    of especial regret.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"

                    Prinsep’s version, but the rock is now in a worse condition than it was in
                    Prinsep’s time, and a full translation is hopeless.</p></note> The letters of
                    the inscriptions in the oldest caves show a slight departure from the forms of
                    the Lât alphabet, and would seem to have been written from about the beginning
                    of the Christian era to the 5th century. The caves at Ajanta, Karlen, Kanhari,
                    Nâsik, and Junir are Buddhist, and contain many inscriptions, but most of these
                    records are of no historical value, as they simply commemorate the dedication of
                    a cave, chamber, cistern, or some other votive gift, coupled with the name of
                    the donor. The same observation applies generally to <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0913-0131-0120"/> the topes at Amarâvati, Sânchi, and elsewhere. In
                    the caves of Nâsik there are some historical records, and the great cave-temple
                    of Karlen is recorded to have been constructed for an emperor named Devabhûti,
                    by a foreigner called “Dhanukâkatâ” or “Dhinukakati,” which name is understood
                    to represent Xenocrates. In a Jain cave-temple at Bâdâmi there is an inscription
                    of the Châlukya dynasty, dated in 578 <hi rend="smallcaps">a.d.</hi> The caves
                    of Elephanta and Ellora are of a much later date. There have been many explorers
                    of' the caves and copyists of the inscriptions. Dr J. Wilson successfully
                    interpreted some of the inscriptions, but Dr Stevenson has been the greatest
                    decipherer. The letters of the inscriptions in the caves are often formed with a
                    want of precision and distinctness, and the copies obtained are not always
                    satisfactory, so the translations are open to some doubt, and are capable of
                    improvement.</p>
                <p>Soon after the inscriptions of Asoka we have those of the Turushka or
                    Indo-Scythic kings Kanishka and Huvishka, the Kanerke and Ooerke of the
                    bilingual coins, whose names are linked with a third as “Hushka, Jushka, and
                    Kanishka” in the Kashmir chronicle called Raja Tarangini. Their inscriptions
                    have been found in Afghânistân, in the Punjab, and in the hills, and as far east
                    as Mathura. With the exception of those at Mathurâ, they are in the Ariano-Pâli
                    character. They are all short; some consist of only six or seven words. The
                    majority of the inscriptions are dated. The Macedonian months are used, but
                    there is no certainty as to the era. The word used is “Samvatsara,” and, as
                    there is an era so called, some maintain that they are dated in that era, but as
                    the word “samvatsara” means also year, it may imply a year of some unknown era
                    or of a king’s reign. Their period is about the beginning of the Christian era.
                    The first inscription discovered was on a stone slab found by General Court in a
                    large tope at Manikyâla in the Punjab; the longest is one punched on a brass
                    vase extracted by Masson from a tope at Wardak in Afghânistân. The former was
                    discovered just before Prinsep’s death, but he did no more with it than picking
                    out the king’s name as “Kaneshm,” and conjecturing that the date figured xx9
                    signified cxx. General Cunningham subsequently interpreted the date as 446, and
                    the title of the king correctly as “Kanishka, maharaja of the Gushang tribe.” No
                    further discoveries of importance were made until the year 1862, when Mr Roberts
                    obtained, at Hasan Abdâl in the Punjab, a copper plate with five lines of
                    inscription, which he sent to the Royal Asiatic Society. The letters on this
                    plate were clearly written, and, when read by Professor Dowson, the record
                    furnished the long desired key to the numeral system, for the date was given
                    both in words and figures. The forms of the numerals had made Prinsep and others
                    suspect a Roman influence, but the figure 7 proved to be 10 and the x equivalent
                    to 4. The inscription was a record made by a satrap named Liako Kusuluko of his
                    having deposited a relic of Sâkyamuni (Buddha) in an institution near Taxila.
                    Before the publication of the translation copies of this inscription were sent
                    to India with the explanation of the date, and with a call for independent
                    translations of the text. General Cunningham made a translation which was
                    revised by Bâbù Râjendra Lâl, and when brought together the versions were found
                    to be in close agreement.</p>
                <p>Professor Dowson succeeded in making out considerable portions of the Manikyâla,
                    Wardak, and other inscriptions, and found that all had reference to the deposit
                    of relics. No progress has since been made in the interpretation of these
                    inscriptions, although there is ample scope for further study. The Manikyâla
                    inscription is dated in the year 18, and was made in the reign of Kanishka; the
                    Wardak urn is dated in the year 51, and was inscribed in the reign of his
                    successor Huvishka. There are other inscriptions, in which the names of these
                    kings appear, and the names of King Moga or Moa and of Gondophares have also
                    been found. Several short inscriptions in this character owe their discovery to
                    General Cunningham, who has been most persevering in his search and constant in
                    his endeavours to interpret them. Another series of inscriptions of these
                    Indo-Scythian rulers was obtained by General Cunningham from the ruins of the
                    Buddhist temples and other buildings at old Mathurâ. These inscriptions are in
                    the Indian Pâli character and the Sanskrit language, and have been translated by
                    Professor Dowson. Several of them are dated <hi rend="italic">“Sam,”</hi> the
                    common abbreviated form of Samvatsara. The earliest certain date is 44, and as
                    one of the dates is as high as 280, it is clear that some era is intended. If it
                    be the Samvatsara era, the dates range from 13 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> to
                    337 <hi rend="smallcaps">a.d.</hi> These inscriptions have two peculiarities in
                    which they agree with the practice of the inscriptions in western India: instead
                    of months they use the triple series of seasons, and the numerals are arbitrary
                    symbols having little or no arithmetical relation to each other. The explanation
                    of these figures has occupied the attention of Prinsep, Dr Stevenson, General
                    Cunningham, Dr Bhau Dâji, and Mr E. Thomas, and may be said to be accomplished.
                    Some further inscriptions have since been found at Mathurâ and translated by
                    General Cunningham. The whole series furnishes the names of Kanishka, Huvishka,
                    and Vâsu-deva <hi rend="smallcaps">[bazoδho</hi> of the coins], all of whom bear
                    the arrogant title <hi rend="italic">Devaputra,</hi> “son of God.” One of the
                    last discovered inscriptions is dated as early as the year 5.</p>
                <p>About the period of the Indo-Scythians there was in Surâshtra, on the western
                    coast of India, a dynasty of rulers who called themselves Kshatrapas or satraps,
                    and are known as the Sâh or more properly Sinha kings. These have left some
                    inscriptions commencing with their founder Nahapâna, but they are better
                    represented by their coins, the legends on which are in the Indian Pâli
                    character. On some of the earlier ones the distinctive name of the king is given
                    also in Ariano-Pâli. An inscription in a cave at Nâsik records its construction
                    and dedication by Nahapâna. The most important of their inscriptions is that of
                    Rudra Dâma, the seventh king of the dynasty, dated in the year 72, but of what
                    era is undetermined. This is engraven on the famous rock of Girnâr near
                    Junâgarh, the same as that on which the edicts of Piyadasi are inscribed. It is
                    in Indian Pâli, and was first deciphered by Prinsep. Since then the trans··
                    lation has been revised by Professor Wilson, Dr Bhau Dâji, and Professor
                    Eggeling. It commemorates the repair of a dam or embankment of the river
                    Palâsinï. Its most interesting passage records the fact that the same dam had
                    been formerly repaired by “the Maurya râja Chandragupta,” the classical
                    Sandrakoptos, and it is the only monumental mention known of that king. It also
                    names Asoka specifically as “Asoka Maurya,” not as Piyadasi. Mr Burgess has
                    published a fine collotype of this inscription in his <hi rend="italic"
                    >Archaeological Survey.</hi></p>
                <p>After the Sâhs come the Guptas of Kanauj, a dynasty which must not be confounded
                    with the Maurya dynasty of which Chandragupta (Sandrakoptos) was a member. The
                    inscriptions of the Guptas are in a slightly advanced form of the Indian Pâli.
                    One, the first known, translated by Dr Mill, was inscribed by Samudra-Gupta on
                    the old Asoka column at Allâhâbâd, another is inscribed on the Asoka rock at
                    Girnâr, being the third on that rock. It records another repair of the Palâsini
                    dam by Skanda-Gupta, and a copy with a translation by Bhau Dâji is published in
                    Burgess’s <hi rend="italic">Survey.</hi> All the Gupta inscriptions are dated in

                    and other places. After the Guptas come the inscriptions of Toramâna, who seems
                    to have succeeded them in Central India.</p>
                <p>The Guptas were overthrown by the Vallabhior Ballabhi kings, the founders of
                    Vallabhi-pura in Kâthiâwâr, who established themselves in the latter half of the
                    5th century <hi rend="smallcaps">λ.d.</hi> No monumental inscriptions of this
                    dynasty have been discovered, but their copper grants are numerous, and fresh
                    discoveries are constantly being made. Far down in the south the Kongu kings
                    have left grants of the 4th century, and one of questionable authenticity
                    corresponds in date to 188 <hi rend="smallcaps">a.d.</hi> In the Deccan reigned
                    the great family of the Châlukyas, which in course of time divided into two
                    branches. They reigned from the 5th to the 12th century <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >a.d.,</hi> and their inscriptions, especially their copper grants, are very
                    numerous. Sir Walter Elliot made the history of this dynasty his especial
                    pursuit, and succeeded in collecting and epitomizing some hundreds of
                    inscriptions. Mr Burgess, the archaeological surveyor of western India, and
                    other explorers are constantly making fresh discoveries of inscriptions relating
                    to the Châlukyas and other dynasties of the west and south; and these are
                    quickly translated by the indefatigable Mr Fleet, Mr Rice, Dr Burnell, and other
                    busy translators. Many other dynasties have left copper plate inscriptions which
                    cannot be here described, and a mere list would be of greater length than value.
                    The inscriptions are found in all parts of the country, and date from the early
                    periods above stated until the establishment of the Mahometan rule. They are
                    almost all in Sanskrit, but in the south inscriptions are found in Tamil and Old
                    Canarese. Through all of them the gradual change of the letters from the old
                    Indian Pâli to the modern forms is distinctly traceable. Mr Rice has published a
                    thick volume of inscriptions discovered in Mysore, and the pages of the <hi
                    rend="italic">Indian Antiquary</hi> add every month to the store. A very
                    handsome volume of photographs of inscriptions has been prepared by Mr Fleet at
                    the expense of the Government, but only ten copies have been made.</p>
                <p>The inscriptions of the Mahometans in India are also numerous. They are either in
                    Arabic or in Persian, and are often engraved with exquisite skill and grace.
                    Some celebrate victories, but most of them record the erection of mosques,
                    palaces, tombs, and other edifices. These inscriptions are occasionally valuable
                    in settling dates, but as the Mahometans are good historians their inscriptions
                    are of less importance than those of their Hindu predecessors, who did not write
                    history. (j. <hi rend="smallcaps">d.*)</hi><hi> IV.</hi><hi rend="smallcaps"

                    by way of appendix. Giving the term inscription a somewhat narrower sense, we
                    still include within it a vast store of documents of the greatest value to the
                    student of Greek civilization. It happens, moreover, that Greek inscriptions
                    yield the historian a richer harvest than those of Rome.</p>
                <p>Partly from fashion, but partly from the greater abundance of the material, the
                    Romans engraved their public documents (treaties, laws, &amp;c.) to a large
                    extent on bronze. These bronze tablets, chiefly set up in the Capitol, were
                    melted in the various conflagrations, or were carried off to feed the mint of
                    the conqueror. In Greece, on the contrary, the mountains everywhere afforded an
                    inexhaustible supply of marble, and made it the natural material for
                    inscriptions. Some Greek inscribed tablets of bronze have come down to us,<note

                    sack of cities and burning of temples. A few inscriptions on small thin plates

                <p>Inscriptions were usually set up in temples, theatres, at the side of streets and
                    roads, in <hi rend="italic">τεμενη</hi> or temple-precincts, and near public
                    buildings generally. At Delphi and Olympia were immense numbers of
                    inscriptions,—not only those engraved upon the gifts of victorious kings and
                    cities, but also many of a more public character. At Delphi were inscribed the
                    decrees of the Amphictyonie assembly, at Olympia international documents
                    concerning the Peloponnesian cities; the Parthenon and Acropolis were crowded
                    with treaties, laws, and decrees concerning the Athenian confederation; the
                    Heraeum at Samos, the Artemisium at Ephesus, and indeed every important
                    sanctuary, abounded with inscriptions. It is a common thing for decrees <hi
                    rend="italic">(ψηφίσματα)</hi> to contain a clause specifying where they are to
                    be set up, and what department of the state is to defray the cost of inscribing
                    and erecting them. Sometimes duplicates are ordered to be set up in various
                    places; and, in cases of treaties, arbitrations, and other international
                    documents, copies were always set up by each city concerned. Accordingly
                    documents like the <hi rend="italic">Harrnor</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Ancyranum</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">Edict of Diocletian</hi> have been
                    restored by a comparison of the various fragments of copies set up in diverse
                    quarters of the empire.</p>
                <p>Greek inscribed marbles varied considerably in their external appearance. The
                    usual form was the <hi rend="italic">στήλη,</hi> the normal type of which was a
                    plain slab, from 3 to 4 or even 5 feet high,<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    from about 2 feet wide at bottom to about 18 inches at the top, where it was
                    either left plain or often had a slight moulding, or still more commonly was
                    adorned with a more or less elaborate pediment; the slab was otherwise usually
                    plain. Another form was the <hi rend="italic">βωμός</hi> or altar, sometimes
                    square, offener circular, and varying widely in size. Tombstones were either
                    σ-ri}λαι (often enriched beneath the pediment with simple groups in relief,
                    commemorative of the deceased), or <hi rend="italic">κίονες,</hi> pillars, of
                    different size and design, or sarcophagi plain and ornamental. To these must be
                    added statue-bases of every kind, often inscribed, not only with the names and
                    honours of <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit13newyrich/page/n133/mode/1up"

                    documents. All these forms were intended to stand by themselves in the open air.
                    But it was also common to inscribe state documents upon the surface of the walls
                    of a temple, or other public building. Thus the cella-walls of the temple of
                    Athena Polias at Priene were covered with copies of the awards made concerning
                    the lands disputed between Samos and Priene <hi rend="italic">(C. I. G.,</hi>
                    2905, and <hi rend="italic">infra)</hi>; similarly the walls of the Artemisium
                    at Ephesus contained a number of decrees (Wood’s <hi rend="italic">Ephesus,</hi>
                    appendix), and the <hi rend="italic">proscenium</hi> of the Odeum was lined with
                    <hi rend="italic">crustse,</hi> or “marble-veneering,” under 1 inch thick,
                    inscribed with copies of letters from Hadrian, Antoninus, and other emperors to
                    the Ephesian people (Wood, <hi rend="italic">ibid.,</hi> p. 44). The workmanship
                    and appearance of inscriptions varied considerably according to the period of
                    artistic development. The letters incised with the chisel upon the wall or the
                    <hi rend="italic">στήλη</hi> were painted in with red or blue pigment, which is
                    often traceable upon newly unearthed inscriptions. When Thucydides, in quoting
                    the epigram of Pisistratus the younger (vi. 54), says, “it may still be read
                    &lt;ψ.υδροΐς <hi rend="italic">γράμμασι,”</hi> he must refer to the fading of
                    the colour; for the inscription was brought to light in 1877 with the letters as
                    fresh as when they were first chiselled (see Kumanudes in <hi rend="italic"
                    >Άθήναίον,</hi> vi. p. 149; <hi rend="italic">Corpus Inscr. AU.,</hi> suppl. to
                    vol. i. p. 41). The Greeks found no inconvenience, as we should, in the
                    bulkiness of inscriptions as a means of keeping public records. On the contrary
                    they made every temple a muniment room; and while the innumerable στήλαι, <hi
                    rend="italic">Hermse,</hi> bases, and altars served to adorn the city, it must
                    also have encouraged and educated the sense of patriotism for the citizen to
                    move continually among the records of the past. The history of a Greek city was
                    literally written upon her stones.</p>
                <p>’ The primary value of an inscription lay in its documentary evidence (so
                    Euripides, <hi rend="italic">Suppl.</hi> 1202, foil.). In this way they are
                    continually cited and put in evidence by the orators <hi rend="italic"
                    >{e.g.,</hi> see Demosth., <hi rend="italic">Pals. Leg.,</hi> 428; Aeschin., <hi
                    rend="italic">In Ctes.,</hi> § 75). But the Greek historians also were not slow
                    to recognize their importance. Herodotus often cites them (iv. 88, 90, 91; v. 58
                    <hi rend="italic">sq.-,</hi> vii. 228); and in his account of the victory of
                    Plataea he had his eye upon the tripod-inscription (ix. 81; <hi rend="italic"
                    >cf.</hi> Thue. i. 132). Thucydides’s use of inscriptions is illustrated by v.
                    18 foil., 23, 47, 77; vi. 54, 59. Polybius used them still more. In later
                    Greece, when men’s thoughts were thrown back upon the past, regular collections
                    of inscriptions began to be made by such writers as Philochorus (300 <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">b.c.),</hi> Polemo (2d century <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.,</hi>
                    called <hi rend="italic">στηλoκoτra&lt;ζ</hi> for his devotion to inscriptions),
                    Aristodemus, Craterus of Macedon, and many others.</p>
                <p>At the revival of learning, the study of inscriptions revived with the renewed
                    interest in Greek literature. Cyriac of Ancona, early in the 15th century,
                    copied a vast number of inscriptions during his travels in Greece and Asia
                    Minor; his MSS. collections were deposited in the Barberini library at Rome, and
                    have been used by other scholars. (See <hi rend="italic">Bulletin</hi> of the
                    French archaeological school at Athens, vol. i.) Succeeding generations of
                    travellers and scholars continued to collect and edit, and Englishmen in both
                    capacities did much for this study.</p>
                <p>Thus early in this century the store of known Greek inscriptions had so far
                    accumulated that the time had come for a comprehensive survey of the whole
                    subject And it was the work of one great scholar, Augustus Boeckh, to raise
                    Greek epigraphy into a science. At the request of the Academy of Berlin he
                    undertook to arrange and edit all the known inscriptions in one systematic work,
                    and vol. i. of the <hi rend="italic">Corpus</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Inscriptionum</hi><hi rend="italic">Graecarum</hi> was published in 1828, vol.
                    ii. in 1833. He lived to see the work completed, although other scholars were
                    called in to help him to execute his great design; vol. iii., by Franz, appeared
                    in 1853; vol. iv., by Kirchhoff, in 1856.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>An index to the four volumes was long wanting; it was at
                    length completed and appeared in 1877.</p></note> The work is a masterpiece of
                    lucid arrangement, profound learning, untiring industry, and brilliant
                    generalization. Out of the publication of the <hi rend="italic">Corpus</hi>
                    there grew up a new school of students, who devoted themselves to discovering
                    and editing new texts, and working up epigraphical results into monographs upon
                    the many-sided history of Greece. In the <hi rend="italic">Corpus</hi> Boeckh
                    had settled for ever the methods of Greek epigraphy; and in his <hi
                    rend="italic">Staatshaushaltτιng</hi><hi rend="italic">der Athener</hi> (well
                    known to English readers from Sir G. C. Lewis’s translation, <hi rend="italic"
                    >The</hi><hi rend="italic">Publie</hi><hi rend="italic">Economy of Athens,</hi>
                    2d ed., 1842) he had given a palmary specimen of the application of epigraphy to
                    historical studies. At the same time Franz drew up a valuable introduction to
                    the study of inscriptions in his <hi rend="italic">Elementa</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Epigraphices</hi><hi rend="italic">Graecae</hi> (1840).</p>
                <p>Meanwhile the liberation of Greece and increasing facilities for visiting the
                    Levant combined to encourage the growth of the subject, which has been advanced
                    by the labours of many scholars, and chiefly Ludwig Ross, Leake, Pittakys,
                    Rangabé, Le Bas, and later by Meier, Sauppe, Kirchhoff, Kumanudes, Waddington.
                    Together with the development of this school of writers, there has gone on a
                    systematic exploration of some of the most famous sites of antiquity, with the
                    result of exhuming vast numbers of inscriptions. Cyrene, Halicarnassus, Cnidus,
                    Priene, Rhodes, and Ephesus have been explored by the English; Athens, Eleusis,
                    and Dodona by the English and the Greeks; Olympia by the Greeks and Germans;
                    Cyprus by General Cesnola; Delphi and Delos by the French; and Pergamos by the
                    Germans. A German and a French institute have been established at Athens,
                    chiefly engaged in the study of inscriptions. And still the work proceeds at a
                    rapid rate. For indeed the yield of inscriptions is practically inexhaustible:
                    each island, every city, was a separate centre of corporate life, and it is
                    significant to note that in the island of Calymnos alone Mr Newton collected
                    over one hundred inscriptions, many of them of considerable interest.</p>
                <p>The result of this has been that Boeckh’s great work, though it never can be
                    superseded, yet has ceased to be what its name implies. The four volumes of the
                    <hi rend="italic">C. I. G.</hi> contain about 10,000 inscriptions. But the
                    number of Greek inscriptions now known has been estimated at 20,000 or 30,000.
                    Many of these are only to be found published in the scattered literature of
                    dissertations, or in Greek, German, and other periodicals. But several
                    comprehensive collections have been attempted, among which may be named—

                <p>The oldest extant Greek inscriptions appear to date from the middle of the 7th
                    century u.c. During the recent excavations at Olympia a number of fragments of
                    very ancient inscriptions have been found, which have been published in the
                    recent numbers of the <hi rend="italic">Archäologische Zeitung</hi> (1878-1880).
                    But what is wanted is a sufficient number of very early inscriptions of fixed
                    date. One such exists upon the leg of a colossal Egyptian statue at Abu-Simbel

                    >(C. I. G.,</hi> 5126). Even if Psammetichus II. is meant, the inscription dates
                    between 594 and 589 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> Documents earlier than the
                    Persian war are not very frequent; but after that period the stream of Greek
                    inscriptions goes on, generally increasing in volume, down to late Byzantine
                    times.</p>
                <p>Greek inscriptions may most conveniently be classified under the following heads
                    :—(1) those which illustrate political history; (2) those connected with
                    religion; (3) those of a private character.</p>
                <p>1. Foremost among the inscriptions which illustrate Greek history and politics
                    are the <hi rend="italic">decrees</hi> of senate and people <hi rend="italic"
                    >(φηφlσμaτa βoυληs, eκκ</hi><hi rend="italic">∖</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >ησlas,</hi> &amp;c.) upon every subject which could concern the interests of
                    the state. These abound from every part of Greece. It is true that a large
                    number of them are honorary, <hi rend="italic">i.c.,</hi> merely decrees
                    granting public honours (crowns, statues, citizenship, and other privileges) to
                    strangers who have done service to the particular city. But the importance of an
                    honorary decree depends upon the individual and the services to which it refers.
                    And even the mere headings and datings of the decrees from various states afford
                    curious and valuable information upon the names and titles of the local
                    magistrates, the names of months, and other details. Droysen in his <hi
                    rend="italic">Hellenismus</hi> (1877-78) has shown how the history of Alexander
                    and his successors is illustrated by contemporary <hi rend="italic"
                    >φηφίσματα.</hi> And when the student of Athenian politics of the 5th and 4th
                    centuries turns to the 2d volume of the <hi rend="italic">C. I. A.,</hi> he may
                    wonder at the abundance of material before him; it is like turning over the
                    minutes of the Athenian parliament. One example out of many must suffice :—No.
                    17 in <hi rend="italic">C. I. A.,</hi> ii. pt. 1, is the famous decree of the

                    reconstruction of the Athenian confederacy. The terms of admission to the league
                    occupy the face· of the marble; at the bottom and on the left edge are inscribed
                    the names of states which had already joined.</p>

                <p><hi rend="italic">Letters</hi> from kings are frequent; as from Lysimachus to the

                    transfer of the population of Lebedus to Teos (Le Bas-Wadd., <hi rend="italic"
                    >Voy. Arch.,</hi> iii. No. 86). Letters from Roman emperors are commoner still;

                <p>The internal administration of Greek towns is illustrated by the minute and
                    complete lists of the treasures in the Parthenon of the time of the
                    Peloponnesian war (Boeckh, <hi rend="italic">Staatshaush.</hi>, vol. ii.);
                    public accounts of Athenian expenditure <hi rend="italic">(ibid.</hi>); records
                    of the Athenian navy in the 4th century, forming vol. iii. of the same work. The
                    management of public lands and mines is specially illustrated from inscriptions
                    <hi rend="italic">filrid.,</hi> vol. i. <hi rend="italic">passim);</hi> and the
                    political constitution of different cities often receives light from
                    inscriptions which cannot be gained elsewhere <hi rend="italic">(e,g.,</hi> see

                <p>Inscriptions in honour of kings and emperors are very common. The <hi

                    example is the <hi rend="italic">Monumentum</hi><hi rend="italic"

                    Euergetes I. Offerings in temples <hi rend="italic">(αναθήματα)</hi> are often
                    of great historical value, <hi rend="italic">e.g.,</hi> the helmet of Hiero, now
                    in the British Museum, dedicated at Olympia after his victory over the

                    16); and the bronze base of the golden tripod dedicated at Delphi after the

                <p>2. The religion of Greece in its external aspects is the subject of a great
                    number of inscriptions. The following are a few specimens. (1) Institution of
                    festivals, with, elaborate ritual directions—see Sauppe, <hi rend="italic">Die
                    Mysterieninschrift</hi><hi rend="italic">aus</hi><hi rend="italic">Andania,</hi>

                    few are more curious than those relating to the enfranchisement of slaves under
                    the form of sale to a god (see Foucart, <hi rend="italic">Sur l'affranchissement
                    des esclaves</hi><hi rend="italic">par</hi><hi rend="italic">forme de
                    vente,</hi> &amp;c., Paris, 1857). This catalogue might be enlarged
                    indefinitely.</p>
                <p>3. There remain a large number of inscriptions of a more strictly private
                    character. The famous Parian marble <hi rend="italic">(C.</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >I. G.,</hi> 2374) falls under this head; it was a system of chronology drawn
                    up, perhaps by a schoolmaster, in the 3d century <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi>
                    The excessive devotion of the later Greeks to athletic and other competitions at
                    festivals is revealed by the numerous dedications made by victorious competitors
                    who record their successes (see <hi rend="italic">C.</hi><hi rend="italic">I.
                    G.,passim).</hi> The dedications and honorary inscriptions relating to the
                    Ephebi of later Athens (which occupy half of <hi rend="italic">C.</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">I. A.,</hi> iii. pt. 1), dreary as they seem, have yet thrown a
                    curious light upon the academic life of Roman Athens (see A. Dumont, <hi
                    rend="italic">Essai sur VÉphébie</hi><hi rend="italic">Attique)</hi>; and from
                    these and similar late inscriptions the attempt has been made to construct <hi
                    rend="italic">Fasti</hi> of the later archons (Dumont, <hi rend="italic">Essai

                    Stackelberg’s <hi rend="italic">Graber</hi><hi rend="italic">der Hellenen

                    Leipsic, 1863). Some of the most interesting epitaphs in the <hi rend="italic"

                    Kumanudes’s collection of Attic epitaphs has been mentioned above; they yield a
                    good deal of information about the Attic demes, and some of them are of high
                    importance, <hi rend="italic">e.g.,</hi> the epitaph on the slain in the year

                    2448). It was also customary at Athens for lands mortgaged to be indicated by
                    boundary-stones inscribed with the names of mortgager and mortgagee, and the
                    amount (Franz, <hi rend="italic">El. Epigr. Gr.,</hi> p. 168, 338); other <hi
                    rend="italic">όροι</hi> are common enough.</p>
                <p>The names of sculptors inscribed on the bases of statues were collected in 1871
                    by G. Hirschfeld <hi rend="italic">(Tituli Statuariorum</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Sculptorumque);</hi> but since then the number has been greatly increased by
                    excavations at Olympia and elsewhere. In most cases the artists are unknown to
                    fame. Among the exceptions are the names of Pythagoras of Rhegium, whom we now

                <p>The bearing of inscriptions upon the study of dialects is very obvious. A handy
                    collection has been made by Cauer <hi rend="italic">(Delectus Inscr. Gr.,</hi>
                    Leipsic, 1877) of the principal inscriptions illustrating this subject; and the
                    dialect of the Athenian dramatists has been illustrated from inscriptions by
                    Wecklein <hi rend="italic">(Curae</hi><hi rend="italic">Epigr. ad</hi><hi

                    Poetas sccnicospertinentes,</hi> Leipsic, 1869).</p>
                <p>The date of inscriptions is determined partly by the internal evidence of the
                    subject, persons, and events treated of, and the character of the dialect and
                    language. But the most important evidence is the form of the letters and style
                    of execution. Much of this evidence is of a kind difficult to appreciate from a
                    mere description. Yet—besides the <hi rend="italic">βουστροφηδόν</hi> writing of
                    many early documents-we may mention the contrast between the stiff, angular
                    characters which prevailed before 500 or 450 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> and
                    the graceful yet simple forms of the Peτiclean age. This development was part of
                    the general movement of the time. Inscriptions of this period are usually
                    written <hi rend="italic">στοιχηδόν,</hi><hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> the
                    letters are in line vertically as well as horizontally. From the archonship of
                    Euclides (403 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> ) onwards, the Athenians adopted
                    the fuller alphabet which had obtained in Ionia since the 6th century. Before
                    403 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> ξ and <hi rend="italic">ψ</hi> were expressed
                    in Attic inscriptions by XS and Φ2, while E did duty for <hi rend="italic"
                    >η,</hi><hi rend="italic">∈</hi><hi rend="italic">,</hi> and sometimes <hi
                    rend="italic">eι,</hi> O for <hi rend="italic">o, oυ,</hi> and <hi rend="italic"

                <p>The documents of Lycurgus’s administration are recognized by their small, neat
                    characters, very carefully inscribed. The Macedonian period betrays a falling
                    off in neatness and firmness of execution,— the letters being usually small and
                    scratchy, excepting in inscriptions relating to great personages, when the
                    characters are often very large and handsome. At this time came in the use of
                    <hi rend="italic">apices</hi> as an ornament of letters. These tendencies
                    increased during the period of Roman dominion in Greece, and gradually,
                    especially in Asia Minor, the <hi rend="italic">iota adscriptum</hi> was
                    dropped. The Greek characters of the Augustan age indicate a period of
                    restoration; they are uniformly clear, handsome, and adorned with <hi
                    rend="italic">apices.</hi> Under the empire the characters fast degenerated,
                    combining increased ornament with less delicacy of execution. In the 2d or 3d
                    century, if not earlier, the circular and square <hi rend="italic">sigma</hi>
                    (c, E) occur, together with the circular <hi rend="italic">epsilon (</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">∈</hi><hi rend="italic">).</hi> There are a good many pretty
                    inscriptions under the Antonines; but later the writing grows more coarse and
                    clumsy until Byzantine times, when the forms appear barbarous indeed beside an
                    inscription of the Augustan or even Antonine age.</p>
                <p>The finest collections of inscribed Greek marbles are of course at Athens. There
                    are also good collections, public and private, at Smyrna and Constantinople. The
                    British Museum contains the best collection out of Athens (now being edited);
                    the Louvre contains a good many (edited by Fröhner, <hi rend="italic">Les

                <p>I. Roman Inscriptions (by which general name are designated, in classical
                    archaeology, all non-literary remains of the Latin language, with the exception
                    of coins, letters and journals) fall into two distinct classes, viz. (1) those
                    which were written upon other objects of various kinds, to denote their peculiar
                    purpose, and in this way have been preserved along with them; and (2) those
                    which themselves are the objects, written, to be durable, as a rule, on metal or
                    stone. The first class is that of <hi rend="italic">inscriptions</hi> in the
                    stricter sense of the word (styled by the Romans <hi rend="italic">tituli,</hi>
                    by the Germans <hi rend="italic">Aufschriften)</hi>; the second is that of
                    instruments or charters, public and private (styled by the Romans first <hi
                    rend="italic">leges,</hi> afterwards <hi rend="italic">instrumenta</hi> or <hi
                    rend="italic">tabulae,</hi> and by the Germans <hi rend="italic"
                    >Urkunden).</hi></p>
                <p>No ancient Latin authors have professedly collected and explained or handed down
                    to us Roman inscriptions. Some of the orators and historians, such as Cicero,
                    Livy, Pliny the elder, and Suetonius among the Latins, and Polybius, Dionysius
                    of Halicarnassus, and Josephus among the Greeks, occasionally mention
                    inscriptions of high historical interest. A few grammarians, as for example,
                    Varro, Verrius Flaccus, and Valerius Probus of Berytus, quote ancient words or
                    <hi rend="italic">formulae</hi> from them, or explain the abbreviations used in
                    them. Juridical instruments, laws, constitutions of emperors, <hi rend="italic"
                    >senatus consulta,</hi> and the like appear here and there in the various
                    collections of Roman jurisprudence.</p>
                <p>Inscriptions (in the wider sense, as we shall henceforth call them without regard
                    to the distinction which has been drawn) have been found in nearly every centre
                    of ancient Roman life, but, like many other remains of antiquity, only seldom in
                    their original sites. The great mass of them has to be sought for in the large
                    European museums of ancient art, and in the smaller local collections of ancient
                    remains which occur nearly everywhere in the European provinces of the former
                    Roman empire, as well as in the north of Africa, and also here and there in Asia
                    Minor.</p>
                <p>Only those copies of inscriptions are to be received with full confidence which
                    are furnished by experienced and well-equipped scholars, or which have been made
                    with the help of mechanical methods (casts, photographs, moist and dry
                    rubbings), not always applicable with equal success, but depending on the
                    position and the state of preservation of the monuments.<note anchored="true"

                    learning in the Carolingian age, attention was paid anew, by pilgrims to Rome
                    and other places worth visiting, to epigraphic monuments also. In the time of
                    the Renaissance, from the end of the 14 th century downwards, some of the
                    leading Italian scholars, like Poggio and Signorili, and the antiquarian
                    traveller Cyriacus of Ancona, collected inscriptions, Greek and Latin.<note

                    of all countries, or of limited districts, were made by Giovanni Marcanova, Fra
                    Felice Feliciano, Fra Michele Ferrarino, Fra Giocondo the architect of Verona,
                    Marino Sanudo the Venetian polyhistor, and others. At the end of the 15th and
                    the beginning of the 16th, the first printed collections can be recorded
                    (Spreti’s for Ravenna, 1489; Peutinger’s for Augsburg, 1508; Huttich’s for
                    Mainz, 1520; Francesco degli Albertini’s for Rome, printed in 1521 by Jacopo
                    Mazochi), while during the same century, a long list of epigraphic travellers,
                    like Pighius, Rambertus, and Accursius, or antiquarian collectors, like
                    Sigonius, Panvinius, Antonius Augustinus with his collaborators Ursinus and
                    Metellus, and many others, were busy in augmenting the stock of epigraphic
                    monuments. The series of printed epigraphic <hi rend="italic">Corpora</hi>
                    begins with that of Apianus (Ingolstadt, 1534), the only one arranged in
                    geographical order, and is continued in those of Smetius (1558, but edited only
                    after the author’s death by Justus Lipsius, 1588), Gruter (with Joseph
                    Scaliger’s <hi rend="italic">Indices,</hi> 1603, and re-edited by Graevius,
                    1707), Gudius (about 1660, edited by Hessel, 1731), Reinesius (1682), Fabretti
                    (1699), Gori (1726), Doni (1731), Muratori (1739), Maffei (1749), Donati
                    (1765-75). These collections, manuscript and printed, will never altogether lose
                    their value, as great numbers of inscriptions known to the ancient collectors
                    have since been lost or destroyed. But, inasmuch as even towards the beginning
                    of the 15th century, as well as afterwards, especially from the 16th down to a
                    very recent period, all sorts of inaccuracies, interpolations, and even
                    downright falsifications, found their way into the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Corpora,</hi> these can be employed only with the greatest caution. Modern
                    critical research in the field of epigraphy began with the detection of those
                    forgeries (especially of the very extensive and skilful ones of Pirro Ligorio,
                    the architect to the house of Este) by Maffei, Olivieri, and Marini. The
                    last-named scholar opens a new era of truly critical and scientific handling of
                    Roman inscriptions (especially in his standard work on the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Atti dei Fratelli</hi><hi rend="italic">Arvali,</hi> Rome, 1795); his disciple
                    and successor, Count Bartolomeo Borghesi (who died at San Marino in 1860), may
                    be rightly called the founder of the modern science of Roman epigraphy.<note

                    materials.</p>
                <p><hi> II.</hi> The alphabet used by the Romans is identical with that of the
                    Chalcidian colonies in southern Italy and Sicily (viz., Cyme, Neapolis, Rhegium,
                    Zancle, Naxos, and Himera), except the three aspirates <hi rend="italic"
                    >θ,φ,χ∙,</hi> these, being of no use in ancient Latin, which had no such
                    aspirates, were employed as numerals. The old Z, which occupied the seventh
                    place in the alphabet, being of rare employment, was replaced, as early as the
                    4th century <hi rend="smallcaps">a.u.c.,</hi> by G, a letter formed by the
                    addition of a stroke out of the old gamma C, which became identical in sound
                    with K, though remaining in use as an abbreviation for <hi rend="italic"
                    >Gaius</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Gnxus.</hi> To that standard alphabet of
                    twenty-one letters were appended, in Cicero’s time, the Greek letters <hi
                    rend="italic">y</hi> and <hi rend="italic">ζ.</hi> In this alphabet
                    (ABCDEFGHIKLMNOPQ R ST VX YZ, in this form found written on the walls of
                    Pompeii, on tiles and other monuments) the forms of the single letters vary not
                    inconsiderably, according to the material of the monuments, their age, and their
                    origin. Carefully cut letters, especially when on a large scale, naturally
                    differ from those scratched or painted on walls by non-professional hands, or
                    hewn on rocks by soldiers; and small incised (or dotted) letters on metal or
                    ivory and bone, and those painted on earthenware, or impressed on it or on glass
                    before burning, are also necessarily of a different character. The letters,
                    ordinarily drawn with <hi rend="italic">minium</hi> on the monument before being
                    cut (and also often painted, after having been cut, with the same colour),
                    sometimes have been painted with a brush, and thence receive a peculiar form. A,
                    in the most ancient period (before the Second Punic War), appears in these
                    forms, ΑΛΑ; L, in the same epoch, is acute-angled (as in the Chalcidian
                    alphabet), b; p is rectilineal, Γ; Q has a perpendicular stroke, ç; B, D, R, S
                    are often not rounded, but acute-angled ( t&gt; k ÷); O and Q appear sometimes
                    not closed (∩, Q). Besides E and F (which usually have their horizontal strokes
                    of equal length and not as in modern printing), there were in use some
                    quasi-cursive forms, l ’ and II; and besides M (which, at the best periods, has
                    its two exterior strokes inclined, not perpendicular, and the middle point
                    extended to the foot of the line), a cursive Illi is to be found. In later
                    periods, F is sometimes elevated above the other letters (and afterwards not F
                    only), G assumes the form S, H appears as h , and L as k ,—to mention only some
                    prominent diversities, for a complete history of the palaeographic changes of
                    the Roman alphabet has not yet been written. In general, the old quadrate forms
                    of the letters, with equal breadth of strokes above and below, become, by
                    degrees, more slender and elegant, the tops and angles being slightly curved,
                    <hi rend="italic">&amp;c.</hi> Additions to the Roman alphabet were made, but
                    without permanent success, by the emperor Claudius (d for V the consonant, to
                    distinguish it from V the vowel, O for the Greek <hi rend="italic">ψ,</hi> ∣-
                    for the sound between <hi rend="italic">i</hi> and <hi rend="italic">u,</hi> as
                    in <hi rend="italic">bybliotheca</hi>; he wrote also <hi rend="italic">ai</hi>
                    for <hi rend="italic">ae).</hi> To distinguish, after the later Greek usage,
                    long from short vowels, in the course of the 7th century A.U.C. the plan of
                    doubling them was introduced for <hi rend="italic">a, e,</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">ο</hi> (not <hi rend="italic">u),</hi> while the long <hi
                    rend="italic">i</hi> was written <hi rend="italic">ei,</hi> and afterwards
                    indicated by the prolonged form I. At the end of the republic these distinctions
                    disappear, and long vowels are distinguished, when at all, by an <hi
                    rend="italic">apex</hi> (a stroke or a curved line upon <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit13newyrich/page/n137/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0913-0137-0126"/> them - <hi rend="superscript"> z</hi>, not an
                    accent), down to the epoch of the emperor Marcus Aurelius. In some very rare
                    instances the doubling of consonants is indicated by a <hi rend="italic"
                    >siciliens,</hi> a hook (’) upon them. The double <hi rend="italic">i</hi>
                    indicates, in some examples, from Caesar down to Domitian, the consonantal <hi
                    rend="italic">j</hi> (as in <hi rend="italic">cuiius, eiius).</hi> To save
                    space, on coins first and afterwards in inscriptions also, two or three or even
                    more letters were joined, especially at the end of the lines, to a nrøwsor a <hi
                    rend="italic">ligatura.</hi> This system of compendious writing, very rare in
                    the republican epoch, and slowly extending itself during the 1st century, became
                    rather frequent in the 2d and 3d, especially in Spain and Africa. There is no
                    constant system in these <hi rend="italic">nexus litterarum,</hi> but generally
                    the rule is observed that no substantial element of a single letter is to be
                    counted for twice (thus, <hi rend="italic">e.g.,</hi> ψ is <hi rend="italic"
                    >it</hi> or <hi rend="italic">ti,</hi> not <hi rend="italic">Titi).</hi> In the
                    republican period, the numbers from one to nine are mostly written in the <hi
                    rend="italic">additive</hi> form (I II III Illi V VI VII VIII Villi), and
                    similarly in combination with X, XX, and so on (XXXX, LXXXX); V, for five, seems
                    to be a graphic division of X. The χ of the Chalcidian alphabet, ψ, is the
                    numeral for fifty (afterwards ± and L, which has originally nothing to do with
                    the letter L); the 5, 0, is that for a hundred (replaced early by the initial of
                    the word <hi rend="italic">centum,</hi> C); the <hi rend="italic">φ,</hi> φ, is
                    that for a thousand (afterwards M, the initial of <hi rend="italic">mille),</hi>
                    of which m ,00 are only slight graphic alterations. The multiples of a thousand
                    by 10 are written thus (10,000), (100,000). From φ came, by graphic division, D
                    (not D the letter) for 500 (with fil 5000, 50,000). A peculiar mark (CL·)
                    appears rarely for 500,000 <hi rend="italic">(Hermes,</hi> iii., 1868, p. 467).
                    Numerals are usually distinguished from letters in the ancient period, down to
                    the end of the republic, by a stroke drawn through them, as in ++VIR, <hi
                    rend="italic">duo(m) νir(om)</hi> +fS <hi rend="italic">duo semis
                    (sestertius),</hi>-D 500; it was afterwards put above them, as in ∏VIR, XVIR,
                    ∣TΓΠIVIR, <hi rend="italic">duovir,</hi><hi rend="italic">decemvir,</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">sevir.</hi><note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"
                    ><p>For other details of numerical notation, fractions, &amp;c·, see the manuals
                    of metrology.</p></note></p>
                <p>The direction of the writing is, even in the oldest inscriptions, from left to
                    right; there exists only one very ancient example of an inscription, found at
                    the lake Fucinus, written in a kind of <hi rend="italic">βουστροφηδόν</hi>
                    arrangement (H. Jordan, <hi rend="italic">Hermes,</hi> vol. xv., 1880, p. 5),
                    while in the Sabellic inscriptions similar arrangements are not infrequent. Each
                    word is separated from the other by a sign of interpunction, which is not
                    wanted, therefore, at the end of lines or of the whole text. Exceptions to this
                    rule occur only in the later period (from the 2d century downwards), and
                    sometimes under special conditions, as when abridged words form the end of the
                    line. Here and there even the different syllables of each word are separated by
                    interpunction. The interpunction is formed by a single dot (except in some very
                    ancient inscriptions, such as those of Pisaurum, where, as in Greek and other
                    Italian monuments, three dots · are used), which, according to the technical
                    skill of the different periods in stone-cutting, is in some very ancient
                    inscriptions quadrangular, or similar to an oblique cross ( × ), or oblong (as a
                    bold stroke), but, as a rule, triangular, and never circular. This triangular
                    dot changes, by ornamentation, into a hook (7) or a. leaf (+)’, the ivy-1
                    eaf-shaped dot is especially frequent in inscriptions from about the 2d century
                    downwards. The dot is always placed at the middle height of the letters, not, as
                    now, at the foot of the line. In large texts of instruments the interpunction is
                    often omitted; in the later period it is often entirely wanting; and in short
                    texts, in the disposition of the lines, in the varying sizes of the letters
                    employed, in the division of words at the end of the lines, &amp;c., certain
                    rules are observed, which cannot be detailed here. In some instances older
                    inscriptions have been cancelled and more recent ones substituted <hi
                    rend="italic">(e.g.,</hi> on milestones), especially in the case of the <hi
                    rend="italic">damnatio</hi><hi rend="italic">memorise</hi> (in cases of high
                    treason), in consequence of which the names of consuls and emperors are often
                    cancelled; but in modern times also inscriptions have been deliberately
                    destroyed or lost ones restored.</p>
                <p>For understanding the texts of the inscriptions an accu-jate knowledge of the
                    system of abbreviations used in them is necessary. These are almost invariably

                    the difference between burial and cremation, which were in use side by side, the
                    latest and a very complete account is given in Marquardt’s <hi rend="italic"
                    >Handbuch der römischen</hi><hi rend="italic">Alterthumer</hi> (vol. vii.

                    these contain nothing but the name of the deceased in the nominative; those of
                    more recent date give it in the genitive. The oldest and simplest form remained
                    always in use down to Christian times; it is that used on the largo tectonic
                    monuments of the Augustan age <hi rend="italic">(e.g.,</hi> that of Caecilia
                    Metella, <hi rend="italic">C. I. L.,</hi> vi.1274) and in the <hi rend="italic"

                    same age (O'. <hi rend="italic">I. L.,</hi> vi., part ii.). It was early
                    succeeded by the lists of names, given also in the nominative, when more than
                    one individual, either dead or alive, were to be indicated as sharers of a tomb.
                    To distinguish the members still alive, a <hi rend="italic">v (vivit,</hi><hi

                    >(e.g., C. I. L.,</hi> i. 1020, 1195, 1271); the deceased were sometimes marked

                    added. About the same epoch, at the beginning of the 6th century, along with the
                    growing taste for tectonic ornamentation of the tombs in the Greek style,

                    added only on certain occasions <hi rend="italic">(c.g.,</hi> in the case of a

                    added many local peculiarities of provinces (as Spain and Africa), districts (as
                    the much-disputed <hi rend="italic">sub</hi><hi rend="italic">ascia

                    the god, as that of the possessor, in the genitive <hi rend="italic">(e.g.,
                    Saetureιi pocolom, Lavernai pocolom).</hi> The proper form of the dedication,
                    the simple dative of the name of a divinity and often nothing else (as <hi
                    rend="italic">Apolenei, Fide,</hi><hi rend="italic">Junone,</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">&amp;c.</hi>, which are all datives), is shown on the very
                    primitive altars found in a sacred wood near Pisaurum <hi rend="italic"
                    >(C.</hi><hi rend="italic">I. L.,</hi> i. 167-180; Wil. 1-14); but also the name
                    of the dedicants <hi rend="italic">(matrona, matrona</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Pisaurese,</hi> which are nomin. plur. ) and the formulae of the offering <hi

                    where <hi rend="italic">dono</hi> and <hi rend="italic">donee</hi> are accus. )
                    are already added to them. This most simple form (the verb in the perfect or in
                    the present) never disappeared entirely; it occurs not infrequently also in the
                    later periods. Nor did the dative alone, without any verb or formula, go
                    entirely out of use (see (7. <hi rend="italic">I. L.,</hi> i. 630; Wil. 36; <hi

                    5789; Wil. 1775). But at an early date the verb <hi rend="italic">donum
                    dare</hi> and some synonyms (like <hi rend="italic">donum</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >portare,</hi><hi rend="italic">ferre,</hi><hi rend="italic">mancupio
                    dare,</hi><hi rend="italic">parare)</hi> were felt to be insufficient to express
                    the dedicator’s good will and his sense of the justice of the dedication, which
                    accordingly were indicated in the expanded formula <hi rend="italic">doeιo dedet

                    rend="italic">I. L.,</hi> i. 182). The dative case and this formula, completely
                    or partially employed (for <hi rend="italic">merito</hi> alone is also used, as
                    <hi rend="italic">C.</hi><hi rend="italic">I. L.,</hi> i. 562, cf. <hi
                    rend="italic">Ephem. eρigr.,</hi> ii. 353, Wil. 29), remained in solemn use. To
                    <hi rend="italic">leibens</hi> (or <hi rend="italic">libens)</hi> was added <hi
                    rend="italic">laetus</hi> (so in Catullus, 31, 4), and, if a vow preceded the

                    the indexes, especially that of Wil. (ii. p. 675), give further information. The
                    objects themselves which are offered or erected begin to be named only in the
                    later period just as in the <hi rend="italic">tituli operum publicorum</hi><hi

                    custom becomes more frequent. It is hardly necessary to observe that all kinds
                    of offerings have very frequently also been adorned with poetry; some of these
                    <hi rend="italic">carmina</hi><hi rend="italic">dedicatoria</hi> are given by
                    Wil. 142-151.</p>
                <p>3. Statues to mortals, whether living or after their death (but not on their
                    tombs), with <hi rend="italic">honorary inscriptions</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >{tituli honorarii),</hi> were introduced into the Roman republic after the
                    Greek model, and only at a comparatively late date. One of the oldest
                    inscriptions of this class comes from Greek soil and is itself Greek in form
                    (O'. <hi rend="italic">I L.,</hi> i. 533; Wil. 649), <hi rend="italic">“Italicei

                    other (Latin or Latin and Greek) inscriptions from Greece (O'. <hi rend="italic"

                    588; Orel. 3036). The same Greek form occurs also, curiously enough, in an
                    honorary inscription of the age of Constantine (O'. <hi rend="italic">I.
                    L.,</hi> i. 1708; Wil. 1227). But at an earlier date, at the end of the 5th
                    century A.u.c., the noble house of the Scipios had already introduced the use of
                    poetical <hi rend="italic">elogia,</hi> in the ancient form of the <hi
                    rend="italic">carmina triumphalia</hi> in Saturnian verses (from the 6th century
                    in elegiac distichs). As has been stated above, they were added to the short <hi
                    rend="italic">tituli,</hi> painted only with <hi rend="italic">minium</hi> on
                    the sarcophagi, giving the name of the deceased (in the nominative) and his
                    curulian offices (exclusively), which were copied perhaps from the well-known
                    <hi rend="italic">imagines</hi> preserved in the <hi rend="italic">atrium</hi>
                    of the nouse (O'. <hi rend="italic">I. L.,</hi> i. 29 <hi rend="italic"
                    >sq.;</hi> Orel. 550 <hi rend="italic">sq.</hi>; Wil. 537 <hi rend="italic"
                    >sq.</hi>; and elsewhere). They hold, by their contents, an intermediate place
                    between the sepulchral inscriptions, to which they belong properly, and the
                    honorary ones, and therefore are rightly styled <hi rend="italic">elogia.</hi>
                    What the Scipios did thus privately for themselves was in other cases done
                    publicly at a period nearly as early. The first instance preserved of such a
                    usage, of which Pliny the elder speaks <hi rend="italic">lHist. Nat.,</hi>
                    xxxiv. § 17 <hi rend="italic">sq.),</hi> is the celebrated <hi rend="italic"
                    >columna rostrata</hi> of C. Duilius, of which only a copy exists, made in the
                    time of the emperor Claudius <hi rend="italic">{C. I. L.,</hi> i. 195 = vi.
                    1300; Orel. 549; Wil. 609). Then follow the <hi rend="italic">elogia</hi>
                    inscribed at the base of public works like the <hi rend="italic">Arcus</hi><hi

                    rend="italic">{C. I. L.,</hi> i., xiii., xiv.; Wil. 614, 615). This custom seems
                    to have been resumed by Augustus with a political and patriotic aim, praised by
                    the poet Horace <hi rend="italic">lθd.,</hi> iv. 8, 13, <hi rend="italic"

                    1272, 1308, 1315, 1318; Wil. 625, 626, 627, 632), and other towns followed his
                    example (so Pompeii, <hi rend="italic">C.</hi><hi rend="italic">I. L.,</hi> i.,
                    xx., xxii. =Wil. 622, 623; Lavinium, <hi rend="italic">C.</hi><hi rend="italic"

                    xxxiv. =Wil. 624, 625, 629-633). All these <hi rend="italic">elogia</hi> are
                    written in the nominative. In the same way in the colonies statues seem to have
                    been erected to their founders or other eminent men, as in Aquileia (O'. <hi
                    rend="italic">I. L.,</hi> i. 538 = v. 873, Wil. 650; compare also <hi

                <p>But along with this primitive and genuine form of the <hi rend="italic">titulus
                    honorarius</hi> another form of it, equivalent to the dedicatory inscription,
                    with the name of the person honoured in the dative, begins to prevail from the
                    age of Sulla onwards. For the oldest examples of this form seem to be the
                    inscriptions on statues dedicated to the dictator at Rome <hi rend="italic">lC.
                    I. L.,</hi> i. 584 = vi∙ 1297; Orel. 567; Wil. 1102α) and at other places
                    (Caieta and Clusium, <hi rend="italic">C.</hi><hi rend="italic">I. L.,</hi> i.
                    585, 586; Wil. 1102δ, <hi rend="italic">c),</hi> in which the whole set of
                    honours and offices is not enumerated as in the <hi rend="italic">elogia,</hi>
                    but only the <hi rend="italic">honores</hi><hi rend="italic">pressentes</hi><hi

                    period, this form is adopted <hi rend="italic">{C. I. L.,</hi> i. 595 = iii.
                    531; Henz. 5294; Wil. 1104). Similar dedications were offered to Pompey the
                    Great (at Auximum and Clusium, <hi rend="italic">C.</hi><hi rend="italic">I.
                    L.,</hi> i. 615, 616; Orel. 574; Wil. 1107) and to his legate L. Afranius (at
                    Bologna, but erected by the citizens of the Spanish colony Valentia, <hi
                    rend="italic">C.</hi><hi rend="italic">I. L.,</hi> i. 601; Henz. 5127; Wil.
                    1106). They are succeeded by the statues raised to Caesar (at Bovianum, <hi
                    rend="italic">C.</hi><hi rend="italic">I. L.,</hi> i. 620; Örel. 582; Wil.

                    him, as is well known, divine honours begin to be paid to the <hi rend="italic"
                    >princeps,</hi> even during life. In this same form other historical persons of
                    high merit also begin to be honoured by posterity, as, for example, Scipio the
                    elder at Saguntum (O'. <hi rend="italic">I. L.,</hi> ii. 3836; Wil. 653),
                    Marcellus, <hi rend="italic">Romanorum ensis,</hi> at Nola (Mommsen, <hi

                    the place which bears his name (Mommsen, <hi rend="italic">Inscr. Neap.,</hi>
                    4487; Wil. 654). Of statues erected by the community of a municipium to a
                    private person, that of L. Popillius Flaccus at Ferentinum seems to be the
                    oldest example <hi rend="italic">(C. I. L.,</hi> i. 1164; Wil. 655, and his
                    note). In Rome, Augustus and his successors in this way permitted the erection
                    of statues, especially to <hi rend="italic">triumphatores,</hi> in the new <hi

                    aqueduct, or the like, by inscribing his name on the work, honours himself, and,
                    as permission to do so has to be given by the public authorities, is also
                    honoured by the community. Therefore the <hi rend="italic">titιιli</hi><hi

                    older honorary inscriptions. Of the ancient and almost universally employed
                    method of erecting public buildings by means of the <hi rend="italic">locatio

                    epigr.,</hi> ii. 199). The oldest instance of this class is that commemorating
                    the restoration of the temple of the Capitoline Jupiter, begun, after its
                    destruction by fire in the year 671 (83 B.C. ), by Sulla and continued five

                    only about twenty years afterwards. Here, after the name of Catulus in the
                    nominative and the indication of the single parts of the building (as, for
                    example, <hi rend="italic">substructionem et tabularium)</hi> follows the solemn

                    soldiers, especially frequent in the Danubian provinces, Africa, Germany, and
                    Britain, give, in this way, manifold and circumstantial information as to the

                    of the work to which they refer (especially, as may be supposed, in the case of

                    the walls of Hadrian and Antoninus Pius in Britain) are indicated, so it early

                    boundary-stones were erected by the emperors, or, under their authority, by
                    magistrates, mostly military, in the rest of Italy also (as in Capua—Mommsen,

                    combine under some boundary system the numerous stones found in Britain on
                    military buildings, as on the wall of Hadrian and in divers <hi rend="italic"
                    >castra,</hi> which indicate the <hi rend="italic">centuriae</hi> of legions and
                    cohorts employed in the work and its measurements as executed by them, has been
                    finally refuted by Mr Clayton (in the <hi rend="italic">Archaeologia
                    Aeliana,</hi> 1880). Private grounds <hi rend="italic">{pedaturae)</hi> were
                    unfrequently marked off by terminal <hi rend="italic">cippi.</hi> To this class
                    of <hi rend="italic">tituli</hi> must be added also the curious inscriptions
                    incised upon the steps of Roman circuses, theatres, and∙amphitheatres (see
                    Hübner, <hi rend="italic">Annali</hi><hi rend="italic">dell’</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Instituto</hi><hi rend="italic">archeologico,</hi> vol. xxviii.,

                    1881).</p>
                <p>4. We now come to the last class of <hi rend="italic">tituli,</hi> viz., thost⅛
                    which in the <hi rend="italic">Corpus</hi> are arranged, at the end of each
                    volume, under the head of <hi rend="italic">Instrumentum.</hi> By this very
                    comprehensive term are designated objects which vary greatly among themselves,
                    but which are of such a character as not to fall within any of the classes of
                    <hi rend="italic">tituli</hi> described before, or the class of the <hi
                    rend="italic">instrumenta</hi> in the proper sense of that word,—the laws,
                    &amp;c. The <hi rend="italic">tituli</hi> of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >instrumentum</hi> embrace movable objects, destined for public and private use,
                    and illustrate almost every side of the life of the ancient Romans. As
                    systematic treatment of them is hardly possible, a simple enumeration only of
                    their different classes can be given, without citing special examples. The first
                    species of them is metrological, comprehending the inscriptions on measures and
                    weights. The gold and silver plate used in the best Roman houses was also always
                    marked with a note of its weight,—as is seen, for instance, on the different
                    objects belonging to the Hildesheim find (see <hi rend="italic">Hermes,</hi>
                    iii., 1868, p. 469 <hi rend="italic">sq.;</hi><hi rend="italic">Philologus,</hi>
                    xxviii., 1869, p. 369), the Corbridge <hi rend="italic">lanx</hi> in
                    Northumberland House (C ’. <hi rend="italic">I. L.,</hi> vii. 1268), and many
                    others. A second species is formed by the <hi rend="italic">tesscrae,</hi>
                    tokens, or marks, mostly in bronze, bone, and ivory, but also earthen, of which
                    the most interesting are the so-called <hi rend="italic">tesscrae
                    gladiatoriae,</hi> little staves of bone with holes at the top, and with names
                    of slaves or freedmen and consular dates upon them, the relation of which to the
                    <hi rend="italic">mxenera</hi><hi rend="italic">gladiatoria</hi> is by no means
                    certain (see <hi rend="italic">G.</hi><hi rend="italic">I. L.</hi>, i. 717 <hi
                    rend="italic">sq.,</hi> and Hübner, <hi rend="italic">Monatsberichte der</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Berl. Akad.</hi><hi rend="italic">der Wissenschaften,</hi> 1867,
                    p. 747 <hi rend="italic">sq.,</hi><hi rend="italic">Revue archéologique,</hi>
                    vol. xvi., 1868, p. 469s⅛ ’., and <hi rend="italic">Ephem.,</hi> iii. 203). The
                    other circular <hi rend="italic">tesscrae</hi> of ivory or bone, with emblems
                    and short inscriptions, partly Greek and Latin, may with more confidence be
                    attributed to the <hi rend="italic">ludi</hi><hi rend="italic">scaenici</hi>
                    (see Henzen, <hi rend="italic">Annali</hi><hi rend="italic">dell'</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Instituto</hi><hi rend="italic">archeologico,</hi> vol. xx., 1848,
                    p. 273 <hi rend="italic">sq.,</hi> and vol. xxii., 1850, p. 357 <hi
                    rend="italic">sqf</hi> and to other <hi rend="italic">l·udi</hi>; but the uses
                    of many of them remain very uncertain. A third species is that of inscriptions
                    carved, inscribed, painted, or stamped upon various materials, raw or
                    manufactured, for trade or household use. Such are, to begin with the most solid
                    and heavy, the inscriptions carved or painted on masses of stone, mostly
                    columns, in the quarries, and preserved either on the rocks themselves in the
                    quarries or on the roughly hewn blocks transported to the Roman <hi
                    rend="italic">empbrium</hi> on the Tiber bank. Curious specimens of the first
                    kind are preserved in Lebanon, and in the north of England, near Hadrian’s Wall
                    and elsewhere; on the second may be consulted a learned treatise by Padre L.
                    Bruzza (“Iscrizioni dei marmi grezzi,” in the <hi rend="italic">Annali</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">dell'</hi><hi rend="italic">Instituto</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >archeologico,</hi> vol. xlii., 1870, p. 106-204). Of a kindred character are
                    the inscriptions, mostly stamped or engraved in the mould, of pigs of silver,
                    bronze, and lead (and pewter), found in the Roman mines in Spain and England
                    (see Hübner, “Römische Bleigruben in Britannien,” in <hi rend="italic"
                    >Rheinisches</hi><hi rend="italic">Museum</hi><hi rend="italic">für

                    p. 23, and vol. xxiii., 1866, p. 63). A fourth species of <hi rend="italic"
                    >tituli</hi> of this class is strictly related to the military institutions of
                    the Roman empire. Many of the weapons are marked with the names of the beareι∙
                    and of the military corps to which he belonged,—so, for example, the buckles of
                    their shields (see Hübner, “Römische Schildbuckel,” in <hi rend="italic"

                    >sq.</hi>; by far the best extant specimen is the umbo of a legionary soldier of
                    the eighth legion found in the Tyne near South Shields, <hi rend="italic"
                    >C.</hi><hi rend="italic">I. L.,</hi> vii. 495), and sometimes the swords, as

                    >Bonner Winckelmannsprogramm</hi> of 1848). The leaden <hi rend="italic"

                    the question of the authenticity of many of them, much discussed of late, Bergk,

                    ’.). Special mention must.be made also of the leaden seals or marks, evidently
                    of military origin (perhaps to be borne by the soldiers as a countersign), which
                    have been found in many parts of England, but nowhere else as yet (G. <hi
                    rend="italic">I. L.,</hi> vii. 1269; <hi rend="italic">Ephem. epigr.,</hi> iii.
                    p. 144, 318, iv. p. 209). Of the highest interest are the manifold productions
                    of the Roman tile and brick kilns. Next to the tiles with consular dates made at
                    Veleia (C ’. <hi rend="italic">I.L.,</hi> i. <hi rend="italic">7T7</hi> foil.),
                    those signed with the name of legions or other military corps, and employed in
                    the various military buildings of these, are especially worthy of mention; they
                    form an important chapter in every geographical part of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Corpus.</hi> But private persons, too, especially the rich landed proprietors,
                    and afterwards the emperors and their kinsmen, kept large <hi rend="italic"
                    >figulinae,</hi> and their manufactures—tiles of every description and other
                    earthenware—were spread over the Roman empire. The different sorts of earthen
                    vessels and lamps, the fragments of which are found in great quantities wherever
                    Roman settlements occurred, are arranged at the end of each volume of the <hi
                    rend="italic">Corpus.</hi> But a scientific inquiry into their origin, age, and
                    employment, difficult on account of the enormous and always increasing mass of
                    the extant remains, has not yet been undertaken, the small works of Froehner <hi

                    thorough treatment of the question has been made by an accurate exploration of
                    the chief deposit of those fragments, the <hi rend="italic">Monte testaccio</hi>

                    when dry, like those on the walls of ancient buildings in Pompeii, Rome, and
                    other places of antiquity. Like the corresponding Greek ware, they contain
                    chiefly names of the makers or the merchants or the owners, and can be treated
                    in a satisfactory manner only when brought together in one large collection,
                    inasmuch as, besides being made in many local potteries, they were exported
                    principally from some places in Italy <hi rend="italic">{e.g.,</hi> Arezzo) and
                    Spain, in nearly every direction throughout northern and western Europe, the
                    countries outside the Roman frontiers not excluded. Vessels and utensils of
                    glass and of metal (gold, silver, and especially bronze) were also exported from
                    Italy on a large scale, as is being more and more readily recognized even by
                    those antiquaries who formerly were wont to assume a local origin for all bronze
                    finds made in the north of Europe. These utensils, ornaments, and other objects
                    made of precious metals (such as cups, spoons, mirrors, <hi rend="italic"
                    >fibulae,</hi> rings, gems), not unfrequently bear Latin inscriptions. On the
                    very ancient silver and bronze caskets, for holding valuable articles of the
                    female toilet, which have been found at Praeneste, are inscribed, in addition to
                    the names of the artist and of the donor, occurring once, the names of the

                    is the Rudge Cup, found in Wiltshire and preserved at Alnwick Castle, which
                    contains, engraved in bronze, an itinerary along some Roman stations in the

                    of the Hildesheim silver find and others of a similar character have been

                    They are mostly of bronze, and contain names; but it is not easy to say what
                    sort of objects were marked with them, as scarcely any article stamped with a
                    still existing stamp has been found. Amongst the materials stamped leather also
                    is to be mentioned. One class only of stamps differs widely from the rest,—the
                    oculists’ stamps, engraved mostly on steatite <pb break="no"

                    against diseases of the eyes, to be stamped on the glass bowls in which such
                    remedies were sold, or on the medicaments themselves (see Grotefend, <hi

                    &amp;c., preserved generally on metal and stone, from the nature of the case
                    have to be considered chiefly with regard to their contents; their form is not
                    regulated by such constant rules as that of the <hi rend="italic">tituli,</hi>
                    so far as may be inferred from the state of completeness in which they have been
                    preserved. The rules for each special class therefore, though, generally
                    speaking, maintained—as was to be expected of Roman institutions—with remarkable
                    steadiness from the earliest times down to a late period, must be based upon a
                    comprehensive view of all the examples, including those preserved by ancient
                    writers, and not in the monumental form. These documents are, as a rule, incised
                    on bronze plates (only some private acts are preserved on wood and lead), and
                    therefore have their peculiar form of writing, abbreviation, interpunction,
                    &amp;c., as has been already explained. A complete collection of these
                    monuments, although projected by many workers in the field of Roman
                    jurisprudence from Antonius Augustinus downwards, has not yet been made. The
                    older Roman laws are now collected, in trustworthy texts, in the <hi

                    be supposed to have been originally verbal only, must certainly be reckoned
                    international transactions <hi rend="italic">{leges foederis</hi> or <hi
                    rend="italic">foedera).</hi> At the head of the prose records written in the
                    Latin language we find the treaties of alliance of Tullus Hostilius λvith the
                    Sabini (Dionysius Halic., iii. 33), of Servius Tullius with the Latini
                    (Dionysius, iv. 26; Festus, p. 169; this was, partly, at the same time, as will

                    preserved in an authentic form, save some few words quoted from them by the
                    ancient grammarians. Of one <hi rend="italic">foedus</hi> only is there a
                    fragment still in existence, relating to the Oscan <hi rend="italic"

                    afterwards to Mommsen, to resume (for the sake of Roman jurisprudence, in the
                    first instance) inquiry into the Oscan and other Italian dialects. Some other

                <p>2. Hardly inferior in antiquity, and of superior value, are the remains of laws
                    in the stricter sense of the word <hi rend="italic">{leges</hi> and <hi

                    unfortunately only in fragments more or less extensive. Of those laws the oldest
                    and most important are the <hi rend="italic">lex</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Acilia</hi> (for so it is in all probability to be styled) <hi rend="italic"
                    >repetundarum</hi> of the year 631 <hi rend="italic">{C. I. L.,</hi> i. 198),
                    which is incised on a bronze table about 2 metres broad, in 90 lines of about
                    200 to 240 letters each, and therefore extremely inconvenient to read, and the
                    <hi rend="italic">lex</hi><hi rend="italic">agraria</hi> of 643 (111 <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">b.c.),</hi> written on the reverse of the table of the Acilia,
                    abrogated shortly afterwards <hi rend="italic">{C. I. L.,</hi> i. 200); this is
                    the third of the celebrated laws of C. Gracchus bearing upon the division of

                    rend="italic">quaestoribus,</hi> a fragment of Sulla’s legislation, the eighth

                    709 (45 B.C.), written on the reverse of the much older Greek law of that

                    rend="italic">{C. I.L.,</hi> i. 206), also a fragment of Caesar’s general
                    municipal institutions; it contains a curious passage relating to the public
                    promulgation of laws (v. 15). These are the laws of the Roman republic preserved
                    in important fragments; some . minor ones (brought together in <hi rend="italic"
                    >C.</hi><hi rend="italic">I. L.,</hi> i. 207-211) may be left out of · account
                    here. In the imperial age, laws in general were replaced by <hi rend="italic"
                    >senatus consulta,</hi> or by imperial decrees. It was also in the form of a <hi
                    rend="italic">senatus consultum</hi> that the <hi rend="italic">leges de</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">imperio,</hi> on the accession of the emperors, seem to have been
                    promulgated. An example of such a law, preserved in part on a bronze tablet
                    found at Rome, is the <hi rend="italic">lex de</hi><hi rend="italic">imperio
                    Vespasiani</hi><hi rend="italic">{C. I. L.,</hi> vi. 930; Orel. vol. i. p. 567).
                    There is, besides, one special category of imperial constitutions which
                    continued to be named <hi rend="italic">leges,</hi> viz., the constitutions
                    given by the emperors to the divers classes of <hi rend="italic">civitates,</hi>
                    based upon the ancient traditional rules of government applied to Rome itself as
                    well as to the <hi rend="italic">coloniae</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >municipia.</hi> Of this sort of <hi rend="italic">leges</hi> some very valuable

                    formed by decrees of the senate of Korne, of the analogous corporations in the

                    emperors and their functionaries, incised, as a rule, on bronze tablets. The
                    oldest decree in the Latin language which has been preserved is that of L.
                    Aemilius Paulus, when praetor in Hispania Baetica, dating from 189 B.C., for the
                    Turris Lascutana in southern Spain (C*. <hi rend="italic">I. L.,</hi> ii. 5041;
                    Wil. 2837); of the same date is a Greek one of Cn. Manlius, consul of the year
                    565, for the Heracleenses Cariae (Le Bas and Waddington, η. 588). Then follow
                    the famous <hi rend="italic">epistula consulum</hi> (falsely styled commonly <hi
                    rend="italic">senatus consultum)</hi><hi rend="italic">ad</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Teuranos</hi><hi rend="italic">de bacchanalibus,</hi> dated 568 (186 <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi>) (Ci <hi rend="italic">I. L.,</hi> i. 196); the
                    sentence of the two Minucii, the delegates of the senate, on a dispute
                    concerning the boundaries between the Genuates and Viturii, 117 <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> (C ’. <hi rend="italic">I. L.,</hi> i. 199; Orel.
                    3121; Wil. 872); and the <hi rend="italic">epistula</hi> of the praetor L.
                    Cornelius (perhaps Sisenna), the praetor of 676 (78 <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >b.c.</hi>) <hi rend="italic">ad Tiburtes (C.LL.,</hi> i. 201). These belong to
                    the republican age. From the imperial period a great many more have come down to
                    us of varying quality. Some of them are decrees or constitutions of the emperors
                    themselves. Such are the decree of Augustus on the aqueduct of Venafrum (Henz.
                    6428; Wil. 784); that of Claudius, found in the Vai di Nona, belonging to 46 <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">a.d.</hi> (O'. <hi rend="italic">1. L.,</hi> V. 5050; Wil.
                    2842); of Vespasian for Sabora in Spain <hi rend="italic">(C.I.L.,</hi> ii.
                    1423), and for the Vanacini in Corsica (Orel. 4031); of Domitian for Falerii
                    (Orel. 3118); the epistles of Hadrian relating to Aezani in Phrygia, added to a
                    Greek decree of Avidius Quietus <hi rend="italic">(C. I. L.,</hi> iii. 355;
                    Henz. 6955), and relating to Smyrna, in Greek, with a short one of Antoninus
                    Pius, in Latin (67. <hi rend="italic">1.*L.,</hi> iii. 411; Orel. 3119); the

                    and Greek <hi rend="italic">(C.I.L.,</hi> iii. 412); of Diocletian <hi

                    more or less complete, in Latin and Greek (C ’.ZZ., iii. p. 801 <hi
                    rend="italic">sq.</hi>; compare <hi rend="italic">Ephcm. cpigr.,</hi> iv. p.
                    180, and, as similar monuments, the <hi rend="italic">lex</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >portus</hi> of Cirta, of 202 <hi rend="smallcaps">a.d.,</hi> Wil. 2738, and the
                    fragment of a regulation for the importation of wines into Rome, Henz. 5089,
                    Wil. 2739); and some of the age of Constantine, as that relating to Hispellum in
                    Umbria (Henz. 5580; Wil. 2843), that of Julian found at Amorgos (Henz. 6431),
                    and some others, of which copies exist also in the juridical collections. Of two
                    imperial rescripts of a still later age (413 A.D.), fragments of the originals,
                    written on papyri, have been found in Egypt (see Mommsen and Jaffé, <hi
                    rend="italic">Jahrbuch des gemeinen deutschen Rechts,</hi> vol. vi., 1861, p.
                    398; Hänel, <hi rend="italic">Corpus</hi><hi rend="italic">legum,</hi> p. 281).
                    Imperial decrees, granting divers privileges to soldiers, are the <hi
                    rend="italic">diplomata</hi><hi rend="italic">militaria</hi> also, mentioned
                    above, incised on two combined bronze tablets in the form of <hi rend="italic"
                    >diptycha,</hi> of which about seventy examples have been brought together in
                    the <hi rend="italic">Corpus</hi> (vol. iii. p. 842 <hi rend="italic">sq.)</hi>;
                    some specimens are given.in Wil. 2862-2869, and in the <hi rend="italic">Ephem.
                    epigr.</hi> (vol. ii. p. 452, and vol. iv. p. 181 <hi rend="italic">sq.),</hi>
                    belonging to nearly all emperors from Claudius down to Diocletian. Though not a
                    decree, yet as a publication going back directly to the emperor, and as being
                    preserved in the monumental form, the speech of the emperor Claudius, delivered
                    in the senate, relating to the Roman citizenship of the Gauls, of which Tacitus
                    gives an abstract <hi rend="italic">(Ann.</hi> xi. 23), ought also to be
                    mentioned here; it was engraved on large bronze slabs by the public authority of
                    Lugudunum (Lyons), where a large fragment of it is still preserved (Boissieu,
                    <hi rend="italic">Inscriptions antiques de Lyon,</hi> p. 132 <hi rend="italic"
                    >sq.).</hi> Another sort of decrees, relating to a great variety of subjects,
                    has to be mentioned, emanating, not directly from the emperors, but from their
                    functionaries. Such are the decree of the proconsul L. Helvius Agrippa, of the
                    year 68 A.n., on the boundaries of some tribes on the island of Sardinia (Wil.
                    872 <hi rend="italic">a);</hi> that of the prefect of Egypt, Tiberius Julius
                    Alexander, written in Greek, of the same year (C ’. <hi rend="italic">I.</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Graec.,</hi> 4957); that of C. Helvidius Priscus, on a similar
                    question relating to Histonium, belonging perhaps to the end of the first
                    century (Wil. 873); that of the legate of Trajan, C. Avidius Quietus, one of the
                    friends of Plutarch, found at Delphi, in Greek and Latin <hi rend="italic"
                    >(C.</hi><hi rend="italic">I. L.,</hi> iii. 567; Orel. 3671; Wil. 874); a
                    rescript of Claudius Quartinus, perhaps the imperial legate of the
                    Tarraconensis, of the year 119 A.D., found at Pampluna <hi rend="italic"
                    >(C.I.L.,</hi> ii. 2959; Orel. 4032); the epistle of <hi rend="italic"
                    >theprae-</hi><hi rend="italic">fecti</hi><hi rend="italic">praetorio</hi> to
                    the magistrates of Saepinum, of about 166-169 A.D. (Mommsen, <hi rend="italic"
                    >I.N.,</hi> 4916; Wil. 2841); the decree of L. Novius Rufus, another legate of
                    the Tarraconensis, who <hi rend="italic">ex</hi><hi rend="italic">tilia
                    recitavit,</hi> of 193 A.D. <hi rend="italic">(C.</hi><hi rend="italic">I.
                    L.,</hi> ii. 4125; Orel. 897; Wil. 876); the sentence of Alfenius Senecio, then
                    subprefect of the <hi rend="italic">classis</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >praetoria</hi><hi rend="italic">Misenensis,</hi> belonging to the beginning of
                    the third century, formerly existing at Naples (Mommsen, <hi rend="italic">I.
                    N.,</hi> 2646); and some others of the fourth and fifth centuries, not requiring
                    specific mention here. Quite a collection of epistles of high Roman
                    functionaries is found in the celebrated inscription of Thorigny (Mommsen, <hi
                    rend="italic">Berichte der sächs.</hi><hi rend="italic">Gesellschaft</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">der Wissenschaften,</hi> 1852, p. 235 <hi rend="italic">sq.).</hi>
                    The letter of a provincial functionary, a priest of Gallia Narbonnensis, to the
                    <hi rend="italic">fabri</hi><hi rend="italic">subaediani</hi> of Narbonne, of
                    the year 149, may also be mentioned (Henz. 7215; Wil. 696α). To these must be
                    added the <hi rend="italic">tabulae</hi><hi rend="italic">alimentariae,</hi>
                    relating to the well-known provision made by Trajanfor the relief of distress
                    among his subjects, such as that of the Ligures Baebiani (Mommsen, <hi
                    rend="italic">I.N.,</hi> 1354; Wil. 2844) and that ofVeleianear Parma (Wil.
                    2845); while evidence of similar institutions is furnished by inscriptions at
                    Tarracina, at Sicca in Africa, and at Hispalis in Spain (Wil. 2846-48; <hi
                    rend="italic">C.I.L.,</hi> ii. 1174). At the close of this long list of official
                    documents may be mentioned the <hi rend="italic">libellus</hi> of the <hi
                    rend="italic">procurator</hi><hi rend="italic">operum publicorum a columna divi
                    Marci</hi> of the year 193 (O'. <hi rend="italic">I. L.,</hi> vi. 1585; Orel.
                    39; Wil. 2840) and the <hi rend="italic">interlocutiones</hi> of the <hi
                    rend="italic">praefecti</hi><hi rend="italic">vigilum</hi> on a lawsuit of the
                    <hi rend="italic">fullones</hi> of Rome, of 244 A.D., inscribed on an altar of
                    Hercules <hi rend="italic">(C.LL.,</hi> vi. 266; Wil. 100). These documents form
                    a most instructive class of <hi rend="italic">instrumenta.</hi></p>
                <p>5. Many documents, as may be supposed, were connected with religious worship,
                    public and private. The oldest <hi rend="italic">lex</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >templi,</hi> which continued in force until a comparatively late period, was
                    the regulation given by Servius Tullius to the temple of Diana on the <pb
                    break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit13newyrich/page/n144/mode/1up"

                    pact with the Latini, noticed above. Mention is made of this ancient law as
                    still in force in two later documents of a similar character, viz., the
                    dedication of an altar to Augustus by the plebs of Narbo in southern France, of
                    764 <hi rend="smallcaps">a.d.,</hi> but existing only, at Narbonne, in a copy,
                    made perhaps in the 2d century (Orel. 2489; Wil. 104), and that of an altar of
                    Jupiter, dedicated at Salonae in Dalmatia in 137 A.D., still existing in part at
                    Padua (C ’. <hi rend="italic">I. L.,</hi> iii. 1933; Orel. 2490; Wil. 163).
                    Another <hi rend="italic">lexfani</hi> still existing is that of a temple of
                    Jupiter Liber at Furfo, a <hi rend="italic">vicus</hi> of southern Italy, of the
                    year 696 (58 B.o.), but copied, in vernacular language, from an older original
                    (Ci <hi rend="italic">I L.,</hi> i. 603; Orel. 2488; Wil. 105; compare Jordan in
                    <hi rend="italic">Hermes,</hi> vol. vii., 1872, p. 201 sg ’.). The lists of
                    objects belonging to some sanctuaries or to the ornaments of statues are
                    curious, such as those of the <hi rend="italic">Diana</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Nemorensis</hi> at Nemi (Henz., <hi rend="italic">Hermes,</hi> vol. vi., 1871,
                    p. 8sg ’.), and of a statue of Isis in Spain (Hübner, <hi rend="italic"
                    >Hermes,</hi> vol. i., 1866, p. 345 <hi rend="italic">sq.</hi>; compare <hi
                    rend="italic">C. I. L.,</hi> ii. 2060, 3386, Orel. 2510, Wil. 210), and two <hi
                    rend="italic">synopses</hi> from a temple at Cirta in Africa (Wil. 2736, 2737).
                    The <hi rend="italic">sortes</hi> given by divinities may also be mentioned (see
                    <hi rend="italic">C. I. L.,</hi> i. p. 267 <hi rend="italic">sq.</hi>; Wil.
                    2822). To a temple also, though in itself of a secular character, belonged a
                    monument of the highest historical importance, viz., the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Index</hi><hi rend="italic">rerum a se gestarum,</hi> incised on bronze slabs,
                    copies of which Augustus ordered to be placed, in Latin and Greek, where
                    required, in the numerous Augustea erected to himself in company with the Dea
                    Roma. This is known as the <hi rend="italic">Monumentum Ancyranum,</hi> because
                    it is at Angora in Asia Minor that the best preserved copy of it, in Greek and
                    Latin, exists; but fragments remain of other copies from other localities (see
                    <hi rend="italic">C.</hi><hi rend="italic">I. L.,</hi> iii. p. 779 <hi

                    Bergk, Gottingen, 1873). Among the inscriptions relating to sacred buildings
                    must also be reckoned the numerous fragments of Roman calendars, or <hi
                    rend="italic">fasti</hi><hi rend="italic">anni Juliani,</hi> found at Rome and
                    other places, which have been arranged and fully explained by Mommsen (O'. <hi

                    some relation, more or less strict, to sacred or public buildings. Along with
                    the official calendar exhibited on the walls of the residence of the <hi

                    viii.). As those documents, though having only a partial claim to be ranked with
                    the sacred ones, derive, like many other dedicatory monuments, their origin and
                    form from that class, so also the protocols <hi rend="italic">(acta),</hi>
                    which, from Augustus downwards, seem to have been preserved in the case of all
                    important <hi rend="italic">collegia</hi><hi rend="italic">magistratuum,</hi>

                    which Marini first drew the attention of epigraphists; they form one of the most
                    important masses of epigraphic, monuments preserved to us in the Latin language
                    (see <hi rend="italic">C.</hi><hi rend="italic">I. L.,</hi> vi. p. 459 <hi

                <p>6. Another species of instruments is formed by private documents. They have been
                    incidentally preserved (inserted, for instance, into sepulchral and honorary
                    inscriptions), in the later period not unfrequently in monumental form, as the
                    testaments, given partly or in full, mentioned above (viz., that of Dasumius and
                    the Gaul, C. Z. Z., vi. 10229, Wil. 314, 315, and some <hi rend="italic"
                    >capita</hi><hi rend="italic">testamentorum</hi> or <hi rend="italic"
                    >codicilli,</hi> as that of Μ. Meconius Leo found at Petelia—Mommsen, <hi
                    rend="italic">I. N.,</hi> 78, 79; Orel. 3677, 3678; Wil. 696), and the
                    donations, such as those of T. Flavius Syntrophus <hi rend="italic">(C.</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">I. L.,</hi> vi. 10239; Wil. 313), of T. Flavius Artemidorus (Wil.
                    310), of Statia Irene and Julia Monime (Ç. <hi rend="italic">I. L.,</hi> vi.
                    10231, 10247; Wil. 311, 318). Of a peculiar description is the <hi rend="italic"
                    >pactum</hi><hi rend="italic">fiduciae,</hi> found in Spain, engraved on a
                    bronze tablet, and belonging, in all probability, to the 1st century (C <hi
                    rend="superscript"> ,</hi>. <hi rend="italic">I, L.,</hi> ii. 5042), which seems
                    to be a formulary. Other documents relating to private affairs exist in their
                    original form, written on <hi rend="italic">tabellae ceratae.</hi> Those found
                    together in a mining district of Dacia have been arranged and explained by
                    Mommsen aιid Zangemeister (G. <hi rend="italic">I. L.,</hi> iii. p. 291 <hi
                    rend="italic">sq.,</hi> with facsimiles); those found at Pompeii in 1875,
                    containing receipts of the banker L. Caecilius Jucundus, have been published by
                    De Petra (“Le tavo-lette cerate di Pompei,” <hi rend="italic">Atti</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">dell’ Academia de' Lined,</hi> vol. iii., 1876) and explained by
                    Mommsen <hi rend="italic">(Hermes,</hi> vol. xii., 1877, p. 88 <hi rend="italic"
                    >sq.</hi>). These documents are written in cursive letters; and so mostly, too,
                    are some other curious private monuments, belonging partly to the sacred
                    inscriptions,—the <hi rend="italic">defixiones,</hi> imprecations directed
                    against persons suspected of theft or other offences, who, according to a very
                    ancient superstition, were in this way believed to be delivered to punishment
                    through the god to whom the <hi rend="italic">defixio</hi> was directed. The
                    numerous Greek and Latin (and even Oscan) examples of this usage have been
                    brought together by Wachsmuth <hi rend="italic">(Rheinisches</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Museum,</hi> vol. xviii., 1863, p. 559 <hi rend="italic">sq.</hi>;

                    rend="italic">C.</hi><hi rend="italic">I. L.,</hi> vii. 140). Only a few of them
                    are incised on stone (as that to the <hi rend="italic">Dea</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Ataedna</hi> from Spain, <hi rend="italic">C.</hi><hi rend="italic">I. L.,</hi>
                    ii. 462); for the most part they are written, in cursive letters, or in very
                    debased capitals, on small bronze or lead tablets (so <hi rend="italic"
                    >C.</hi><hi rend="italic">I. L.,</hi> i. 818, 819; Henz. 6114, 6115; Wil. 2747,
                    2748), to be laid in the tombs of the “defixi,” or deposited in the sanctuaries
                    of some divinity. Some new specimens of this class have been lately added from
                    Pavia and Arezzo in Italy (Mommsen, <hi rend="italic">Hermes,</hi> vol. iii.,
                    1868, p. 302, and vol. iv., 1869, p. 282 <hi rend="italic">sq.</hi>; Wil. 2749,
                    2753, 2754); one ,was lately found at Bath (Zangemeister, <hi rend="italic"
                    >Hermes,</hi> vol. xv., 1880, p. 588 <hi rend="italic">sqf</hi></p>
                <p>7. Many of the private documents just alluded to have not a monumental character
                    similar to that of the other inscriptions in the wider sense of the word, as
                    they are written on materials not very durable, such as wood and lead,—in the
                    majority of cases, in cursive characters; but, nevertheless, they cannot be
                    classed as literature. As a last species, therefore, of <hi rend="italic"
                    >instrumenta,</hi> there remain some documents, public and private, which
                    similarly lack the strict .monumental character, but still are to be reckoned,
                    among inscriptions. These are the inscriptions painted or scratched on the walls
                    of the buildings of ancient towns, like Pompeii, where, as was to be expected,
                    most of them have been preserved, those from other ancient cities buried by the
                    eruptions of Vesuvius and from Rome being very small in number. All the various
                    classes of these inscriptions—public and private advertisements, citations for
                    the municipal elections, and private scribblings of the most diverse (and
                    sometimes most indecent) character, once partly collected by Chr. Wordsworth <hi
                    rend="italic">(Inscriptiones</hi><hi rend="italic">Pompeianae,</hi> &amp;c.,
                    London, 1837, 1846)—are now arranged by Zangemeister in the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Corpus,</hi> vol. iv. (see also <hi rend="italic">Ephem. cpigr.,</hi> i. pp.
                    49, 177 <hi rend="italic">sq.,</hi> and some specimens in Wil. 1951 <hi
                    rend="italic">sqf</hi> whence their peculiar palaeographic and epigraphic rules
                    may be learned. And, lastly, as related to some of these advertisements, though
                    widely differing from them in age and character, may be mentioned the so-called
                    <hi rend="italic">diptycha</hi><hi rend="italic">consularia,</hi> monuments, in
                    the first instance, of the still very respectable skill in this branch of
                    sculpture to be found at this late period. They are, as is generally known,
                    carved-ivory tablets, in the form of <hi rend="italic">pugillaria,</hi> and seem
                    to have been invitations to .the solemnities connected with the accession of
                    high magistrates, especially to the spectacles of the circus and amphitheatre;
                    for they contain, along with representations of such spectacles, the names, and
                    often the portraits, of high functionaries, mostly of the 5th and 6th centuries.
                    Since Gori’s well-known work on this class of monuments <hi rend="italic"

                    has its merits, though it is somewhat antiquated, and is, besides, a rather
