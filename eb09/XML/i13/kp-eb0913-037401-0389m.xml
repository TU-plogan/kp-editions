                    rend="superscript"> v</hi> Iσακoς), the only child of Abraham and Sarah, was
                    born when his parents were respectively a hundred and ninety years of age (Gen.
                    xvii. 17). Explanations of the name seem to be intended by the sacred writer in
                    more than one reference to the incredulous or joyous laughter of his parents
                    when a son was promised to them (Gen. xxi. 6, xviii. 12, xvii. 17). Like his
                    father, Isaac lived a nomadic pastoral life, but within much narrower local
                    limits, and with an occasional experiment in agriculture (Gen. xxvi. 12). After
                    the death of his mother, he married Rebekah the daughter of his cousin Bethuel,
                    by whom after twenty years of married life he became the father of Esau and
                    Jacob. He died at the age of one hundred and eighty. The most striking episode
                    of his life as related in the Biblical record is that which took place while he
                    was still young, “in the land of Moriah,” when at the last moment he was by
                    angelic interposition released from the altar on which he was about to be
                    sacrificed by his father in obedience to a divine command. Other occurrences
                    which have been recorded have striking resemblances to incidents in the life of
                    Abraham. Of a less marked and energetic individuality than his father and sons,
                    Isaac is by general consent of the Christian church taken as a representative of
                    the unobtrusive, restful, piously contemplative type of human character. By
                    later Judaism, which fixed its attention chiefly on the altar scene, he was
                    regarded as the pattern and prototype of all martyrs. The Mahometan legends
                    regarding him are curious, but trifling. Among the far-fetched attempts of those
                    who prefer a mythological interpretation of the early incidents of the Bible
                    narrative may be mentioned those of Goldziher, who sees in Isaac a
                    personification of the smiling light of the ruddy evening sky, and of Popper,
                    who identifies the name with that of the dragon Azhi dahâka of Eranian folklore.
