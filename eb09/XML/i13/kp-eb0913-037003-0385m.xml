                    1792. By his father’s side, who followed the occupation of a tanner, he was
                    descended from a family long known in the district, and the purity of whose
                    Scotch lineage had been tinged by alliance with French Protestant refugees; but
                    it was from his mother’s race, the Lowthers, farmers or small proprietors in
                    Annandale, that he seems to have derived the most distinctive features of his
                    personality. The first stage of his education was passed at a school kept by
                    “Peggy Paine,” a relation of the well-known author of the <hi rend="italic">Age
                    of Reason,</hi> after which he entered the Annan academy, taught by Mr Adam
                    Hope, of whom there is a graphic sketch in the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Reminiscences</hi> of Thomas Carlyle. Of Irving’s career at school there is
                    nothing special to record if we except a slight liking for mathematical study,
                    which afterwards developed itself more decidedly. Even in his early years he had
                    a predilection for what was grave and solemn, but this tendency was also united
                    with genial mirthfulness and a special fondness for athletic exercises.</p>
                <p>At the age of thirteen Irving entered the university of Edinburgh. In 1809 he
                    graduated M.A.; and in 1810, on the recommendation of Sir John Leslie, he was
                    chosen master of an academy newly established at Haddington, where he became the
                    tutor of Jane Welsh, afterwards the wife of Thomas Carlyle. His appointment at
                    Haddington he exchanged for a similar one at Kirkcaldy in 1812. Completing his
                    divinity studies by a series of partial sessions, he was “licensed” to preach in
                    June 1815, <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0913-0386-0371"/> but continued to discharge his scholastic duties
                    for other three years. As a teacher he acquired the reputation of being a severe
                    disciplinarian,—apparently rather from the stern gravity with which he regarded
                    every kind of delinquency than from excessive severity in the actual
                    administration of chastisement; out of doors he identified himself with the
                    recreations of his pupils in a degree rare even at the present time, mingling
                    instruction and amusement so as to win their enthusiastic respect. During the
                    latter period of his stay at Kirkcaldy Irving renewed an acquaintanceship with
                    Thomas Carlyle, which ripened into lifelong friendship. While waiting with some
                    impatience for a permanent opportunity to exercise his gifts in the ministry, he
                    devoted his leisure, not only to mathematical and physical science, but to a
                    course of reading in English literature, his bias towards the antique in
                    sentiment and style being strengthened by a perusal of the older classics, among
                    whom Richard Hooker, denominated by him “the venerable companion of my early
                    days,” was his favourite author. At the same time his love of the marvellous
                    found gratification in the wonders of the <hi rend="italic">Arabian Hights,</hi>
                    and it is further characteristically related of him that he used to carry
                    continually in his waistcoat pocket a miniature copy of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Ossian,</hi> passages from which he frequently recited with “sonorous elocution
                    and vehement gesticulation.”</p>
                <p>The impression which Irving’s early appearances as a preacher produced upon his
                    hearers seems to have been more of a perplexing and bewildering than an edifying
                    character; but he himself never seems to have been troubled with doubts as to
                    whether preaching was his “vocation.” In the summer of 1818 he resigned his
                    mastership, and, in order to increase the probability of obtaining a permanent
                    appointment in the church, took up his residence in Edinburgh, where he now
                    resolved to write according to a new system specially adapted to the wants of
                    the age. Yet, although his exceptional method of address seems to have gained
                    him the qualified approval of certain dignitaries of the church, the prospect of
                    his obtaining a settled charge seemed as remote as ever, and he was meditating a
                    missionary tour in Persia when his departure was arrested by steps taken by Dr
                    Chalmers, which after considerable delay resulted, in October 1819, in Irving
                    being appointed his assistant and missionary in St John’s Parish, Glasgow.
                    Except in the case of a select few, Irving’s preaching awakened little interest
                    among the congregation of Chalmers, Chalmers himself, with no partiality for its
                    bravuras and flourishes, comparing it to “Italian music appreciated only by
                    connoisseurs”; but as a missionary among the poorer classes he wielded an
                    influence that was altogether unique. The benediction “Peace be to this house,”
                    with which, in accordance with apostolic usage, he greeted every dwelling he
                    entered, was not inappropriate to his figure and aspect, and it is said “took
                    the people’s attention wonderfully,” the more especially after the magic of his
                    personality found opportunity to reveal itself in close and homely intercourse.
                    This half-success in a subordinate sphere was, however, so far from coinciding
                    with his aspirations that he had again, in the winter of 1821, begun to turn his
                    attention towards missionary labour in the East, when the possibility of
                    fulfilling the dream of his life was suddenly revealed to him by an invitation
                    from the Caledonian church, Hatton Garden, London, to “make trial and proof” of
                    his gifts before the “remnant of the con" gregation which held together.” Over
                    that charge he was ordained in July 1822. Some years previously he had expressed
                    his conviction that “one of the chief needs of the age was to make inroad after
                    the alien, to bring in the votaries of fashion, of literature, of sentiment, of
                    policy, and of rank, who are content in their several idolatries to do without
                    piety to God and love to Him whom He hath sent;” and, with an abruptness which
                    must have produced on him at first an effect almost astounding, he now had the
                    satisfaction of beholding these various votaries thronging to hear from his lips
                    the words of wisdom which would deliver them from their several idolatries and
                    remodel their lives according to the fashion of apostolic times. This sudden
                    leap into popularity seems to have been occasioned in connexion with a veiled
                    allusion to Irving’s striking eloquence made in the House of Commons by Canning,
                    who had been induced to attend his church from admiration of an expression in
                    one of his prayers, quoted to him by Sir James Mackintosh. As far as the mere
                    manner of Irving’s eloquence was concerned, it was improbable that any eulogy
                    could err on the side of warmth and enthusiasm, for perhaps there never was any
                    one more highly gifted with what may be called the personal qualifications of an
                    orator. His commanding stature, the admirable symmetry of his form, the dark and
                    melancholy beauty of his countenance, rather rendered piquant than impaired by
                    an obliquity of vision, produced an imposing impression even before his deep and
                    powerful voice had given utterance to its melodious thunders; and harsh and
                    superficial halftruths enunciated with surpassing ease and grace of gesture, and
                    not only with an air of absolute conviction but with the authority of a
                    prophetic messenger in tones whose magical fascination was inspired by an
                    earnestness beyond all imitation of art, acquired a plausibility and importance
                    which, at least while the orator spoke, made his audience entirely forgetful of
                    their preconceived objections against them. The subject-matter of his orations,
                    and his peculiar treatment of his themes, no doubt also at least at first
                    constituted a considerable part of his attractive influence. He had specially
                    prepared himself, as he thought, for “teaching imaginative men, and political
                    men, and legal men, and scientific men who bear the world in hand”; and he did
                    not attempt to win their attention to abstract and worn-out theological
                    arguments, but discussed the opinions, the poetry, the politics, the manners and
                    customs of the time, and this not with philosophical comprehensiveness, not in
                    terms of warm eulogy or measured blame, but of severe satire varied by fierce
                    denunciation, and with a specific minuteness which was concerned primarily with
                    individuals. Indeed it was the titillation produced by his picturesque
                    unconventionality rather than any contagious emanation from his intense moral
                    energy that formed the principal basis of connexion between him and his
                    audience, with the majority of whom he was so deeply out of sympathy. The
                    pungency of the titillation was sufficiently evidenced by the fire of criticism
                    from pamphlets, newspapers, and reviews which opened on his volume of <hi
                    rend="italic">Orations,</hi> published in 1823; but the excitement produced was
                    merely superficial and essentially evanescent. Though cherishing a strong
                    antipathy to the received ecclesiastical formulas, Irving’s great aim was to
                    revive the antique style of thought and sentiment which had hardened into these
                    formulas, and by this means to supplant the new influences, the accidental and
                    temporary moral shortcomings of which he detected with instinctive certainty,
                    but whose profound and real tendencies were utterly beyond the reach of his
                    conjecture. Being thus radically at variance with the main current of the
                    thought of his time, the failure of the commission he bad undertaken was sooner
                    or later inevitable; and shortly after the opening of his new church in Regent
                    Square in 1827, he found that “fashion had taken its departure,” and the church,
                    “though always well filled,” was “no longer crowded.” By this desertion his
                    self-esteem, one of his strongest passions, though curiously united with
                    singular sincerity and humility, was doubtless hurt <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit13newyrich/page/n387/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0913-0387-0372"/> to the quick; but the wound inflicted was of a
                    deeper and deadlier kind, for it confirmed him finally in his despair of the
                    world’s gradual amelioration, and imparted to his tendency towards
                    supernaturalism a supremacy which virtually produced the partial suspension of
                    his intellectual faculties. For years the subject of prophecy had occupied much
                    of his thoughts, and his belief in the near approach of the second advent had
                    received such wonderful corroboration by the perusal of the work of a Jesuit
                    priest, writing under the assumed Jewish name of Juan Josafat Ben-Ezra, that in
                    1827 he published a translation of it, accompanied with an eloquent preface.
                    Probably the religious opinions of Irving, originally in some respects more
                    catholic and truer to human nature than generally prevailed in ecclesiastical
                    circles, had gained breadth and comprehensiveness from his intercourse with
                    Coleridge, but gradually his chief interest in Coleridge’s philosophy centred
                    round that which was mystical and obscure, and to it in all likelihood may be
                    traced his initiation into the doctrine of millenarianism, although Irving’s
                    imagination laid hold of this doctrine as an indispensable contrast to the dark
                    and hopeless foreground of the present, which his morbid and incurable
                    melancholy had led him to represent as robed in the gloomy draperies of the
                    “reign of Satan.” Towards supernaturalism he was indeed impelled, apart
                    altogether from any accidental association with individuals, both by certain
                    peculiar blemishes in his character and by its noblest excellences; and it
                    seemed a foregone necessity that he should become the moral victim of the
                    struggle between the old and new faiths. He had so imbibed the spirit of
                    apostolic times, and had accepted the old forms of Scriptural truths in such
                    entire good faith, that he virtually lived in an atmosphere of which the
                    miraculous constituted the principal element, and the tendency towards
                    supernaturalism thus associated with a profound moral sincerity was strengthened
                    as well as tainted by alliance with a love of outward magnificence and
                    splendour, and a restless craving after excitement, the result of misused and
                    over-exerted energy.</p>
                <p>The history of the remainder of Irving’s career is a striking example of the
                    power of one delusive prepossession partly to stifle and partly to frustrate the
                    beneficent exercise of noble mental and moral gifts. Impracticable, visionary,
                    deficient in appreciation of a whole side of human nature, and without real
                    depth of humour, he became the compliant tool of almost any one who offered to
                    supply him with the necessary corroboration of his own absorbing hallucination.
                    The first stage of his deflexion was associated with the prophetical conferences
                    at Albury, followed by an almost exclusive study of the prophetical books and
                    especially of the Apocalypse, and by several series of sermons on prophecy both
                    in London and the provinces, his apocalyptic lectures in 1828 rfu&gt;re than
                    crowding the largest churches of Edinburgh in the early summer mornings. In
                    1830, however, there was opened up to his ardent imagination a new vista into
                    spiritual things, a new hope for the age in which he lived, by the seeming
                    actual revival in a remote corner of Scotland of those apostolic gifts of
                    prophecy and healing which he had already in 1828 persuaded himself had only
                    been kept in abeyance by the absence of faith. At once he welcomed the new ‘ ‘
                    power” with an unquestioning evidence which could be shaken by neither the
                    remonstrances or desertion of his dearest friends, the recantation of some of
                    the principal agents of the “gifts,” his own declension into a-comparatively
                    subordinate position, the meagre and barren results of the manifestations, nor
                    their general rejection both by the church and the world. His excommunication by
                    the presbytery of London, in 1830, for publishing doctrines regarding the
                    humanity of Jesus Christ now generally held by the broad school of theologians,
                    and the condemnation of these opinions by the General Assembly of the Church of
                    Scotland in the follθλving year, were irrelevant and secondary episodes which
                    only affected the main issue of his career in so far as they tended still
                    further to isolate him from the sympathy of the church; but the “irregularities”
                    connected with the manifestation of the “gifts” gradually estranged the majority
                    of his own congregation, and on the complaint of the trustees to the presbytery
                    of London, whose authority they had formerly rejected, he was declared unfit to
                    remain the minister of the National Scotch Church of Regent Square. After he and
                    those who adhered to him had removed to a new building in Newman Street, he was
                    in March 1833 deposed from the ministry of the Church of Scotland by the
                    presbytery of Annan on the original charge of heresy. With the sanction of the
                    “power” he was now after some delay reordained “chief pastor of the church
                    assembled in Newman Street,” but unremitting labours and ceaseless spiritual
                    excitement soon completely exhausted the springs of his vital energy.
                    “Commissioned” by the “power” as “a prophet to do a great work in his native
                    land,” he, notwithstanding that he was ‘ ‘ sinking under a deep consumption,”
                    undertook a mission to Glasgow, where, though his “gigantic frame” was now seen
                    to “bear all the marks of age and weakness,” and his “tremendous voice” had
                    become “tremulous,” he bated no jot of heart or hope; and even when “stretched
                    in utter weakness,” and “visibly dying,” he, with unfaltering faith in the
                    testimony of the prophetic voice, waited for the moment when God “should bring
                    life and strength.” He died worn out and wasted with labour and absorbing care
                    while still in the prime of life, 4th December 1834.</p>

                    published in 5 volumes, edited by Gavin Carlyle. The earlier of his writings
                    abound in passages of finely figurative eloquence rising occasionally into a
                    strain of sublime poetic spiritualism, sometimes breaking out into wild notes of
                    melancholy and touching lamentation, and again hardening into vehement and
                    scornful invective. They manifest, not only a keen sense of the beauties of
                    nature, but a genuine interest in literature and art, a comprehensive if
                    somewhat vague intellectual grasp, and a moral discernment penetrating and
                    subtle, but tending towards narrowness of temper and sympathy. The style,
                    however, is so much influenced in its forms by his study of the older writers as
                    to seem stiff and antiquated, in addition to which many of its finer passages
                    are marred by glaring errors of taste, while there are already signs of that
                    tendency to irrelevancy and diffuseness which imparts such tediousness to his
                    later writings, and along with the exaggeration of his other defects,
                    contributed to deprive them of nearly all literary charm as well as of moral and
                    intellectual worth.</p>
