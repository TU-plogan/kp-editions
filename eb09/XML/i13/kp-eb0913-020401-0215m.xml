                    comparatively small breadth, which, together with the adjacent islands, was
                    occupied by Greeks of the Ionic race, and was thus permanently distinguished
                    from the interior district, which was inhabited by the Lydians.</p>
                <p>According to the tradition universally received among the Greeks, the cities of
                    Ionia were founded by emigrants from Greece on the other side of the Aegean, and
                    their settlement was connected with the legendary history of the Ionic race in
                    Attica and other parts of European Greece, by the statement that the colonists
                    were led by Neleus and Androclus, the two sons of Codrus, the last king of
                    Athens. In accordance with this view a definite date was assigned to the Ionic
                    migration, as it was called by later chronologers, who placed it one hundred and
                    forty years after the Trojan war, or sixty years after the return of the
                    Heraclidae into the Peloponnese. It is hardly necessary to remark that no
                    reliance can be placed upon this chronological statement; and it is altogether
                    improbable that the colonization of the whole of this important district took
                    place at the same period. All analogy would lead us to suppose that the
                    foundation of the different cities which ultimately constituted the Ionic League
                    took place at different times, and was perhaps spread over a long period of
                    time. It is, however, not improbable that the great Dorian invasion of the
                    Peloponnese, which gave rise to such extensive changes in the population of
                    European Greece, may have given the first impulse to the migration of a large
                    part of the Ionian inhabitants to the opposite shores of the Aegean. Nor is
                    there anything unlikely in the fact that a body so composed should have put
                    themselves under the command of a leader or cekist from Athens, which was
                    generally looked upon as the special representative of the Ionian race.<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Concerning the Ionian race in
                    Greece, the reader is referred to the article <hi rend="smallcaps">Greece,</hi>
                    vol. xi. p. 90.</p></note> But Herodotus himself tells us (i. 146) that they
                    were very far from being of unmixed Ionic descent, and comprised settlers from
                    many different tribes and cities of Greece (a fact indicated also by the local
                    traditions of the different cities), as well as by intermarriage with the native
                    races whom they found in possession of the country. A striking proof of this was
                    to be found in the fact that so late as the time of the historian several
                    distinct dialects were spoken by the inhabitants of different cities within the
                    limits of so restricted an area.</p>
                <p>Some modern critics have supposed that the population of this part of Asia was
                    originally of Ionic race, and that the settlers from Greece found the country in
                    the possession of a kindred people. But no trace is found in any ancient writers
                    of such a fact, or of the distinction established by these modern scholars
                    between the so-called Old Ionians and New Ionians. All that we know upon
                    anything like historical evidence is that at the earliest period when we hear of
                    any Greek population as existing on the east coasts of the Aegean we find there
                    a large group of cities, distinct in dialect and institutions from those to the
                    north and south of them, and generally regarded both by themselves and their
                    neighbours as derived by direct immigration from the people who bore the name of
                    Ionians in European Greece. Of the period of their settlement in Asia we have no
                    trustworthy evidence; but it appears to have been anterior to the rise of the
                    Lydian monarchy, which gradually became their most formidable neighbour.</p>
                <p>The cities comprised under this name in historical times were twelve in
                    number,—an arrangement copied as it was supposed from the constitution of the
                    Ionian cities in Greece, which had originally occupied the territory in the
                    north of the Peloponnese subsequently held by the Achaians. These were
                    (proceeding from south to north)— Miletus, Myus, Priene, Ephesus, Colophon,
                    Lebedus, Teos, Erythrae, Clazomenae, and Phocaea, together with the two
                    important islands of Samos and Chios. Smyrna, which subsequently assumed so
                    prominent a position among the cities of this part of Asia, was originally an
                    Aeolic colony, but was afterwards occupied by a band of Ionians from Colophon,
                    and became thenceforth an Ionian city,—an event which had taken place before the
                    time of Herodotus. But at what period it was admitted as a member of the Ionian
                    League we have no information.</p>
                <p>The cities above enumerated unquestionably formed a kind of league or confederacy
                    among themselves, of which their participation in the Pan-Ionic festival was the
                    distinguishing characteristic. But, like the Amphictyonie League in Greece
                    itself, this was rather of a sacred than a political character; every city, as
                    usual among the Greeks, enjoyed absolute autonomy, and, though common interests
                    often united them for a common political object, they never formed a real
                    confederacy like that of the Achaians or Boeotians; and the advice of Thales of
                    Miletus to combine in a more intimate political union found no approval among
                    them.</p>
                <p>The territory thus occupied was of small extent, not exceeding 90 geographical
                    miles in direct length from north to south, with a breadth varying from 20 to 30
                    miles, but to this must be added the remarkable peninsular promontory of Mimas,
                    together with the two large islands. So <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit13newyrich/page/n216/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0913-0216-0205"/> intricate indeed is the coast-line that the <hi
                    rend="italic">periplus</hi> or voyage along its shores was estimated at 340
                    geographical miles, or nearly four times the direct distance. A great part of
                    this area was, moreover, occupied by mountains, none of them attaining to any
                    great elevation, but filling up a considerable space. Of these the most lofty
                    and striking were— Mounts Mimas and Corycus, in the peninsula which stands out
                    to the west, facing the island of Chios; Mount Sipylos, to the north of Smyrna;
                    Mount Corax, extending to the south-west from the Gulf of Smyrna, and descending
                    to the sea between Lebedus and Teos; and the strongly marked range of Mount
                    Mycale, which is in fact a kind of continuation of the chain known as Mount
                    Messogis in the interior, and forms the bold headland of Trogilium or Mycale,
                    opposite to the island of Samos. None of these mountains attain a height of more
                    than from 3000 to 4000 feet; but they for the most part form abrupt and detached
                    ranges, intersecting the country in different directions. Confined as it thus
                    was, the narrow district in question had the advantage of comprising three broad
                    valleys, formed by the outflow of three rivers, among the most considerable in
                    Asia Minor:—the Hermus in the north, flowing into the Gulf of Smyrna, though at
                    a considerable distance from the city of that name; the Cayster, which flowed
                    under the walls of Ephesus; and the Maeander, which in ancient times discharged
                    its waters into the deep gulf that bathed the walls of Miletus, which has been
                    gradually filled up by its continued action. These valleys were all of them
                    extremely fertile, and besides them many smaller tracts were to be found between
                    the mountains and the sea, of great fertility, and enjoying the advantage of a
                    peculiarly fine climate, for which this part of Asia Minor has been famous in
                    all ages. The consequence is that Ionia enjoyed the reputation in ancient times
                    of being the most fertile of all the rich provinces of Asia Minor; and even in
                    modern times, though very imperfectly cultivated, it produces abundance of fruit
                    of all kinds, and the raisins and figs of Smyrna supply almost all the markets
                    of Europe.</p>
                <p>The colonies founded in such a favoured land speedily rose to opulence and
                    prosperity. Miletus especially was at an early period one of the most important
                    commercial cities of Greece, and in its turn became the parent of numerous other
                    colonies, which extended all around the shores of the Euxine and the Propontis,
                    from Abydus and Cyzicus to Trapezus and Panticapaeum. Phocaea also was one of
                    the first Greek cities whose mariners explored the distant shores of the western
                    Mediterranean, where they founded on the coast of Gaul the important colony of
                    Massilia. Ephesus also, though it did not send out any colonies of importance,
                    from an early period became a flourishing and opulent city, and gradually
                    attained to a position in this part of Asia corresponding in some measure to
                    that of Smyrna at the present day.</p>
                <p>The first event in the history of these Ionian cities of which we have any
                    trustworthy account is the invasion, or rather inroad, of the Cimmerians, a
                    nomad people from beyond the Euxine, who ravaged a great part of Asia Minor,
                    including the neighbouring Lydia, and even sacked Magnesia on the Maeander, but
                    were foiled in their attack upon Ephesus. This event may be referred to the
                    middle of the 7th century <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> A more formidable
                    danger soon threatened the Ionian Greeks from the rising power of the Lydian
                    monarchy. Gyges, the first king of the Mermnad dynasty (about 700 B. c. ),
                    already invaded the territories of Smyrna and Miletus, and is even said to have
                    taken Colophon, as his son Ardys did Priene. But neither conquest was durable,
                    and it was not till the reign of Croesus (560-545 <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >b.c.)</hi> that the cities of Ionia successively fell under the dominion of the
                    Lydian monarch. The defeat of Croesus by Cyrus was followed by the conquest of
                    all the Ionian cities by the Persian general Harpagus, and they henceforth
                    became subject to the Persian monarchy, in common with all the other Greek
                    cities of Asia. In this position they enjoyed a considerable amount of autonomy,
                    but were for the most part subject to the rule of local despots. It was at the
                    instigation of one of these, Histiaeus of Miletus, that in about 500 <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> the principal cities broke out into insurrection
                    against Persia, in which they were at first assisted by the Athenians, with
                    whose aid they even penetrated into the interior, and burnt the important city
                    of Sardis, an event which ultimately led to the Persian invasion of Greece. But
                    this first success was of little avail; the fleet of the Ionians was defeated in
                    a great battle off the little island of Lade, and the capture and destruction of
                    Miletus, after a long protracted siege, was followed by the reconquest of all
                    the Asiatic Greeks, insular as well as continental (494 <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >b.c.</hi>).</p>
                <p>The victories of the Greeks during the great Persian war had the effect of
                    enfranchising their kinsmen on the other side of the Aegean; and the battle of
                    Mycale (479 <hi rend="smallcaps">b,c.),</hi> in which the defeatof the Persians
                    was in great measure owing to the revolt of the Ionians, secured their
                    emancipation from the Persian yoke. They henceforth became, like most of the
                    inhabitants of the islands, the dependent allies of Athens, though still
                    retaining their autonomy, which they preserved until the peace of Antalcidas in
                    388 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> once more placed them, as well as the other
                    Greek cities in Asia, under the nominal dominion of Persia. They appear,
                    however, to have retained a considerable amount of freedom until the invasion of
                    Asia Minor by Alexander the Great brought about a fresh change. After the battle
                    of the Granicus most of the Ionian cities submitted at once to the conqueror;
                    Miletus alone held out, and was not reduced till after a long siege, 334 B.c.
                    From this time they passed successively under the dominion of the Macedonian
                    rulers of Asia, but continued to enjoy a state of great prosperity, both under
                    these Greek dynasties and after they had been united as a part of the province
                    of Asia with the all-absorbing empire of Rome.</p>
                <p>There was indeed one striking exception to this prosperity. Miletus, so long one
                    of the chief cities of Ionia, gradually sank into complete decay, a circumstance
                    owing not so much to political as to physical causes, the mass of alluvial
                    matter brought down by the river Maeander having gradually filled up the Latmian
                    Gulf, on which it was situated, so that the island of Lade was ultimately joined
                    to the mainland, and Miletus itself altogether ceased to be a seaport. The same
                    cause has at a later period produced the same effect, though in a less degree,
                    with the city of Ephesus; while the continually advancing deposits of the Hermus
                    threaten, at no distant period, unless prevented by the skill of modern
                    engineers, to close up the still more extensive Gulf of Smyrna.</p>
                <p>It has been mentioned that the Ionian cities were accustomed to celebrate in
                    common a festival called the Pan-Ionia; the sanctuary at which this was
                    celebrated, and which was also called the Panionium, was situated on the
                    northern slope of Mount Mycale, in the territory of Priene. But, besides this
                    common religious centre, Ionia contained also two of the most celebrated shrines
                    in all Asia, the temple of Artemis at Ephesus, and that of Apollo at Branchidae
                    near Miletus. It is probable that both sites were connected with local centres
                    of more ancient religious worship, and were adopted by the Ionian Greeks when
                    they first settled in Asia. (E. H. B.)</p>
