                    the birth of Joanna “Beltraneja,” she was, along with her uterine brother
                    Alphonso, removed by Henry to the court, where she showed a remarkable example
                    of staidness and sobriety. Already more than one suitor had made application for
                    her hand, Ferdinand of Aragon, who ultimately became her husband, being among
                    the number; for some little time she was engaged to his elder brother Carlos,
                    who died in 1461. When in her thirteenth year her brother promised her in
                    marriage to Alphonso of Portugal, but to this union she firmly refused to
                    consent; her resistance seemed less likely to be effectual in the case of the
                    marquis of Villena, the grand master of the order of Calatrava, to whom she was
                    next affianced, when she was delivered from her fears by the sudden death of the
                    bridegroom while on his way to the nuptials (1466). After an offer of the crown
                    of Castile, made by the revolutionary leaders in the civil war, had been
                    declined by her, she was in 1468 formally recognized by her brother as lawful
                    heir, after himself, to the united crowns of Castile and Leon. New candidates
                    for her hand now appeared in the persons of a brother of Edward IV. of England
                    (probably Richard, duke of Gloucester), and of the duke of Guienne, brother of
                    Louis XI., and heir presumptive of the French monarchy. Finally, however, in
                    face of very great difficulties, she was married to Ferdinand of Aragon at
                    Valladolid on October 19, 1469. Thenceforward the fortunes of the two spouses
                    were inseparably blended (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Ferdinand,</hi> vol. viii. p.
                    81). For some time they held a humble court at Duenas, and afterwards they
                    resided at Segovia, where on the death of Henry she was proclaimed queen of
                    Castile and Leon (December 13, 1474). The first months of her reign were fully
                    employed in coping with domestic disaffection and in repelling invasion from
                    Portugal; but peace was soon secured on a basis of such firmness and permanence
                    as rendered possible that successful policy the main features of which have
                    already been sketched elsewhere. Spain undoubtedly owed to Isabella’s clear
                    intellect, resolute energy, and unselfish patriotism much of that greatness
                    which for the first time it acquired under “the Catholic sovereigns.” The moral
                    influence of the queen’s personal character over the Castilian court was
                    incalculably great; from the debasement and degradation of the preceding reign
                    she raised it to being “the nursery of virtue and of generous ambition.” The
                    very sincerity of her piety and strength of her religious convictions led her
                    more than once, however, into great errors of state policy, which have never
                    since been repaired, and into more than one act which offends the moral sense of
                    a more refined age; her efforts for the introduction of the Inquisition into
                    Castile, and for the proscription of the Jews, are outstanding evidences of what
                    can only be called her bigotry. But not even the briefest sketch of the facts of
                    her life can omit to notice that happy instinct or intuition which led her, when
                    all others had heard with incredulity the scheme of Columbus, to recall the
                    wanderer to her presence with the words “I will assume the undertaking for my
                    own crown of Castile, and am ready to pawn my jewels to defray the expenses of
                    it, if the funds in the treasury should be found inadequate.” She died at Medina
                    del Campo on November 24, 1504, and was succeeded by her daughter Joanna “la
                    loca” (the “Crazy ”) with Ferdinand as regent. See Prescott <hi rend="subscript"
