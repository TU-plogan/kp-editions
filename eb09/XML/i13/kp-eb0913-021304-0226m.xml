                    principal river in the province of British Burmah, traversing the Pegu division
                    from north to south. The Irawadi is formed by the junction of two streams whose
                    source is as yet unknown, in about 26° N. lat. The chief tributaries are the
                    Mogoung, from the westward, which throws its water into the main stream (here
                    600 yards wide), in 24° 50' N. lat., and the Shwe li and Kyeng-dweng. Shortly
                    after leaving the mouth of the Mogoung it enters the first or upper defile. Here
                    the current is very rapid, and the return waters occasion violent eddies and
                    whirlpools. When the river is at its lowest, no bottom is found even at 40
                    fathoms. After receiving the Ta-peng from the east, it enters the second defile,
                    which is exceedingly picturesque, the stream winding in perfect stillness under
                    high bare rocks rising sheer out of the water. Farther down the Irawadi, and not
                    far from Mandalay, is the third or lowest defile. The banks are covered at this
                    point with dense vegetation, and slope down to the water’s edge; at places
                    appear almost perpendicular but wooded heights. The course of the Irawadi after
                    receiving the waters of the Myit-nge and Tsagaing, as far as 17° N. lat., is
                    exceedingly tortuous; the British frontier is crossed in 19° 29' 3" N. lat., 95°
                    15' E. long., the breadth of the river here being f mile; about 11 miles lower
                    down it is nearly 3 miles broad. At Akouk-toung, where a spur of the Arakan
                    hills ends in a precipice 300 feet high, the river enters the delta, the hills
                    giving place to low alluvial plains, now protected on the west by embankments.
                    From 17° N. lat. the Irawadi divides and subdivides, converting the lower
                    portion of its valley into a network of intercommunicating tidal creeks. It
                    reaches the sea in 15° 50' N. lat. and 95° 8' E. long., by nine principal
                    mouths. The only ones used by sea-going ships are the Bassein and Rangoon
                    mouths. The area of the catchment basin of the Irawadi is 158,000 square miles;
                    its total length from its known source to the sea is about 900 miles, the last
                    240 of which are in British territory. As far down as Akouk-toung in Henzada
                    district its bed is rocky, but below this sandy and muddy. It is full of islands
                    and sandbanks; its waters are extremely muddy, and the mud is carried far out to
                    sea. The river commences to rise in March; about June it rises rapidly, and
                    attains its maximum height about September. The total flood discharge for 1877
                    was 466,120,288,940 metre tons of 37 cubic feet. The river is navigable at all
                    seasons by steamers of light draught as high as the first defile, and during the
                    dry season for steamers drawing 6 feet as far as the frontier. The chief
                    tributaries of the Irawadi in British territory are the Tha-htùn (or Theug-dùn),
                    the Tha-de, and Thai-lai-dau from the west; and the Kye-ni, Bhwotlay, and
                    Na-weng from the east. Below Akouk-toung on the west and Prome on the east the
                    Irawadi receives no tributaries of any importance..</p>
                <p>The broad channel of the Irawadi has always been the sole means of communication
                    between the interior and the seaboard. From time immemorial the precious stones,
                    minerals, &amp;c., of Upper Burmah, Siam, and the Chinese frontier provinces
                    have been brought down by this route. At the present day the great bulk of the
                    trade is in the hands of the “Irrawaddy Flotilla Company,” an important English
                    carrying firm; but native boats still maintain a strenuous competition. The
                    flotilla of the company consists of about sixty vessels, including both steamers
                    and flats. They employ about 1770 hands, European and native, and distribute in
                    wages upwards of £50,000 a year. Their headquarters are at Rangoon, whence
                    steamers run twice a week to Bassein, and also to Mandalay.</p>

                <p>The latter service is continued twice a month to Bhamo, about 1000 miles from the
                    sea. The principal articles carried up stream are Manchester piece goods, rice,
                    salt, hardware, and silk. The articles carried down stream are raw cotton,
                    cutch, india-rubber, jade, spices, precious stones, timber, earth-oil, and dry
                    crops, such as wheat and pease. The value of the trade either way is roughly
                    estimated at about 1⅜ millions sterling. The total number of native boats on the
                    Ira wadi is returned at about 8000. They carry a large proportion of the heavy
                    articles of commerce, especially cutch and earth-oil.</p>
