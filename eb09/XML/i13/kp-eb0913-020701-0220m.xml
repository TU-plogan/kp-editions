                <p><label type="entry">IOWA</label>, one of the north-western States of the American
                    Union. Its boundary lines are—on the S. and N. the parallels 40° 36' and 43° 30'
                    of N. lat., on the E. the Mississippi river, and on the W. the Missouri and Big
                    Sioux rivers. The south-eastern corner projects slightly below the parallel of
                    40° 36', the boundary following the Des Moines river down to its mouth. The
                    neighbouring States are—Minnesota on the north, Wisconsin and Illinois on the
                    east, Missouri on the south, and Nebraska and Dakota on the west. The length of
                    the State from north to south is about 200 miles, and its greatest breadth from
                    east to west 300 miles. Its area is 35,228,800 acres, or 55,045 square
                    miles.</p>
                <p>The State lies entirely within the prairie region of the Mississippi valley, and
                    has a level or undulating surface. Its mean height above the sea is 925
                    feet,—ranging from 500 in the south-east to 1700 in the north-west. About 24,600
                    square miles of the area rise less than 1000 feet above sea-level.</p>
                <p>The surface presents very little relief. A broad elevation (1700 feet at the
                    north boundary, and decreasing gradually southwards) separates the waters of the
                    Mississippi from those of the Missouri. The position of this “divide” is, for
                    the most part, near the western border of the State, giving to the branches of
                    the Mississippi long courses and an easy fall, while those of the Missouri have
                    comparatively short courses and a rapid fall. Near their sources, these
                    branches, both of the Mississippi and Missouri, flow in broad, shallow valleys.
                    Farther down their courses, however, bluffs develop, and increase gradually in
                    height, while the valleys in general become narrower. The bluffs bordering the
                    valley of the Mississippi range in height from 200 to 400 feet, the valley
                    between them being usually from 4 to 8 miles in width, although in a few places,
                    as at Dubuque, they close in upon the river on both sides. On the Missouri, the
                    bluffs range from 200 to 300 feet in height, enclosing a bottom land 5 to 12
                    miles in width.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Rivers and Lakes.—</hi> The Mississippi and Missouri are the
                    only navigable rivers. They have ample depth of water for all purposes of inland
                    navigation. At two points upon the former river, indeed (at Rock Island and near
                    Keokuk), there are rapids which at low water form partial obstructions to
                    navigation; but at high water steamers can run them in either direction. A canal
                    is now being made to facilitate the passage of the lower or Des Moines rapids,
                    and works are projected for the improvement of the upper or Rock Island rapids.
                    The other rivers are the Upper Iowa, Turkey, Maquoqueta, Wapsipinicon, Iowa,
                    Cedar, Skunk, or Checauqua, and Des Moines, flowing into the Mississippi, and
                    the Chariton, Nodaway, Grand, Nishna-botany, and Little and Big Sioux, flowing
                    into the Missouri. None of these streams are navigable. A few small lakes are
                    found in the north-west, on or near the divide between the two great rivers. The
                    area of swamp and marsh surface is proportionally small, and is rapidly
                    diminishing.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Forests.—</hi> As in most of the prairie region of the
                    Mississippi valley, there is in this State but little forest, the timber being
                    confined to the bottom lands of the streams and the faces of the bluffs. The
                    commonest trees are the oak, elm, cottonwood, black walnut, hickory, maple, and
                    linden. Upon the bluffs is found a sparse growth of pines and red cedar.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Geology.—</hi> The geology of the State is remarkably simple;
                    excepting in the north-western quarter, where the formations are so covered with
                    Quaternary drift as to be unrecognizable, there is from north-east to south-west
                    a succession of belts, from the Lower Silurian to the top of the Carboniferous,
                    varying in breadth and extending northwest and south-east. The Silurian occupies
                    but a comparatively small area in the north-eastern corner. A strip of Devonian
                    follows, 40 to 50 miles in width, extending from Davenport on the Mississippi
                    north-westward to the northern boundary. The south-western <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit13newyrich/page/n221/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0913-0221-0208"/> half of the State is overlaid by the different
                    members of the Carboniferous formation, with here and there fragments of
                    Cretaceous beds, which have survived the enormous erosion to which the surface
                    has everywhere been subjected.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Minerals.—</hi> It is estimated that about 7000 square miles
                    are underlaid by the Coal-measures. Within this area coal beds of workable
                    thickness and quality have been found at Fort Dodge, Moingona, Des Moines, and
                    Oskaloosa, where they are being extensively worked. The coal is bituminous, no
                    anthracite having been found in the State. The north-eastern part of Iowa is
                    included within the great lead region of the Upper Mississippi; and, although
                    the palmy days of the mines of that region are over, the product is yet very
                    important. The ore, which is galena, is found in pockety deposits in the
                    limestones of the Silurian formation. These deposits vary immensely in size, and
                    in general extend to no great depth, and therefore cannot be relied upon for
                    permanence.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Climate.—</hi> The climate resembles in its essential features
                    that of the rest of the prairie States, excepting that towards the west the
                    aridity of the atmosphere and the decreased rainfall characteristic of the great
                    plains begin to be perceptible. The annual rainfall ranges from 24 to 44 inches,
                    with an average of about 36 inches, the southeastern portion receiving the
                    greatest amount, and the western part the least. The mean annual temperature
                    ranges from 42° to 52° Fahr., the summer mean from 66° to 79° and the winter
                    mean from 14° to 27° showing a difference between the summer and winter
                    temperatures of 52°. The highest single observed temperatures have been 95° to
                    105°, and the lowest 18° to 33° below zero, an extreme range of about 125°. The
                    south-eastern portion has the mildest and most equable temperature, as well as
                    the greatest rainfall. Northward and westward the temperature becomes lower and
                    extremes greater.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Soil.—</hi> The soil is extremely fertile, whether drift,
                    bluff, or alluvial. The drift, whose name explains its origin, covers the
                    greater part of the State. It is a dark loam, 1 to 2 feet in depth, and of
                    almost inexhaustible fertility. The bluff soil or loess occupies the country
                    bordering upon the valley of the Missouri. It is supposed to be a subaerial
                    deposit, brought by the prevalent westerly winds from the plains of Nebraska and
                    Dakota, and deposited here near the borders of the humid region. It has a great
                    depth, reaching 200 feet in some instances, and is everywhere extremely rich.
                    The alluvial soil, found in the valleys and bottom-lands, is the deposit of the
                    streams, and varies in composition with the country which the streams have
                    traversed above. Much of it on the Missouri and its branches is composed of
                    loess, while that on the Mississippi is mainly altered drift deposits.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Agriculture.—</hi> The agricultural interest is by far the
                    largest and most important of the State. In the production of Indian corn it
                    ranks second, and of wheat fifth, among the States of the Union. The following
                    table, taken from the report of the department of agriculture, shows the amount
                    of the agricultural products for 1879:—</p>

                    The increased value of the latter is due to the scarcity of forests. The average
                    monthly wages paid to agricultural labourers during the same year was $23’26;

                <p><hi rend="italic">Communication.—</hi> For means of communication and
                    transportation Iowa is dependent almost entirely upon its railroads and its two
                    bounding rivers. It has no canals, if we except the short one around the Des
                    Moines rapids.</p>
                <p>In 1880 there were forty-five railroads, working 4779 miles of track, with a
                    total capital stock of $60,000,000, and a funded debt of $44,400,000. The total
                    amount invested in railroads exceeded $100,000,000. The total gross earnings of
                    the companies from passengers, freight, and mails was $5,218,000, of which
                    $1,415,000 or 27 per cent, were net earnings. This is but 2- <hi

                <p><hi rend="italic">Banks.—</hi> According to the report for 1880 of the controller
                    of the currency, there were in operation in Iowa 75 national banks, having a
                    capital of $5,837,000, and an outstanding circulation of $4,697,314; 60 State
                    banks and trust companies, with a capital of $2,521,985, holding $6,100,367 of
                    deposits; 245 private bankers, representing a capital of $2,583,754, with
                    deposits amounting to $7,017,806; and 4 savings banks, with a capital of
                    $48,167, having deposits amounting to $208,018.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Administration.—</hi> As in the other States, the governmental
                    power is divided among three departments, known as the executive, legislative,
                    and judicial.</p>
                <p>The officers of the executive department are the governor, lieutenant-governor,
                    secretary of state, auditor, treasurer, superintendent of public instruction,
                    and register of the State land office. All these officers are elected by the <pb
                    break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit13newyrich/page/n222/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0913-0222-0209"/> people, the term of office being in each case two
                    years. No one is eligible for the office of governor or lieutenant-governor who
                    is less than thirty years of age, or has not been a citizen of the United States
                    and of the State for at least two years. The governor is commander-in-chief of
                    the militia. He has the power of filling vacancies in office in cases for which
                    the law does not otherwise provide, of calling the general assembly to meet in
                    extra session, of vetoing laws passed by the general assembly, and of pardoning
                    persons convicted of any crime excepting treason. The lieutenant-governor is <hi
                    rend="italic">ex offi,cio</hi> president of the State senate; and, in the event
                    of the death, resignation, or removal of the governor, he assumes his
                    office.</p>
                <p>The legislative department is vested in the general assembly, which consists of a
                    senate and house of representatives. The former consists of not more than 50
                    senators, who are elected for terms of four years. Each senator must be at least
                    twenty-five years of age, and must be a citizen of the State. The house of
                    representatives consists of not more than 100 representatives. Their term of
                    office is two years. A representative must have attained the age of twenty-one
                    years. The general assembly meets at Des Moines (which since 1857 has been the
                    capital), and holds a regular session once in two years.</p>
                <p>The judicial department comprises a supreme court and district and circuit
                    courts. Its officers are the judges of the several courts, clerk and reporter of
                    the supreme court, attorney-general and district attorneys, all of whom are
                    elected by the people. The supreme court consists of four judges, whose term of
                    office is six years. The senior in office is the chief justice. The State is
                    divided into a certain number of judicial districts, in each of which are
                    elected every four years a judge of the district and of the circuit court and a
                    district attorney. The latter is the prosecuting attorney for his district.</p>
                <p>The representation of the State in the national congress consists of two
                    senators, chosen by joint ballot of the two houses of the general assembly, and
                    of nine representatives, elected directly by the people of the congressional
                    districts.</p>
                <p>The State is divided into ninety-nine counties. Their officers are all elected by
                    the people, and the tenure of office is two years. They are—three, five, or
                    seven supervisors (who collectively form a “board of supervisors”), an auditor,
                    a clerk of the district and circuit courts, a sheriff, treasurer, recorder,
                    superintendent of schools, coroner, and surveyor. The board of supervisors have
                    authority over the property of the county, levy State and county taxes, and keep
                    in repair roads and bridges. Each county is divided into civil townships, which
                    are in most cases 6 miles square, corresponding with the congressional or survey
                    townships of the general land system. Each township is under a civil government,
                    administered by three trustees, a clerk, an assessor of taxes, and two or more
                    justices of the peace and constables. All these officers are elected by the
                    people, and all, with the exception of the justices of the peace, whose term is
                    two years, serve for one year only. The trustees are the general managers of the
                    affairs of the township. They are the judges of election, and have charge of
                    fences and roads, and the care of the poor. Cities and towns, when incorporated,
                    are not removed from the jurisdiction of the township officers.</p>

                    from $900,000,000. It is impossible to make an estimate of the true valuation of
                    personal property.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Education.—</hi> The State is divided into school districts,
                    each civil township constituting one, with such incorporated cities and towns as
                    may so elect. The support of the educational system is derived from the proceeds
                    from all sales of State lands, 5 per cent, of all proceeds from sales of land
                    belonging to the general Government within the State, a county tax of not less
                    than 1 mill nor more than 2⅛ mills on the dollar, and a district tax of not more
                    than 1⅛ per cent, upon the assessed valuation of the property within the school
                    district. Besides these, there are several other minor sources of revenue. The
                    amount of the school district tax for 1880 was $3,704,465, and the county tax
                    for schools, $409,110, giving a total taxation for support of schools of
                    $4,113,575. The total valuation of school property is estimated at $12,197,396.
                    The total school district debt, all which is bonded, is $1,125,138. The schools
                    are graded, and classified as primary, intermediate, grammar, and high schools.
                    The law permits a high school in each county.</p>

                    normal, medical, and law departments. The State also supports a school of
                    agriculture and the mechanical arts, located near Ames, in Story county. There
                    are also several colleges supported by religious denominations, the greater
                    number of them belonging to the Methodists, theological seminaries, and a

                    purchase. In 1834 all that part of the United States lying west of the
                    Mississippi river and north of Missouri, including the present area of Iowa, was
                    placed under the jurisdiction of the Territory of Michigan, and two years later
                    the Territory of Wisconsin was created, including what is now Iowa. In 1838 Iowa
                    itself was made a Territory, and on December 28, 1846, it was admitted to the
                    Union as a State. At the time of the Louisiana purchase, this region was
                    occupied by the Sioux, Sac and Fox, and Iowa tribes of Indians. The first white
                    settlements within the State were made along the Mississippi in 1833,—Fort
                    Madison, Burlington, and Dubuque being the first points occupied. From these
                    points settlement spread westward, and the growth of the Territory and State has
                    from that time been rapid and steady. (H. G.*).</p>
