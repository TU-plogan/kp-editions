                    over an area of 272,140 square miles of eastern Siberia, and bounded by the
                    Yenissei and Yakutsk governments, the Trans-Baikal region, and the Chinese
                    frontier. It is divided into the districts of Kirensk, Nizhne-Udinsk, Irkutsk,
                    Verkholensk, and Balagansk.</p>
                <p>The surface of the government is mountainous, especially in the south-west. While
                    the greater part lies at a level of from 1200 feet to nearly 3000 feet above the
                    sea, the range of the Sayanski mountains reaches from 6000 feet to between 7000
                    and 8000 feet (the highest point, Mungu Sarduik, is in Chinese territory). Other
                    mountains of note are the Gurbi Daban and Tunkinski Byelki ranges and the massif
                    of the Khamar Daban. All the rivers of the government belong either to the
                    system of the Yenissei (as the Angara and the two Tunguskas) or to that of the
                    Lena (as the Kirenga, the Tchaya, the Tchuya, the Kuta, the Hga). Of the
                    geological features of the country the most remarkable is the wide distribution
                    of volcanic products—basalts, dolerites, tuffs, obsidians even, and pumice. The
                    mountain chains consist in the main, of crystalline rocks. Iron is obtained in
                    considerable quantities; coal-beds exist in various parts, especially in the
                    basin of the Angara; graphite is wrought in several places; and salt-springs
                    form the object of a considerable exploitation.</p>

                <p>In 1879 the number of factories and public works in the government was 117, with
                    3322 workmen and a production amounting to 3,647,045 roubles, besides 57
                    workshops with upwards of 250 workmen and a production of nearly 280,000
                    roubles. The distilleries ranked first with 1,897,500 roubles. In the iron-works
                    of Nicolaieff 795 workmen were employed, and the production was valued at
                    442,110 roubles. The salt-works were credited with 298,852 roubles, the cloth
                    factories with 115,365, and the porcelain potteries with 85,962. The principal
                    pottery is situated in the <hi rend="italic">okrug</hi> or circle of Irkutsk,
                    and employs about 1500 workmen; and its wares are widely known throughout all
                    Siberia. The chief cloth factory is at Telminsk, about 40 miles from Irkutsk.
                    Cigars are manufactured to the value of 115,000 roubles. See the <hi

                    Government, 1881.</p>
                <p>The population, which in 1862 was 363,375, was 383,578 in 1879 (199,344 males).
                    At the latter date the native tribes numbered 115,783 souls (59,979 males); the
                    Buriats are the most numerous, these amounting to about 116,000 in 1862. The
                    Yakuts and Tunguses are comparatively few. Of the European population a large
                    proportion are exiles or descendants of exiles, most of them being of Polish
                    blood. Shamanism was in 1879 the religion of 66,422, and Lamaism that of 12,491;
                    1837 were Mahometans, and 2878 Jews. Of the Christian population (319,919), the
                    Orthodox Greek Church claims 296,521, and 2427 are Roman Catholics. In 1862 the
                    Jews were under 900 and the Roman Catholics about 1200. The native tribes are
                    being rapidly incorporated by the Orthodox Church.</p>
                <p>According to observations taken at the town of Irkutsk, which is one of the
                    regular meteorological stations of Russia (1536 feet above the sea), the
                    temperature ranged in 1879 from 99° Fahr, in July to 34° below zero in January.
                    In 1876 the minimum was 40° below zero. The mean temperature in summer is 56°,
                    and in winter 7°.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Irkutsk,</hi> the chief town of the government of the same
                    name, is under various aspects the most important place in all Siberia, being
                    not only the greatest centre of population and principal commercial depot to the
                    north of Tashkend, but the residence of the governor-general, a fortified
                    military post, an archbishopric, and the seat of several learned societies. It
                    is situated in 52° 17' N. lat. and 104° 12' E. long., 3780 miles from St
                    Petersburg. The town proper lies on the right bank of the Angara, a tributary of
                    the Yenissei, and on the opposite bank is the Glaskovsk suburb. The river, which
                    has a breadth of 1890 feet, is crossed by a flying bridge. The Irkut, from which
                    the town takes its name, is a small river which rises in Lake Ilchin and joins
                    the Angara directly opposite the present town, the main portion of which is
                    separated from the monastery, the castle, the port, and the suburbs by another
                    confluent the Ida or Ushakovka. Irkutsk has long been reputed a remarkably fine
                    city for such an outlying situation—its streets being straight, broad, well
                    paved, and well lighted; but in 1879, on the 22d and 24th June (4th and 6th
                    July), the greater proportion of its houses being of wood, the central and most
                    important part fell a prey to a great conflagration. In the accompanying plan
                    the area laid waste is indicated by the lighter shade. The palace of the
                    governor-general, the principal administrative and municipal offices, and many
                    of the other public buildings were destroyed; and the government archives, the
                    admirable library (10,000 vols.) and museum of the Siberian section of the
                    Geographical Society, with minor collections of the same kind, were utterly
                    ruined. . The total loss was estimated at 30,000,000 roubles. Full details will
                    be found in D. D. Larionoff’s <hi rend="italic">Cub. gorod Irkutsk</hi>
                    (Irkutsk, 1880). A cathedral (built of wood in 1693 and rebuilt of stone in
                    1718) and other twenty-three Orthodox churches, a fine gymnasium, a school of
                    medicine, a museum, a theatre, a town’s hospital and a military hospital, an
                    orphan asylum, an infirmary, the penitentiary, and the crown factories are among
                    the public institutions and buildings.</p>
                <p>The origin of Irkutsk is to be found in the winter-quarters established by Ivan
                    Pokhaboff for the collection of the fur tax from the Buriats. Its existence as a
                    town dates from 1686. The first church, that of our Saviour, and the monastery
                    of the Ascension, 3⅜ miles from the town, were built in 1672, and that of the
                    Apparition of the Virgin in 1693. It was in 1731 that the town was made the
                    administrative centre of the Irkutsk province, and its position as chief town of
                    the government dates from 1764. Its population, which was about 6500 at the time
                    of Gmelin’s visit (1740), had increased to 16,569 by 1838, and to 24,779 in 1862
                    (12,639 males). An elaborate census taken in 1875 gave 18,076 males and 14,436
                    females, a total of 32,512. This increase is wholly produced by immigration; for
                    the death-rate always considerably exceeds the birth-rate, a fact easily
                    explained by the vast proportion of the unmarried classes,—public employés,
                    soldiers, ecclesiastics, prisoners, and domestics amounting to 12,876 in
                    1875.</p>
