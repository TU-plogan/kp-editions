                    name is obtained from <hi rend="italic">Cephaelis Ipecacuanha,</hi> A. Rich., a
                    small shrubby plant of the natural order <hi rend="italic">Cincho-nαcese.</hi>
                    It is a native of Brazil, growing in clumps or patches in moist shady forests
                    from 8° to 22° S. lat., and is believed to extend to the Bolivian province of
                    Chiquitos, and the valley of Cauca in New Granada. The drug of commerce is
                    procured chiefly from the region lying between the towns of Cuyaba, Villa Bella,
                    Villa Maria, and Diamantina in the province of Matto Grosso, and near the German
                    colony of Philadelphia, north of Rio Janeiro. Ipecacuanha, although in common
                    use in Brazil, was not employed in Europe previous to 1672. In France within a
                    few years after that date it formed the chief ingredient in a remedy for
                    dysentery, the secret of the composition of which was purchased by the French
                    Government for 1000 louis d’or, and made public in 1688. The botanical source of
                    ipecacuanha was not accurately known until 1800.</p>
                <p>The mode of obtaining the root is thus described by Weddell. The collector or <hi
                    rend="italic">poayero</hi> grasps the whole of the stems of the <hi
                    rend="italic">poaya</hi> or ipecacuanha plant in one hand, and loosens the roots
                    by inserting a stick obliquely under them, to which is given a see-saw motion;
                    the adhering soil is then shaken off, and the root placed in a bag. A poayero
                    collects on the average about 10 to 12 lb of the root in a day, but sometimes as
                    much as 30 fl), or as little as 6 fl) or 8 K&gt;. The root requires to be dried
                    rapidly; it is therefore spread out in the sunshine as much as possible, and at
                    night is covered over to shield it from the dew. In about three days, under
                    favourable circumstances, it becomes dry, and is then broken up, sifted to
                    remove sand or dirt, and packed in “serons,” or bales made of cowhide.</p>
                <p>The root is gathered during the whole of the year, but in less quantity during
                    the rainy season on account of the difficulty of drying the root. As imported,
                    about three packages out of four are damaged by sea-water or damp. The root
                    appears to be possessed of very great vitality, for in 1869 M <hi
                    rend="superscript"> t</hi> Nab, the late curator of the Botanical Gardens of
                    Edinburgh, discovered that so small a portion as - <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi>
                    ⅛ of an . inch of the annulated root, placed in suitable soil, would throw out a
                    leaf-bud and develop into a fresh plant, while Lindsay, a gardener in the same
                    establishment, proved that even the leaf-stalk is capable of producing roots and
                    buds; hence there is but little probability of the plant being destroyed in its
                    native habitat. The great value of the drug in dysentery, and its rapid increase
                    in price from an average of 2s. 9⅜d. per ft&gt; in 1850 to about 8s. 9d. per
                    fl&gt; in 1870, led to attempts to acclimatize the plant in India, which,
                    however, have not hitherto proved to be a commercia] success, owing to the
                    difficulty of finding suitable spots for its cultivation, and to its slowness of
                    growth. Like other dimorphic plants, ipecacuanha ripens seeds best when
                    cross-fertilized, and presents various forms. Two of these have been described
                    by Professor Balfour of Edinburgh, one distinguished by having a woody stem,
                    firm elliptic or oval leaves, with wavy margins and few hairs, and the other by
                    an herbaceous stem, and leaves less coriaceous in texture, more hairy, and not
                    wavy at the margins. This diversity of form is most apparent in young plants,
                    and tends to disappear with age.</p>
                <p>Ipecacuanha root occurs in pieces about 2 or 3 lines in thickness, of a
                    greyish-brown or reddish-brown tint externally, having a ringed or annulated
                    surface, and exhibiting a white or greyish interior and a hard wiry centre. It
                    has a faint rather musty odour, and a bitterish taste. It is usually mixed with
                    more or less of the slender subterranean stem, which has a very thin bark, and
                    is thus easily distinguished from the root. The activity of the drug resides
                    chiefly in the cortical portion, and hence the presence of the stem diminishes
                    its value. The variety imported from New Granada and known as Cartagena
                    ipecacuanha differs only in its larger size and in being less conspicuously
                    annulated. Ipecacuanha owes its properties to the presence of rather less than 1
                    per cent, of the alkaloid emetine, which, with the exception of traces, occurs
                    only in the cortical portion of the root. The formula assigned to emetine has
                    been variously stated by different chemists, that published by Lefort and Wurtz
                    in 1877 is C <hi rend="subscript"> 28</hi> H <hi rend="subscript"> 40</hi> N <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 2</hi> O <hi rend="subscript"> 5</hi>. Emetine is a white
                    powder, turning brown on exposure to light, and softening at 70° C. (158°
                    Fahr.). It is precipitated from its solution by tannin and nitrate of potassium,
                    and is soluble in chloroform, but only slightly so in ether. A solution
                    containing only <hi rend="subscript"> 7</hi> oW part of emetine has been shown
                    by Power to become of an intense and permanent yellow colour when treated with a
                    solution of chlorinated lime and a little acetic acid. Emetine exists in the
                    root in combination with ipecacuanhic acid, which according to Reich is a
                    glucoside. It is amorphous, bitter, and very hygroscopic. The root contains also
                    about 37 per cent, of starch, a large quantity of pectin, and small proportions
                    of resin, fat, albumen, and fermentable and crystallizable sugar.</p>
                <p>Ipecacuanha is one of the safest and most valuable emetics, being more suitable
                    for administering to children than any other. The amount required to produce its
                    effect varies considerably, children as a rule being more tolerant than adults:
                    according to Ringer, thirty grains is the average dose for an adult, twenty
                    grains for young children. Its action is rather slow, taking place in from 20
                    minutes to half an hour after ingestion. Minute quantities of the drug, on the
                    contrary, such as drop doses of ipecacuanha wine every hour or three times a
                    day, <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit13newyrich/page/n224/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0913-0224-0211"/> according to the urgency of the case, have the
                    effect of checking vomiting arising from natural causes. The nauseating and
                    emetic properties of ipecacuanha are believed to be due to its influencing the
                    peripheral terminations of the pneumogastric nerve, since it produces vomiting
                    even if injected into the blood. In nauseating doses it acts both as a
                    diaphoretic and antispasmodic. It is also a stimulant or irritant of the mucous
                    membranes, and is hence classed as an expectorant, and used successfully in
                    cough, bronchitis, gastric catarrh, and diarrhoea. Some individuals are so
                    sensitive to the action of ipecacuanha as to suffer, even on smelling the drug
                    on entering a room where it is kept, all the symptoms of coryza, hay fever, or
                    bronchitis. In large doses of from 60 to 90 grains, repeated if required in 10
                    or 12 hours,— the patient lying on his back to prevent sickness or nausea, —it
                    is found to be one of the most valuable remedies in dysentery, especially in the
                    epidemic and sporadic forms met with in tropical and malarious countries.
                    Externally applied in the form of ointment, ipecacuanha causes considerable
                    irritation, followed by the appearance of pustules and ulceration. In doses of
                    one-eighth to one-sixth of a grain it acts as a stomachic, and probably
                    increases the gastric secretions.</p>

                    properties to a greater or less degree.</p>
                <p>The term <hi rend="italic">poaya</hi> is applied in Brazil to emetic roots of
                    several genera belonging to the natural orders <hi rend="italic">Cinchonaccae,
                    Violaceae,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Polygalaceae,</hi> and hence several
                    different roots have from time to time been sent over to England as ipecacuanha;
                    but none of them possesses the ringed or annulated appearance of the true drug.
