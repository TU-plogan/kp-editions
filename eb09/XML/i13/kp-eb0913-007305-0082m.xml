                    lost his father in early childhood, was educated at the grammar school at
                    Slagelse, and entered the university of Copenhagen in 1806. His studies were
                    interrupted by the English invasion, and on the first night of the bombardment
                    of the city Ingemann stood with the young poet Blichet on the walls, while the
                    shells whistled past them, and comrades were killed on either side. All his
                    early and unpublished writings were destroyed by the English when they burned
                    the town. Iu 1811 he published his first volume of poems, and in 1812 his
                    second, followed in 1813 by a book of lyrics entitled <hi rend="italic"
                    >Procne.</hi> These three volumes were extremely well received, and so was his
                    cycle of romances in verse, called <hi rend="italic">The Black Knight,</hi>
                    1814. With these books he attained at once the leading position in Denmark as a
                    lyrist, and he then turned his attention to the drama. In 1815 he published two
                    tragedies, <hi rend="italic">Masanidlo</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Blanca,</hi>
                    followed by <hi rend="italic">The Voice in the Desert, The Shepherd of</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Tolosa,</hi> and other romantic plays. After a variety of
                    publications, all enormously successful, he travelled iu 1818 to Italy. At Rome
                    he wrote <hi rend="italic">The Liberation of Tasso,</hi> and returned in 1819 to
                    Copenhagen. In 1820 he began to display his real power in a volume of delightful
                    tales. In 1821 his dramatic career closed with the production of an unsuccessful
                    comedy, <hi rend="italic">Magnetism in a Barber's Shop.</hi> In 1822 the poet
                    was nominated lector in Danish language and literature at Sörö College, and he
                    now married. <hi rend="italic">Valdemar the Great and his Men,</hi> an
                    historical epic, appeared in 1824. The next few years were occupied with his
                    best and most durable work, his four great historical novels of <hi
                    rend="italic">Valdemar Seier,</hi> 1826; <hi rend="italic">EriL Menvefs
                    Childhood,</hi> 1828; <hi rend="italic">King Erik,</hi> 1833; and <hi
                    rend="italic">Prince Otto of Denmark,</hi> 1835. He then returned to epic poetry
                    in <hi rend="italic">Queen Margaret,</hi> 1836, and <hi rend="italic"
                    >Holger</hi><hi rend="italic">Danske,</hi> 1837. The number of his later
                    writings is too great to permit us to chronicle them. They consist of religious
                    and sentimental lyrics, epic poems, novels, short stories in prose, and fairy
                    tales. His last publication was <hi rend="italic">The Apple of Gold,</hi> 1856.
                    In 1846 Ingemann was nominated director of Sörö College, a post from which he
                    retired in 1849. He died peacefully and happily on the evening of the 24th of
                    February 1862. Ingemann enjoyed during his lifetime a popularity which Was
                    unapproached even by that of Oehlensehläger, and in fact it may be said that no
                    Danish poet has ever been nearly so popular as he. But criticism has been busy
                    since his death in reversing this decision of the public, and Ingemann now takes
                    a place in Danish literature below four or five of his immediate contemporaries.
                    His boundless facility and fecundity, his sentimentality, his religious
                    melancholy, his direct appeal to the domestic affections, gave him instant
                    access to the ear of the public. His novels are better than his poems; of the
                    former the best are those which are directly modelled on the manner of Sir
                    Walter Scott. As a dramatist *he has entirely outlived his reputation, and his
                    unwieldy epics are now little read. Ingemann was a purely sentimental writer,
                    and his reputation has proved no less ephemeral than the fashion for
                    sentiment.</p>
