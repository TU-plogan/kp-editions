                    <hi rend="italic">infantiae</hi><hi rend="italic">proximus</hi>; and from the
                    eighth year to puberty he is <hi rend="italic">pubertati proximus.</hi> An
                    infant in the last stage could, with the assent of his tutor, act so as to bind
                    himself by stipulations; in the earlier stages he could not, although binding
                    stipulations could be made to him in the second stage. After puberty, until the
                    age of twenty-five years, a modified infancy was recognized, during which the
                    minor’s acts were not void altogether, but voidable, and a curator was appointed
                    to manage his affairs. The difference between the tutor and the curator in Roman
                    law was marked by the saying that the former was appointed for the care of the
                    person, the latter for the estate of the pupil. These principles of course apply
                    only to children who are <hi rend="italic">sui juris.</hi> The <hi rend="italic"
                    >patria potestas,</hi> so long as it lasts, gives to the father the complete
                    control of the son’s actions; and tutorship and curatorship were devices for
                    protecting those who were free from the <hi rend="italic">potestas,</hi> but
                    unable by reason of infancy to control their own affairs. The right of the
                    father to appoint tutors to his children by will <hi rend="italic"
                    >(testamentarii)</hi> was recognized by the Twelve Tables, as was also the
                    tutorship of the <hi rend="italic">agnati</hi> (or legal as distinct from
                    natural relations) in default of such an appointment. Tutors who held office in
                    virtue of a general law were called <hi rend="italic">legitimi.</hi> Besides and
                    in default of these, tutors <hi rend="italic">dativi</hi> were appointed by the
                    magistrates. These terms are still used in much the same sense in modern systems
                    founded on the Roman law, as may be seen in the case of Scotland, noticed
                    below.</p>
                <p>By the law of England full age is twenty-one, and all minors alike are subject to
                    incapacities. The period of twenty-one years is regarded as complete at the
                    beginning of the day before the birthday: for example, an infant born on the
                    first day of January attains his majority at the first moment of the 31st of
                    December. The incapacity of an infant is designed of course for his own
                    protection, and its general effect is to prevent him from binding himself
                    absolutely by obligations. In the matter of contracts, the statement has
                    generally passed current that an infant’s contracts, except when they are
                    binding for special reasons, are either void or voidable, <hi rend="italic"
                    >i.e.,</hi> null, <hi rend="italic">ab</hi><hi rend="italic">initio,</hi> or
                    capable of being nullified by the infant at his choice. Contracts, for example,
                    which cannot be beneficial to the infant are said to be absolutely void. A bond
                    with a penalty is for this reason declared to bo void. On the other hand, it is
                    alleged by the more recent text-writers that the words void and voidable have
                    not been carefully distinguished, and that a contract is often described as void
                    when it is only meant that it is not binding. On this theory all the contracts
                    of an infant might bo described as voidable at his option except those few which
                    are absolutely valid. On his voidable contracts an infant may sue if he chooses
                    to do so, but may not be sued. Of the contracts of an infant which are binding
                    <hi rend="italic">ab</hi><hi rend="italic">initio,</hi> the most important are
                    those relating to “necessaries.” The word is used in an extended signification
                    to cover “articles fit to maintain the person in the particular state, degree,
                    and station in life in which he is.” Whether a particular thing is necessary or
                    not is a question of fact to be decided by a jury, but it is for the judge to
                    say whether it is <hi rend="italic">prima</hi><hi rend="italic">facie</hi> of a
                    description such that it may be a necessary. It has been ruled by judges,
                    without consulting the jury, that the following articles were not necessary
                    :—expensive dinners supplied to an undergraduate in his private rooms; a pair of
                    solitaire studs costing .£25, and a goblet costing £15, for a baronet’s son; a
                    chronometer worth £68, for a lieutenant in the navy; ornaments to the value of
                    £137. On the other hand, an undergraduate has been allowed a gold watch as a
                    necessary; and liveries for an officer’s servant, money paid to release an
                    infant from ejectment or distress, and necessaries for an infant’s wife have all
                    been held to be necessaries of an infant. An object, in itself of a character to
                    be pronounced a necessary, may in particular cases be declared not necessary,
                    <hi rend="italic">e.g.,</hi> if the infant is already supplied with things of
                    the kind. A sealskin waistcoat may be a necessary to an infant of good fortune,
                    but not if he has half a dozen such garments in his possession <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit13newyrich/page/n11/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0913-0011-0002"/> already. The person who supplies goods <hi
                    rend="italic">prima</hi><hi rend="italic">facie</hi> necessary to an infant
                    must, it would seem, take the risk of their turning out to be unnecessary. An
                    infant fraudulently passing himself off as of full age and contracting on that
                    footing will be held bound in equity. The protection of infants extends
                    sometimes to transactions completed after full age: the relief of heirs who have
                    been induced to barter away their expectations is an example. “Catching
                    bargains,” as they are called, throw on the persons claiming the benefit of them
                    the burden of proving their substantial righteousness; and, although the youth
                    of the party charged is not an essential point, it is generally one of the facts
                    relied on as showing undue influence.</p>
                <p>At common law a bargain made by an infant might be ratified by him after full
                    age, and would then become in all respects binding. Lord Tenterden’s Act
                    required the ratification to be in writing. But now by the Infants Relief Act,
                    1874, “all contracts entered into by infants for the repayment of money lent or
                    to be lent, or for goods supplied or to be supplied (other than contracts for
                    necessaries), and all accounts stated, shall be absolutely void,” and “no action
                    shall be brought whereby to charge any person upon any promise made after full
                    age to pay any debt contracted during infancy, or upon any ratification made
                    after full age of any promise or contract made during infancy, whether there
                    shall or shall not be any new consideration for such promise or ratification
                    after full age.” It has been held in a recent case that this action applies to
                    promises of marriage, so that where an infant had promised marriage, and after
                    attaining full age continued to recognize the promise, no action arose on the
                    breach. But an actual contract of marriage may be lawfully made by persons under
                    age. Marriageable age is fourteen in males and twelve in females. So, generally,
                    an infant may bind himself by contract of apprenticeship or service. Since the
                    passing of the Wills Act, an infant is unable to make a will. Infancy is in
                    general a disqualification for public offices and professions, e.y., to be a
                    member of parliament or an elector, a mayor or burgess, a priest or deacon, a
                    barrister or solicitor, &amp;c.</p>
                <p>The custody of an infant belongs in the first place, and against all other
                    persons, to the father, who is said to be “the guardian of his children by
                    nature and nurture and the father may by deed or will dispose of the custody or
                    tuition of his children until the age of twentyωne. If the father is dead, and
                    has appointed no testamentary guardian, themotheris recognized as “guardian by
                    nature andnurture.” But the children must be brought up in the father’s
                    religion, even when he has given no directions on the subject; and it appears
                    that no agreement between husband and wife to the contrary effect will be
                    sustained. When, however, the father has in his lifetime suffered the children
                    to be educated in their mother’s religion, he may be held to have waived his
                    rights. The Court of Chancery is unwilling to embarrass itself by departing from
                    the strict rule, and an instance is recorded of a child which had been educated
                    from eight to fifteen in the tenets of the Plymouth Brethren being ordered by
                    the court to be educated in the religion of the Church of England. The right of
                    the father to the custody of the child will be enforced, except where he has
                    been guilty of gross immorality, by writ of <hi rend="italic">habeas
                    corpus,</hi> as long as a child is within the age of nurture, which for males at
                    least may be taken to be fourteen years. The infant then acquires a right of
                    election. In two cases a boy over fourteen but under sixteen has been permitted
                    by the court to choose, when the father had sued for the custody under a <hi
                    rend="italic">habeas corpus.</hi> In the case of female infants, the courts have
                    held that they do not acquire the right of election till sixteen, following the
                    statute of Philip &amp; Mary which punishes the abduction of maidens under that
                    age as a criminal offence. These rules do not apply to illegitimate children, as
                    they are not under the legal guardianship of the putative father or the mother.
                    The rights of the father or mother may be interfered with by the Court of
                    Chancery under special circumstances, such as cruelty, immorality, &amp;c. A
                    recent Act (36 &amp; 37 Viet, c. 12) gives power to the court to make orders for
                    the mother of an infant under sixteen, to have or retain the custody of such
                    infant, or to have access thereto, &lt;fcc. The same statute legalizes
                    agreements by the father to give up the custody and control of children to the
                    wife. The Divorce Court has also very extensive powers of regulating the custody
                    and maintenance of children, in exercising which it observes the same limits of
                    age as the courts of law and chancery.</p>
                <p>There is not at common law any corresponding obligation on the part of either
                    parent to maintain or educate the children. The legal duties of parents in this
                    respect are only those created by the poor laws and the Elementary Education
                    Act. In the case, however, of debts contracted by a child for necessaries, the
                    authority of the father would, to use a common phrase, be “easily implied.”</p>
                <p>Besides the natural guardianship of parents, children may in various other ways
                    come under the authority of guardians. A recent author gives the following as a
                    complete list of guardians :—guardian in chivalry, in socage, in nature, by
                    nurture, by election of the infant, by statute (4 Philip &amp; Mary c. 8, 12
                    Chas. II. c. 24), by custom, by appointment of the ecclesiastical courts and of
                    the Court of Chancery, foreign guardians, and guardians <hi rend="italic">ad
                    litem</hi> (Simpson’s <hi rend="italic">Law of Infants,</hi> London, 1875). Some
                    of these have already been noticed, and others are obsolete or nearly so. The
                    Act of Chas. II. enables the father to appoint a testamentary guardian to his
                    children during infancy or any less period, who shall have the charge of the
                    infant’s real and personal estate. The Act is not to prejudice any customary
                    guardianship, such as that of the City of London, where, according to ancient
                    but now disused custom, the goods and lands of the orphans of freemen are in the
                    custody of the lord mayor and aidermen in their court of orphans. By the custom
                    of Kent, and by the special customs of certain manors, the lord has the right of
                    appointing guardians to infant tenants. Guardianship by socage extends only to
                    lands of socage tenure, and belongs to the next of blood of the infant, other
                    than those who might succeed to the estate when the infant dies. It ends when
                    the infant reaches the age of fourteen; after that age, or before if there was
                    no guardian, infants were formerly allowed to elect a guardian, but that
                    practice is now superseded by the action of the Court of Chancery which appoints
                    guardians in all cases where it is for the benefit of the infants to do so. An
                    infant under a guardian appointed by the Court of Chancery is properly a “ward
                    of court,” but the term is also applied to infants brought under the authority
                    of the court although no guardian be appointed. The office and duty of the
                    guardian extend to the custody and control of the infant, to his education,
                    maintenance, and advancement out of any property that may be available therefor,
                    and to the prevention of improper and disparaging marriages. The office of
                    guardian is strictly a trust, the ordinary duties and responsibilities of a
                    trustee with respect to property being accompanied by peculiar rights and duties
                    with respect to the person of the <hi rend="italic">cestui</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >que</hi><hi rend="italic">trust.</hi> He must act in all cases for the benefit
                    of the infant, and may not put himself into any position in which his interest
                    would be hostile to that of the infant. The Court of Chancery has full
                    jurisdiction over guardians of every kind, whether appointed by itself or not,
                    and if it cannot actually dismiss a testamentary guardian, it may supersede him
                    and entrust the charge of <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit13newyrich/page/n12/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0913-0012-0003"/> the infant to some other person on proper cause
                    being shown (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Trustee).</hi></p>
                <p>An infant is liable to a civil action for torts and wrongful acts committed by
                    him. But, as it is possible sometimes so to shape the pleadings in an action as
                    to make what is in substance a right arising out of contract take the form of a
                    right arising from civil injury, care is taken that an infant in such a case
                    shall not be held liable. With respect to crime, mere infancy is not a defence,
                    but a child under seven years of age is presumed to be incapable of committing a
                    crime, and between seven and fourteen his capacity requires to be affirmatively
                    proved. After fourteen an infant is <hi rend="italic">doli capax.</hi></p>
                <p>The law of Scotland follows the leading principles of the Roman law. The period
                    of minority (which ends at twenty-one) is divided into two stages, that of
                    absolute incapacity (until the age of fourteen in males, and twelve in females),
                    during which the minor is in pupilarity, and that of partial incapacity (between
                    fourteen and twenty-one), during which he is under curators. The guardians (or
                    tutors) of the pupil are either tutors-nominate (appointed by the father in his
                    will); tutors-at-law (being the next male agnate of twenty-five years of age),
                    in default of tutors-nominate; or tutors-dative, appointed by royal warrant in
                    default of the other two. No act done by the pupil, or action raised in his
                    name, has any effect without the interposition of a guardian. After fourteen,
                    all acts done by a minor having curators are void without their concurrence.
                    Every deed in nonage, whether during pupilarity or minority, and whether
                    authorized or not by tutors or curators, is liable to reduction on proof of
                    “lesion,” <hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> of material injury, due to the fact of
                    nonage, either through the weakness of the minor himself or the imprudence or
                    negligence of his curators. Damage in fact arising on a contract in itself just
                    and reasonable would not be lesion entitling to restitution. Deeds in nonage,
                    other than those whi&lt;⅛h are absolutely null <hi rend="italic">ab</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">initio,</hi> must be challenged within the <hi rend="italic"
                    >gιiad∙ riennium utile,</hi> or four years after majority.</p>
                <p>In the United States, the principles of the English common law as to infancy
                    prevail, generally the most conspicuous variations being those affecting the age
                    at which women attain majority. In many States this is fixed at eighteen. There
                    is some diversity of practice as to the age at which a person can make a will of
                    real or personal estate. (E. R. )</p>
