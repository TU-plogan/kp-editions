                <p><label type="entry">INJUNCTION</label>, in English law, is a judicial process
                    whereby a party is required to refrain from doing a particular thing according
                    to the exigency of the writ (Daniel’s <hi rend="italic">Chancery Practice).</hi>
                    Formerly it was a remedy peculiar to the Court of Chancery, and was one of the
                    instruments by which the jurisdiction of that court was established in cases
                    over which the courts of common law were entitled to exercise control. The Court
                    of Chancery did not presume to interfere with the action of the courts, but, by
                    directing an injunction to the person whom it wished to restrain from following
                    a particular remedy at common law, it effected the same purpose indirectly.
                    Under the present constitution of the judicature, the peculiar features of the
                    injunction have been considerably altered. It is now equally available in all
                    the divisions of the high court of justice, and it can no longer be used to
                    prevent an action in any of them from proceeding in the ordinary course.</p>
                <p>From the definition given above it is apparent that an injunction is properly a
                    restraining order, although there are instances in which, under the form of a
                    prohibition, a positive order to do something is virtually expressed. Thus in a
                    case of nuisance an injunction was obtained to restrain the defendant from
                    preventing water from flowing in such regular quantities as it had ordinarily
                    done before the day on which the nuisance commenced. But generally, if the
                    relief prayed for is to compel something to be done, it cannot be obtained by
                    injunction, although it may be expressed in the form of a prohibition—as in the
                    case in which it was sought to prevent a person from discontinuing to keep a
                    house as an inn, which is the same thing as ordering him to keep an inn. The
                    injunction was used to stay proceedings in other courts “wherever a party by
                    fraud, accident, mistake, or otherwise had obtained an advantage in proceeding
                    in a court of ordinary jurisdiction, which must necessarily make that court an
                    instrument of injustice.” As the injunction operates personally on the
                    defendant, it may be used to prevent applications to foreign judicatures; but it
                    is not used to prevent applications to parliament, or to the legislature of any
                    foreign country, unless such applications be in breach of some agreement, and
                    relate to matters of private interest. In so far as an injunction is used to
                    prohibit acts, it may be founded either on an alleged contract or on a right
                    independent of contract. The jurisdiction of the court to prevent breaches of
                    contract has been described as supplemental to its power of compelling specific
                    performance; <hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> if the court has power to compel a
                    person to perform a contract, it will interfere to prevent him from doing
                    anything in violation of it. In the case of contracts to abstain from doing,
                    injunction is in fact a means of compelling specific performance. But even when
                    it is not within the power of the court to compel specific performance, it may
                    interfere by injunction; thus, <hi rend="italic">e.y.,</hi> in the case of an
                    agreement of a singer to perform at the plaintiff’s theatre and at no other, the
                    court, although it could not compel her to sing, could by injunction prevent her
                    from singing elsewhere in breach of her agreement. In other matters, an
                    injunction may as a general rule bo obtained to prevent acts which are
                    violations of legal rights, except when the same may be adequately remedied by
                    an action for damages at law. Thus the court will interfere by injunction to
                    prevent waste, or the destruction by a limited owner, such as a tenant for life,
                    of things forming part of the inheritance. Injunctions may also be obtained to
                    prevent the continuance of nuisances, public or private, the infringement of
                    patents, copyrights, and trade marks. Trespass might also be prevented by
                    injunction, in certain cases, alluded to below. Under the Common Law
                        Procedure<pb break="no"

                        xml:id="kp-eb0913-0088-0079"/> Act of 1854, and by other statutes in special
                    cases, a limited power of injunction was conferred on the courts of common law.
                    But the Judicature Act, by which all the superior courts of common law and
                    chancery are consolidated, enacts that an injunction may be granted by an
                    interlocutory order of the court in all cases in which it shall appear to be
                    just or convenient; . . . . and, if an injunction is asked either before or at
                    or after the hearing of any cause or matter, to prevent any threatened or
                    apprehended waste or trespass, such injunction may be granted whether the person
                    against whom it is sought is or is not in possession under any claim of title or
                    otherwise, or if not in possession does or does not claim to do the act sought
                    to be restrained under colour of any title, and whether the estates claimed are
                    legal or equitable.</p>
                <p>An injunction obtained on interlocutory application during the progress of an
                    action is superseded by the trial. It may be continued either provisionally or
                    permanently. In the latter case the injunction is said to be perpetual. The
                    distinction between “special” and “common” injunctions—the latter being obtained
                    as of course—is now abolished in English law. The practice as to injunctions
                    obtains in the United States of America. “In the courts of the United States, as
                    injunctions are grantable only on notice to the adverse party, all interlocutory
                    injunctions are regarded as within the class of special injunction; and this is
                    believed to be also the practice of the State courts generally” (Abbott’s <hi
