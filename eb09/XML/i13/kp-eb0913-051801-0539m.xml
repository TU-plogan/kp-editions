                    de</hi></label> (1783-1824), emperor of Mexico from May 1822 to March 1823, was
                    born September 27, 1783, at Valladolid, now Morelia, in Mexico, where his
                    father, an Old Spaniard from Pampeluna, had settled with his creole wife. After
                    enjoying a better education than was then usual in Mexico, Iturbide entered the
                    military service, and in 1810 held the post of lieutenant in the provincial
                    regiment of his native city. In that year the insurrection under Hidalgo broke
                    out, and Iturbide, more from policy, it would seem, than from principle, served
                    in the royal army. Possessed of splendid courage and brilliant military talents,
                    which fitted him especially for guerilla warfare, the young creole did signal
                    service, and rapidly rose in military rank. In December 1813 Colonel Iturbide,
                    along with General Llano, dealt a crushing blow to the revolt by defeating
                    Morelos, the successor of Hidalgo, in the battle of Valladolid; and the former
                    followed it up by another decisive victory at Puruaran in January 1814. Next
                    year Don Augustin was appointed to the command of the army of the north and to
                    the governorship of the provinces of Valladolid and Guanajuato, but in 1816
                    grave charges of extortion and violence were brought against him, which led to
                    his recall. Although the general was acquitted, or at least although the inquiry
                    was dropped, he did not resume his commands, but retired into private life for
                    four years, which, we are told, he spent in a rigid course of penance for his
                    former excesses. In 1820 Apodaca, viceroy of Mexico, received instructions from
                    the Spanish cortes to proclaim the constitution promulgated in Spain in 1812,
                    but, although obliged at first to submit to an order by which his power was much
                    curtailed, he secretly cherished the design of reviving the absolute power for
                    Ferdinand VII. in Mexico. Under pretext of putting down the lingering remains of
                    revolt, he levied troops, and, placing Iturbide at their head, instructed him to
                    proclaim the absolute power of the king. Four years of reflexion, however, had
                    modified the general’s views, and now, led both by personal ambition and by
                    patriotic regard for his country, Iturbide resolved to espouse the cause of
                    national independence. His subsequent proceedings—how he issued the <hi
                    rend="italic">Plan of Iguala,</hi> on February 24, 1821, how by the refusal of
                    the Spanish cortes to ratify the treaty of Cordova, which he had signed with
                    O’Donoju, he was transformed from a mere champion of monarchy into a candidate
                    for the crown, and how, hailed by the soldiers as emperor Augustin I. on May 18,
                    1822, he was compelled within ten months by his arrogant neglect of
                    constitutional restraints, to tender his abdication to a congress which he had
                    forcibly dissolved—will be found detailed under <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Mexico.</hi> Although the congress refused to accept his abdication on the
                    ground that to do so would be to recognize the validity of his election, it
                    permitted the ex-emperor to retire to Leghorn in Italy, while in consideration
                    of his services in 1820 a yearly pension of £5000 was conferred upon him. But
                    Iturbide resolved to make one more bid for power; andin 1824, passing from
                    Leghorn to London, he published a <hi rend="italic">Statement,</hi> and on May
                    11th set sail for Mexico. The congress immediately issued an act of outlawry
                    against him, forbidding him to set foot on Mexican soil on pain of death.
                    Ignorant of this, the exemperor landed in disguise at Soto la Marina on July
                    14th. He was almost immediately recognized and arrested, and on July 19, 1824,
                    was shot at Padilla, by order of the state of Tamaulipas, without being
                    permitted an appeal to the general congress. Don Angustin de Iturbide is
                    described by his contemporaries as being of handsome figure and ingratiating
                    manner. His brilliant courage and wonderful success made him the idol of his
                    soldiers, though towards his prisoners he displayed the most cold-blooded
                    cruelty, boasting in one of his despatches of having honoured Good Friday by
                    shooting three hundred excommunicated wretches. Though described as amiable in
                    his private life, he seems in his public career to have been ambitious and
                    unscrupulous, and by his haughty Spanish temper, impatient of all resistance or
                    control, to have forfeited the opportunity of founding a secure imperial
                    dynasty. His son Augustin was chosen by the ill-fated emperor Maximilian as his
                    successor.</p>
