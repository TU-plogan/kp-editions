                <p><label type="entry">INSECTIVOROUS PLANTS</label>. Insectivorous or, as they are
                    sometimes more correctly termed, carnivorous plants are, like the parasites, the
                    climbers, or the succulents, a physiological assemblage belonging to a number of
                    distinct natural orders. They agree in the extraordinary habit of adding to the
                    supplies of nitrogenous material afforded them in common with other plants by
                    the soil and atmosphere, by the capture and consumption of insects and· other
                    small animals. The curious and varied mechanical arrangements by which these
                    supplies of animal food are obtained, the ways and degrees in which they are
                    utilized, and the remarkable chemical, histological, and electrical phenomena
                    which accompany these processes of prehension and utilization, can only be
                    understood by a separate and somewhat detailed examination of the leading orders
                    and genera. It is convenient to follow the order adopted by Mr Darwin in his
                    work on <hi rend="italic">Insectivorous Plants</hi> (Lond., 1875), to which our
                    knowledge of the subject is mainly due, incorporating, however, as far as
                    possible the leading observations of other writers on the subject. We must
                    preface this, however, by a brief summary of the facts of taxonomy and
                    distribution.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Taxonomy.—</hi> The best known and most important order —the
                    <hi rend="italic">Droseraceae</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi> is placed among the
                    calycifloral exogens, and has obvious affinities with the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Saxifragaceae.</hi> It includes six genera— <hi rend="italic">Byblis,</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Roridula,</hi><hi rend="italic">Drosera,</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Drosophyllum, Aldrovanda,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Dionaea,</hi> of which the
                    last three are monotypic, <hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> include only one species.
                    The curious pitcher-plant, <hi rend="italic">Cephalotus</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >follicularis,</hi> is usually raised to the dignity of a separate natural order
                    <hi rend="italic">Cephaloteae,</hi> though Bentham and Hooker <hi rend="italic"
                    >{Gen. Plant.)</hi> place it among the <hi rend="italic">Ribesiaceae.</hi> The
                    <hi rend="italic">Sarraceniaceae</hi> are thalamiflorals, and contain the genera
                    <hi rend="italic">Sarracenia, Darlingtonia, Heliamphora,</hi> while the true
                    pitcher plants or <hi rend="italic">Nepenthaceae,</hi> consisting of the single
                    large genus <hi rend="italic">Nepenthes,</hi> are placed near the <hi
                    rend="italic">Aristolochiaceae</hi> among the <hi rend="italic">Apetalae.</hi>
                    Finally the genera <hi rend="italic">Pinguicula, Utricularia,</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Genlisea,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Polypom-ρholix</hi> belong to
                    the gamopetalous order <hi rend="italic">Utriculariae.</hi> Thus all the four
                    leading divisions of the exogenous plants are represented by apparently
                    unrelated orders; certain affinities, however, are alleged between <hi
                    rend="italic">Droseraceae, Sarraceniaceae,</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >Nepenthaceae.</hi><hi rend="italic">Distribution.—</hi> While the large genus
                    <hi rend="italic">Drosera</hi> has an all but world-wide distribution, its
                    congeners are restricted to well-defined and usually comparatively small areas.
                    Thus <hi rend="italic">Drosophyllum</hi> occurs only in Portugal and Morocco,
                    <hi rend="italic">Byblis</hi> in tropical Australia, and, although <hi
                    rend="italic">Aldrovanda</hi> is found in Queensland, in Bengal, and in Europe,
                    a wide distribution explained by its aquatic habit, <hi rend="italic"
                    >Dionaea</hi> is restricted to a few localities in North and South Carolina,
                    mainly around Wilmington. <hi rend="italic">Cephalotus</hi> occurs only near
                    Albany in Western Australia, <hi rend="italic">Heliamphora</hi> on the Roraima
                    Mountains in Venezuela, <hi rend="italic">Darlingtonia</hi> on the Sierra Nevada
                    of California, and these three genera too are as yet monotypic; of <hi
                    rend="italic">Sarracenia,</hi> however, there are six or eight known species
                    scattered over the eastern States of North America. The 36 species of <hi
                    rend="italic">Nepenthes</hi> are mostly natives of the hotter parts of the
                    Indian Archipelago, but a few range into Ceylon, Bengal, Cochin China, and some
                    even occur in tropical Australia on the one hand, and in the Seychelles and
                    Madagascar on the other. <hi rend="italic">Pinguicula</hi> is abundant in the
                    north temperate zone, and ranges down the Andes as far as Patagonia; the 150
                    species of <hi rend="italic">Utricularia</hi> are mostly aquatic, and some are
                    found in all save polar regions; their unimportant congeners, <hi rend="italic"
                    >Genlisea</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Polypompholix,</hi> occur in tropical
                    America and south-western Australia respectively. It is remarkable that all the
                    insectivorous plants agree in inhabiting damp heaths, bogs, marshes, and similar
                    situations where water is abundant,—a peculiarity perhaps due to their habit of
                    copious secretion and consequent need of water.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Drosera.</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi> The Common Sundew <hi
                    rend="italic">{D. rotundifolia)</hi> has extremely small roots, and bears five
                    or six radical leaves horizontally extended in a rosette around the flowerstalk.
                    The upper surface of each leaf is covered with gland-bearing filaments or
                    “tentacles,” of which there are on an average about two hundred. Each gland is
                    surrounded by a large dew-like drop of a viscid but transparent and glittering
                    secretion, and the popular names (Sundew, French <hi rend="italic"
                    >Rossolis,</hi> German <hi rend="italic">Soηηenthau)</hi> as well as the
                    Linnaean (from δρόσον, dew) have been thus suggested. The stalk of the tentacle
                    has the essential structure of a leaf. A small fibro-vascular bundle, consisting
                    mainly of spiral vessels, runs up through the stalk and is surrounded by a layer
                    of elongated parenchyma cells lined by a thin layer of colourless circulating
                    protoplasm, and filled with a homogeneous fluid, tinted purple by a modification
                    of chlorophyll (erythrophyll, Sorby). The epidermis bears small multi cellular
                    prominences. The glandular head of the tentacle contains a central mass of
                    spirally thickened cells in immediate contact with the upper end of the
                    fibro-vascular bundle. Around these (but separated from them by a <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit13newyrich/page/n146/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0913-0146-0135"/> layer of much elongated cells, Warming) there is
                    a layer of cells filled with purple fluid, and outside these lies a similar
                    series of cells, whose contents differ slightly in tinge, and in behaviour when
                    treated with reagents.</p>
                <p>Insects seem to be attracted by the leaves of <hi rend="italic">Drosera,</hi> but
                    whether by their colour, their glittering secretion, their odour, or by all
                    three, remains as yet unsettled. A fly alighting on the disk, or even only
                    touching one or two of the exterior tentacles, is immediately entangled by the
                    viscid secretion; the tentacles to. which it is adhering begin to bend, and thus
                    pass on their prey to the tentacles next succeeding them inwards, and the insect
                    is thus carried by a curious rolling movement to the centre of the leaf. The
                    tentacles on all sides become similarly inflected; the blade or the leaf may
                    even become almost cup-shaped; and the insect, bathed in the abundant secretion
                    which soon closes up its tracheae, is drowned in about a quarter of an hour. The
                    leaves clasp also, but for a much shorter time, over inorganic bodies.</p>
                <p>The bending of the tentacle takes place near its base, and may be excited (1) by
                    repeated touches, although not by gusts of wind or drops of rain, thus saving
                    the plant from much useless movement; (2) by contact with any solid, even though
                    insoluble and of far greater minuteness than could be appreciated by our sense
                    of touch,—a morsel of human hair weighing only <hi rend="subscript"> 7s</hi> ⅞
                    <hi rend="subscript"> 47y</hi> of a grain, and this largely supported too by the
                    viscid secretion, sufficing to induce movement; (3) by the absorption of a trace
                    of certain fluids, mostly nitrogenous. During the inflexion of the tentacle, and
                    even before it touches the stimulating object, the secretion of the gland
                    increases in quantity, and, instead of remaining neutral, becomes acid.</p>
                <p>The stalk of a tentacle whose gland has been stimulated by repeated shocks,
                    continuous pressure, or the absorption of any nitrogenous fluid, particularly a
                    solution of ammonic carbonate, shows a mottled appearance; and, when examined
                    under the microscope the formerly homogeneous fluid contents of its constituent
                    cells are seen to have separated into purple masses of constantly varying
                    number, shape, and size, suspended in a colourless fluid, and the layer of
                    colourless circulating protoplasm which lines the cells thus becomes much more
                    distinctly visible. This process, which is termed by Darwin “aggregation of the
                    protoplasm,” commences in the glands and gradually travels down the tentacles,
                    being temporarily arrested at each cell-wall. The process of redissolution of
                    the protoplasm commences at the base of the tentacles and proceeds upwards.
                    Aggregation is a vital process: the cells must be alive, uninjured, and
                    oxygenated; if they are crushed or treated with carbonic acid the phenomenon
                    does not take place. It is not necessarily related to inflexion, for one may be
                    induced without the other; it is totally unlike the “plas-molysis,” or shrinking
                    away of the protoplasm from the cell-wall, which takes place on treating a
                    portion of vegetable tissue with any dense fluid, and which is simply due to
                    exosmose; and it does not depend upon increased secretion. Darwin has also
                    observed aggregation in the sensitive hairs of <hi rend="italic">Dionaea,</hi>
                    and in the roots of various plants; it seems indeed to be of wide distribution
                    and profound importance in the physiology of the vegetable cell.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Effects of Hcαt.—</hi> Sachs asserts that plants are killed by
                    immersion for ten minutes in water at 45° to 46° C., and that their protoplasm
                    coagulates at 50 <hi rend="superscript"> a</hi> or 60°. Darwin, however, found
                    that the im mersion of leaves of <hi rend="italic">Drοserα</hi> for ten minutes
                    in water at 50°, instead of killing the leaves, excited the tentacles into quick
                    movement, that a temperature of 54° ’ 4 paralysed the leaves without killing
                    them, and that some even survived a temperature of 62° C. Some of the lowest
                    plants have frequently been described as living in hot springs, but that so
                    highly organized a native of temperate and even almost arctic regions should
                    withstand so high a temperature is very remarkable.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Action of Ammonia Salts.—</hi> All the salts of ammonia produce
                    inflexion, the carbonate strongly, the nitrate even more so, and the phosphate
                    most of all. The immersion of a leaf in a solution of the last-mentioned salt,
                    so weak that each gland could only absorb about ⅞aat <hi rend="strikethrough"
                    >⅛a</hi> ⅛⅛ θf <hi rend="superscript"> a</hi> grain, is sufficient to produce
                    complete inflexion of the tentacles. Though the particles of solid matter which
                    stimulate the olfactory nerves, and so produce the sensation of odour in
                    animals, must be infinitely smaller than this, as Mr Darwin remarks, the fact
                    remains truly wonderful that the absorption of so minute a quantity by a gland
                    should induce some change in it, which leads to the transmission of a motor
                    impulse down the entire length of the tentacle, causing the whole mass to bend,
                    often through an angle of more than 180°, and this too in the absence of any
                    specialized nervous system.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Action of various Salts and Acids.—</hi> In the case of salts
                    the nature of the base seems to be of much more importance than that of the
                    acid, a conclusion already arrived at by animal physiologists. Thus nine salts
                    of sodium caused inflexion, and were not poisonous; seven of the corresponding
                    salts of potassium did not cause inflexion, and some were poisonous. This is
                    interesting in connexion with the fact that large doses of sodium salts may be
                    introduced into the circulation of mammals with impunity, whereas small doses of
                    potassium salts speedily cause death. Of twenty-four acids tried, nineteen
                    caused inflexion, and the majority, even including most of the organic acids,
                    were poisonous, which is the more remarkable since juice of many plants seems
                    much more strongly acid than the solutions which were employed. The poisonous
                    action, however, is not improbably connected with the negative osmose which is
                    known to be induced by dilute acids.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Action of Alkaloid Poisons, of other Substances, and of
                    Vapours.</hi> —Acetate and sulphate of quinine, citrate of strychnine, nicotine,
                    digitaline, act more or less strongly on the glands and kill them; on the other
                    hand, nitrate of quinine, atropine, veratrine, colchicine, theine, are quite
                    harmless. Curare is not poisonous, and cobra poison, which kills animals by
                    paralysing their nerve centres, causes “strong and rapid inflexion of the
                    tentacles, and soon discharges all colour from the glands,” stimulating also the
                    movements of their protoplasm. Since alkaloids which act strongly on the nervous
                    system of animals are without effect on <hi rend="italic">Drosera,</hi> it seems
                    probable that the sensibility of its glands, and their power of transmitting a
                    stimulus to other parts of the leaf, are not due to elements analogous to nerve.
                    Camphor in solution acts as a stimulant; the vapours however, of camphor,
                    chloroform, alcohol, ether, and carbonic acid have a narcotic or anaesthetic
                    action, and kill the plants after a time.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Effects of Organic Fluids.—Digestive Power of Secretion.—</hi>
                    Darwin treated sixty-one leaves of <hi rend="italic">Drosera</hi> with
                    non-nitrogenous solutions (gum-arabic, sugar, starch, dilute alcohol, olive-oil,
                    tea). The tentacles were not in a single case inflected. He then applied to
                    sixty-four other leaves various nitrogenous fluids (milk, urine, albumen,
                    infusion of meat, mucus, saliva, isinglass), and sixty-three had the tentacles
                    and often the blades well inflected. Finally, taking twenty-three of the leaves
                    which had served for the first experiment and treating them with bits of meat or
                    drops of nitrogenous fluids, all save a few, apparently injured by exosmose
                    caused by the density of the former solution of gum, sugar, &amp;c., were
                    distinctly inflected.</p>
                <p>We are thus led to inquire whether the leaves have only the power of absorbing
                    matter already in solution or whether they can render nitrogenous matter
                    soluble, that is, whether they have the power of true digestion. The digestion
                    of albuminous bodies by animals is effected by means of a ferment, pepsin,
                    acting in presence of weak hydrochloric acid,—neither the acid nor the ferment
                    having the power of digesting in the absence of the other, though almost any
                    other acid may be substituted for hydrochloric. When the stomach is mechanically
                    excited, acid is secreted, but not pepsin; this requires for its production the
                    absorption of a minute quantity of already soluble animal matter (peptogene of
                    Schiff). These propositions all hold good of <hi rend="italic">Drosera.</hi>
                    Frankland analysed the secretion obtained by stimulating four hundred and
                    forty-five leaves with particles of glass, and came to the conclusion that its
                    acidity was due to some acid of the acetic series, apparently either propionic
                    or a mixture of acetic and butyric acids. Analysis of larger quantities enabled
                    Will to show that the secretion contained formic as well as probably butyric and
                    propionic acid, and Rees and Will prepared a glycerin extract which when
                    acidulated rapidly digested fibrin.</p>

                    Solution soon took place in the former cases; and, just as in animal digestion,
                    the edges of the cubes of egg were first rounded off, and the striation of
                    muscle was replaced by dark points, while the bits of egg left in moss
                    putrefied. On neutralization of the acid by alkali, digestion stops; on
                    reacidification, it goes on again. Neither the watery nor the glycerin extract
                    of leaves stimulated by fragments of glass was able to digest, showing that the
                    ferment is not secreted until the glands have absorbed a trace of animal matter.
                    The leaves digested fibrin, connective tissue, cartilage, bone, enamel, and
                    dentine, gelatin, chondrine, casein of milk, &amp;c., but could not digest
                    epidermic productions (nails, hairs, feathers), fibro-elastic tissue, mucin,
                    pepsin, urea, chitin, chlorophyll, cellulose, gun-cotton, oil, fat, and starch,
                    thus completing the analogy with the gastric digestion of animals. Pollen-grains
                    had their protoplasmic contents dissolved, and seeds were usually killed.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Irritability αgιd Movements.—</hi> Cutting and pricking the
                    leaf does not induce movement; the petiole is quite insensible, nor do the
                    pedicels of the glands bend when rubbed or stimulated by contact with food. Only
                    the glands remain, and these at once respond to stimuli, yet their irritability
                    seems to extend for a very slight distance below them, since when the glands are
                    cut off their pedicels often become inflected. When a tentacle receives an
                    impulse either from its own gland or from the central tentacles, it bends
                    towards the middle of the leaf, the short tentacles on which do not bend at all;
                    in all other cases all the tentacles, even those of the centre, bend towards the
                    point whence the stimulus comes. Thus all the tentacles of a leaf may be made to
                    converge into two symmetrical groups by placing a fragment of phosphate of
                    ammonia in the middle of each half of the blade. Contrary to the opinion of
                    Ziegler, vivisection shows that the motor impulse is not transmitted through the
                    fibro-vascular bundles, but through the cellular tissue. An impulse thus travels
                    more rapidly along than across the leaf, since, from the elongated shape and the
                    position of the cells, fewer cell-walls have to be crossed in a given distance.
                    Thus, when the central glands are excited, they send centrifugally some
                    influence to the exterior glands, where aggregation of the protoplasm is set up,
                    which may be watched descending their tentacles, and the whole process is not
                    without analogy to a reflex action. The motor impulse seems to be allied to the
                    aggregating process, and it has been attempted to explain the bending which
                    takes place at the base of the tentacles by assuming either (1) a rapid passage
                    of fluid out of the cells in that region, which would thus contract, at least if
                    we suppose them to be previously in a state of high tension and to possess great
                    elasticity, (2) a contraction of the protoplasm of these cells, (8) the
                    contraction of the cell-walls as well as the protoplasm, or (4) a shrinkage of
                    the fluid contents of the cells, owing to a change in their molecular state with
                    the subsequent closing in of the walls.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Absorption.—</hi> Bennett has described what he terms
                    absorptive glands beneath the epidermis, consisting of two nearly hemispherical
                    cells, filled with brownish protoplasm and bearing papillae, which sometimes
                    rise above the surface of the leaf, or the filaments of the tentacles. He finds

                    Tait, by cultivating plants with roots cut off and leaves buried in pure sand
                    watered with an ammoniacal solution, showed that the sundew can not only absorb
                    nutriment from its leaves, but can actually live and thrive by their aid alone,
                    if supplied with small quantities of nitrogenous material.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Dionaea Muscipula,</hi> L.—This plant, the well-known Venus’s
                    Fly-trap, was first described in 1768 by Ellis in a remarkable letter to
                    Linnaeus, in which he gave a substantially correct account of the structure and
                    functions of its leaves, and even suggested the probability of their
                    carni-vorism. Linnaeus declared it the most wonderful of plants <hi
                    rend="italic">(miraculum</hi><hi rend="italic">naturae),</hi> yet only admitted
                    that it showed an extreme case of sensitiveness, supposing that the insects were
                    only accidentally captured and subsequently allowed to escape. Two American
                    botanists, Curtis and Canby, successively advanced our knowledge of the mode of
                    capture and digestion, which has also been investigated by Mrs Treat, T. A. G.
                    Balfour, and others, and most fully by Darwin.</p>
                <p>The leaves are all radical, with broad foliaceous footstalks. Each leaf has two
                    lobes, standing at rather less than a right angle to each other, their edges
                    being produced into spike-like processes. The upper surface of each lobe is
                    covered with minute circular sessile glands, each consisting of from 20 to 30
                    cells filled with purplish fluid. It bears also three fine-pointed sensitive
                    filaments arranged in a triangle. These contain no fibro-vascular bundles, but
                    present an articulation near their bases, which enables them to bend parallel to
                    the surface of the leaf when the lobes close, When the filaments are touched by
                    an insect, the lobes close very sharply upon the hinge-like midrib, the spikes
                    interlock, and the insect is imprisoned. If very minute, and so not worth
                    digesting, it is able to escape between the interlocked spines; more usually,
                    however, it is retained between the lobes, which gradually but firmly compress
                    it, until its form is distinguishable from without. The leaf thus forms itself
                    into a temporary stomach, and the glands, hitherto dry, commence, as soon as
                    excited by the absorption of a trace of nitrogenous matter, to pour out an acid
                    secretion containing a ferment, which rapidly dissolves the soft parts of the
                    insect. This is produced in such abundance that, when Darwin made a small
                    opening at the base of one lobe of a leaf which had closed over a large crushed
                    fly, the secretion continued to run down the footstalk during the whole time —
                    nine days — during which the plant was kept under observation. Aggregation may
                    be observed in the glands, and, at least on treatment with carbonate of ammonia,
                    the aggregative process may be watched ascending the sensitive hairs.</p>
                <p>Though the filaments are exquisitely sensitive to the slightest contact with
                    solid bodies, yet they are far less sensitive than those of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Drosera</hi> to prolonged pressure, a singular difference in evident relation
                    to the habits of the two plants. Like the leaves of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Drosera,</hi> however, those <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit13newyrich/page/n148/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0913-0148-0137"/> of <hi rend="italic">Dionaea</hi> are completely
                    indifferent to wind and rain. The surface of the blade is very slightly
                    sensitive; it may be roughly handled or scratched without causing movement, but
                    closes when its surface or midrib is deeply pricked or cut. Irritation of the
                    triangular area on each lobe enclosed by the sensitive filaments causes closure.
                    The footstalk is quite insensitive. Inorganic or non-nitrogenous bodies, placed
                    on the leaves without touching the sensitive filaments, do not excite movement,
                    but nitrogenous bodies, if in the least degree damp, cause after several hours
                    the lobes to close slowly. So too the leaf which has closed over a digestible
                    body applies a gradual pressure, which serves to bring the glands on both sides
                    into contact with the body, and may also, as Balfour suggests, aid in
                    absorption. Thus we see that there are two kinds of movement, adapted for
                    different purposes, one rapid, excited mechanically, the other slow, excited
                    chemically. Leaves made to close over insoluble bodies reopen in less than
                    twenty-four hours, and are ready, even before being fully expanded, to shut
                    again. But if they have closed over nitrogen-yielding bodies, they remain
                    closely shut for many days, and after re-expanding are torpid, and never act
                    again, or only after a considerable time. Even in a state of nature, the most
                    vigorous leaves are very rarely able to digest more than twice, or at most
                    thrice, during their life. The secretion is a true gastric juice containing
                    formic acid, and like gastric juice has remarkable antiseptic powers. Lindsay
                    fed leaves with such quantities of meat as to kill them with indigestion, yet
                    showed that the meat inside the leaf remained perfectly fresh while portions
                    hanging outside putrefied.</p>
                <p>While evidence is thus afforded of the absorption of the products of digestion by
                    the complete disappearance of fibrin, albumen, &amp;c., placed upon the leaf of
                    <hi rend="italic">Dionaea,</hi> Fraustadt was able, by feeding leaves with
                    albumen dyed with aniline-red, to colour the contents and nuclei of the
                    gland-cells.</p>
                <p>The motor impulse, as in <hi rend="italic">Drosera,</hi> is transmitted through
                    the cellular tissue. Burdon Sanderson has demonstrated the existence of a normal
                    electric current in the leaf of <hi rend="italic">Dionaea,</hi> and the negative
                    variation undergone by that current at the moment of closure of the leaf due to
                    the conversion of electromotive force into mechanical work. This discovery,
                    which is of the highest importance as showing the profound resemblance between
                    the closure of the leaf of <hi rend="italic">Dionaea</hi> and the contraction of
                    a muscle, has been followed up and extended by Munk. C. de Candolle ascribes the
                    closure of the valves to variations in the turgescence of the parenchyma of
                    their upper surface.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Aldrovaηda vesiculosa. —</hi> This “minute aquatic <hi
                    rend="italic">Dionaea”</hi> floats freely, and is destitute of roots. Its
                    whorled leaves have two lobes, with slightly inflected margins, which open only
                    about as much as the valves of a living mussel-shell, and thus capture the more
                    easily the small crustaceans and mollusks which may get between them. Part of
                    the upper surface of each lobe next the midrib bears colourless glands (like
                    those of <hi rend="italic">Dionaea,</hi> but stalked), together with numerous
                    long sensitive filaments which have both median and basal articulations; the
                    outer thinner portion bears small quadrifid hairs. Darwin holds that the glands
                    secrete and digest, while the quadrifids are destined to the absorption of
                    decaying animal matter, the two regions of the leaf thus serving for very
                    different purposes.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Drosophyllum lusitanicum.—</hi> This plant catches such vast
                    numbers of flies in a state of nature that the Portuguese cottagers call it the
                    fly-catcher, and hang up branches of it in their houses for this purpose. Its
                    linear leaves are thickly covered with stalked glands which resemble in the main
                    the tentacles of <hi rend="italic">Drosera,</hi> save in that they are incapable
                    of movement, and that their secretion is acid before excitement. The secretion
                    too is less viscid, and freely leaves the gland to wet the insect, which,
                    creeping onward, soon clogs its wings and dies. There are, moreover, many minute
                    colourless sessile glands which only begin to secrete when stimulated by the
                    absorption of nitrogenous matter, with which they seem to be mainly
                    concerned.</p>

                    those of the latter, scarcely differing appreciably from the glandular hairs of
                    other plants. Mr Darwin has thrown considerable light upon the question of how
                    far the glands of plants not adapted for capturing insects share the power of
                    absorption exhibited by those of the <hi rend="italic">Droseraceae.</hi>
                    Choosing a number of plants at hazard, he found that the glands of two species
                    of <hi rend="italic">Saxifraga,</hi> a genus distantly allied to <hi
                    rend="italic">Drosera,</hi> of a <hi rend="italic">Primula,</hi> and of <hi
                    rend="italic">Pelargonium</hi> have the power of rapid absorption, and exhibit
                    movements of aggregation in their protoplasm, whereas those of <hi rend="italic"

                    >Nicotiana</hi> appear to have no such power. Heckel has made similar

                    and on the leaf-glands of <hi rend="italic">Geranium sparmaηnia,</hi> &amp;c.
                    The glandular hairs of at least some plants are known to be capable of absorbing

                    abqut <hi rend="subscript"> τ</hi> ⅛ of an inch in length, each of which bears
                    six or seven long bristles around the mouth, which is fitted with a thin
                    transparent valve, that opens inwards and is covered with peculiar glands. The
                    interior of the bladder is lined by quadrifid hairs (fig. 11, B), like those
                    described in <hi rend="italic">Aldrσvanda.</hi> Aquatic crustaceans, worms,
                    insect larvae, and other small animals easily enter by pushing inwards the

                <p>This instantly shuts against au interior thickened collar or projection around
                    the mouth, and so renders escape impossible. The means by which the plant
                    attracts its victims are unknown, but their success is very remarkable. Few
                    bladders fail altogether, and many are found quite filled with crustaceans, as
                    many as ten having been counted by Darwin within a single bladder. These
                    bladders, however, have no secretion, and are quite unable to digest; they
                    merely absorb the products of decomposition by means of their quadrifid
                    hairs.</p>

                    attractive surface (fig. 12, A). A pathway too leads upwards from the ground
                    along the broad wing of the pitcher, and is at least in some species also
                    honey-baited; along this creeping insects are lured to their destruction. Below
                    it is the conducting surface (B) of glassy epidermic cells, with short
                    downward-directed points, which like those of <hi rend="italic">Genlisea</hi>
                    facilitate the descent, but impede the ascent of an insect. Then come the
                    glandular surface (C), which is formed of smooth polished epidermis with
                    numerous glands, that secrete the fluid contents of the pitcher, and finally the
                    detentive surface (D), of which the cells are produced into long and strong
                    bristles which point downwards and meet in the centre of the diminishing cavity
                    so as to render escape impossible. The secretion wets an insect very rapidly,
                    and appears to have remarkable anaesthetic effects. It seems to be completely
                    destitute of digestive power, indeed rather to accelerate decomposition. The
                    pitchers accumulate vast quantities of insects in the course of a season, and
                    must thus abundantly manure the surrounding soil when they die. Moreover, the
                    feast is largely shared by unbidden guests (commensals). Not to speak of insects
                    which feed upon the pitcher itself, some drop their eggs into the putrescent
                    mass, where their larvae find abundant nourishment, while birds often slit open
                    the pitchers with their beaks and devour the maggots in their turn.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Darlimgtonia.—</hi> Of the two forms of pitcher in this genus
                    the larger and ordinary form, that of the adult plant, is somewhat twisted, and
                    instead of a lid has a large inflated hood overarching the small mouth. A large
                    bilobed nectariferous and brightly coloured expansion hangs down from this, and
                    attracts insects, particularly moths. As in <hi rend="italic">Sarracenia,</hi>
                    the plant seems merely to absorb the products of their putrefaction.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Nepenthes.—</hi> The pitchers of this genus are borne at the
                    ends of long tendril-like prolongations of the leaves, and are of considerable
                    size, varying from an inch to a foot or more in depth. Again we have two
                    varieties of pitchers, one belonging to the young state of the plant, short,
                    broad, and provided with broad external wings, adapted for the capture of ground
                    game, while the adult form, intended for winged game, is long, narrow, and often
                    destitute of lateral appendages. The mouth of the pitcher is strengthened and
                    kept open by a thickened rim, which, like the under surface of the lid, secretes
                    honey, and is frequently produced inwards and downwards into a short
                    funnel-shaped tube which prevents the escape of insects, or into a row of
                    incurved hooks sometimes strong enough to retain a small bird. The younger form
                    of pitcher has its whole interior lined by secreting glands; the other and more
                    common form <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit13newyrich/page/n150/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0913-0150-0139"/> has an attractive, a conductive, and a secreting
                    surface analogous to those of <hi rend="italic">Sarracenia,</hi> but wholly
                    different in histological details. The detentive surface is represented by the
                    fluid secretion which is invariably present. This is developed before the
                    pitcher opens, and has generally a faintly acid reaction; it contains, as shown
                    by Voelcker, malic and citric acids, together with chloride of potassium, and
                    carbonates of soda, magnesia, and lime. Hooker proved the digestive powers of
                    the fluid, even on substances so resisting as cartilage; Rees and Will found
                    that fibrin was dissolved even more rapidly by the secretion of the excited
                    pitchers than in a test experiment with pepsin from the pig’s stomach; and
                    Lawson Tait, Vines, and others have obtained the ferment in a separate state.
                    Tait indeed finds two substances, both possessing great antiseptic powers, and
                    both being apparently, together with acid, essential to digestion—one a
                    greyish-white precipitate with alkalies, which he terms “droserin,” and which
                    seems the analogue of pepsin; the other, “azerin,” a transparent straw-coloured
                    substance precipitated by alcohol, he compares to ptyalin, the ferment of
                    saliva. Droserin seems to be present in the secretion of all those insectivorous
                    plants which possess the power of digestion, azerin perhaps in all without
                    exception. The latter substance has the property of rapid deliquescence, so that
                    it can only be preserved in hermetically sealed tubes, and its solution, like
                    glycerin, quickly wets any body with which it comes in contact. Λ fly thrown
                    into water never gets completely wetted, while one which falls into the
                    secretion of any insectivorous plant is rapidly soaked and drowned by the fluid
                    entering its tracheae.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Cephalotus.—</hi> This plant bears ordinary leaves as well as
                    pitchers. The latter somewhat resemble in general form those of <hi
                    rend="italic">Nepenthes,</hi> but are more complicated in histological details.
                    Tait has proved the digestive action of their secretion.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Morphology of Pitchers.—</hi> Bailion, and indeed first of all
                    Linnaeus, have pointed out how by exaggerating the concavity of a peltate leaf
                    like that of <hi rend="italic">Nymphaea</hi> we obtain a pitcher of the type of
                    <hi rend="italic">Sarracenia.</hi> Intermediate forms are frequently shown by a
                    variety of <hi rend="italic">Piperomia arifolia.</hi> Hooker has given reason to
                    believe that the pitcher of <hi rend="italic">Nepenthes</hi> is not a
                    transformed leaf, but a mere leafappendage answering to the water-secreting
                    gland found at the end of many leaves. The apex of the leaf, instead of forming
                    the lid as in <hi rend="italic">Sarracenia,</hi> is represented by a filiform
                    appendage (see fig. 16, F). Finally, Dickson has proved by comparison with
                    monstrous forms that the pitcher of <hi rend="italic">Cephalotus</hi> arises in
                    a third and totally distinct way, by a calceolate pouching from the upper
                    surface of the ordinary spathulate leaves, the lid here arising from the
                    proximal side of the pitcher-orifice.</p>

                    described by Spruce as capturing numerous insects. All these cases, however,
                    require much further investigation. The connate leaves of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Dipsacus</hi> frequently enclose water in which insects are drowned, and
                    Francis Darwin has discovered protoplasmic filaments which are emitted by the
                    cells of certain glands within these cups, and which appear to absorb the
                    products of decomposition. A similar process has recently also been shown by
                    Ludwig to occur in <hi rend="italic">Silphium,</hi> an allied genus.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Conclusion.—</hi> When Mr Darwin’s work appeared, numerous
                    objections were made to accepting his conclusions, on the <hi rend="italic">a
                    priori</hi> ground that digestion was too purely an animal function to be
                    conceivable of plants. Morren demolished these by showing that digestion—the
                    conversion of insoluble and indiffusible proteids, fats, and amyloids into
                    soluble and diffusible compounds by means of appropriate ferments—is not
                    confined either to animals or to carnivorous plants, but is a universal property
                    of living beings, in fact the necessary preliminary of all assimilation. Not
                    only are all the important animal digestive ferments represented among plants,
                    but vegetable physiologists have made us acquainted with several
                    ferments—synaptase, erythrozyme, myrosine, &amp;c.—which have no known analogues
                    in the animal kingdom. It is merely the exudation, not the existence, of the
                    ferment, then, which is remarkable in carnivorous plants, and this Darwin
                    suggests might begin by an exosmose accompanying the absorption of animal matter
                    by any plant possessing viscid glandular hairs, and, once set up, would be
                    perfected by natural selection. Insectivorous plants too are not the only ones
                    which exhibit peculiarities of nutrition. The true parasites absorb the juices
                    of the plants which they infest, and, not to mention the fungi, many of which
                    subsist partly or wholly on animal matter, the phanerogamous saprophytes <hi
                    rend="italic">(Neottia, Monotropa,</hi> &amp;c.) live by absorbing the partially
                    decomposed materials of other plants; and from the absorption of vegetable to
                    that of animal matter the transition is easy. The reciprocal case too occurs in
                    the animal kingdom; animals possessing chlorophyll have been shown to nourish
                    themselves like plants, without feeding, by decomposition of carbonic acid and
                    the formation of starch in sunlight, and thus carnivorous plants—trespassers
                    into the animal kingdom—are paralleled by vegetating animals. Thus, then, we
                    have only to change our standpoint, and look, not at the anomalous plant or
                    animal, but at the essentially similar cells, and the yet more essentially
                    similar protoplasm of which both are composed, to see that their apparent
                    anomalies are but additional proofs of the unity of nature.</p>
                <p>But a more serious criticism affected the completeness of Darwin’s work. Though
                    Knight in 1818 had thought plants of <hi rend="italic">Dionsea</hi> on which he
                    placed morsels of beef grew more luxuriantly than others not so treated, many
                    observers have since failed to see any improvement on insectivorous plants when
                    regularly fed, or any disadvantage when prevented from obtaining animal food
                    altogether; while others have even asserted that animal food was hurtful, having
                    injured or killed their plants by feeding. In the latter case the explanation
                    was of course that the feeding was excessive, but to meet the objections of the
                    former a very careful research was undertaken by Francis Darwin. He took six
                    plates full of thriving plants of sundew, and divided off each by a transverse
                    bar. Then, choosing the least flourishing side of each, he placed, on June 12,
                    1877, roast meat, in morsels of about - <hi rend="subscript"> g</hi> ⅛∙ of a
                    grain on the leaves, and renewed the dose occasionally. The plants on the fed
                    sides were soon clearly greener than those on the starved sides, and their
                    leaves contained more chlorophyll and starch, In less than two months the number
                    of flowerstalks was half as numerous again on the fed as on the unfed sides,
                    while the number and diameter of the leaves and the colour of the flowerstalks
                    all showed a great superiority. The flowerstalks were all cut at the end of
                    August, when their numbers were as 165 to 100, their total weight as 230 to
                    .100, and the average weight per stem as 140 to 100 for the fed and unfed sides
                    respectively. The total numbers of seed capsules were as 194 to 100, or nearly
                    double, and the average number of seeds in each capsule as 12 to 10
                    respectively. The superiority of the fed plants over the unfed was even more
                    clearly shown by comparing their seeds, the average weights per seed being as
                    157 to 100, their total calculated number as 240 to 100, and their total weight
                    as 380 to 100. The fed plants, though at the commencement of the experiment in a
                    slight minority, at the end of the season exceeded the unfed by more than 20 per
                    cent., while the following spring the young plants which sprang up on the fed
                    side exceeded those on the other by 18 per cent, in number and by 150 per cent,
                    in total weight, so that, in spite of the relatively enormous quantity of
                    flowerstalk produced by the fed plants during the previous summer, they had
                    still been able to lay up a far greater store of reserve material.</p>
                <p>It is to be remarked that the beneficial effect of feeding, although distinct in
                    the vegetative system, is much more remarkable in the reproductive, a fact which
                    explains the unfavourable opinion of previous observers.</p>
                <p>These results were also independently arrived at by three German observers, Rees,
                    Kellerman, and Von Räumer, who used aphides instead of roast meat. The question
                    of the utility of the carnivorous habit may thus be considered as no less
                    indisputable than its existence.</p>
