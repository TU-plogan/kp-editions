                <p><label type="entry">INTERNATIONAL LAW</label> is the name now generally given to
                    the rules of conduct accepted as binding <hi rend="italic">inter se</hi> by the
                    nations—or at all events the civilized nations—of the world. International law
                    as a whole is capable of being very differently interpreted according to the
                    point of view from which it is regarded, and its rules vary infinitely in point
                    of certainty and acceptance. According to the ideas of the leading English
                    school of jurists it is an impropriety to speak of these rules as being laws:
                    they are merely moral principles,—positive, it is true, in the sense that they
                    are recognized in fact, but destitute of the sanctioning force which is the
                    distinguishing quality of law. There is not a word to be said against this
                    criticism considered merely as a verbal criticism, but it may be so used as
                    unduly to depreciate the actual force and effect of the system as a whole. On
                    the other hand, the vast majority of writers on international law have preferred
                    to derive its principles from some transcendental source, such as nature,
                    reason, the Divine will, &amp;c.; and these accordingly have no hesitation in
                    attributing to its rules an intrinsic authority over all the nations of the
                    world. The usage of nations according to this theory is evidence of, but not the
                    origin of, the law. It merely expresses, as Sir R. Phillimore puts it, “the
                    consent of nations to things which are <hi rend="italic">naturally,</hi> that
                    is, by the law of God, binding upon them.” The true position is this—that we
                    find as a fact a number of rules accepted by civilized nations as obligatory in
                    their mutual dealings. These rules no doubt in many cases owe their existence to
                    the prevalence of theories of natural and divine law, but their authority no
                    longer depends on the truth of such theories. The rules are in themselves just
                    and reasonable. Some of them are so precise, so certain, and so universally
                    accepted that they cannot be distinguished from positive law except by the
                    absence of a determinate legislative source. Many of them are taken up by the
                    municipal laws of different countries, and in so far as they are thus
                    incorporated with positive systems they are in every sense positive laws. But
                    many of the rules of international law are vague, uncertain, and of disputed
                    •authority. Some of the rules, for example, relating to capture in war, the law
                    of blockade, and the privileges of ambassadors are so well ascertained and
                    settled that it is hardly conceivable that they should be broken by any
                    civilized state. On other points— <hi rend="italic">e.g.,</hi> as to what
                    articles should be contraband of war, when a state should interfere with the
                    domestic policy of another—no universally admitted principles can be said to
                    have been established. The substance of international law has been for this
                    reason divided into various sections, according to the degree of certainty which
                    the rules have obtained. Thus one of the most recent writers on this subject, Dr
                    Woolsey, distinguishes the rights and duties known to the science as (1) those
                    which are deducible from natural <hi rend="italic">jus,</hi> which no action of
                    a state can begin or terminate, (2) those deducible from the idea of a state,
                    and (3) those which can be created or destroyed by compact, express or tacit.
                    This and similar divisions do not really explain why some of the rules composing
                    what is known as international law are as fixed and certain as rules of conduct
                    can well be, while others are pure matter of controversy. It is simpler to state
                    the fact and to take note that the area of certainty in international law is
                    constantly increasing. For example, the rights of embassies were disputed by
                    England till a recent period; and the rules prohibiting the slave-trade and
                    making privateering illegal are comparatively recent additions to the
                    certainties of international law. To say that such rules as the last, being
                    founded on contract, are therefore of inferior authority to the imperishable
                    principles which pronounce all sovereigns to be equal and independent, and
                    distinguish between just and unjust wars, is absurd.<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>The name ‘ ‘ international law” has generally
                    taken the place of the “law of nations,” the “law of war and peace,” <hi

                    earlier writers. Bentham suggested international law as the most suitable
                    title.</p></note></p>
                <p>The theory of international law contemplates the world as divided into
                    independent states. That states are sovereign within their own territories,
                    independent of other states, and equal as between themselves is a fundamental
                    axiom of the science. Not that all states are regarded as lying within the
                    domain of this law. In modern times at least it has included all the states of
                    the Christian world; but at one time it excluded non-Christian states, and at
                    this moment it would be difficult to say to what extent it covers the relations
                    of such states <hi rend="italic">inter se</hi> and with the Christian states of
                    Europe and America. There is little doubt, however, that in course of time all
                    the civilized communities of the world will observe substantially the same
                    system of international law.</p>
                <p>In the next place international law regards the states of the world as being
                    either in a state of war or in a state of peace. It prescribes rules of conduct
                    to be observed in the mutual dealings of nations which are at peace with each
                    other, and of nations that are at war with each other; and it fixes the rights
                    and duties of belligerent and neutral nations. If peace is the normal state of
                    nations, as jurists sometimes assert, war is the state which has made the
                    largest demands on the science. The rules of international law with regard to
                    war are more voluminous and more certain than those which govern nations in time
                    of peace.</p>
                <p>International law, as we now know it, is substantially the creation of civilized
                    Europe in the last three hundred years, but rules of some kind, however meagre,
                    <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit13newyrich/page/n202/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0913-0202-0191"/> must accompany any state of society in which
                    intercourse, hostile or peaceful, between different communities is common. The
                    great nations of antiquity which have contributed most to the civilization of
                    modern Europe have given least to this branch of that civilization. The history
                    of the Jews furnishes nothing but examples of the total absence of a sense of
                    duty in relation to other nations. The division of the Greek world into a large
                    number of independent communities favoured the existence of an Hellenic law of
                    nations, presenting in many points—such as the recognition of common Hellenic
                    customs, religious and political, and of the principle of a balance of power— a
                    parallel to modern international law, The coherence of the Greek communities,
                    however, only intensified the difference between them and all other peoples, and
                    left their relations with them unregulated by any general principles. The <hi
                    rend="italic">jus</hi><hi rend="italic">feciale</hi> of the earlier Roman law—
                    regulating the formal intercourse between Rome and other nations—is indeed the
                    germ of what might have been a system of pure international law. But the rise of
                    the Roman commonwealth to the mastery of the world rendered <hi rend="italic">o,
                    jus inter</hi><hi rend="italic">gentes</hi> unnecessary and impossible. The
                    fecial law with its college of interpreting priests dwindled into an obsolete
                    collection of formalities no longer supported by the religious feelings of the
                    people. The <hi rend="italic">jus gentium</hi> of the Romans does indeed play an
                    important part in the history of international law, but as conceived of by the
                    Roman lawyers it was not international, but a body of positive law composed of
                    the elements common to the nations known to them, including Rome itself.
                    Positive international law does not in fact come into existence until the era of
                    Grotius, although usages of international intercourse must at all times have
                    existed. The sanctity attributed to ambassadors, the importance of formal
                    declarations of war, and the good faith to be observed in promises or treaties
                    would probably be found to be the points of most general recognition.</p>
                <p>The connexion between Roman and modern international law, through the conceptions
                    of <hi rend="italic">jus gentium ⅛τ∖Ajus naturae,</hi> has been lucidly traced
                    by Sir Henry Maine in his treatise on <hi rend="italic">Ancient Law,</hi> and
                    may be briefly noticed here. The postulates of the law of nations—that there is
                    a determinate law of nature, that it is binding on states <hi rend="italic"
                    >inter se,</hi> and that such states are equal—are founded on well-known general
                    principles of the Roman jurists. The ambiguity of the phrase <hi rend="italic"
                    >jus gentium</hi> enabled the early founders of international law to apply the
                    principles of the <hi rend="italic">jus</hi><hi rend="italic">naturae</hi> to
                    the conduct of states <hi rend="italic">inter sc</hi> in a way of which there is
                    no example in the Roman law-books. Further, in the Middle Ages the state systems
                    of Europe had arranged themselves on a territorial basis, so that sovereigns
                    were regarded as being the absolute masters of the territory occupied by their
                    people, instead of the chiefs of the people irrespective of territory. They
                    could thus be conceived as “members of a group of Roman proprietors,” and the
                    Roman law of property supplied the fundamental principles on which their
                    occupation was in international law understood to be based. The appearance of
                    jurists, dominated by the conceptions of the Roman law, at a time when European
                    arrangements made their application possible, is the true beginning of modern
                    international law. The greatest name is that of Grotius, whose work <hi
                    rend="italic">De jure Belli</hi><hi rend="italic">et Pacis</hi> was published in
                    1624. In the first sentence of the prolegomena he defines his subject as the law
                    which obtains between nations or their rulers, whether founded on native or
                    divine ordinance, or custom and tacit consent, which he adds <hi rend="italic"
                    >uηiversim</hi><hi rend="italic">ac certo ordine tractavit hactenus nemo.</hi>
                    There had been earlier workers in the same field. Among these were Francis de
                    Victoria of Salamanca, Suarez, Ayala, and Albericus Gentilis, all of whom
                    flourished in the 16th century. The work of Grotius definitely laid the
                    foundation of the science, which ho shaped in imitation of the institutional
                    treatises of Roman law. Among the jurists who followed Grotius, the classical
                    names are those of Puffendorf, Wolff, Vattel, and Bynkershoek. In England Sir
                    Leoline Jenkins and Lord Stowell are the most illustrious of those who have made
                    important contributions to international law. In America Wheaton stands at the
                    head of a school of distinguished jurists, and his <hi rend="italic">Elements of
                    International Law</hi> is the standard modern treatise on the subject.</p>
                <p>Several of the more important heads of international law will have to be noticed
                    separately, and it is only proposed in the present article to state shortly and
                    in outline its leading principles so far as they can be gathered from the most
                    authoritative modern writers. It will be convenient to discuss first the general
                    rules obtaining between nation and nation, and, secondly, the modifications and
                    special rules which are brought into existence by a state of war.</p>
                <p>It may be necessary to distinguish here between public international law and what
                    is known as private international law. The latter phrase is applied to those
                    principles which in the ordinary tribunals of a country are used to harmonize
                    the conflict of laws. Where the subject of a foreign state has a claim against
                    the queen or any of the queen’s subjects, for which he seeks redress in our
                    courts of law, it may become necessary to recognize and enforce the law of the
                    foreign state and not the law of England. The best illustration of this class of
                    questions is the case of domicile. For many purposes the place in which a man is
                    domiciled, as distinguished both from that in which he lives and the country of
                    which he is a subject, supplies the law applicable to his case. A French
                    subject, domiciled in Scotland, dies in England leaving personal property in
                    England; in such a case the property would be distributed according to the law
                    of Scotland, and not of England or of France. All nations have to provide for
                    such cases, in which the principles of a foreign jurisprudence must be enforced,
                    and have to determine under what conditions and to what extent the tribunal will
                    be required to enforce them. As it happens there is a general agreement among
                    nations on these points; the rule, for example, which makes real property
                    administrable according to the law of the land, and personal property according
                    to the law of the owner’s domicile, is universally recognized. So far as this
                    agreement extends, there may be said to be a private international law
                    corresponding to the international system of public law. But in the former we
                    have to deal with true positive law, deriving its authority from the
                    legislature, having no reference to the opinions and practice of nations, and
                    dealing with the rights of individuals. Public international law is of a totally
                    different character, recognizing nations as the only parties, and depending on
                    the agreement of nations as evinced by their opinions and practice. It is with
                    the latter only that we have now to deal.</p>
                <p>Independent sovereign states are then the units of international law, and whether
                    a given community is such a state is a question of fact. A community having
                    definite territorial limits within which its own government exercises absolute
                    authority, free from all external control, is the proper type of a state in
                    international law. But the world is not parcelled out among states thus
                    accurately defined. Where a number of states have been united in a permanent
                    confederation, it may be a question whether the group alone is in international
                    law an independent state, or whether each individual member has retained its
                    international independence. The United States of America are an example of the
                    former case; the German confederation until the recent changes was an example of
                    the other. Again, when one state has placed itself under the protection <pb
                    break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit13newyrich/page/n203/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0913-0203-0192"/> of another, it may be a question whether it has
                    lost or retained its independent status in international law. The proper test,
                    according to Phillimore, is its capacity <hi rend="italic">de facto</hi> to deal
                    with other states in peace or war, without reference to the protecting state.
                    States which have lost this capacity have been called semi-sovereign states.
                    They have the organization of an independent nation, but are in practice subject
                    to the rule of another state. The Ionian Islands - under the English
                    protectorate were in that position, and in the treaty of 1815 they are described
                    as a single free and independent state, under the exclusive protection of Great
                    Britain. A similar character attaches to some of the dependencies of Turkey. On
                    the other hand, a large portion of the surface of the earth is occupied by
                    communities having neither the permanent territorial occupation nor the social
                    coherence of civilized states, yet entering into such relations with them as
                    require the recognition of some system of rules. A further question of the
                    highest importance may arise when a portion of an existing state rises in
                    rebellion and sets up a claim to independence. Here again the question is one of
                    fact. If the rebels have succeeded in establishing a government, it is the right
                    and duty of the nations to recognize the fact, and each nation must judge for
                    itself whether the time for recognition has come. Premature recognition would be
                    regarded as an aid to rebellion inconsistent with the rules of international
                    law. The criterion suggested by practice and authority is whether the old
                    government had ceased to contend in fact against the revolutionary state. But
                    other nations are not bound to wait until the old government has itself
                    recognized the independence of the new. Similar questions arise when the form of
                    government in any country is changed by revolution, or when portions of one
                    state are transferred by conquest to the dominion of another. When the new state
                    of things is established in fact, no matter whether justly or unjustly, it must
                    be recognized by other nations.</p>
                <p>With the question of recognition is intimately connected that of
                    non-interference. Premature recognition of a struggling rebellion would be
                    regarded as a breach of the principle of non-intervention, but to recognize the
                    independence of an independent state is part of the same duty as to abstain from
                    interfering with it when it has been established. Writers on international law
                    lay it down as one of the fundamental principles of the science that one state
                    has no right to interfere with the domestic affixi rs of another. In the formal
                    arrangement of topics it generally appears as one of the necessary consequences
                    flowing from the independence of nations, and Phillimore considers it a
                    self-evident proposition for which it is unnecessary to cite authorities.
                    Nevertheless the practice of nations forbids the doctrine to be stated without
                    limitation. Interference has been sanctioned, according to Phillimore, either in
                    the purely domestic concerns of a nation, or with respect to its foreign
                    relations and territorial acquisitions. The first kind of interference has been
                    justified on the plea of self-defence, as when the decree of the French
                    Convention of 1792, promising aid to all peoples who wished to recover their
                    liberty, was treated as a declaration of war on all existing constitutions.
                    Interference to prevent effusion of blood, or put an end to a state of anarchy
                    from which the interests of other nations necessarily suffer, has also been
                    justified, as when England, France, and Russia interfered between Turkey and its
                    rebellious subjects in 1827. On the whole, the right of intervention has been
                    discredited in international law, and the anomalous condition of the Turkish
                    empire has almost alone in recent times given occasion for its exercise. The
                    ground that reversionary rights of a particular family to the throne of a
                    country justify foreign interference with legislative changes of the succession
                    can no longer be maintained. Nor is it necessary to discuss any such pretended
                    right as that of putting down new Governments which have established themselves
                    by revolution. The same kind of interference is illustrated by the principle of
                    the balance of power which is thus enunciated by Dr Woolsey—that any European
                    state may be restrained from pursuing plans of acquisitions or making
                    preparations looking toward future acquisitions which are judged to be hazardous
                    to the independence and national existence of its neighbours. According to the
                    same authority, it applies only to European states and their acquisitions in
                    Europe, and does not extend to predominant power on the sea. It is not so much a
                    rule of international law as a maxim of policy which has from time to time
                    united European nations against the dangerous ambitions of one of their number.
                    The “Monroe doctrine” of the United States is of a similar character, being
                    directed against the interference of European states in the affairs of the
                    American continent. The declaration that no European power can be permitted to
                    acquire territory on the American continent is, according to Woolsey, not a
                    principle of the national policy of the United States.</p>
                <p>Independent states are said to be equal in international law, because, says
                    Phillimore, it is contrary to the nature of an independent state to be in
                    servitude to another. The proposition negatives any claim of precedence on the
                    part of one or more states in international rank, and asserts that all states
                    equally are entitled to the benefit of international rules. No difference in
                    constitution affects this equality, a republic being the equal of a kingdom, and
                    a kingdom of an empire. Beyond this it can hardly be stretched. It is consistent
                    with conventional inequalities in the reciprocal treatment of nations, and with
                    the habitual recognition in Europe at least of the predominance of the Great
                    Powers. Phillimore deduces from the principle of equality the following
                    rights—(1) the right to protect subjects resident in other countries, (2) the
                    right to recognition, (3) the right to external marks of honour, and (4) the
                    right to enter into treaties. As to the first of these, it may be laid down that
                    a state has cause of complaint if its subjects in foreign countries are denied
                    ordinary justice.</p>
                <p>States in relation to the territories occupied by them are treated on the footing
                    of proprietors in law. As between nations each is the absolute owner of its
                    dominions, and the principles applicable to their ownership are taken, as
                    already said, from the Roman law of things. For example, the modes of acquiring
                    territory in international law are said to be four. (1) The first is occupation
                    of land not already occupied <hi rend="italic">(res</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >nullius).</hi> Mere discovery unaccompanied by beneficial use and occupation
                    will not give a title. (2) The second is prescription or mere possession for a
                    considerable length of time, jurists on the whole are agreed in admitting this
                    title, although they refrain from attempting to fix a period of prescription.
                    These have been called original modes of acquisition, while secondary or
                    derivative modes are (3) gift, purchase, or treaty, and (4) conquest in war.
                    With reference to these distinctions it may be observed that the overruling
                    consideration is actual possession as a matter of fact. Sovereignty exercised
                    <hi rend="italic">de facto</hi> over any territory makes it the territory of the
                    sovereign state. This is a deduction of what has already been said on the
                    subject of recognition, and the modes of acquisition here described would only
                    be appealed to in default of such unequivocal possession. In former times a bull
                    of the pope has been set up as a title, <hi rend="italic">e.g.,</hi> the famous
                    bull of Alexander VI. granting to Spain all lands west of a north and south line
                    drawn a hundred leagues west of the Azores. No such mode of acquisition would
                    now be recognized even by Catholic states. In modern times the acquisition of
                    territory is to some extent governed by the wishes of the inhabitants. As an
                    abstract principle of international <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit13newyrich/page/n204/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0913-0204-0193"/> justice, the transfer of territory from one
                    sovereignty to another should be with the consent of the people. But this is not
                    yet a recognized rule of international law, although in many recent cases of
                    acquisition of new territory a certain amount of deference has been paid to it.
                    In the treaty of Prague (1866), in the union of the Neapolitan provinces to the
                    kingdom of Italy, and in the union of Savoy and Nice to France, the rights of
                    the inhabitants to decide on the proposed transfers are expressly reserved. A
                    recent and more painful instance is the annexation of the Transvaal by England
                    under an order in council which authorized the measure if it should appear to be
                    agreeable to the legislature or a sufficient portion of the inhabitants. It is
                    now clear that no such assent was given by the people, while the acting
                    Government of the republic firmly protested against the annexation.</p>
                <p>The territory of a state includes all the lands and inland waters within its
                    boundaries, the mouths of rivers, bays, and estuaries, and the sea to the
                    distance of a marine league along the coast. By a fiction vessels on the high
                    seas, and public vessels everywhere, are treated as part of the territory of the
                    state to which they belong. The high seas are no nation’s property,—although in
                    the earlief stages of international law exclusive pretensions have been set up
                    to particular seas, as by Spain to the Pacific, England to the seas around Great
                    Britain, and Russia to the North Pacific.</p>
                <p>Formal intercourse between nations is carried on under well-ascertained rules.
                    Omitting mere ceremonial regulations, we may notice specially the position
                    assigned by the law of nations to ambassadors. These are the highest class of
                    diplomatic agents, and according to the universal modern practice they are
                    permanently attached to the foreign court to which they are accredited. The
                    earlier practice <hi rend="italic">(e.g.,</hi> before the Reformation) favoured
                    the appointment of special ambassadors for particular business. The office of
                    ambassador, whether permanent or temporary, has at all times been clothed with a
                    character of peculiar sanctity. His privileges during residence at a foreign
                    court may be summed up in the statement that himself, his house, his property,
                    and his household are exempt from the foreign jurisdiction. Like a ship of war
                    in foreign waters, the embassy is exterritorial—supposed by fiction of law to be
                    part of the sovereign’s dominions. The ambassador therefore is not liable to
                    prosecution in the criminal nor to suit in the civil courts. His official
                    residence is free from the local jurisdiction; but it is no longer an asylum,
                    and a criminal taking refuge there may be seized by the local authority if not
                    delivered up by the ambassador. Ambassadors are further relieved from taxation
                    on goods imported for their own use, a privilege which has not unfrequently been
                    abused. An ambassador is entitled to freedom of worship, whether his religion be
                    tolerated by the local government or not. The suite of an ambassador down to his
                    domestic servants are also exempt from the local jurisdiction. *The household
                    may in some respects be likened to a separate community under the sovereignty of
                    the ambassador. But it is only in minor affairs that his power to actually
                    execute criminal justice on his own servants would now be recognized. The proper
                    course for him to adopt in a serious charge would be to send the accused home to
                    be tried. The privileges of an ambassador and his suite, it should be added,
                    apply only so far as they do not act beyond the limits of their legatorial
                    character, <hi rend="italic">—e.g.,</hi> as merchants, trustees, and so on.
                    Exceptional crimes committed by an ambassador do not destroy his character or
                    rights,—at least according to the general consensus of modern authorities,
                    although English lawyers have argued That a crime <hi rend="italic">contra jus
                    gentium</hi> destroyed the ambassadorial character. Besides ambassadors, two
                    inferior grades of foreign ministers are recognized, viz., (1) envoys,
                    ministers, or others accredited to sovereigns, and (2) chargés d’affaires
                    accredited to ministers charged with foreign affairs. These three grades of
                    diplomatic rank were settled by the congress of Vienna (1815) to avoid the
                    embarrassment arising from claims of precedence. Consuls are merely local agents
                    of a foreign Government, for certain limited purposes, such as facilitating and
                    recording legal transactions affecting the subjects of the state they represent,
                    and assisting them in obtaining their legal rights. They are appointed with the
                    permission <hi rend="italic">(exequatur)</hi> of the country in which they are
                    to act. They have no immunity from local jurisdiction except under special
                    arrangements. In non-Christian countries the consuls representing Christian
                    states have more extensive functions. In Turkey and the Mahometan countries of
                    the Levant they exercise generally an exclusive criminal and civil jurisdiction
                    over their countrymen.</p>
                <p>The contracts made by states with each other are in international law treated
                    according to the general principles of the law of contracts (see <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Treaties).</hi> Under the modern practice rules of private law
                    affecting foreigners are in many cases settled by treaty on the basis of
                    reciprocity, <hi rend="italic">e.g.,</hi> extradition, copyright, &amp;c.</p>
                <p>Hitherto we have considered nations as in a state of peace. War introduces an
                    entirely new order of rules, applying either between the belligerents themselves
                    or between the belligerents and neutral states. To the question whether a given
                    war be just or unjust international law has no answer to. give, or only a formal
                    one. Any war undertaken in defence of the rights which have been already
                    described might be called a just, and any war undertaken in violation of them
                    might be called an unjust war. The justice or injustice of any war is really a
                    question of morality, and in proportion as international law has escaped from
                    the merely ethical region it has abandoned the attempt to decide this question.
                    It figures largely in Grotius, as compared with later writers, and more largely
                    in the speculative than in the positive jurists.. One condition of the legality
                    of a war, that of a formal declaration, borrowed from Roman practice by Grotius
                    and some of his followers has ceased to be of any importance, although some
                    publication of the fact of war is considered necessary in fairness to neutrals.
                    But all wars are legal in international law— that is, they are governed by the
                    rules of the law of war—· except wars levied by pirates or piratical
                    communities. The part played by international law has been not to prevent but to
                    regulate warfare. Nations have arrived at a tolerable degree of unanimity as to
                    how wars ought to be conducted, and the result is a certain and progressive law
                    of war. They are far from having arrived at any understanding as to the
                    conditions under which war ought to be allowed; when they are within sight of
                    any such understanding, it will be time enough to talk about a war being just or
                    unjust in international law.</p>
                <p>The absence of any legal standard of the justice of a war only adds to the
                    importance of the moral question. There being no law of nations to restrain the
                    warlike ambition of nations, as there is to restrain their passions when war has
                    begun, the purely moral restraints become all-important. Among these it might
                    not be worth while to reckon the kind of selfishness which counts the cost of a
                    campaign against a powerful enemy. But a generous horror of war for its own sake
                    may safely be pronounced to be, in spite of recent events, a growing public
                    sentiment, particularly in the English-speaking people of both worlds. There is
                    no English or American statesman who would not at least do lip-service to the
                    principle that an avoidable war is a public crime. Some of them have done more.

                    promoters, and will be more fruitful of benefit to mankind, than fifty
                    victorious campaigns. It is through the establishment of the principle of
                    arbitration that we may ultimately hope to see the question of justice or
                    injustice in war take its place among the topics of international law.</p>
                <p>Short of war, certain preliminary measures of hostility are recognized. These
                    are—“embargo,” or the seizure in port of vessels belonging to a foreign nation
                    with which we have a difference, in order to bring it to justice; “retorsion,”
                    or retaliating on the foreign nation or its subjects, by similar injuries to
                    those inflicted on us; and “reprisals,” or the seizure of foreign property in
                    retaliation for wrongs done to us. These are now of little importance. The right
                    of “pacific blockade,” <hi rend="italic">i.e.</hi><hi rend="italic subscript">
                    y</hi> the blockade of ports belonging to a nation with which we profess not to
                    be at war, has been asserted in a few doubtful instances, but such interference
                    ought to be treated as an act of war.</p>
                <p>A state of war transforms the nations engaged into two hostile camps, every man
                    in either being the enemy of all in the other, and entitled to slay and capture
                    as best he can. Such at least is the “natural” theory of war, which
                    international law has reduced to much smaller proportions. First, hostile acts
                    are strictly reserved for the soldiers or others acting under direct public
                    authority; non-combatants are to be regarded as neutrals so far as actual
                    warfare is concerned; they must abstain from hostile acts, and they must be left
                    unharmed by the enemy. Property taken in war belongs to the state, not to the
                    individual captor; and, on the other hand, subject to modifications to be
                    pointed out hereafter, only the property of the state and not private property
                    should be liable to capture. War is thus reduced to an open armed strife between
                    two states carried on by means of a definite and unmistakable set of agents,
                    viz., the fleets and armies. That the non-combatant portions of the two
                    communities should remain as though they were in a state of peace is the
                    principle towards which international law appears to be tending. The movement
                    against privateering is an illustration of this tendency. In wars carried on by
                    land, non-combatants are as far as possible kept out of the sphere of
                    operations,—persons only under public military command being regarded as
                    combatants. In naval warfare it has long been recognized as a valid mode of
                    conducting hostilities to grant “letters of marque” to private vessels, owned,
                    manned, and officered by private persons. Its analogy on land would be a roving
                    commission to private gangs of freebooters. These letters commission the
                    privateers to prey upon the commerce of the hostile nation, the reward for their
                    services being the plunder they may chance to gain. The privateer may belong to
                    a neutral nation or to the nation granting the commission. The practice is
                    defended on the ground that it enables a power having weak naval resources to
                    cope with a great naval power on sudden emergencies. On the other hand the loose
                    discipline of privateer crews, and the fact that their object is simply plunder,
                    are serious evils. The treaty of Paris of 1856 contains the famous declaration
                    that “privateering is and remains abolished,” and the adhesion of the United
                    States to this principle would go far to make the practice illegal by the law of
                    nations. Hitherto they have declined, preferring the more comprehensive policy
                    of prohibiting the seizure of private property of all kinds by ships of war.
                    This point conceded, the United States would assent to the abolition of
                    privateering.</p>
                <p>Contracts entered into between the subjects of hostile states are void. Rights
                    already created by contracts entered into before the war are not destroyed, but
                    the remedy is suspended, an alien enemy having no redress in courts of law. All
                    commercial intercourse between the two peoples is interdicted, according to the
                    maxim that there cannot be at the same time “a war for arms and a peace for
                    commerce.” Partnerships between a citizen and an alien enemy existing before the
                    war are <hi rend="italic">ipso facto</hi> extinguished by the war. All nations,
                    in fact, are agreed in pronouncing illegal during a time of war the ordinary
                    commercial intercourse which prevails between them in time of peace. The
                    principle extends to giving one of two allies a right to prohibit intercourse
                    carried on with or without licence by the subjects of the other with the common
                    enemy. Contracts for the ransom of captured property are valid by the law of
                    nations, but may be and sometimes are restricted by the provisions of a
                    municipal law. And a state may of course grant special licences to its own
                    subjects to trade with the enemy.</p>
                <p>The effect of war on the persons and property of alien enemies within the
                    dominions of the state, and on debts due to them by the state or its subjects
                    before the war, has been greatly softened in modern practice. In strict theory
                    the debts and property would be liable to confiscation, and the persons
                    themselves to detention as prisoners of war. Such is the rule laid down by
                    Bynkershoek, but later writers have held that the guarantees to a contrary
                    effect contained in commercial treaties and even in voluntary declarations by
                    belligerent powers have altered the law of nations on this point. This question
                    was expressly decided in an important American case (Brown <hi rend="italic"
                    >v.</hi> the United States), in which the supreme court held that the ancient
                    rule still remained unimpaired as a right recognized by the law of nations,
                    however much it might have been mitigated in practice. In that case, however,
                    its exercise was held to require a special Act of Congress. The confiscation of
                    debts and the confiscation of property seem to stand on the same footing, and in
                    both cases it may be said that the law of nations has not yet formally
                    recognized the rule established by universal practice. The Act of the
                    Confederate Congress in 1861, confiscating all property and debts (except public
                    debts) due to an alien enemy, may be taken as the exception which proves the
                    rule. It has been unequivocally condemned, and was vigorously protested against
                    at the time by Earl Russell as a violation of the spirit of modern law. Even the
                    Confederate Act did not profess to confiscate public debts, and it may be taken
                    as the settled rule of law that no state is justified in repudiating its own
                    public obligations to the subjects of a state with which it may be at war.</p>
                <p>The laws and usages of actual war exhibit the same tendency to substitute a
                    milder and more humane code for the unrestrained licence of earlier times. The
                    inspiring idea of Grotius was in fact to introduce the spirit of law into the
                    conduct of hostilities, to enforce the principle that there was a lawful as well
                    as an unlawful way of waging war. Between the time of Grotius and our own the
                    sphere of law in war has greatly widened. No nation claiming to be civilized
                    would now venture to conduct a campaign otherwise than according to the rules of
                    civilized warfare, unless against savages from whom no reciprocal treatment is
                    to be expected, or rebels to whom they refuse the status of belligerents.
                    Besides the influence of international law systematically studied as a science,
                    and the general growth of humaner modes of life and action, a specific cause of
                    this improvement in the law of war is the fact that battle is now for the most
                    part the business of professional soldiers scientifically equipped, and
                    accustomed to stringent discipline. For the best historical view of this
                    interesting subject we may refer to Mr Mountague Bernard’s paper “On the Growth
                    of Laws and Usages of War,” in the volume of <hi rend="italic">Oxford
                    Essays</hi> for 1856.</p>
                <p>The actual laws and usages of civilized warfare can scarcely be brought within
                    the scope of the present article, but we may refer to a summary of them
                    contained in the <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit13newyrich/page/n206/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0913-0206-0195"/> project of an international declaration submitted
                    to the Brussels conference of 1874. The conference did not result in any
                    international convention, and England firmly repudiated portions of the
                    declaration which appeared to be calculated to “facilitate aggressive wars, and
                    to paralyse the patriotic efforts of an invaded people.” But on the whole this
                    document, although not accepted into the legislation of nations, expresses their
                    general sense on most of the points with which it deals. It lays down rules with
                    regard to (1) the occupation of a hostile country by military force, (2) the
                    distinction between combatants and non-combatants, (3) the means of injuring an
                    enemy, (4) sieges and bombardments, (5) spies, (6) prisoners of war, (7) sick
                    and wounded, (8) private individuals and private property, (9) contributions and
                    requisitions, (10) flags of truce, (11) capitulations, (12) armistices, (13)
                    belligerents interned or wounded treated in neutral territory. Under the first,
                    second, eighth, and ninth heads the effects of war are restricted to the
                    property of the state and its recognized army, although the necessity of
                    military organization in order to entitle combatants to the rights of war is
                    laid down too stringently. Private property must be respected, and pillage is
                    expressly forbidden, but on the other hand an army of occupation has a right to
                    seize all the personal property of the state which is likely to be of use in
                    war, including any kind of munitions of war although belonging to private
                    individuals or companies. The occupying state is to consider itself in the light
                    of an administrator and usufructuary of the public buildings, &amp;c., of the
                    hostile state. Contributions and requisitions may be imposed on the inhabitants,
                    for which receipts must be given. Under the third head there are forbidden the
                    use of poison or poisoned weapons, murder by treachery or murder of a disarmed
                    enemy, declaration of “no quarter,” projectiles causing unnecessary suffering or
                    prohibited by the declaration of St Petersburg 1818, abuse of the flag of truce,
                    and unnecessary destruction of enemy’s property; but <hi rend="italic">ruses de
                    guerre</hi> are permitted. Spies (who collect information on false pretences or
                    secretly in territory occupied by the enemy) shall when captured be tried and
                    treated according to the law of the army which captures them. The bearer of a
                    flag of truce is inviolable unless he abuse his position, but a commander is not
                    bound to receive a flag of truce. Treatment of the wounded is regulated by the
                    Geneva Convention of 1864, and such modifications thereof as may from time to
                    time be made. The English reader will find a copy of the Brussels project in
                    Boyd’s edition of Wheaton’s <hi rend="italic">International Law.</hi> The Geneva
                    Convention, to which reference is here made, was an international compact
                    between the European states, establishing the neutrality of ambulances and
                    military hospitals, and of all persons engaged in the service thereof, as well
                    as of inhabitants of the country bringing help to the wounded. The hospitals,
                    &amp;c., shall bear a distinctive flag (red cross on white ground), and badges
                    similarly distinguished shall be allowed for individuals entitled to the
                    benefits of neutrality. The St Petersburg declaration renounces for the
                    contracting parties in case of war among themselves the use of “any projectile
                    of a weight below 400 grammes, which is either explosive or charged with
                    fulminating or inflammable substances.”</p>
                <p>War by land is necessarily carried on within the territory of one or other of the
                    belligerents, and generally in the midst of surroundings devoted to the
                    permanent works of civilization and peace. Naval warfare is a duel between two
                    sets of “floating fortresses,” on an element which is no nation’s exclusive
                    property, and in no nation’s continuous possession. This is the principal reason
                    for the superior humanity characterizing the rule of war on land, where the
                    licence of primitive warfare would be infinitely more disastrous than it would
                    be at sea. Another reason why the law of the sea retains so much of its original
                    severity is that its rules have been developed under the influence of a regular
                    court and a professional bar, and have acquired the fixed and inelastic
                    character peculiar to positive law. The toleration of privateering already
                    noticed is an example of the difference between the two systems, and the
                    practice of bombarding seaports to enforce contributions is another. The
                    liability of private property to capture is, however, the most important point
                    of difference. The public vessels of the enemy are of course the natural prey of
                    our own. The private property of the enemy may be contained either in private
                    vessels of his own or in the ships of neutral powers, and we may add for the
                    sake of convenience a third case, where the private vessels of the enemy carry
                    goods belonging to neutral owners. In the last case, when the hostile vessel has
                    been captured, the neutral property is not affected thereby— <hi rend="italic"
                    >enemy ship</hi> does not make <hi rend="italic">enemy goods.</hi> In the second
                    case the treaty of Paris has promulgated the rule that <hi rend="italic">free
                    ship</hi> makes <hi rend="italic">free goods,</hi> which may now be regarded as
                    the established modern rule. In the first case ship and cargo alike are the prey
                    of our vessels of war. In the result, therefore, we may capture the enemy’s
                    ships and the enemy’s property on board his own ships, but we must spare neutral
                    vessels and all the goods therein, whether belonging to enemies or neutrals, and
                    neutral goods when found on board the enemy’s vessels. There is, however, a
                    manifest tendency in international opinion to withdraw private vessels and
                    private property lawfully used altogether from the sphere of warlike operations.
                    The law of capture by sea is further considered under the heading <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Prize.</hi></p>
                <p>It remains to speak of the right of neutrals, and their obligations to the
                    belligerents. The neutral nation is to be regarded as the friend of both
                    belligerents, and is bound to treat both of them alike. Jurists distinguish
                    between “strict” or “ordinary” neutrality, and “imperfect” neutrality, in which
                    certain advantages are allowed to both belligerents, or in which advantages are
                    granted to one of the belligerents only under a prior treaty, which the other
                    belligerent does not choose to consider a <hi rend="italic">casus belli.</hi>
                    The “perpetual* neutrality of Belgium and Switzerland secured by treaties binds
                    those states to abstain from taking part in any war arising between their
                    neighbours. The combination of several northern powers to enforce by arms
                    certain alleged rights of neutrals against the claims of belligerents in 1780
                    and 1800 has been termed an “armed neutrality.”</p>
                <p>Neutral states are entitled to prohibit all belligerent operations within their
                    territory,—using that phrase in the enlarged sense it bears in international
                    law. They may prevent the passage of fleets or armies through those portions of
                    the sea or land over which their jurisdiction extends. Hostilities carried on
                    within neutral territory are unlawful, and captures effected thereby are void.
                    The rule is indisputable, but its application to warfare by sea has not been
                    free from controversy. A capture made outside the neutral territory by the boats
                    of a ship lying within the neutral territory has been held to imply an illegal
                    use of that territory for purposes of war. On the other hand, a capture begun
                    outside but consummated within the neutral territory, is also, notwithstanding
                    the theory set up by Bynkershoek, entirely illegal. It is in fact as much the
                    duty as the right of the neutral state to insist on these prohibitions, as the
                    omission to do so in any case might give an advantage to one belligerent over
                    the other inconsistent with true neutrality. The exemption of neutral property
                    everywhere from the operation of war has been already noticed. The impartiality
                    which it is the duty of the neutral to observe towards the belligerents has been
                    summed up by Vattel in two propositions cited with approval by Wheaton:—(I) that
                    no assistance should be given to either party, in matters relating to war unless
                    under some pre-existing <pb break="no"

                    peace are wrongful and incompatible with sound neutrality. The fulfilment of
                    them would be an attempt to do the act of a belligerent and yet claim the
                    immunity of a neutral.</p></note> (2) that in matters not relating to war the
                    neutral should not refuse to one belligerent “merely because he is at war with
                    the other what she grants to that other.” The obligation of impartiality extends
                    to prohibiting the use of the neutral territory for the purpose of fitting out
                    warlike expeditions, equipping vessels, and enlisting men. The right and duty of
                    neutral nations in this respect were first recognized and enforced by the United
                    States, long the chief representative and champion of neutral rights. An Act of
                    Congress passed in 1794, reenacted 1818, makes it a misdemeanour for “any person
                    within the jurisdiction of the United States to augment the force of any armed
                    vessel belonging to one foreign power at war with another power with whom they
                    are at peace, or to prepare any military expedition against the territories of
                    any foreign nations with whom they are at peace, or to hire or enlist troops or
                    seamen for foreign military or naval service, or to be concerned in fitting out
                    any vessel to cruise or commit hostilities in foreign service, &amp;c.” The same
                    principles inspire the English Foreign Enlistment Acts which have been
                    pronounced by the well-known writer “Historicus”<note anchored="true"

                    &amp; 34 Vict. c. 90). These Acts are correctly described as municipal statutes,
                    based indeed on international law, but intended for the protection of the
                    neutral state rather than the belligerents.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    been recently the subject of protracted discussions between England and America,
                    arising out of the depredations committed by Confederate cruisers on American
                    commerce. The treaty of Washington, 1871, by which all these questions were
                    referred to arbitration, directed the arbitrator to apply to them not only the
                    rules of the law of nations but three new rules, which England at least could
                    not admit as being in force when the claims arose, but which she acceded to as
                    an evidence of her desire to strengthen friendly relations with the United
                    States. Both parties agreed to abide by these principles in future, and to
                    invite other nations to accede to them. The rules were that a neutral government
                    is bound—(1) to use due diligence to prevent the fitting out, arming, or
                    equipping within its jurisdiction of any vessel which it has reasonable ground
                    to believe is intended to cruise or to carry on war against a power with which
                    it is at peace, and also to use like diligence to prevent the departure from its
                    jurisdiction of any vessel intended to cruise or carry on war as above, such
                    vessel having been adapted in whole or in part within such jurisdiction to
                    warlike use; (2) not to permit or suffer either belligerent to make use of its
                    ports or waters as the base of naval operations against the other, or for the
                    purpose of renewal or augmentation of military supplies or arms or the
                    recruitment of men; and (3) to exercise due diligence in its own ports and
                    waters and as to all persons within its jurisdiction, to prevent any violation
                    of the foregoing obligations and duties.</p>
                <p>These rules, which we believe to be substantially just, have been unduly
                    discredited in England, partly by the result of the arbitration, which was in
                    favour of the United States, partly by the fact that they were from the point of
                    view of English opinion <hi rend="italic">ex post facto</hi> rules, and that the
                    words defining liability (“due diligence”) were vague and open to unforeseen
                    constructions,—for example, the construction actually adopted by the Geneva
                    tribunal that due diligence ought to be exercised in proportion to the
                    belligerent’s risk of suffering from any failure of the neutral to fulfil his
                    obligations.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>See
                    Mountague Bernard’s <hi rend="italic">British Neutrality.</hi></p></note> One
                    important principle, to some extent challenged in these controversies, is
                    established beyond dispute. Whatever the obligations of a neutral in any given
                    case may be, failure to fulfil them is not excused either by defects of the
                    municipal law or by successful evasions of that law. The neutral state ought to
                    make its laws conformable to its international duties, and to compel its
                    subjects to obey them. If it fails in either respect, and injury to belligerents
                    is the consequence, it is answerable under the law of nations.</p>
                <p>So far we have been dealing with the rights and duties of neutral <hi
                    rend="italic">states.</hi> Neutral commerce in times of war is subject to
                    restrictions which affect individuals rather than states, such as the rules
                    relating to blockade and contraband of war.</p>
                <p>Pirates and savages or uncivilized tribes have been mentioned as excluded from
                    the benefits of international law. The municipal law of most countries assumes
                    jurisdiction over the former wherever they may be found (see <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Piracy).</hi> With regard to the latter, it cannot be said that
                    civilized nations have observed any rule of law or morality whatsoever in their
                    dealings with them. The overflowing population of European nations has been
                    compelled to seek an outlet in regions occupied by men in a low state of
                    civilization, neither capable nor desirous of making a beneficial use of them.
                    It is not to be pretended for a moment that the Europeans were bound to leave
                    the continent of America to its original Indians, for even civilized communities
                    are not permitted to claim dominion over territory which they do not really
                    occupy. But the early European settlers founded their claims on some authority,
                    generally that of their own sovereigns, which recognized no right whatever in
                    the original occupants. They were described in patent deeds as “heathens and
                    infidels,” and a colour of religious duty was thus imparted to the most
                    barefaced schemes of spoliation. Wheaton cites the authority given by Henry VII.
                    to Cabot and by Queen Elizabeth to Sir Humphrey Gilbert to seek out foreign and
                    barbarous lands “not actually possessed of any Christian prince or people,” and
                    to hold, occupy, and enjoy the same. Vattel, who strongly insists upon the right
                    of civilized people to reduce the ineffective occupation of savages to the
                    narrowest possible limits, warmly commends the conduct of William Penn and the
                    English Quakers in purchasing from its savage occupants the country they wished
                    to inhabit. The colonizing nations, says Wheaton, were agreed in one thing,
                    viz., in “almost entirely disregarding the right of the native inhabitants.”
                    Settlements of this kind are not now made from European countries, and public
                    opinion would no longer sanction the pretensions on which they were based. But
                    between the European settlements already established and the native tribes by
                    which they are surrounded the same disregard of the rights of the weaker party
                    is only too common. So far as England is concerned, the temptations of her
                    colonists to commit injustice in their dealings with inferior races are
                    counterbalanced by an active public opinion at home. In the conduct of
                    hostilities against savages, civilized troops would not be regarded as bound by
                    the international law of war; and it is difficult to conceive of any restraint
                    other than that of their own sense of decency and humanity. In conflicts between
                    civilized communities the employment of savages on either side is condemned for
                    this very reason. In self-defence the troops opposed to them must resort to
                    practices condemned by the opinion of the civilized world.</p>

                <p>The main object of this article has been to exhibit the law of nations as much as
                    possible in the form of a positive system of rules binding on states <hi
                    rend="italic">inter se,</hi> to assimilate the treatment of the subject to a
                    statement of the ordinary rules of positive law. Many topics have therefore been
                    omitted which are discussed at length in treatises on international law. It is
                    not always possible to say where international law begins and international
                    morality ends, but it is of the highest importance to mark the distinction. The
                    former, taken broadly, means the rules of conduct that the nations of the
                    civilized world admit and insist upon as a matter of course, and the fact that
                    there are such rules is the central fact of the whole subject. Every addition to
                    them is a positive good to the whole world, and such additions are for the most
                    part to be traced to the reasonings of private thinkers. But to treat principles
                    supported only by the authority of jurists, however distinguished, as of equal
                    validity with those which have been adopted by the universal practice of nations
                    is to weaken the one without strengthening the other. It should be said,
                    moreover, that the systematic study of international law with a view to its
                    improvement by jurists of all countries organized in societies like the <hi
                    rend="italic">Institut</hi><hi rend="italic">de Droit International</hi> at once
                    tends to mature opinion and io give it an immediate hold on the practice of
                    nations.</p>
                <p>Among the purely speculative questions connected with international law two
                    deserve special notice on account of the extent to which they have engaged the
                    sympathies at least of the best minds in every age. One is the project for a
                    perpetual peace, the other is the more immediately practical proposal to reduce
                    the law of nations to a written code. With the former the names of Bentham and
                    of Kant are associated. Bentham’s plan is a congress of deputies, two from each
                    state, which should determine international disputes, and the decrees of which
                    should be enforced against any state that might resist them by the combined
                    power of the rest. As a preliminary condition he requires the reduction of
                    military establishments and the abandonment by European nations of their
                    colonies. Kant proposes a confederation of states, all under a republican
                    constitution, and acting in international affairs through congresses to be held
                    from time to time. An account of these and other projects of the same kind will
                    be found in Wheaton’s <hi rend="italic">History of the Law of Nations.</hi>
                    Codification would effect for the law of nations, as a whole, what has already
                    been done for portions of it by the St Petersburg and Geneva conventions, and
                    even by the treaties of Paris and Washington. All states are alike interested in
                    ascertaining the rules to which they have assented in general terms. The work
                    has already been to a great extent performed by private associations, and what
                    is wanted is the formal ratification of their labours by the Governments of the
                    world.</p>
                <p>The following are the most authoritative modem works on International Law :—Henry

                    edition published in 1866 with notes by R. H. Dana, jun.; an English edition
                    appeared in 1880); Sir Robert Phillimore’s <hi rend="italic">Commentaries on
                    International Law,</hi> in 4 vols, (a very complete and elaborate work); Sir
                    Travers Twiss’s <hi rend="italic">Law of Nations,</hi> 2 vols.; and Heffter’s
                    <hi rend="italic">Das Europäische Völkerrecht der Gegenwart.</hi> To these may
                    be added the less important treatises of Richard Wildman, William Oke Manning,
                    and H. W. Halleck (American). Useful elementary works are Chancellor Kent’s <hi
