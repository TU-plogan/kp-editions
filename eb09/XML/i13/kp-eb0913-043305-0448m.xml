                    on the north by the districts of Trieste, Görz, and Carniola, stretches
                    southwards into the Adriatic Sea, between the Gulf of Trieste <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Sinus</hi><hi rend="italic">Tergestinus),</hi> and the Gulf of Quarnaro <hi
                    rend="italic">(Sinus Flanaticus).</hi> The area of the official district, which
                    includes Veglia, Cherso, Lussino, and other smaller islands on the south-east
                    coast, is 1908 square miles, of which 1545 belong to the peninsula itself. The
                    surface is mountainous, especially in the north and east regions, which are
                    occupied by offshoots from the Julian Alps. Monte Maggiore (4573 feet) in the
                    north-east is the highest summit. The Quieto in the west and the Arsa in the
                    east, neither of which is navigable, are the principal streams. The west coast
                    abounds in convenient bays and harbours, of which Pola, an imperial naval
                    station, is the chief; but the steep and rocky east coast is beset with shallows
                    and islets, and is much exposed to the prevailing winds, the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Sirocco</hi> from the south-south-east and the <hi rend="italic">Bora</hi> from
                    the north-east. The climate of Istria, although it varies with the varieties of
                    surface, is on the whole warm and dry. The soil is not unfertile, but its
                    resources are far from being fully developed. About one half of the total area
                    is occupied with scanty grass and pasture land, while timber and the various
                    annual crops divide the remainder in different proportions. Wheat, oats,
                    potatoes, and rye are grown in the north, and in the south wheat, maize, rye,
                    olives, vines, and melons. The harvest of 1872 yielded 46,410 bushels of wheat,
                    157,385 of rye, 165,800 of oats, and 158,200 of maize; and the value of the
                    total agricultural produce was £950,000. Beech and oak timber (good for
                    shipbuilding), gall-nuts, oak-bark, and cork are also produced. The minerals
                    include coal, alum, quartz, and good building stone. Many of the inhabitants are
                    engaged in a seafaring life, in fishing, and in preparing salt for fishcuring.
                    Shipbuilding, sheep and cattle rearing, and the manufacture of oil, wine, and
                    bricks are also noteworthy industries. The best sorts of wine are made near Capo
                    d’Istria, Muggia, Isola, Parenzo, and Dignano; and the oil of Istria was famous
                    even in Roman times. The trade of the peninsula is unimportant. The roads are
                    fairly numerous, and a railway, lately opened, with a branch to Rovigno,
                    connects Pola with Trieste. Istria is divided into the six government districts
                    of Capo d’Istria, Parenzo, Pisino, Pola, Volosca, and, for the islands, Lussino.
                    The estates of Istria, which meet at Parenzo, consist of 3 bishops, 5
                    representatives of the landed proprietors, 8 representatives of the towns, 12
                    representatives for the other and rural communities, and 2 representatives of
                    the chamber of commerce at Rovigno. Two-thirds of the people are Slavs, although
                    among these there are many differences of dress and dialect. The remaining
                    third, on the coast and in the towns, is almost entirely Italian. The population
                    in 1869 was 254,905, of whom 35,917 belonged to the islands: 278,218 was the
                    official estimate at the end of 1879.</p>
                <p>The modern Istria occupies the same position as the ancient Istria or Histria,
                    known to the Romans as the abode of a fierce tribe of Illyrian pirates. It owed
                    its name to an old belief that the Danube (Ister, in Greek) discharged some of
                    its water by an arm entering the Adriatic in that region. The Istrians,
                    protected by the difficult navigation of their rocky coasts, were only subdued
                    by the Romans in 177 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> after two wars. Under
                    Augustus the greater part of the peninsula was added to Italy, and, when the
                    seat of empire was removed to Ravenna, Istria reaped many benefits from the
                    proximity of the capital. After the fall of the Western empire it was pillaged
                    by the Longobardi and the Goths; it was annexed to the Frankish kingdom by
                    Pippin in 789; and about the middle of the 10th century it fell into the hands
                    of the dukes of Carinthia. Fortune after that, however, led it successively
                    through the hands of the dukes of Meran, the duke of Bavaria, and the patriarch
                    of Aquileia, to the republic of Venice. Under this rule it remained till the
                    peace of Campo Formio in 1797, when Austria acquired it, and added it to the
                    north-eastern part which had fallen to her share so early as 1374. By the peace
                    of Pressburg, Austria was in 1805 compelled to cede Istria to France, and the
                    department of Istria was formed; but in 1813 Austria again seized it, and has
                    retained it ever since. <hi rend="italic">Sαggiο di bibliοgrafa Istriaηa</hi>
