                <p><label type="entry">INNOCENT II</label>., pope from 1130 to 1143, whose family
                    name was Paparesci, his own baptismal name being Gregory, was probably one of
                    the clergy in personal attendance on the antipope Clement III. (Guibert of
                    Ravenna). By Paschal II. he was created cardinal-deacon. In this capacity he
                    accompanied Pope Gelasius II. when driven into France; and by Calixtus II. he
                    was employed on various important missions, such as on that to Worms for
                    concluding the peace concordat with the emperor in 1122, and on that to France
                    in 1123. On February 14, 1130, he was hurriedly chosen to succeed Honorius II.;
                    soon afterwards an opposition asserted itself which issued in the
                    counter-election of Pietro Pierleoni as Pope Anacletus II. Unable to maintain
                    his position in Rome, Innocent took ship for Pisa, and thence sailed by Genoa to
                    France, where the influence of Bernard of Clairvaux readily secured his cordial
                    recognition by the clergy and the court; in October of the same year he was duly
                    acknowledged by Lothaire of Germany and his bishops at the synod of Würzburg. In
                    January 1131 he had also a favourable interview with Henry II. of England; and
                    in August 1132 Lothaire undertook an expedition to Italy for the double purpose
                    of being crowned by the pope, and of setting aside the antipope. The coronation
                    ultimately took place in the Lateran church (June 4,1133), but otherwise the
                    expedition proved abortive. A second expedition by Lothaire in 1136 was not more
                    decisive in its results, and the protracted struggle between the rival pontiffs
                    was terminated only by the death of Anacletus on January 25, 1138. By the
                    Lateran council of 1139, at which Roger of Sicily, Innocent’s most
                    uncompromising foe, was excommunicated, peace was at last restored to the
                    church. The remaining years of this pope’s life were almost as barren of
                    permanent results as the first had been; his efforts to undo the mischief
                    wrought in Rome by the long schism were almost entirely neutralized by a
                    struggle with the town of Tivoli in which he became involved, and by a quarrel
                    with Louis VII. of France, in the course of which that kingdom was laid under an
