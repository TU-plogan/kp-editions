                <p><label type="entry">ISPAHÁN, or <hi rend="smallcaps">Isfahán</hi></label>, a city
                    of Persia, in the province of Irak Adjerni, is situated in 32° 39' N. 1at. and
                    51° 44' E. long. It enjoys the reputation of a very salubrious climate^ except
                    in the autumn, when fevers are prevalent. The following statistics are given by
                    modern authorities; but the condition of the city and its environs is subject to
                    constant change. The city walls—a mere mud curtain ruined in many places—are
                    about 5 miles in circumference. There are some 300 villages, more or less
                    flourishing, in the neighbourhood. In the interior of the city there are
                    reckoned to be sixty mosques (of which about forty are in use), from eighty to a
                    hundred baths, perhaps fifty colleges (which seems, however, far beyond the
                    wants of the population), and twenty caravanserais in a more or less perfect
                    state.</p>

                <p>The public buildings of Ispahan (the best specimens of modern Oriental design and
                    decoration to be found in Persia, or perhaps anywhere in the East) are of two
                    distinct classes—those constructed by Shah Abbas and his successors, and those
                    erected during the present Kajar dynasty. The two great palaces of Shah Abbas
                    the Great are named respectively Chihil-Sutùn (“the forty pillars ”) and Hasht
                    Bihisht (“the eight paradises”). They are surrounded by extensive gardens,
                    traversed by avenues of planes and poplars, and intersected by paved canals of
                    running water, with fountains and reservoirs sparkling in all directions, the
                    whole area being encompassed by a mud wall which is nearly 3 miles in
                    circumference. The buildings themselves are ornamented with gilding and mirrors
                    in every possible variety of arabesque decoration; and large and brilliant
                    pictures of the usual Persian type, representing scenes of Persian history,
                    cover the walls of all the principal apartments and have been ascribed in many
                    instances to Italian and Dutch artists, who are known to have been in the
                    service of Shah Abbas. Attached to these palaces are separate buildings, such as
                    the Amâret-i-Now (or “new edifice”), the Tâlâri-Tavileh (or “hall of the
                    stables”), the Gul-dastah (“bunch of roses ”), and several others, which have
                    been erected in modern times by wealthy courtiers for the convenience of the
                    sovereign, and which are also generally occupied as residences by the European
                    ministers, and by other distinguished travellers who are provided with royal
                    accommodation on their way to the capital. Perhaps the most agreeable residence
                    of all is the Haft Dast (“seven courts”) in the beautiful garden of Sa’adetabâd,
                    on the southern bank of the river, and 2 or 3 miles from the heart of the city.
                    This palace was built by Shah Tahmasp, the successor of Shah Abbas, and until
                    lately was kept in good repair and used as a villa residence by the prince
                    governor. Sir Gore Ouseley resided there with his suite for some months on his
                    deputation to Persia in 1811. The garden of the Chihil-Sutun palace, where Sir
                    Harford Jones’s mission was established in 1809, opens out thr ,ugh the Ali-Kâpi
                    (or “Sublime Porte ”) into the great square or Mydân-i-Shah, the most remarkable
                    feature in the city, and probably the largest square in the world, being 2000
                    feet in length by 700 in breadth. This square is su wounded by a double row of
                    arcades, and formerly resembled a permanent fair; now, however, it is painfully
                    desolate. The corners of the square face the cardinal points, and in the centre
                    of each face is some remarkable building. On the north-west is the Ali-Kâpi,
                    forming the entrance to the royal palace. It is three stories high, and from the
                    summit is obtained a splendid view of Ispahân and the environs. Opposite to the
                    Ali-Kâpi on the south-east side of the square is the famous Mesjid-i-Shah, or
                    “royal mosque,” covered with glazed tiles of unusual brilliancy, and richly
                    decorated with gold and silver ornaments, being by far the handsomest mosque in
                    all Persia; but, as Europeans are not admitted to the interior, it has never
                    been well described. In the centre of the north-east face of the square is the
                    gate entrance to the great bazaar usually called the Kaiserieh, while
                    immediately over the gate, where in Chardin’s time the great Dutch clock with
                    its automatic figures used to excite the admiration of the Ispahânis, the
                    Nokhâra-Khâna, or “trumpet house,” now blares forth its dissonant roar at
                    sunrise and sunset, and on the remaining or south-west side is another sacred
                    building, the mosque of Lutf Ollah, which is only inferior in grandeur and
                    beauty to the Mesjid-i-Shab.</p>
                <p>Among the other notable buildings of Ispahân must be reckoned its colleges and
                    bridges. The Zindeh-rrid or “river of life” rises in Zardehkob, about 90 miles
                    to the west of Ispahân, where some stupendous tunnelling works are yet to be
                    seen, the traces of Shah Abbas’s abortive attempt to turn the Karûn or Shuster
                    stream into the eastern river bed. It flows in a well-cultivated valley through
                    the districts of Châr-mehel and Liujân to the town of Ispahân, passing along the
                    southern outskirts of the city from west to east, and being crossed by three
                    principal bridges. The first, the Pül-i-Châr-bâgh, or, as it is also called, the
                    Pul-i-Julfa, connecting the suburb of Julfa to the south with the stately Char
                    bâgh avenue to the north, consists of a double row of 34 arches, with covered
                    galleries on both sides, and with a roadway, battlemented and paved throughout.
                    It was built by Ali Verdi Khân, one of Shah Abbas’s principal officers. The
                    second bridge, the ΡύΙ-i-Khaju, is on the high road to the south, and is thus
                    much frequented. It is also built with great solidity on a double row of arches,
                    and is kept in excellent repair. The third bridge is smaller and less used. It
                    is named Pùl-i-Sheheristân, from a village of that name to which it leads,
                    forming the north-eastern suburb of the city. The river flows on some 30 miles
                    further to the west, and is there lost in the sand.</p>
                <p>Of the colleges of Ispahân, which are said to be fifty in number, and the greater
                    part of which are still used as educational establishments for the Mahometan
                    priesthood, the most remarkable building is the Medresseh Shah Sultân Hussain,
                    on the right of the avenue leading northwards from the Pûl-i-Khajù. It is thus
                    described by Mr Morier :—</p>
                <p>“Its entrance is handsome. A lofty portico, enriched with fantastically twisted
                    pillars, and intermixed with the beautiful marble of Tabriz, leads through a
                    pair of brazen gates, finished with silver, and their whole surface highly
                    carved and embossed with flowers and verses from the Koran. The gates lead to an
                    elevated semi-dome, which opens at once into the square of the college. The
                    right side of this court is occupied by the mosque, which is still a beautiful
                    building, covered with a cupola and faced with two minarets. The interior of the
                    dome is richly spread with variegated tiles, on which are invocations to the
                    prophet and verses of the Koran in the fullest profusion. The other sides of the
                    square are occupied, one by a lofty and beautiful portico, and the remaining two
                    by rooms for the students, twelve in each front, arranged in two stories. These
                    apartments are little square cells, and seem admirably calculated for
                    study.”</p>
                <p>Another striking feature of Ispahân is the line of covered bazaars, commencing
                    with the Hassanabâd and ending with the Kaiserieh, which extends for nearly 3
                    miles, and divides the city from south to north. The confluence of people in
                    these bazaars is certainly very great, and gives an exaggerated idea of the
                    populousness of the city, the truth being that while the inhabitants congregate
                    for business in these streets, the rest of the city is comparatively deserted
                    (see Morier’s lively description).</p>
                <p>But although Ispahân thus abounds with traces of former grandeur and
                    magnificence, although even now, when surveyed from a commanding height within
                    the city, or in the immediate environs, the enormous extent of mingled garden
                    and building, at least 30 miles in circumference, gives an impression of
                    populousness and busy life, a closer scrutiny reveals that the whole scene is
                    nothing more than a gigantic sham. With the exception of the bazaars and a few
                    scattered hamlets, there is really no continuous inhabited area. Whole streets,
                    whole quarters of the city have fallen into utter ruin, and are absolutely
                    deserted, the traveller who is bent on visiting some of the remarkable sites in
                    the north-western or north-eastern suburbs, such as the ruins of the old fire
                    temple, the remains of the famous castle of Tabarrak, or the shaking minarets of
                    Guladân, having to pass through miles of crumbling mud walls and roofless
                    houses. It is believed indeed that not a twentieth part of the area of the old
                    city is at present peopled, and that the million of inhabitants, reported in the
                    time of Chardin, have now dwindled to about 40,000 souls.</p>
                <p>The Armenian suburb of Julfa, at any rate, which contained a population of 30.000
                    souls in the 17th century, <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit13newyrich/page/n410/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0913-0410-0395"/> is now tenanted by some 300 wretched families,
                    and the Christian churches, which used to number thirteen, and were many of them
                    maintained in great splendour, are now reduced to half a dozen edifices with
                    bare walls and empty benches. At the same time it must be noted that some
                    improvement has recently taken place in the education of the young, and also in
                    their religious teaching, the wealthy Armenians of India having contributed
                    liberally to the national schools, and a Scottish gentleman, Mr Bruce, having
                    been engaged for some years in missionary labours among the ignorant Christian
                    peasantry of Julfa and Feridun.</p>
                <p>The commerce of Ispahan has also greatly fallen off from its former flourishing
                    condition. The manufactures, it is true, for which the city has been long
                    famous, are still to a certain extent carried on; in the bazaars are yet to be
                    found the brocades, satins, and silks of former days, together with calicoes,
                    chintzes, and other cotton goods; tiιe <hi rend="italic">daldls</hi> still hawk
                    about the lacquered boxes, pen-cases, mirror-frames, and book-covers,
                    beautifully painted and ornamented, which are peculiar to Ispahân, while
                    swordblades, damascened gunbarrels, glass, and earthenware continue here and
                    there to be exhibited in the stalls for sale; but the imports, both from India
                    and from the north, have greatly diminished, and this has crippled the demand
                    for native produce. Whether the trade of former days can ever be restored is
                    doubtful. British mercantile houses, established at Bushire, are making great
                    efforts to push on their operations to the northward. Various schemes have been
                    discussed for opening direct communication with the Persian Gulf, either by
                    railway through Shirâz to Bushire, or across the mountains to Shuster on the
                    Karûn, and thence by river steamer to Mohamreh. If the Persian Government can be
                    induced to throw open the navigation of the Karûn to British enterprise, it is
                    probable that an attempt will really be made to connect Shuster and Ispahân by
                    rail, notwithstanding the formidable engineering difficulties to be encountered
                    in crossing the Bakhtiâree mountains; and in that case, as the Indian trade from
                    the south would compete both with the Russian and British trade from the north,
                    in supplying eastern Persia, Ispahân might be expected to derive great benefit
                    from the competition. The position indeed is so favoured by nature and is so
                    conveniently situated in the very focus of the British Indian lines of traffic
                    that in due course of time some improvement may be confidently looked for.</p>
                <p>The Ispahânis have a very poor reputation in Persia either for courage or morals.
                    They are regarded as a clever, but at the same time a dissolute and disorderly
                    community, whose government requires a strong hand and unyielding temper. The
                    <hi rend="italic">looties</hi> indeed of Ispahân are proverbial as the most
                    “rowdy” set of vagabonds in Persia. There is also a good deal of religious
                    fanaticism and party spirit among the lower classes, the city being divided into
                    two factions of Na’amet Ullahi and Hyderi (so called from two famous saints of
                    former days), who reside in the rival quarters of Jubâreh and Deridasht, and are
                    continually coming into collision. The priesthood on the other hand are much
                    respected for their learning and high character, and the decisions of the chief
                    “mujtehid” of Ispahân are considered of more authority even than those of the
                    sheikh-el-Islâm at the capital. The merchants also of Ispahân are a very
                    respectable class, occupied in extensive dealings with India, with Baghdad, and
                    with Constantinople, and rarely, if ever, failing in their engagements.
                    Altogether Ispahân is one of the most interesting cities in the East, exhibiting
                    a genuine picture of active Oriental life.</p>
                <p>The natural advantages of Ispahan—a genial climate, a fertile soil, and abundance
                    of water for irrigation—must have always made it a place of importance. In the
                    most ancient cuneiform documents, referring to a period between 3000 and 2000
                    <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.,</hi> the province of <hi rend="italic">Ansan,</hi>
                    which certainly included Ispahan, was the limit of the geographical knowledge of
                    the Babylonians, typifying the extreme east, as Syria (or <hi rend="italic"
                    >Hαrtu-ki)</hi> typified the west. The two provinces of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Ansan</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Subαrtα,</hi> by which we must understand the
                    country from Ispahan to Shuster, were ruled in those remote ages by the same
                    king, who undoubtedly belonged to the great Turanian family; and from this first
                    notice of Ansan down to the 7th century <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> the
                    region seems to have remained, more or less, dependent on the paramount power of
                    Susa. With regard to the eastern frontier of Ansan, however, ethnic changes were
                    probably in extensive operation during this interval of twenty centuries. The
                    western Iranians, for instance, after separating from their eastern brethren on
                    the Oxus, as early perhaps as 3000 me..must have followed the line of the Elburz
                    mountains, and then bifurcating into two branches must have scattered, westward
                    into Media and southward towards Persia. The first substantial settlement of the
                    southern branch would seem then to have been at Ispahan, where <hi rend="italic"
                    >Jem,</hi> the eponym of the Persian race, is said to have founded a famous
                    castle, the remains of which were visible as late as the 10th century A.n. This
                    castle is known in the Zoroastrian writings as <hi rend="italic">Jem-gird,</hi>
                    but its proper name was <hi rend="italic">Saru</hi> or <hi rend="italic"
                    >Sartik</hi> (given in the Bundahish as <hi rend="italic">Sruzca</hi> or <hi
                    rend="italic">Srοbak∖</hi> and it was especially famous in early Mahometan
                    history as the building where the ancient records and tables of the Persians
                    were discovered which proved of so much use to <hi rend="italic">Abü-Mhshcr</hi>
                    (Albumazar) and his contemporaries. A valuable tradition, proceeding from quite
                    a different source, has also been preserved to the effect that Jem, who invented
                    the original Persian character, “dwelt in Assan, a district of Shuster” (see
                    FliigeΓs <hi rend="italic">Fihrist,</hi> p. 12, 1. 21), which exactly accords
                    with the Assyrian notices of Assan or Ansan classed as a dependency of Elymais.
                    Now it is well known that native legend represented the Persian race to have
                    been held in bondage for a thousand years, after the reign of Jem, by the
                    foreign usurper <hi rend="italic">Zοhak</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Biverasp,</hi>
                    a period which may well represent the duration of Elymaean supremacy over the
                    Aryans of Ansan. At the commencement of the 7th century <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >b.c.</hi> Persia and Ansan are still found in the annals of Sennacherib amongst
                    the tributaries of Elymais, confederated against Assyria; but shortly afterwards
                    the great Susian monarchy, which had lasted for full 2000 years, crumbled away
                    under continued pressure from the west, and the Aryans of Ansan recovered their
                    independence, founding for the first time a national dynasty, and establishing
                    their seat of government at Gabae on the site of the modern city of Ispahan.</p>
                <p>The royal city of Gabae was known as a foundation of the Achaemenidae as late as
                    the time of Strabo, and the inscriptions show that Achaemenes and his successors
                    did actually rule at Ansan until the great Cyrus set out on his career of
                    western victory. Whether the <hi rend="italic">Kdbi</hi> or <hi rend="italic"
                    >Kdvi</hi> of tradition, the blacksmith of Ispahân, who is said to have headed
                    the revolt against Zohâk, took his name from the town of Gabae may be open to
                    question; but it is at any rate remarkable that the national standard of the
                    Persian race, named after the blacksmith, and supposed to have been first
                    unfurled at this epoch, retained the title of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Darafsh·a</hi><hi rend="italic">Κάνάηί</hi> (the banner of Kavi)to the time of
                    the Arab conquest, and that the men of Ispahan were, moreover, throughout this
                    long period, alwaysespeciallydιarged with its protection. The provincial name of
                    Ansan or Assan seems to have been disused in the country after the age of Cyrus,
                    and to have been replaced by that of Gabene or Gabiane, which alone appears in
                    the Greek accounts of the wars of Alexander and his successors, and in the
                    geographical descriptions of Strabo. Gabae or Gavi became gradually corrupted to
                    <hi rend="italic">Jai</hi> during the Sassanian period, and it was thus by the
                    latter name that the old city of Ispahan was generally known at the time of the
                    Arab invasion. Subsequently the title of Jai became replaced by <hi
                    rend="italic">Sheheristdn</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Mcdineh,</hi> “the city” <hi
                    rend="italic">par excellence,</hi> while a suburb which had been founded in the
                    immediate vicinity, and which took the name of <hi rend="italic">Yahudieh,</hi>
                    or the “Jews’ town,” from its original Jewish inhabitants, gradually rose into
                    notice and superseded the old capital.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>The name of Yahudieh or “Jews’ town” is derived by the early
                    Arab geographers from a colony of Jews who are said to have migrated from
                    Babylonia to Ispahan shortly after Nebuchadnezzar’s conquest of Jerusalem, but
                    this is pure fable. The Jewish settlement really dates from the 3d century <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">a.d.,</hi> as is shown by a notice in the Armenian history of
                    Moses of Chorene, lib. iii. cap. 35. The name <hi rend="italic">Ispahan</hi> las
                    been generally compared with the Aspadana of Ptolemy in the extreme north of
                    Persis, and the identification is probably correct. At any rate the title is of
                    great antiquity, being found in the Bundahish, and being derived in all
                    likelihood from the family name of the race of <hi rend="italic">Feridûn,</hi>
                    the <hi rend="italic">Athrnydn</hi> of romance, who were entitled <hi

                    >Yahudieh</hi> are thus in the early ages of Islam described as independent
                    cities, the former being the eastern and the latter the western division of the
                    capital, each surrounded by a separate wall; but about the middle of the 10th
                    century the famous Boide king known as the <hi rend="italic">Rukn-ed-Dowleh</hi>
                    united the two suburbs and many of the adjoining villages in one general
                    enclosure which <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit13newyrich/page/n411/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0913-0411-0396"/> was about 10 miles in circumference. The city,
                    which had now resumed its old name of Ispahan, continued to flourish till the
                    time of Timur (1387 <hi rend="smallcaps">a.d.),</hi> when in common with so many
                    other cities of the empire it suffered grievously at the hands of the Tartar
                    invaders. Timur indeed is said to have erected a <hi rend="italic">Kelleh
                    Mindr</hi> or “skull tower” of 70,000 heads at the gate of the city, as a
                    warning to deter other communities from resisting his arms. The place, however,
                    owing to its natural advantages, gradually recovered from the effects of this
                    terrible visitation, and when the Sefevaean dynasty who succeeded to power in
                    the 16th century, transferred their place of residence to it from Casbin, it
                    rose rapidly in populousness and wealth. It was under Shah Abbas the first, the
                    most illustrious sovereign of this house, that Ispahan attained its greatest
                    prosperity. This monarch adopted every possible expedient, by stimulating
                    commerce, encouraging arts and manufactures, and introducing luxurious habits,
                    to attract visitors to his favourite capital. He built several magnificent
                    palaces in the richest style of Oriental decoration, planted gardens and
                    avenues, and distributed amongst them the waters of the Zindeh-rud in an endless
                    series of reservoirs, fountains, and cascades. The baths, the mosques, the
                    colleges, the bazaars, and the caravanserais of the city received an equal share
                    of his attention, and European artificers and merchants were largely encouraged
                    to settle in his capital. Ambassadors visited his court from many of the first
                    states of Europe, and factories were permanently established for the merchants
                    of England, France, Holland, the Hanseatic towns, Spain, Portugal, and Moscow.
                    The celebrated traveller Chardin, who passed a great portion of his life at
                    Ispahan in the latter half oι the 17th century, has left a detailed and. most
                    interesting account of the statistics of the city at that period. He himself
                    estimated the population at 600,000, though in popular belief the number
                    exceeded a million. There were 1500 flourishing villages in the immediate
                    neighbourhood; the enceinte of the city and suburbs was reckoned at 24 miles,
                    while the mud walls sur rounding the city itself, probably nearly following the
                    lines of the Boide enclosure, measured 20,000 paces. In the interior were
                    counted 162 mosques, 48 public colleges, 1802 caravanserais, 273 baths, and 12
                    cemeteries. The adjoining suburb of Julfa was also a most flourishing place.
                    Originally founded by Shah Abbas the Great, who transported to this locality
                    3400 Armenian families from the town of J ulfa on the Arras, the colony
                    increased rapidly under his-fostering care, both in wealth and in numbers, the
                    Christian population being estimated in 1685 at 30,000 souls. The first blow to
                    the prosperity of modern Ispahan was given by the Afghan invasion at the
                    beginning of the 18th century, since which date, although continuing for some
                    time to be the nominal head of the empire, the city has gradually dwindled in
                    importance, and now only ranks as a second or third rate provincial capital.
                    When the Kajar dynasty indeed mounted the throne of Persia at the end of the
                    last century the seat of government was at once transferred to Teheran, with a
                    view to the support of the royal tribe, whose chief seat was in the neighbouring
                    province of Mazenderan; and, although it has often been proposed, from
                    considerations of state policy in reference to Russia, to re-establish the court
                    at Ispahan, which is the true centre of Persia, the scheme has never commanded
                    much attention. At the same time the government of Ispahan, owing to the wealth
                    of the surrounding districts, has always been much sought after. Early in the
                    century the post was often conferred upon some powerful minister of the court,
                    but in later times it has been usually the apanage of a favourite son or brother
                    of the reigning sovereign. Feth Ali Shah, who had a particular affection for
                    Ispahan, died at that place in 1834, and it is still a time-honoured custom for
                    the monarch on the throne to seek relief from the heat of Teheran by forming a
                    summer camp at the rich pastures of Gan-domân on the skirts of Zardeh-Koh, to
                    the west of Ispahan, for the exercise of his troops and the health and amusement
                    of his courtiers. (H. C. R.)</p>
