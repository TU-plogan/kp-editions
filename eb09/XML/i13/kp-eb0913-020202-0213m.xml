                    its vapour (Zoeιδτ)ς, violet-coloured), one of the so-called halogen elements,
                    has already been partially described (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Chemistry,</hi>
                    vol. v. pp. 490-498).</p>
                <p>Iodides occur in minute quantity in most mineral waters and in sea water. The
                    ashes of many marine algae are rich in them; and formerly iodine was chiefly
                    extracted from kelp or varec, the ashes of sea-weed, by distilling the mother
                    liquor remaining after the separation of the less soluble salts by
                    crystallization with manganese dioxide and sulphuric acid. Of late years,
                    however, large quantities of iodine have been obtained from crude Chili
                    saltpetre by a similar process.</p>
                <p>The chief use of iodine is in the preparation of methyliodide, a substance
                    employed in the manufacture of certain of the so-called aniline dyes. In
                    medicine it is frequently applied externally as an irritant. Potassium iodide is
                    also an important medicinal agent; and iodoform, CHI <hi rend="subscript">
                    3</hi>, a substance prepared by acting on alcohol with iodine in presence of
                    alkali, has latterly been introduced as an agent for external application in
                    certain diseases. Several iodides, especially ammonium, cadmium, and potassium
                    iodide, are largely employed in photography.</p>
                <p>Recent investigations have disclosed a number of most remarkable facts regarding
                    the behaviour of iodine, and the allied elements bromine and chlorine, which
                    merit a brief description here. Free chlorine, bromine, and iodine are
                    respectively represented by the formulae Cl <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi>, Br <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 2</hi>, and I <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi>; that is to say,
                    their molecules are <hi rend="italic">“diatomic</hi>,” each consisting of two
                    atoms (comp. voL v. pp. 467-472). On the other hand, the molecules of which
                    sulphur vapour at a temperature of about 500° C. consists are hexatomic, as
                    expressed by the formula S <hi rend="subscript"> 6</hi>; but on raising the
                    temperature these molecules undergo simplification, so that at temperatures
                    above 800° the vapour appears to consist entirely of diatomic molecules such as
                    are indicated by the formula S <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi>. It would seem that
                    the halogens undergo a similar molecular simplification when heated.</p>
                <p>Having devised a method of extreme simplicity for the determination of vapour
                    density, V. Meyer was led in the summer of 1879 to determine the density of a
                    number of elementary bodies at much higher temperatures than had previously been
                    employed, and among others chlorine was examined. He was then led (in
                    conjunction with C. Meyer) to the discovery that at high temperatures this gas
                    has a very much lower density than corresponds to the formula Cl <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 2</hi><hi rend="italic">{Berichte der deutschen chemischen
                    Gesellschaft zu Berlin,</hi> 1879, p. 1430; comp. <hi rend="italic">ibid,</hi>
                    1880, p. 1172). Subsequently he extended his observations to bromine and iodine
                    <hi rend="italic">(ibid.,</hi> 1880, p. 394), and with similar results. Meier
                    and Crafts took up the subject with the object of verifying V. Meyer’s
                    statements <hi rend="italic">(ibid.,</hi> 1880, p. 851); they introduced several
                    refinements in the method of operating, and determined the temperatures at which
                    the experiments were made more accurately; in the main, however, their
                    observations with iodine were confirmatory of V. Meyer’s. V. Meyer’s original

                <p>Meier and Crafts were of opinion that the highest temperature they employed was
                    probably as high as that estimated by V. Meyer at 1570°, and the latter chemist
                    subsequently acknowledged the justice of their criticism of his determinations
                    of temperature, which were conducted by a calorimetric method, whereas Meier and
                    Crafts employed an air thermometer. V. Meyer has since extended his observations
                    to a still higher temperature, and has obtained the values 4 <hi
                    rend="superscript"> ,</hi> 53, 4 ’ 55, 4 ’ 57, which are not far removed from
                    the theoretical value 4 <hi rend="superscript"> -</hi> 39, corresponding to the
                    formula I for the iodine molecule <hi rend="italic">(op. cit.,</hi> 1880, p.
                    1010).</p>
                <p>An important series of observations by Meier and Crafts <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Comptes Pendus,</hi> xcii. 39) on the density of iodine at various
                    temperatures under various pressures show that at temperature below 700° and
                    pressures below atmospheric pressure the density is constant, and corresponds to
                    the formula I <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi>, and that the density diminishes more
                    rapidly with rise of temperature.</p>
                <p>From the earlier results obtained by Meier and Crafts, A. Naumann has calculated
                    the rate of dissociation of iodine, on the assumption that the decomposition is
                    expressed by the equation I <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> = I +1, and has shown
                    that it is in accordance with the general law of dissociation deduced from the
                    dynamical theory of gases. He points out as especially remarkable that
                    dissociation probably extends over 1200°, since it is only half completed at a
                    temperature of about 1270°, and commences at least 600° lower.</p>
                <p>The observations of Meier and Crafts indicate that the density of iodine begins
                    to be abnormal at a temperature between 600° and 700°. The dissociation of
                    bromine apparently does not commence at so low a temperature, and at a
                    temperature at which the ratio of the observed to the theoretical density is <hi
                    rend="superscript"> ,</hi> 66 for iodine, it is <hi rend="superscript"> -</hi> 8
                    for bromine. Chlorine is much less readily dissociated than bromine. These
                    results are in accordance with the general chemical behaviour of the halogens.
                    It has yet to be proved, however, that the dissociation is of the character
                    indicated above, and that the molecules of the halogens do not undergo a less
                    simple decomposition such as is contemplated in Sir Benjamin Brodie’s calculus
                    of chemical operations. <hi rend="smallcaps">(h. e. a.)</hi></p>
