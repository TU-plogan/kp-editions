                    or similar materials. The term includes two distinct conditions of pigment or
                    colouring matter :—the one fluid, and prepared for use with a pen or brush, as
                    writing ink; the other a glutinous adhesive mass, printing ink, used for
                    transferring to paper impressions from types, engraved plates, and other like
                    surfaces. The latter class may be more properly dealt with under <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Lithography</hi> and <hi rend="smallcaps">Printing</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">(q.v.).</hi></p>
                <p>Writing inks are fluid substances which contain colouring matter either in
                    solution or in suspension, and very commonly partly in both conditions. They may
                    be prepared in all shades of colour, and contain in their composition almost
                    every pigment which can be dissolved or suspended in a suitable medium; but by
                    far the most important of all varieties is black ink, after which red and blue
                    are the colours most commonly employed. Other colours are only occasionally
                    employed; but apart from colour there are special qualities which recommend
                    certain inks for limited applications, such as marking inks, ineradicable ink,
                    sympathetic ink, &amp;c.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Blade Ink.—</hi> Among the qualities which should characterize
                    a good black ink for ordinary purposes, the following are important. It should
                    continue limpid, and flow freely and uniformly from the pen; it should not throw
                    down a thick sludgy deposit on exposure to the air; nor should a coating of
                    mould form on its surface. It should yield distinctly legible characters
                    immediately on writing, which ought to become a deep blue-black, not fading or
                    decaying with age; and the fluid ought to penetrate into the paper without
                    spreading, so that the characters will neither wash out nor be readily removed
                    by erasure. Further, it is desirable that ink should be non-poisonous, that it
                    should as little as possible corrode steel pens, that characters traced in it
                    should dry readily on the application. of blotting paper without smearing, and
                    that the writing should not present a glossy varnished appearance. To obtain
                    these characteristics is the chief object of the ink manufacturer; and upon the
                    whole they have hitherto been found best combined in ink prepared from galls, or
                    other sources of tannin, and a salt of iron, with the addition of some colouring
                    matter. Such a compound indeed forms the staple black ink of commerce, which is
                    essentially a ferroso-ferric gallate in extremely fine division held in
                    suspension in water.</p>
                <p>The essential ingredients of this ordinary black ink arefirst, tannin-yielding
                    bodies, for which Aleppo or Chinese galls are the only eligible materials;
                    second, a salt of iron, the ferrous sulphate (green vitriol) being alone
                    employed; and third, a gummy or mucilaginous agent to keep in suspension the
                    insoluble tinctorial matter of the ink. For ink-making the tannin, from whatever
                    source obtained, has first to be transformed into gallic acid; and, as has been
                    shown by Viedt, in the case of Aleppo galls that change takes place by
                    fermentation when the solution of the galls is exposed to the air, the tannin
                    splitting up into gallic acid and sugar (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Gallic
                    Acid,</hi> vol. x. p. 41). Chinese galls, which formerly were considered
                    unsuitable for the manufacture of ink, do not contain the ferment necessary for
                    inducing this change; and therefore to induce the process yeast must be added to
                    their solution. To-prepare a solution of Aleppo galls for ink-making, the galls
                    are coarsely powdered, and intimately mixed with chopped straw. This mixture is
                    thrown into a narrow deep oak vat, provided with a perforated false bottom, and
                    having a tap at the bottom for drawing off liquid. Over the mixture is poured
                    lukewarm water, which, percolating down, extracts and carries with it the tannin
                    of the galls. The solution is drawn off and repeatedly run through the mixture
                    to extract the whole of the tannin, the quantity of water used being in such
                    proportion to the galls as will produce as nearly as possible a solution having
                    5 per cent, of tannin. The object of using straw in the extraction process is to
                    maintain the porosity of the mixture, as powdered galls treated alone become so
                    slimy with mucilaginous extract that liquid fails to percolate the mass. For
                    each litre of the 5 per cent, solution about 45 grammes of the iron salt are
                    used, or about 100 parts of tannin for 9 ’ 0 parts of crystallized green
                    vitriol. These ingredients when first mixed form a clear solution, but on their
                    exposure to the air oxidation occurs, and an insoluble blue-black ferroso-ferric
                    gallate in extremely fine division, suspended in a coloured solution of ferrous
                    gallate, is formed. To keep the insoluble portion suspended, a mucilaginous
                    agent is employed, and that most available is gum Senegal. An ink so prepared
                    develops its intensity of colour only after some exposure; and after it has
                    partly sunk into the paper it becomes oxidized there, and so mordanted into the
                    fibre. But, as the first faintness of the characters is a disadvantage, it is a
                    common practice to add some adventitious colouring matter to give immediate
                    distinctness, and for that purpose either extract of logwood or a solution of
                    indigo is used. When logwood extract is employed, a smaller proportion of
                    extract of galls is required, from the fact that logwood itself contains a large
                    percentage of tannin. Black ink in which the provisional colouring matter is
                    indigo was introduced about the year 1856, under the name alizarin ink, although
                    the substance alizarin has nothing whatever to do with the preparation. The
                    indigo for this ink is dissolved in strong sulphuric acid, and the ferrous
                    sulphate, instead of being used direct, is prepared by placing in this indigo
                    solution a proper quantity of scrap' iron. In order to free the solution from
                    excess of uncombined acid, chalk or powdered limestone is added, whereby the
                    free acid is fixed and a deposit of sulphate of lime formed. A solution so
                    prepared, mixed with a tannin solution, yields a very limpid sea-green writing
                    fluid, and as all the constituents remain in solution, no gum or other
                    suspending medium is necessary. In consequence the ink flows freely, is easily
                    dried, and is free from the glossy <pb break="no"

                    C. H. Viedt of Brunswick, who has written very exhaustively on all kinds of ink,
                    gives the following as the standard ingredients of these three varieties of
                    ink:—</p>

                <p>On long exposure to air, as in inkstands, or otherwise, all these varieties of
                    ink gradually become thick and ropy, depositing a slimy sediment. This change on
                    exposure is inevitable, resulting as it does from the gradual and at the same
                    time essential oxidation of the ferrous compound, and it can only be retarded by
                    permitting access of air to as small surfaces as possible. The inks also have a
                    tendency to become mouldy, an evil which may be obviated by the use of a minute
                    proportion of carbolic acid; or, should that body be objectionable on account of
                    its smell, salicylic acid may be used.</p>
                <p>Under the name of chrome ink a black ink was discovered and prepared by the
                    chemist Runge, which held out the promise of cheapness combined with many
                    excellent qualities. It is prepared by dissolving 15 parts of extract of logwood
                    in 900 parts of water, to which 4 parts of crystallized sodic carbonate are
                    added. A further solution of 1 part of chromate (not bichromate) of potassium in
                    100 parts of water is prepared, and is added very gradually to the other
                    solution with constant agitation. Thereby is obtained an ink which possesses an
                    intense blue-black colour, which flows freely and dries readily, which being
                    neutral in reaction does not corrode steel pens, and which so adheres to and
                    sinks into paper that manuscripts written with it may be freely washed with a
                    sponge without danger of smearing or spreading. It forms a good copying ink, and
                    in short it possesses all the qualities essential to the best ink; but
                    unfortunately on exposure to air it very readily undergoes decomposition, the
                    colouring matter separating in broad flakes, which swim in a clear menstruum. It
                    is affirmed by Viedt that this drawback may be overcome by the use of soda, a
                    method first suggested by Böttger.</p>
                <p>Logwood forms the principal ingredient in various other black inks which are now
                    much used, especially as copying ink. A very strong decoction of logwood or a
                    strong solution of the extract with ammonia-alum yields a violet· ink which
                    darkens slowly on exposure. Such an ink is costly, however, on account of the
                    concentrated condition in which the logwood must be used. If, however, a
                    metallic salt is introduced, a serviceable ink is obtained with the expenditure
                    of much less logwood. Either sulphate of copper or sulphate of iron may be used,
                    but the former, which produces a pleasing blue-black colour, is to be preferred.
                    The following is the formula most highly recommended for this ink. A clear
                    solution of 20 kilos of extract of logwood in 200 litres of water is obtained,
                    to which is added, with agitation, 10 kilos of ammonia-alum dissolved in 20
                    litres of boiling water. The solution is acidified with 0 <hi rend="superscript"
                    > ,</hi> 2 kilo of sulphuric acid, which has the effect of preventing any
                    deposit, and finally there is added a solution of 1 ’ 5 kilos of sulphate of
                    copper dissolved in 20 litres of water. This compound is exposed to the air for
                    a few days to allow the colour to develop by oxidation, after which it is stored
                    in well-corked bottles. The acid condition of this ink has a corrosive influence
                    on steel pens; but in all other respects it is a most valuable writing
                    fluid.</p>
                <p>A black ink under the name of nigrosin is prepared from a soluble aniline colour,
                    which, although not producing a black so intense as common ink, is possessed of
                    various advantages. Being perfectly neutral, it does not attack pens; it can
                    easily be kept of a proper consistency by making up with water; and its colour
                    is not injuriously affected by the action of acids.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Copying Ink.—</hi> Ink which yields by means of pressure an im.
                    pression, on a sheet of damped tissue paper, of characters written in it is
                    called copying ink. Any ink soluble in water, or which retains a certain degree
                    of solubility, may be used as copying ink. Runge’s chrome ink, being a soluble
                    compound, is, therefore, so available; and the other logwood inks as well as the
                    ordinary ferrous gallate inks contain also soluble constituents, and indeed are
                    essentially soluble till they are oxidized in and on the paper after exposure to
                    the air. To render these available as copying inks it is only necessary to add
                    to them a substance which will retard the oxidizing effect of the air for some
                    time. For this purpose the bodies most serviceable are gum arabic or Senegal,
                    with glycerin, dextrin, or sugar, which last, however, has the disadvantage of
                    rendering the ink sticky. These substances act by forming a kind of glaze or
                    varnish over the surface of the ink which excludes the air. At the same time
                    when the damp sheet of tissue paper is applied to the writing they dissolve and
                    allow a portion of the yet soluble ink to be absorbed by the moistened tissue.
                    As copying ink has to yield two or more impressions, it is necessary that it
                    should be made stronger, <hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> that it should contain
                    more pigment or body than common ink. It, therefore, is prepared with from 30 to
                    40 per cent, less of water than non-copying kinds; but otherwise, except in the
                    presence of the ingredients above alluded to, the inks are quite the same.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Red Ink.—</hi> The pigment most commonly employed as the basis
                    of red ink is Brazil-wood, a dye-stuff which yields a good durable ink. Such an
                    ink is prepared by adding to a strong decoction of the wood a proportion of
                    stannous chloride (tin spirits), and thickening the resulting fluid with gum
                    arabic. In some instances alum and cream of tartar are used instead of the
                    stannous chloride. Cochineal is also employed as the tinctorial basis of red
                    ink; but, while the resulting fluid is much more brilliant than that obtained
                    from Brazilwood, it is not quite so permanent. A very brilliant red ink may be
                    prepared by dissolving carmine in a solution of caustic ammonia, but it is
                    necessary to keep this preparation in closely stoppered bottles. A useful red
                    ink may also be made by dissolving the rosein of Brooke, Simpson, and Spiller in
                    water, in the proportion of 1 to from 150 to 200 parts.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Blue Ink.—</hi> For the production of blue ink the pigment
                    principally used is Prussian blue. To render this colour soluble in water it is
                    first digested for two or three days with either strong hydrochloric acid,
                    sulphuric acid, or nitric acid, the digested mass is next very largely diluted
                    with water, and after settling the supernatant liquid is siphoned away from the
                    sediment. This sediment is repeatedly washed, till all traces of iron and free
                    acid disappear from the water used, after which it is dried and mixed with
                    oxalic acid in the proportion of 8 parts of Prussian blue to 1 of the acid, and
                    in this condition the material is ready for dissolving in water to the degree of
                    colour intensity necessary. An aniline blue ink may be prepared by dissolving 1
                    part of bleu de Paris in from 200 to 250 parts of water.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">China ink</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Indian ink</hi> is the form
                    in which ink was earliest prepared, and in which it is still made and used in
                    China and Japan for writing with small brushes instead of pens. It is
                    extensively used by architects, engineers, and artists generally, and for
                    various special uses. China ink is prepared in the form of sticks and cakes,
                    which are rubbed down in water for use. It consists essentially of lamp-black in
                    very fine condition, baked up with a glutinous substance; and the finer Oriental
                    kinds are delicately perfumed. The following description of the manufacture as
                    conducted in Japan is from a native source :—“The body of the ink is soot
                    obtained from pine wood or rosin, and lamp-black from sesamum oil for the finest
                    sort. This is mixed with liquid glue made of ox skin. This operation is effected
                    in a large round copper bowl, formed of two spherical calottes, placed 1 inch
                    apart, so that the space between can be filled up with hot water to prevent the
                    glue from hardening during the time it is being mixed by hand with the
                    lamp-black. The cakes are formed in wooden moulds, and dried between paper and
                    ashes. Camphor, or a peculiar mixture of scents which comes from China, and a
                    small quantity of carthamine (the red colouring substance of safflower), are
                    added to the best kinds for improving the colour as well as for scenting the
                    ink. There is a great difference both in price and in quality of the various
                    kinds of ink, the finest article being rather costly.” It is said that the size
                    used in Chinese kinds is of vegetable origin.</p>

                <p><hi rend="italic">Marking Ink.—</hi> The ink so called, used principally for
                    marking linen, is composed of a salt of silver, usually the nitrate, dissolved
                    in water and ammonia, with a little provisional colouring matter and gum for
                    thickening. The colour resulting from the silver salt is developed by heat and
                    light; and the stain it makes, although exceedingly obstinate, gradually becomes
                    a faint brownish-yellow. The following yields a good marking ink. Equal parts of
                    nitrate of silver and dry tartaric acid are triturated in a mortar, and treated
                    with water, when a reaction takes place, resulting in the formation of tartrate
                    of silver and the liberation of nitric acid. The acid is neutralized, and at the
                    same time the silver tartrate is dissolved by the addition of ammonia, and this
                    solution with colouring matter and gum forms the ink, which may be used with an
                    ordinary steel pen.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Gold</hi> and <hi rend="italic">silver inks</hi> are writing
                    fluids in which gold and silver, or imitations of these metals, are suspended in
                    a state of fine division. In place of gold, Dutch leaf or mosaic gold is
                    frequently substituted, and bronze powders are also used for preparing a similar
                    kind of ink. The metallic foil is first carefully triturated into a fine paste
                    with honey, after which it is boiled in water containing a little alkali, and
                    then repeatedly washed in hot water and dried at a gentle heat. A solution is
                    prepared consisting of 1 part of pure gum arabic and 1 part of soluble potash
                    glass in 4 parts of distilled water, into which the requisite quantity of the
                    metallic powder prepared as above is introduced. Owing to the superior covering
                    nature of pure gold, less of the metal is required than is necessary in the case
                    of silver and other foils; but the proportion varies according to the colour and
                    condition of the surface upon which the ink is to be used. In general 1 part of
                    foil to 3 or 4 parts of solution is sufficient. The metallic lustre of writing
                    done with this solution may be greatly heightened by gently polishing with a
                    burnishing point.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Indelible</hi> or <hi rend="italic">incorrodible ink</hi> is
                    the name given to various combinations of lamp-black or other carbonaceous
                    material with resinous substances used for writing which is exposed to the
                    .weather or to the action of strong acids or alkaline solutions. An ink having
                    great resisting powers may be conveniently prepared by rubbing down Indian ink
                    in common ink till the mixture flows easily from the pen. Other combinations
                    have more the character of coloured varnishes.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Sympathetic inks</hi> are preparations used for forming
                    characters which only become visible on the application of heat or of some
                    chemical reagent. Many chemicals which form in themselves colourless solutions,
                    but which develop colour under the influence of reagents, may be used as
                    sympathetic ink, but they are all of little practical utility. Characters
                    written in a weak solution of galls develop a dark colour on being treated with
                    a solution of copperas; or, <hi rend="italic">vice versa,</hi> the writing may
                    be done in copperas and developed by the galls solution. Writing done in various
                    preparations develops colour on heating which fades as the paper cools. Among
                    such substances are solutions of the acetate and the chloride of cobalt and of
                    the chloride of nickel. Very dilute solutions of the mineral acids and of common
                    salt and a solution of equal parts of sulphate of copper and sal-ammoniac act
                    similarly. Characters traced in a weak solution of nitrate of silver darken on
                    exposure to light, and terchloride of gold solution develops a purple colour on
                    exposure. (J. PA. )</p>
