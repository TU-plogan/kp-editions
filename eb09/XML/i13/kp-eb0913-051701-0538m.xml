                    The island consists of two mountain masses, connected by a narrow’ isthmus of
                    hills, and separated by a wide inlet of the sea known as the Gulf of Molo. The
                    northern and greater mass culminates in the heights of Anoi (2066 feet), and the
                    southern in Hagios Stephanos, or Mount Marovugli (2135 feet). Vathy (Bα0υ), the
                    chief town and port of the island, lies at the northern foot of Mount Stephanos,
                    its whitewashed houses stretching for about a mile round the deep bay in the
                    Gulf of Molo, to which it owes its name <hi rend="italic">(cf.</hi> Dieppe and
                    such Dutch names as Hollands Diep). As there are only one or two small stretches
                    of arable land in Ithaca, the inhabitants are dependent on commerce for their
                    grain supply; and olive oil, wine, and currants are the principal products
                    obtained by the cultivation of the thin stratum of soil that covers the
                    calcareous rocks. Goats are fed in considerable number on the brushwood pasture
                    of the hills; and hares (in spite of Aristotle’s supposed assertion of their
                    absence) are exceptionally abundant. The island is divided into four
                    districts:—Vathy, Aeto (or Eagle’s Cliff), Anoge (Anoi) or Upland, and Exoge
                    (Exoi) or Outland.</p>
                <p>The name Ithaca (Iτthcη), like Utica, has been explained by pl∏V, a “colony,”
                    which would point to a Phoenician connexion. It has remained attached to the
                    island from the very earliest times with but little interruption of the
                    tradition; though in Brompton’s travels (12th century) and in the old Venetian
                    maps we find it called Fale or Vai de Compar, and at a later date it not
                    unfrequently appears as Little Cephalonia. This last name indicates the general
                    character of Ithacan history (if history it can be called) in modern and indeed
                    in ancient times; for the fame of the island is almost solely due to its
                    position in the Homeric story of Ulysses. Ithaca, according to the Homeric epos,
                    was the royal seat and residence of King Ulysses, and within its narrow limits
                    lies the scene of much of the poem. The island is incidentally described with no
                    small variety of detail, picturesque and topographical; but the very apparent
                    definiteness of the description has rendered the process of identification
                    peculiarly perplexing, and the coincidences between the Ithaca of the <hi
                    rend="italic">Odyssey</hi> and the Ithaca of the present day are sometimes as
                    puzzling as the points of disagreement. The phraseology in which the position of
                    the island is indicated is of doubtful interpretation, and the important word
                    <hi rend="italic">χθαμαλή</hi> would have naturally been rendered “low-lying” if
                    stress of present fact had not forced the commentators to find or fancy such
                    significations as “with low shores” (the shores after all being rather unusually
                    high ) or “slanting downwards.” The Homeric localities for which counterparts
                    have been sought are Mount Neritos, Mount Neion, the harbour of Phorcys, the
                    town and palace of Ulysses, the fountain of Arethusa, the cave of the Naiads,
                    the stalls of the swineherd Eumaeus, the orchard of Laertes, and the Korax or
                    Raven Cliff. The master site may be said to be that of the town; and several of
                    the minor points may be at once dismissed as hopeless of all certainty of
                    recognition. Among the “identificationists” there are two schools, one placing
                    the town at Polis on the west coast in the northern half of the island (Leake,
                    Gladstone, &amp;c. ), and the other at Aeto on the isthmus. The latter site,
                    which was advocated by Sir William Gell <hi rend="italic">{Topography and
                    Antiquities of Ithaca,</hi> London, 1807), has received a great accession to its
                    probability as opposed to the rival theory by the excavations of Dr Schliemann
                    carried on in 1873 and 1878 (see Schliemann, <hi rend="italic">Ithaque, le
                    Péloponnèse, Troie,</hi> Paris, 1869, also published in German; his letter to
                    <hi rend="italic">TheTimes,</hi> September 26, 1878; and the author’s life
                    prefixed to <hi rend="italic">Ilios,</hi> London, 1880). He. found that the
                    valley called Polis or city has never been the site of a town, and that the
                    apparent ruins on a neighbouring height supposed to be the acropolis are really
                    a group of castellated rocks. Remains of Cyclopean structures at the spot known
                    as Homer’s school (a name of the most modern origin) were the only evidence in
                    favour of the existence of a town in the northern part of the island. On the
                    ridge of Mount Aeto, on the other hand, he found vast Cyclopean walls built of
                    stones even larger than those of Mycenae and Tiryns; and within the area which
                    they enclose there may have been, he calculates, 2000 houses similar to those
                    which he actually made out to the number of 190. Fragments of pottery of a
                    Trojan type, of tiles with impressed ornaments, and of a curious handmill were
                    the only relics of the former inhabitants. “In the south-eastern extremity of
                    the island are a number of rooms like stables, averaging 35 feet in length and
                    10 feet in breadth, partly rock-cut, partly formed by Cyclopean walls of very
                    huge rudely wrought stones, and in their immediate vicinity thousands of very
                    common but most ancient potsherds.” Mr Buubury <hi rend="italic">{Hist. of
                    Ancient Geography,</hi> vol. i. p. 83) is disposed to consider this evidence
                    conclusive as to the site of the capital.</p>
