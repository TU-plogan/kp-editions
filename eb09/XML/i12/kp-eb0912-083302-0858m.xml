                    and 37° N. lat, and the meridians of 17° and 23° W. long, of Washington (94° and
                    100° W. of Greenwich). It is bounded N. by Kansas, E. by Missouri and Arkansas,
                    and S. and W. by Texas. The area is estimated approximately at 69,000 square
                    miles. The eastern portion is fertile and well watered, having an annual
                    rainfall of 40 to 50 inches, and a mean annual temperature of about 60° Fahr.
                    The surface is mainly rolling prairie, with broad stretches of rich land along
                    the streams, and an abundance of timber. This section of the territory is
                    separated from the western part, which presents a different aspect, by a broad
                    belt of forest, known as the “Cross Timbers,” which extends nearly across the
                    territory in a north and south direction, marking the outcrop of the
                    Carboniferous formation. Its breadth ranges from 40 to 60 miles.</p>
                <p>West of this singular strip of forest the country assumes the appearance of the
                    “Great Plains,”—that long incline which stretches eastward from the base of the
                    Rocky Mountains. The surface is a monotonous, rolling, treeless expanse. The
                    valleys are shallow, and the dividing ridges are broad and slightly marked. The
                    climate is comparatively dry, the average annual rainfall being but 20 to 25
                    inches; and irrigation is needed for the successful cultivation of most crops.
                    The mean annual temperature is somewhat<pb break="no"

                    this regard between summer and winter, day and night, becomes much more marked.
                    Timber is found only in the river valleys, on the faces of bluffs, and among the
                    hills.</p>
                <p>The generally level surface of prairies and plains is broken in the southern and
                    south-eastern parts of the territory by ranges and groups of hills, which rise
                    from a few hundred to 1500 feet above the surrounding country. These hills,
                    known as the San Bois Hills, Shawnee Hills, Wichita Mountains, &amp;c., form a
                    part of the Ozark Mountains, which extend eastward over into Missouri and
                    Arkansas.</p>
                <p>The principal rivers of the territory are the Arkansas with its branches, the
                    Neosho, the Salt and Red Forks, and the Canadian, with its North Fork, and, in
                    the southern part of the territory, the Red River, which forms the boundary with
                    Texas, and its branch, the Washita. All these are of little or no importance as
                    regards navigation. The eastern part of the territory is well watered, but the
                    western part, except at times of flood, in late spring and early summer, has few
                    flowing streams.</p>
                <p>The geology of the region is very imperfectly known, as no survey has been made,
                    with the exception of two or three hasty reconnaissances. The general outline of
                    the distribution of geological formations is as follows. The eastern third of
                    the territory is occupied by the Carboniferous formation. In the south-eastern
                    corner, near Red River, it is covered by the Cretaceous. In the eastern portion
                    there are several outcrops of granite, marking the location of groups of the
                    Ozark Hills. The western two-thirds of the territory are covered by Triassic and
                    Jurassic beds, with the exception of the granite mass of the Wichita mountains.
                    The mineral resources are almost totally unknown. It is highly probable that the
                    territory contains extensive deposits of coal, and it is very possible that the
                    precious metals may be found in the Ozark Hills.</p>
                <p>The fauna and flora partake of the double character of the surface and climate.
                    In the eastern part they tend toward subtropical types, while the western
                    portion presents forms more or less peculiar to the arid plains. In the eastern
                    part deer, and brown and black bears, are quite abundant, except in the
                    neighbourhood of settlements; and wild turkeys are plentiful. In the western
                    part antelopes and bison are the principal large game; wild horses are still
                    occasionally met with; and various species of grouse, sage hens, owls,
                    rattlesnakes, gophers, and prairie dogs are abundant. The vegetation of the
                    eastern part is profuse, especially in the bottom lands. The forests present a
                    great variety of species very similar to those found throughout the lower
                    Mississippi valley; among them are several species of oak and pine, cypress, red
                    cedar, black walnut, gum tree, &amp;c. Among the wild fruits, which also present
                    much variety, are plums, persimmons, grapes, &amp;c. On the plains of the
                    western part of the territory the principal natural productions are the grasses
                    which, growing in tufts or bunches, are known collectively as bunch or buffalo
                    grass. While this is the prevailing growth, in the more desert localities its
                    place is usurped more or less by artemisia, cactus, and yucca.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Inhabitants.—</hi> Besides the Indians who originally inhabited
                    this territory, the United States Government has from time to time moved thither
                    entire tribes or parts of tribes, from more or less distant portions of the
                    country, assigning to each tribe a definite area or “reservation.” The
                    immigrants now outnumber very largely the original occupants of the soil. The
                    reservation is, to a certain extent, a prison-house. An Indian is not allowed to
                    leave it without a pass from the agent; nor are whites allowed to settle on it,
                    or even to visit it. Exception is made, however, in the case of white mon who
                    marry Indian women. In the case of most of the tribes, the Government holds in
                    trust funds belonging to them derived from the sale of their original land. The
                    income from these funds is paid in the form of subsistence and clothing, live
                    stock, and tools. An agent is appointed for each tribe or group of tribes, for
                    the purpose of regulating its relations with the Government, and of providing
                    and issuing these supplies. With few exceptions, the Indians still retain the
                    tribal organization, although, with their progress in civilization, their forms
                    of self-government have undergone some changes. The five civilized tribes have,
                    besides the principal and the subordinate chiefs, a council, which corresponds
                    in many respects to the legislature of a State. They also have simple codes of
                    laws, and courts to enforce them. The territory has no representation in the
                    national government. For the enforcement of United States laws it is attached to
                    the western judicial district of Arkansas.</p>
                <p>It is difficult to obtain correct estimates of the number of Indians in. the
                    territory, as many of them lead a wandering life. No accurate census has been
                    taken, and the only data available are the estimates made by the Indian agents.
                    The report of Indian affairs for 1879 contains the estimates given in the
                    following table, which also shows the areas of the different reservations :—</p>

                    living in the territory is very small, consisting almost exclusively of the

                    considerable advance in civilization. All the members of the above tribes wear
                    the ordinary dress, live in houses, and are engaged in civilized pursuits. Their
                    occupations are almost entirely farming and stock-raising, principally the
                    former. They support schools, which are attended by a large proportion of the
