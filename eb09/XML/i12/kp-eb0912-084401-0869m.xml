                <p><label type="entry">INDIUM</label>, a metal discovered with the aid of the
                    spectroscope in 1863 by Reich and Richter when testing certain specimens of
                    Freiberg zinc-blende for thallium. Instead of the brilliant green line
                    characteristic of this latter metal, they observed an intense indigo-blue line
                    occupying a position different from that of any known line, and were thus at
                    once led to suspect the presence of a previously unknown element. The name
                    indium was chosen for the metal, when they succeeded in isolating it, on account
                    of this circumstance. It has since been detected in blendes from various
                    sources, but always in extremely minute amount, and still remains one of the
                    rarest of the elements. Indium is best prepared from crude zinc made from
                    indium-containing blendes. As it is less positive than zinc, if the crude zinc
                    is treated with insufficient hydrochloric acid to dissolve it completely, a
                    residue is obtained containing all the indium together with several other metals
                    also present in small quantity in the zinc. The properties of indium have
                    already been partially described (vol. v. p. 533). Its flame spectrum exhibits,
                    besides the indigo-blue line (w. 1. 4509), a violet line of w. 1. 4101. Lockyer
                    has stated <hi rend="italic">{Royal Society Proceedings,</hi> 1878, xxviii. p.
                    177) that the strongest line in photographs of the spectrum of indium in the
                    electric arc is, as already recorded by Thalén, the <hi rend="italic">h</hi>
                    line of hydrogen, the hydrogen line near G being, however, absent. He argues
                    that this is not to be explained by the supposition that the indium contains
                    occluded hydrogen, since none of the hydrogen lines become impressed on the
                    plate when palladium-hydrogen is volatilized in the arc. Indium is commonly
                    regarded as closely allied to aluminium, on account of the general resemblance
                    of corresponding compounds of the two metals, and especially on account of the
                    existence of an indium alum isomorphous with ordinary <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0912-0870-0845"/> alum. Hence indium chloride is usually
                    represented by the formula In <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> Cl <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 6</hi>, the formula of aluminium chloride being Al <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 2</hi> Cl <hi rend="subscript"> 6</hi>. V. and C. Meyer have
                    recently found, however, that the density of its vapour at a bright red heat
                    corresponds with the formula InCl <hi rend="subscript"> 3</hi>, indicating that
                    indium is a <hi rend="italic">triad</hi> and not a <hi rend="italic">tetrad</hi>
                    like aluminium and iron. Aluminium and iron (ferric) chloride boil readily at a
                    temperature below that at which sulphur or mercury boil, but indium chloride
                    does not volatilize in the vapour of perchlorodiphenyl, which boils considerably
                    above 440° C., and only slowly sublimes in the vapour of phosphorus
                    pentasulphide (b.p. 530°). It evaporates by no means rapidly at a dull red heat,
                    but is momentarily converted into vapour at a bright red heat, furnishing a gas
                    which behaves normally. It is noteworthy that aluminium chloride decomposes
                    entirely at a temperature very little above that at which it gasifies. The issue
                    raised by the Meyers’ observation is of considerable theoretical interest, and
                    the subject demands further investigation.</p>
