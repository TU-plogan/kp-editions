                    lizards belonging to the suborder <hi rend="italic">Pachyglossae</hi> or
                    “thick-tongued,” and comprising 56 genera and 236 species. With a single
                    undoubted exception, all the genera of this extensive family belong to the New
                    World, being specially characteristic of the Neotropical region, where they
                    occur as far south as Patagonia, while extending northward into the warmer parts
                    of the Nearctic region as far as California and British Columbia. The single
                    non-American genus— <hi rend="italic">Brachylophus</hi> —occurs in the Fiji
                    Islands. The iguanas are characterized by the peculiar form of their teeth,
                    these being round at the root and blade-like, with serrated edges towards the
                    tip, resembling in this respect the gigantic extinct reptile iguanodon. The
                    typical forms belonging to this family are distinguished by the large dewlap or
                    pouch situated beneath the head and neck, and by the crest, composed of slender
                    elongated scales, which extends in gradually diminishing height from the nape of
                    the neck to the extremity of the tail. The latter organ is very long, slender,
                    and compressed, while its vertebrae, in common with those of certain other
                    lizards, possess thin unossified septa traversing their centres. It is owing to
                    the weakness thus produced in their vertebral column that, when caught <pb
                    break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit12newyrich/page/n718/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0912-0718-0701"/> by the tail, they are able to part so readily
                    with the portion seized. The tongue is generally short and not deeply divided at
                    its extremity, nor is its base retracted into a sheath; it is always moist and
                    covered with a glutinous secretion. The prevailing colour of the iguanas is
                    green; and, as the majority of them are arboreal in their habits, such colouring
                    may be generally regarded as protective. Those on the other hand which reside on
                    the ground have much duller, although as a rule equally protective hues; thus
                    Darwin observed on the shore at Bahia a terrestrial member of this family, which
                    from its mottled appearance could hardly be distinguished from the surrounding
                    surface. Iguanas, however, possess to an extent only exceeded by the chameleon
                    the power of changing their colours, their brilliant green becoming transformed
                    in an instant, under the influence of fear or irritation, into more sombre hues
                    and even into black. They differ greatly in size, from a few inches to several
                    feet in length. One of the largest and most widely distributed is the common
                    iguana <hi rend="italic">(Iguana tul)erculata∖</hi> which occurs in South
                    America and the West Indies. It attains a length of <hi rend="italic">5</hi>
                    feet, and is of a greenish colour occasionally mixed with brown, while the tail
                    is surrounded with alternate rings of those colours. Its food consists of
                    vegetable substances, which it obtains from the forest trees among whose
                    branches it lives and in the hollows of which it deposits its eggs. These are of
                    an oblong shape, about an inch and a half in length, and are said by travellers
                    to be very pleasant eating, especially when taken raw, as they usually are, and
                    mixed with farina. They are timid, defenceless animals, depending for safety on
                    the comparative inaccessibility of their arboreal haunts and their protective
                    colouring, which is rendered even more effective by their remaining still on the
                    approach of danger. Otherwise they exhibit few signs of animal intelligence.
                    “The iguana,” says Bates <hi rend="italic">(The Naturalist on the Amazon),</hi>
                    “is one of the stupidest animals I ever met. The one I caught dropped helplessly
                    from a tree just ahead of me; it turned round for a moment to have an idiotic
                    stare at the intruder, and then set off running along the path. I ran after it
                    and it then stopped as a timid dog would do, crouching down and permitting me to
                    seize it by the neck and carry it off.” Along with several other species the
                    common iguana is much sought after in tropical America; the natives esteem its
                    flesh a delicacy, and capture it by slipping a noose round its neck as it sits
                    in fancied security on the branch of a tree. Although chiefly arboreal, many of
                    the iguanas take readily to the water; and there is at least one species, <hi
                    rend="italic">Oreocephalus</hi><hi rend="italic">cristatus,</hi> which leads for
                    the most part an aquatic life. These marine lizards occur only in the Galapagos
                    Islands, where they are never seen more than 20 yards inland, while they may
                    often be observed in companies several hundreds of yards from the shore,
                    swimming with great facility by means of their flattened tails. Their feet are
                    all more or less webbed, but in swimming they are said to keep these organs
                    motionless by their sides. Their food consists of marine vegetation, to obtain
                    which they dive beneath the water, where they are able to remain, without coming
                    to the surface to breathe, for a very considerable time. Though they are thus
                    the most aquatic of lizards, Mr Darwin, who studied their habits during his
                    visit to those islands, states that when frightened they will not enter the
                    water. Driven along a narrow ledge of rock to the edge of the sea, they
                    preferred capture to escape by swimming, while if thrown into the water they
                    immediately returned to the point from which they started. A land species
                    belonging to the allied genus <hi rend="italic">Trachycephalus</hi> also occurs
                    in the Galapagos, which differs from most of its kind in forming burrows in the
                    ground.</p>
