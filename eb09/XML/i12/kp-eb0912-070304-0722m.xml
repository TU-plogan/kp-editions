                    twenty-first in the order of admission and the fourth in rank of population of
                    the States of the American Union, is one of the group of States formed out of
                    the “North-West Territory.” Its boundaries, beginning at the point where the
                    Wabash river joins the Ohio, pass thence north by that river, by the west line
                    of Indiana, and by Lake Michigan to 42° 30' N. lat., thence west to the
                    Mississippi river, thence south by that river to its confluence with the Ohio
                    river, and thence, by that, northeasterly to the mouth of the Wabash. It has an
                    area of 55,414 square miles, extending with varying width from 42° 30' to 36°
                    59' N. lat.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Surface and Sail.—</hi> Illinois is a great plain, with its
                    highest section in the north, on Lake Michigan; thence it imperceptibly declines
                    to the south-west, in which direction its principal rivers flow to the
                    Mississippi. A small tract in the north-west, which includes the lead mines, is
                    hilly and broken, and there are bluffs along the Mississippi, some of which rise
                    300 to 400 feet A ridge extends across the south end of the State, constituting
                    the fruit district of the region, called “Egypt” on account of its never-failing
                    fertility. On this ridge or swell of clay land are grown all the varieties of
                    berries, grapes, plums, peaches, apples, and all kinds of vegetables in great
                    profusion, which find prompt sale in Chicago and the northern counties by reason
                    of reaching market at early dates in the season. Excepting along the rivers, and
                    where there has been extensive tree planting, the greater part of the State
                    consists of a vast level or slightly undulating treeless prairies. Much of this
                    has been reclaimed from swamp land by systematic drainage, and is found to be
                    the strongest and most productive soil of the State. To the eye the surface of
                    the. State is as level as that of an ocean in calm. The general slope from the
                    watershed rarely exceeds 1 foot to the mile, and the fall of the Illinois river
                    in a course of 300 miles to the south-west, is, for most of the distance, but 1
                    inch to the mile. The origin of the prairies is still a matter of speculation,
                    but there is an opinion that in a former geological age the whole State was the
                    bed of a vast shallow freshwater lake. The prairie soil is a black fine humus
                    mould, formed of the decayed vegetation, and underlain at varying depths by
                    clay. The soil is of great fertility, and much of it seemingly inexhaustible.
                    Over these prairies for hundreds of miles the plough never touches stone,
                    pebble, or even sand. A luxuriant native grass formerly sustained herds of
                    buffalo, and from the still unbroken prairie surface are annually <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0912-0723-0704"/> mown thousands of tons of the wild grass for hay,
                    which is as nutritious and brings as high a price in market as “tame hay.” All
                    the cereals, roots, fruits, grasses, and vegetables of the temperate zone are
                    grown in Illinois, and some of the semi-tropical productions, as cotton and
                    amber cane. Because of the richness of the soil, cultivators still plough very
                    shallow, and neglect manuring, or even rotation of crops, in the larger portion
                    of the State. It is usual to plant maize for ten or twenty years in succession,
                    only changing the crop to wheat, oats, barley, buckwheat, or rye when the market
                    prices of these cereals promise larger profits than maize. Upon any sign of
                    exhaustion, the productiveness may be restored by deeper ploughing, grassing,
                    fallowing, and applying barnyard manure. In half a century there has never been
                    a bad failure of crops; twice or thrice there has been insufficient rain, and as
                    often too much, and once a frost in summer; but the injury in no one year was so
                    great or so widespread as to produce general distress among farmers.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Minerals.—</hi> Coalis found in nearly all parts of the State;
                    it is bituminous, a small proportion being cannel. The beds vary from 3⅜ to 8
                    feet in thickness. The Coal-measures are part of the general formation extending
                    from beyond the Mississippi river in Missouri, across Illinois and parts of
                    Indiana and Ohio, and into Kentucky. It is estimated that three-fourths of the
                    surface area of the State are underlain by beds of coal. There are twelve
                    separate and well-defined beds of from 4 to 8 feet in thickness. The State is
                    supplied with coal for consumption, not only from the mines of Illinois, but
                    also from those of Indiana and Ohio by rail, and with anthracite from
                    Pennsylvania by lake. The coal mined in the State is between 3,500,000 and
                    4,000,000 tons annually. Near Galena, in the northwest part of the State, are
                    lead mines which have been worked for half a century, and which at one time made
                    Galena the most prosperous city in the State. Salt springs are found in the
                    south-east counties. Stone suitable for building is found in various parts of
                    the State. An inexhaustible field of limestone, called “Lemont marble,” is found
                    near Chicago, and has been largely used in rebuilding that city.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">State Lands.—</hi> The lands in the State were thus classified
                    in the years 1878 and 1880:—in the former year there were 25,639,304 acres of
                    improved and 8,635,953 of unimproved lands (total, 34,275,257), while in the
                    latter year the numbers were 26,174,566 and 8,204,505 (total, 34,379,071 acres).
                    The city and town lots numbered 365,344 improved and 486,731 unimproved in 1878,
                    and 374,664 improved and 484,932 unimproved in 1880. The railroads hold 13,253
                    acres of land and 3028 city and town lots.</p>
                <p>The improved lands were under cultivation in 1878 and 1880, as follows :—</p>

                <p><hi rend="italic">Railways.—</hi> In 1850 Congress granted to the State, to aid
                    in the construction of a railway from Cairo to Galena and Chicago, alternate
                    sections of land along the route; the State transferred the grant of land to the
                    Illinois Central Railroad Company, a corporation composed mainly of English
                    capitalists, conspicuous among whom was Richard Cobden. These capitalists
                    furnished the money and constructed the road, and they and their successors
                    still own the property. The railway lies wholly within the State, though it
                    works other lines extending south to New Orleans and west to the Missouri river.
                    Its completion gave that impetus to the construction of railways to Chicago and
                    across the State which has contributed so largely to the rapid development of
                    the resources of Illinois. The State is now admirably supplied with railways,
                    their extent reaching 6849 miles. They cross every county in the State; indeed,
                    they are so numerous and so interlaced that there are few if any localities more
                    than 10 miles from a railway, while a large proportion of the shipping points
                    have the benefit of more than one route by which to ship and receive
                    merchandise. The great trunk lines leading west from the Atlantic and from
                    Canada have their termini at Chicago, or at some other point in Illinois, while
                    those leading from the States west of the Mississippi also terminate in
                    Illinois, or crossing the State run further east. The system of railway
                    government somewhat resembles that of England. A railway commission, appointed
                    by the State, exercises a general supervision, and enforces the penalties for
                    violations of law. The receipts of the forty-six railways doing business in
                    Illinois amounted in 1879-80 to $138,659,155; the working expenses to
                    $73,089,185; and the net income to $61,093,612.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Inland Navigation.—</hi> In addition to the railway traffic,
                    there is much business done by steamboats at Cairo, East St Louis, Alton,
                    Quincy, Rock Island, and other points on the Ohio and Mississippi rivers, though
                    transportation by river has declined much of late years. The Illinois and
                    Michigan canal is 93 miles long, and connects Lake Michigan at Chicago with the
                    Illinois river, at the head of the navigation of that river. This canal has cost
                    $17,000,000, but is now too small for the service needed. The Illinois river is
                    formed by the union of the Kankakee and Des Plaines rivers, which junction
                    occurs 45 miles south-west of Chicago. It receives, besides the rivers named,
                    <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit12newyrich/page/n724/mode/1up"

                    rivers, and of some smaller streams. Its general direction is southwest to the
                    Mississippi, into which it falls. The State has expended much money improving
                    the navigation by locks and dams, and this improvement when completed, with the
                    enlargement of the canal to the capacity of steamboat navigation, will be one of
                    the most extensive works of interior water communication in the world, being
                    over 400 miles long, and connecting the waters of the Atlantic, through the St
                    Lawrence river and the lakes, and through the Mississippi river, with the Gulf
                    of Mexico. Rock river rises in Wisconsin, flows rapidly to the south-west
                    through Illinois, and joins the Mississippinear Rock Island. On this river
                    manufacturing establishments are rapidly increasing, the water power being
                    regarded as equal to any in the country. The other rivers are the Kaskaskia,
                    Embarras, Little Wabash, Big Muddy, and Chicago river, the last-named an inlet
                    from Lake Michigan, furnishing a commodious harbour, 8 miles long, in which an
                    average of 400 vessels find shelter during the winter season. The extent of the
                    commerce on the lake is shown by the customhouse returns. During 1880 the steam
                    vessels arriving at Chicago had a total burthen of 2,141,879 tons, the sailing
                    vessels 2,456,337 tons; the clearances showed about the same figures.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Manufactures.—</hi> The statistics of manufactures for 1870
                    give as results 13,597 establishments, employing 82,979 operatives. Since that
                    date the increase in manufactures throughout the State has been general,
                    embracing all branches of manufacturing industry. The following are the
                    statistics for Cook county (including Chicago) in 1880: —number of
                    establishments, 3752; capital, $80,693,102; average numberof hands, 113,507:
                    wages paid, $37,615,381; value of material used, $180,807,706; value of
                    products, $253,405,695. These figures for Cook county alone in 1S80 exceed in
                    several particulars those for the whole State in 1870; and the increase in the
                    State during the ten years may be regarded as proportionate to that in Cook
                    county. The abundance of coal, the proximity to the Lake Superior iron and
                    copper mines, the unlimited means of transportation, the supply of lumber, the
                    cheapness of food, the superior water power in various parts of the State, have
                    all tended to make Illinois a large and convenient seat of manufactures. The
                    iron and steel establishments of the State rank with the largest in the country.
                    On Rock Island, in the Mississippi river, the U. S. Government has an arsenal
                    for the manufacture of ordnance. The establishment is the most extensive in the
                    United States, and the buildings and workshops cover nearly the entire
                    island.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Administration.—</hi> The territory embraced in the present
                    State of Illinois was ceded in 1765 by France to Great Britain; then it became a
                    possession of the colony of Virginia; in 1787 it was made a county in the
                    North-West Territory; from 1800 to 1809 it was a county in the territory of
                    Indiana; in 1809 it was erected into a territory; and in December 1818 was
                    admitted into the Union as a State. On its admission to the Union a constitution
                    providing a form of government was adopted; in 1848 this w is superseded by
                    another, and this again was set aside in 1870 by the third and present
                    constitution, which pro vi les the ordinary State government of three
                    departments, executive, legislative, and judicial. The executive, consisting of
                    a governor and other officers, are elected every four years; the legislature, or
                    general assembly, consists of a senate of 51 members, elected by as many
                    districts; the term of senators is four years, one half, or as near as may be,
                    retiring every two years. The house of representatives consists of 153 members,
                    3 elected in each senatorial district every two years. In electing
                    representatives, the voter may give his three votes for one, two, or three
                    candidates. This cumulative voting is peculiar to the constitution of Illinois;
                    it has become popular. The judiciary consists of one supreme court of seven
                    judges, several district appellate courts of limited jurisdiction, circuit
                    courts in such number as may be needed, and one county court, including probate
                    jurisdiction, in each county. Each county and each township has its own local
                    government. Every male citizen resident one year in the State may vote. This
                    constitution when adopted was regarded as a great improvement and advance in
                    State government, and many of its provisions have since been adopted by other
                    States. The sessions of the legislature are held at Springfield, which since
                    1836 has been the capital of the State.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Revenue, Debts, Taxation.—</hi> In 1836-38 the State was
                    seduced into a scheme of internal improvements. The population was then less
                    than half a million, but the debt created was $14,000,000, to construct railways
                    and a canal. In three years the scheme was abandoned, and the State in July 1841
                    suspended payment of interest. In 1845 the legislature levied a tax to pay the
                    current interest; in 1848 an irrepealable tax was levied to pay the principal;
                    all the overdue and unpaid interest was funded in interest-bearing bonds. Credit
                    was restored, and in December 1880 the State was free of all debt. Taxation is
                    imposed by a rate levied on all real and personal property, according to a
                    previous valuation, made by local assessors, revised by county boards, and again
                    revised and equalized by a State board. The total assessment or valuation of the
                    property in the State for taxation averages not more than onefourth of the value
                    at which the property can be sold. The constitution limits the rate of taxation
                    (except to pay debts) by counties to 75 cents on each 5100 of the official
                    valuation. The same valuation governs all taxation, the maximum rate being fixed
                    by law. In like manner all municipal corporations are (since 1870) prohibited
                    from incurring any debt, for any purpose, exceeding, with previous debts, 5 per
                    cent, on the official valuation of the property within their territorial
                    jurisdiction. An annual tax is required in each municipality to pay the interest
                    and a portion of the principal of all existing debts. Under these stringent
                    requirements, municipal debts in Illinois are gradually decreasing. The State,
                    without becoming responsible for municipal debts, acts as trustee, and through
                    its officers collects and disburses the taxes to pay principal and interest of
                    these local debts. The latter were contracted mainly in aid of railroads, and
                    bore an average rate of 9 per cent, interest.</p>

                <p>The valuation of all the property in the State for taxable purposes, for the year
                    1880, was $786,616,394. The rate of tax levied for State purposes, and to pay
                    cost of assessment and collection, is 36 cents on each $100 of the property
                    valuation given, which, as above stated, is about one-fourth of the real value.
                    In 1880 lands (except railroad lands) were valued at $390,594,627, and city and
                    town lots at $182,808,928; total landsand lots, $573,403,555.</p>
                <p>The State is in receipt of a permanent revenue from the Illinois Central Railroad
                    Company. In consideration of the cession of land, in 1850, by the State, the
                    company contracted to pay into the State treasury half-yearly 7 per cent, of the
                    gross annual earnings of the line. This was to be in lieu of all other taxes on
                    the property of the company. This contract is now a source of large, revenue to
                    the State. Up to November 1, 1855, the payment to the State was $29,752; the
                    payment in 1880 was $368,349. The total pavments to the State, at the close of
                    1880, amounted tβ $8,307,217.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Education and Charities.—</hi> The public school system is
                    liberally supported in Illinois. The permanent school fund yields about $60,000,
                    to which the State adds $1,000,000 annually, and this is distributed among the
                    counties. Many counties and districts have invested school funds. The aggregate
                    of these local funds is $5,500,000, the interest of which is applied to support
                    school*. In addition each school district levies such taxes as may be needed for
                    its schools, and may borrow money to build schoolhouses. In <pb break="no"

                    to $9,634,727, the expenditure to $7,526,109. The number of children in the
                    State (1878) of the school age, six to twenty-one years, was 1,102,021; of these
                    706,733 were enrolled as attending the public schools, and 41,406 as attending
                    private and parochial schools; total attending schools, 748,139. The whole
                    number of school districts in the State was 11,714; male teachers 9475, female
                    teachers 12,817, teachers in private schools 1017—total teachers 23,309.
                    Salaries of male teachers range from $15 to $225 per month, of female teachers
                    from $10 to $115 per month. Five months in each year is the minimum term of the
                    public schools, ten months the general term. Except the income from invested
                    funds, school revenues are obtained from direct taxation. The State has
                    established two normal universities, providing the buildings and grounds, —one
                    at Normal, M <hi rend="superscript"> l</hi> Lean county, the other at
                    Carbondale, Jackson county. There is an industrial university at Champaign,
                    maintained and liberally endowed by the State. There are also several other
                    universities and colleges, including medical and theological, in various parts
                    of the State. All schools supported in whole or in part by public money must be
                    non-sectarian in their instruction and government.</p>
                <p>Under the general supervision of a board of charities, the State maintains four
                    hospitals for the insane, at J ack-son ville, Elgin, Anna, and Kankakee; an
                    institution for educating the blind, and one for educating the deaf and dumb,
                    both at Jacksonville; an asylum for imbecile children; an eye and ear infirmary;
                    a home for soldiers’ orphans; and a correctional or reformatory school for boys.
                    All these institutions are provided with spacious grounds and extensive
                    buildings. The annual expenditure for the maintenance of these charities is
                    about $1,000,000. This does not include the cost of buildings and grounds, on
                    which over $5,000,000 have been expended. Several other asylums for the insane
                    are maintained by local authorities.</p>
