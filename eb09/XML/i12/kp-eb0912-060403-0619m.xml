                <p><label type="entry">IBERIANS</label><hi rend="italic">(Iberi, *Jβηpeς).</hi> To
                    the question, Who are the Iberians? it is impossible to give a satisfactory
                    answer in the form of a concise definition. While our knowledge of their actual
                    history is comparatively slight, the position which they have acquired in modern
                    ethnographical theory is at once a prominent and a perplexing one. It is almost
                    impossible to hazard any statement in regard to them which will not find an
                    impugning voice from one quarter or other. Historical, numismatical, linguistic,
                    and anthropological evidences have been brought to bear on the problem of their
                    affinity, and the result is on the whole not so much light as darkness
                    visible.</p>
                <p>The name Iberians seems to have been applied by the earlier Greek navigators to
                    the peoples who inhabited the eastern coast of Spain; and there is considerable
                    probability in the suggestion that it originally meant the ripuarians of the
                    Iberus or Ebro.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>A very
                    different etymology is offered by Basque-Iberian theorists; Μ. Boudard, for
                    example, derives the name from <hi rend="italic">ibαy-erri,</hi> the country of
                    the river.</p></note> On the other hand, the term Iberia is said to have
                    embraced in older Greek usage the country as far east as the Rhone (see
                    Herodorus of Heraclea, <hi rend="italic">Fragmenta Historiarum</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Croecarum,</hi> tom. ii. p. 34), and by the time of Strabo it was
                    the common Greek name for the Spanish peninsula,—Iberians meaning sometimes
                    theinhabi-tants of the peninsula in general, and sometimes, it would appear, the
                    peoples of a definite race or γένος. Of the tribal distribution of this race, of
                    its linguistic social and political characteristics, and of the history of its
                    relation to the other peoples of Spain, we have only the most general,
                    fragmentary, and in part self-contradictory accounts. On the whole our
                    historical evidence authorizes the assertion that in Spain, when it first became
                    known to the Romans and Greeks, there existed a large number of separate and
                    variously civilized tribes connected with each other by at least apparent
                    identity of race, and by similarity (but not identity) of language, their
                    general characteristics sufficiently differencing them from Phoenicians, Romans,
                    and Celts. The statement that the mingling of these Iberians with the immigrant
                    Celts gave rise to the Celtiberians (Keltiberians) is in itself sufficiently
                    probable, and has been impugned by nothing more precise than the general
                    untrustworthiness of the author by whom it is made (Diodorus Sicħlus). Varro and
                    Dionysius Afer went so far as to identify the Iberians of Spain with the
                    Iberians of the Caucasus, the one regarding the eastern and the other the
                    western settlements as of earlier date.</p>
                <p>The only material relics which have come down to us with the imprint of the
                    ancient Iberian or Celtiberian civilization are a variety of coins and a few
                    inscriptions of dubious interpretation. So difficult has the reading of the
                    legends of the coins been found that the Spanish numismatists have regularly
                    catalogued them as the <hi rend="italic">desconoeidas</hi> or unknown; and the
                    explanation of them has been sought now in Visigothic runes (Olaus Wormius and
                    Olaus Rudbeck), now in Hebrew (L. J. Velasquez), now in Latin, and now in
                    Celtic. By the general consensus of more modern investigators, however, their
                    Iberian character is recognized, though the methods and results of <pb

                    Celtiberian coins are found most frequently in the north-east and east of Spain,
                    in smaller numbers in the centre, rarely in the south, and more rarely still in
                    Portugal and Asturias. The legends, he maintains, belong to peoples who
                    inhabited the country at the time when the Greeks were still coining pieces with
                    the type of Apollo and the wheel,—that is, before the completion of the Roman
                    conquest. Their monetary system seems to have been imitated from that of the
                    Roman republic, having a division analogous to that of the denarii and quinarii.
                    The principal type on the reverse is either a horseman galloping with lance in
                    rest or bearing a palm-branch or laurel-branch, or a man leading two horses and
                    brandishing a sword or a bow. The Latin coins of Bilbilis, Osca, Segobriga,
                    &lt;fcc., retain the type of the galloping horseman. Pieces with inscriptions in
                    the same alphabet and similar images are found in the district of Narbonne.</p>

                <p>It was not till 1821 that the Iberian problem became an established <hi
                    rend="italic">pièce</hi><hi rend="italic">de resistance</hi> in the
                    ethnographical programme. In that year Karl Wilhelm Humboldt published his <hi
                    rend="italic">Prüfung der</hi><hi rend="italic">Untersuchungen</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">uber die</hi><hi rend="italic">Urbewohner</hi><hi rend="italic"

                    >l·Vaskischen</hi><hi rend="italic">Sprache,</hi> Berlin, 1821. As a matter of
                    course this was a work of exuberant learning and bold hypothesis; and partly
                    through its inherent attractiveness, partly through the prestige of its author,
                    the theory which it expounded met with general acceptance. The main arguments
                    were these :—that the Iberians were one great people, speaking a distinct
                    language of their own; that they were to be found in Sicily, Sardinia, and
                    Corsica, in southern France, and even in the British Isles; and that the Basques
                    of the present day were the distinctly recognizable remnants of the race which
                    had elsewhere been expelled or absorbed. This last was the central and seminal
                    idea of the work, and it has been the point round which the battle of
                    scholarship has mainly raged. The principal evidence which Humboldt adduced in
                    its support was the possibility of explaining a vast number of the ancient
                    topographical names of Spain, and of other asserted Iberian districts, by the
                    forms and significations of Basque. The first serious attack on the theory was
                    made by Graslin <hi rend="italic">(Be</hi><hi rend="italic">l’Ibérie,</hi>
                    Paris, 1839), who maintained that the name Iberia was nothing but a Greek
                    misnomer of Spain, and that there was no proof that the Basque people had ever
                    occupied a wider area than at present; and Μ. Blade has since, in his <hi
                    rend="italic">Origine</hi><hi rend="italic">des Basques</hi> (Paris 1869), taken
                    up the same line of argument and brought to bear on the subject a vast amount of
                    laborious and many-sided erudition. His criticism is almost purely negative. Of
                    the whole structure of the Iberian theory he would not leave one stone upon
                    another. He holds that Iberia is a purely geographical term, that there was no
                    proper Iberian people or race, that the whole Basque-Iberian theory is a modern
                    figment, that the Basques were always shut in by alien races, and that their
                    affinity is still to seek. His main contention has met with some
                    acceptance;<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>W. van Eys,
                    for example, “La langue Ibérienne et la langue Basque,” in <hi rend="italic"
                    >Revue de linguistique,</hi> goes against Huml&gt;oldt; but Prince Napoleon and
                    to a considerable extent A. Luchaire maintain the justice of his method and the
                    value of many of his results. See Luchaire, <hi rend="italic">Les origines
                    linguistiques de l’Aquitaine,</hi> Paris, 1877.</p></note> but the great current
                    of ethnographical speculation still flows in the direction indicated by
                    Humboldt, though it breaks up into a number of distinct channels. The
                    anthropological researches of Broca, Thurnam and Davis, Huxley, Busk, Virchow,
                    Tubino, and others have proved the existence in Europe of a Neolithic race,
                    small of stature, with long or oval skulls, and accustomed to bury their dead in
                    tombs. Their remains have been found in Belgium and France, in Britain, Germany,
                    and Denmark, as well as in Spain; but they bear a closer resemblance to the
                    Basques than to any other living people. This Neolithic race has consequently
                    been identified with the Basques and the Iberians; and extreme exponents of the
                    theory do not hesitate to speak of the Iberian ancestors of the people of
                    England, recognizing the racial characteristics in the “small swarthy Welshman,”
                    the “small dark Highlander,” and the “Black Celts to the west of the Shannon,”
                    as well as in the typical inhabitants of Aquitania and Brittany. (Compare the
                    interesting <hi rend="italic">résumé</hi> of the whole question in Boyd
                    Dawkins’s <hi rend="italic">Early Man in Britain,</hi> London, 1880.<note

                    very questionable identification of the Iberians of Spain with the Iberians of
                    the Caucasus.</p></note>) Some investigators go even further. Μ. D’Arbois de
                    Jubainville, for example <hi rend="italic">(Les premiers habitants</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">de l’Europe,</hi> Paris, 1877), regards the Iberians as the
                    descendants of the Atlantes (i.e., the hypothetical inhabitants of Plato’s great
                    western isle the Atlantis, see <hi rend="smallcaps">Atlantis),</hi> and
                    maintains that in Europe they possessed Spain, Gaul, Italy, and the British
                    Isles, penetrated into the Balkan peninsula, and occupied a part of northern
                    Africa, Corsica, and Sardinia. And in reviewing Μ. Jubainville’s work in <hi
                    rend="italic">Revue d’</hi><hi rend="italic">Anthropologie</hi> (1877), Μ.
                    Hovelacque considers that it has been clearly made out that a race with
                    distinctly marked characteristics was at one time in possession of the south of
                    France (or at least of Aquitania), the whole of Spain from the Pyrenees to the
                    straits, the Canary Islands (the Guauchos), a part of northern Africa, and
                    Corsica. Tubino, in his <hi rend="italic">Los aborigènes</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >ibcricos</hi> (Madrid, 1876), argues that the builders of the megalithic
                    monuments of Spain and northern Africa, the ancient Iberians, and the modern
                    Basques and Andalusian mountaineers, as well as the Berbers<note anchored="true"
