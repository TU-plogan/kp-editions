                <p><label type="entry">INDRE</label>, a department of central France, consisting of
                    parts of the old provinces Bas-Berry, Orléanais, and Marche, is bounded N. by
                    the departments of Indre-et-Loire and Loir-et-Cher, E. by Cher, S. by Creuse,
                    Haute-Vienne, and Vienne, and W. by Vienne and Indre-et-Loire. It lies between
                    46° 22' and 47° 15' N. lat., and between 0° 52' and 2° 13' E. long., being 60
                    miles in length from north to south and 54 miles in breadth from east to west.
                    It derives its name from the river Indre, which flows through it from south-east
                    to north-west. The Creuse, Claise, and Vienne, tributaries, like the Indre, of
                    the Loire, are the other principal streams. The surface forms a vast plateau,
                    sloping from south to north, and divided into three districts, the Bois-Chaud,
                    Champagne, and Brenne, varying with the characteristics of the soil. The
                    Bois-Chaud is a large well-wooded plain, comprising seven-tenths of the entire
                    area, and covered with a sandy and stony soil. In the river valleys, however,
                    the soil is extremely fertile. The Champagne, a bare though fertile district to
                    the northwest, produces abundant cereal crops, and affords excellent pasturage
                    for large numbers of sheep, celebrated for the fineness of their wool. The
                    Brenne is an unhealthy marshy district to the south. The climate of Indre is
                    mild and temperate, though moist. On the southern heights the cold is often
                    severe, and throughout the department the crops suffer much from hailstorms. The
                    growth of cereals in Indre exceeds the requirements of the inhabitants; the
                    pasturage is good and abundant; and there are numerous valuable forests of oak,
                    elm, beech, and other timber. Fruit-trees are plentiful, and market-gardening is
                    a flourishing industry. The vine is cultivated to a small extent, and yields a
                    mediocre red wine. Chestnuts, potatoes, turnips, beetroot, hemp, and colza are
                    also grown. The rearing of horses and horned cattle is carried on in the
                    Bois-Chaud, and of sheep in the Champagne. The mineral resources of the
                    department include large quantities of iron, besides marl, sandstone, limestone,
                    marble, lithographic and mill-stones, granite, and other stones. The chief
                    industry is the working of the iron; tobacco, paper, parchment, cloth, woollen
                    goods, leather, felt, pottery, porcelain, bonnets, scythes, and tiles are also
                    manufactured. Indre has considerable trade in its natural productions and
