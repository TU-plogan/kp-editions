                <p><label type="entry">INDIAN ARCHIPELAGO</label>. The East Indian Archipelago or
                    Malay Archipelago, the largest island cluster in the world, lies to the
                    south-east of Asia and to the north and north-west of Australia, and bears the
                    impress in many of its most important characteristics, both natural and
                    historical, of this twofold relation.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>For more detailed information respecting the several islands
                    and groups of the archipelago the reader is referred to the separate articles
                    <hi rend="smallcaps">Borneo, Java, Sumatra, Philippine Islands,
                    &amp;c.</hi></p></note></p>
                <p>As the archipelago does not form a political unity, different writers assign it
                    very different limits, according as they are influenced by one set of
                    considerations or another. New Guinea to the east and the Philippines to the
                    north are sometimes included and sometimes excluded; Sumatra is sometimes
                    regarded as the most western member of the group, and sometimes that position is
                    given to the Nicobar or the Andaman Islands. From the following survey of the
                    extent of the archipelago the Malay Peninsula and New Guinea are excluded, but
                    the Andaman Islands are admitted as having at least an ethnographical claim. The
                    Balintong Strait, about the 20th parallel of N. lat., may be taken as the
                    northern limit; and but for a small portion of the islands Timor and Sumba
                    (Sandalwood Island), with their insignificant adjacencies, the southern limit
                    might be stated as the 10th of S. lat. The Andaman Islands take us as far west
                    as 93° E. long., the Aru Islands aS far east as 135°. The equator passes through
                    the middle of the archipelago; it successively cuts Sumatra, Borneo, Celebes,
                    and Jilolo, four of the most important islands. To adopt Mr Wallace’s graphic
                    sentences (noting that he embraces New Guinea and the Solomon Islands), the
                    archipelago “includes two islands larger than Great Britain; and in one of them,
                    Borneo, the whole of the British Isles might be set down, and would be
                    surrounded by a sea of forests. Sumatra is about equal in extent to Great
                    Britain; Java, Luzon, and Celebes are each about the size of Ireland. Eighteen
                    more islands are on the average as large as Jamaica; and more than a hundred are
                    as large as the Isle of Wight.”</p>
                <p>The statistics of the area and population of the several islands can only be
                    given approximately. The following table is based on statements contained in the

                <p>The total area is thus rather less than that of British India, and the population
                    rather more than that of Great Britain and Ireland.</p>
                <p>The islands of the archipelago nearly all present bold and picturesque profiles
                    against the horizon, and at the <pb break="no"

                    from island to island and even from district to district. The mountains arrange
                    themselves for the most part in lines running either from north-west to
                    south-east or from west to east. In Sumatra and in the islands between Sumatra
                    and Borneo the former direction is very distinctly marked, and the latter is
                    equally noticeable in Java and the other southern islands. The mountains of
                    Borneo rise rather in short ridges and clusters from the plain, like islands
                    from the sea ∙ <hi rend="subscript"> i</hi> the arrangement represented on even
                    what are considered authoritative maps being, like much else in the cartography
                    of the archipelago, the product of imagination. Nothing in the general
                    physiognomy of the islands is more remarkable than the number and distribution
                    of the volcanoes, active or extinct.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>A valuable list of these will be found in Junghuhn’s <hi
                    rend="italic">Java,</hi> a work which contains many details in regard to various
                    parts of the archipelago.</p></note> Running south-east through Sumatra, east
                    through Java and the southern islands to Timor, curving north through the
                    Moluccas, and again north from the end of Celebes through the whole line of the
                    Philippines, they form as it were the rim of a great atoll (to use Dr
                    Schneider’s phraseology), rudely resembling a horseshoe narrowed towards the
                    point. The loftiest mountain in the archipelago would appear to be the famous
                    Kina Balu in Borneo; the loftiest of the volcanic peaks are Indrapura in Sumatra
                    (12,255 feet), Semeru in Java (12,238), Gunong Agong in Bali (11,726), and
                    Tamboro in Sumbawa (9324 feet).</p>
                <p>Au important fact in the physical geography of the archipelago is that Java,
                    Bali, Sumatra, and Borneo, and the lesser islands between them and the Asiatic
                    mainland, all rest on a great submerged bank, nowhere more than 100 fathoms
                    below the surface of the sea, which may be considered a continuation of the
                    continent; while to the east the depth of the sea has been found at various
                    places to be from 1000 to 2500 fathoms. As the value of this fact has been
                    particularly emphasized by Mr Wallace, the limit of the shallow water, which
                    passes through between Bali and Lombok, and strikes north to the east of Borneo,
                    has rightly received the name of Wallace’s line. The Philippines, on the other
                    hand, “are almost surrounded by deep sea, but are connected with Borneo by means
                    of two narrow submarine banks.”<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                <p>The geology of the archipelago has not been investigated even with the
                    completeness attained in regard to the zoology and botany; but there is a very
                    considerable collection of material in the publications of the mining engineers
                    of the Dutch Government <hi rend="italic">(Jaarboek Mijmvezen Ned. O.
                    Ind.)·,</hi> and for the Philippines a valuable “Memoria geologico-minera” has
                    been printed in the <hi rend="italic">Boletino</hi> of the Commission of the
                    Geological Map of Spain (Madrid, 1876). The results obtained by the Dutch
                    engineers have been summarized by Dr Schneider, “Geologische Uebersicht über den
                    holländ.-ostind. Archipel,” in <hi rend="italic">Jahrbuch</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >d. K.K.</hi><hi rend="italic">Geolog. Reichsanstalt,</hi> Vienna, 1876, Bd.
                    xxvi. There is a wide and varied representation of the azoic formations—gneiss,
                    mica-schist, hornblende, &amp;c., in Timor (which it may be remarked is
                    geologically one of the best known of the islands), Ceram, Billiton, Banka,
                    &amp;c. Silurian rocks are found in Banka (where they contain the famous
                    tin-mines), Billiton, and the Linga and Riouw archipelago; carboniferous
                    limestone occurs in the north of Timor; the coal of Batchian is apparently
                    similar to that of the English Carboniferous measures; and the Coal-measures of
                    Borneo are thought by Van Dyk to be also Palaeozoic. The Sumatran coal is of
                    unascertained age. Permian rocks are present in Timor, Celebes, Pulo-Laut, and
                    Sumatra. Of Secondary formations we find both Triassic and Jurassic rocks, the
                    latter represented by Oolites in Timo?, by a coralline limestone in Celebes.
                    Cretaceous rocks occur in both these islands and in Celebes. Throughout the
                    whole archipelago the Tertiary formations have a wide development both in their
                    Eocene and their Miocene divisions. The latter is represented by fυraminiferous
                    limestone, and the former by nummulitic limestone. Lignite is freely distributed
                    throughout the Tertiary strata of Java, Sumatra, and Nias. Among the rocks of
                    economic importance may be mentioned granite of numerous kinds, syenite,
                    serpentine, porphyry, marble (at least in southern Java), sandstones, and marls.
                    Coal is worked successfully in Sumatra, Borneo, and Labuan. Diamonds are
                    obtained in Borneo, garnets in Sumatra, Batchian, and Timor, and topazes in
                    Batchian; antimony in Borneo and the Philippines; lead in Sumatra, Banka,
                    Flores, and the Philippines; and copper and malachite in the Philippines, Timor,
                    Borneo, and Sumatra. Iron is pretty frequent in various forms, and in some
                    places might be successfully worked. Gold is not uncommon in the older ranges of
                    Sumatra, Banka, Celebes, Batchian, Timor, and Borneo. Manganese could be readily
                    worked in Timor, where it lies in the carboniferous limestone. Platinum is found
                    in Landak and other parts of Borneo, and mercury in small quantities in
                    Java.</p>
                <p>The meteorology of the archipelago has hitherto been studied only in a very vague
                    manner. For Batavia, indeed, there exists a mass of observations; and the
                    observatory there is extending the region of its investigations. At the close of
                    1879 it had one hundred and twenty-five rainfall stations. A magnetic survey of
                    the islands has been made by E. Van Rijckevorsel, whose report is published by
                    the Academy of Sciences of Amsterdam. The most striking general fact is that,
                    wherever that part of the south-east monsoon which has passed over Australia
                    strikes, the climate is comparatively dry, and the vegetation is less luxuriant
                    and luscious. The east end of Java, <hi rend="italic">e.g.,</hi> has a less
                    rainfall than the west; the distribution of the rain on the north coast is quite
                    different from that on the south, and a similar difference is observed between
                    the east and the west of Celebes. According to Dr Bergsma’s <hi rend="italic"
                    >Rainfall of the East Indian Archipelago, First Year,</hi> 1879 (which, like
                    other publications of the Batavian meteorological office, is printed in
                    English), at thirty-three stations out of fifty-nine the annual rainfall
                    exceeded 100 inches, and at five stations .200 inches. The highest registration
                    was 282 inches, at Padang Pandjang (Sumatra). The north-west monsoon, beginning
                    in October and lasting till March, brings the principal rain season in the
                    archipelago. The midday heat of the sun, it need hardly be said, makes itself
                    powerfully felt. Exposure to its direct rays in Timor, for example, “at any time
                    between 9 <hi rend="smallcaps">a.m.</hi> and 3 <hi rend="smallcaps">p.m.,”</hi>
                    says Mr Wallace <hi rend="italic">(Tropical Nature),</hi> “would blister the
                    skin in a few minutes almost as effectually as the application of scalding
                    water,” and Mr Moseley mentions that on wading into the sea at the Aru Islands
                    he found the heat of the water actually greater than was at all pleasant. But at
                    the same time the general climate cannot be said to be oppressive or
                    unhealthy.</p>
                <p>Most of the islands of the archipelago belong to that great forest-belt which, in
                    the words of Mr Wallace, “girdles the earth at the equator, clothing hill,
                    plain, and mountain with an evergreen mantle.” In islands and districts where
                    human civilization has been at work for centuries, the natural covering has in
                    large measure given place to artificial tilth; and in Timor and several of the
                    south-eastern islands the characteristics of New Guinea—luxuriant herbage and
                    open park-like woodlands—are more or less strikingly predominant.<note

                    is still vast and alluring. Among the very giants of the forest the unregistered
                    species must be numerous; and, if we descend to the minor forms, it is a very
                    poor collection that does not yield something absolutely new to science. The
                    ferns, the pitcher plants, and the orchids are especially numerous, and have
                    attracted particular attention. “The volcano of Pangerango in Java is said to
                    have, for example, yielded three hundred species of ferns and Mr Burbidge, in a
                    short excursion in Borneo in 1879, found upwards of fifty species that had not
                    been previously obtained in the island.</p>

                <p>If we turn to the economical aspect of the vegetation, whether natural or
                    cultivated, we cannot fail to be impressed by its varied resources. The list of
                    fruits is a very extensive one; though unfortunately it is only with a very few
                    of them that the untravelled European can have any practical acquaintance.
                    Besides the orange, the mango, the mangosteen, the pomato or shaddock, the
                    guava, the papaw, and the jack fruit, we have the rambutan, the tarippe or trap,
                    the jintawan, the tampu, the bilimbing, the mamhangan, the langsat, the rambi,
                    and the jambosa. The name at least of the durian is now well known (see <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Durian),</hi> and nearly as strange is the bawangutan <hi
                    rend="italic">{Scor-doprasum borneense),</hi> of which the fruit, the leaves,
                    and the branches have all a strong odour and flavour of onions.<note

                    what more distinctively deserve the name of food-plants the variety is equally
                    notable. Not only are rice and maize (usually called <hi rend="italic"
                    >cljagong</hi> in the archipelago), sugar and coffee, among the widely
                    cultivated crops, but the cocoa-nut, the bread fruit, the banana and plantain
                    (usually called <hi rend="italic">pisaηg</hi> in the archipelago), the
                    sugar-palm <hi rend="italic">( A renga saccharifera),</hi> the tea-plant, the
                    sago-palm, the cocoatree (which curiously yields the favourite beverage of the
                    Sulu archipelago), the ground-nut, the <hi rend="italic">Caladium</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">esculentum,</hi> the yam, the cassava, and others besides, are of
                    practical importance. The cultivation of sugar and coffee owes its development
                    mainly to the Dutch; and to them also is due the introduction of tea. They have
                    greatly encouraged the cultivation of the cocoa-nut among the natives, and it
                    now flourishes, especially in the coast districts, in almost every island in
                    their territory. The oil is very largely employed in native cookery. The
                    sago-palm is most abundant in the island of Ceram, but is also found growing
                    wild in Borneo, Celebes, Timor, and other islands of the Moluccas, in the Linga
                    archipelago, and in parts of Sumatra. The product is mainly prepared for export.
                    Pepper, nutmegs, and cloves were long the objects of the most important branch
                    of Dutch commerce; and camphor, dammar, benzoin, and other products of a similar
                    kind have a place among the exports. India-rubber and gutta percha are no longer
                    obtained to the same extent as formerly.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                <p>To the naturalist the Indian archipelago is a region of the highest interest; and
                    from an early period it has attracted the attention of explorers of the first
                    rank. And yet the list of its living forms is far from being completely
                    ascertained. The best known district is western Java, and Timor, the Moluccas,
                    and the Papuan Islands have for the most part been well explored. Only parts of
                    Sumatra, Borneo, and Celebes have been worked, and most of the other islands
                    have yet to be dealt with.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"

                <p>The ethnology of the Indian archipelago does not lack its difficult problems; but
                    some outstanding features are easily described. There are at least two main
                    native races, the brown long-haired Malay and the darker-skinned frizzly-haired
                    Papuan. And to these more recent explorations make it almost certain that a
                    third and probably more thoroughly aboriginal race—the Negrito—must bo added,
                    though even specialists who have had opportunities of direct observation are not
                    unanimous in regard to this noteworthy element. The Malays are subdivided into
                    an immense number of tribes and peoples in the most various stages of
                    civilization, and broadly differenced from each other by physical and linguistic
                    characteristics. Of chief note are the Malays proper, the Javanese, the Bugis,
                    the Tagalas, and Bisayas, the people of the Moluccas, the Dayaks (mainly in
                    Borneo), the Battaks of Sumatra, the Sulu islanders (closely similar to the
                    tribes of northern Borneo). The Papuan race is chiefly to be found in the
                    eastern section of the archipelago. Besides these three races, whose first
                    connexion with the archipelago dates from before the dawn of history, we have a
                    variety of intrusive elements, traceable by more or less strictly historical <pb
                    break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit12newyrich/page/n843/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0912-0843-0818"/> documents. A Hindu strain is evident in Java and
                    others of the western islands; Moors and Arabs (that is, as the names are used
                    in the archipelago, Mahometans from various countries between Arabia and India)
                    are found more or less amalgamated with many of the Malay peoples; and the
                    Chinese form, in an economical point of view, one of the most important sections
                    of the community in many of the more civilized districts. Chinese have been
                    established in the archipelago from a very early date: the first Dutch invaders
                    found them settled at Jacatra; and many of them, as, for instance, the colony of
                    Ternate, have taken so kindly to their new home that they have acquired Malay to
                    the disuse of their native tongue. Chinese tombs are among the objects that
                    strike the traveller’s attention at Amboyna and other ancient settlements.</p>

                <p>There is a vast field for philological explorations in the archipelago. Of the
                    very great number of distinct languages known to exist, few have been studied
                    scientifically. The most widely distributed is the Malay, which has not only
                    been diffused by the Malays themselves throughout the coast regions of the
                    various islands, but, owing partly to the readiness with which it can be
                    learned, has become the common medium between the Europeans and the natives. The
                    most cultivated of the native tongues is the Javanese, and it is spoken by a
                    greater number of people than any of the others. To it Sundanese stands in the
                    relation that Low German holds to High German, and the Madurese in the relation
                    of a strongly individualized dialect. Among the other languages which have been
                    reduced to writing and grammatically analysed are the Balinese, closely
                    connected with the Javanese, the Battak (with its dialect the Toba), the Dayak,
                    and the Macassarese (see the writings of R. van Eck, H. N. van der Tuuk, A.
                    Harde-Iand, and B. F. Matthes). Alfurese, a vague term meaning in the mouths of
                    the natives little else than pagan, is more particularly applied by the Dutch
                    philologists to the native speech of certain tribes in Celebes. The commercial
                    activity of the Buginese causes their language to be pretty widely
                    spoken,—little, however, by Europeans.</p>

                    of Behm and Wagner in 1880 has been already stated,—34,813,000. This gives the
                    comparatively sparse proportion of 45 to the square mile. The distribution, too,
                    is extremely unequal. In Java we have as much as 364 to the square mile, and in
                    the Philippines about 65, so that for the remaining islands the average is only
                    about 15, It would appear that when left in their natural savage or semi-savage
                    condition the natives increase very slowly in numbers, and in some cases hardly
                    maintain their ground.</p>
                <p>Politically the Indian archipelago is subject to a sixfold division:—the
                    independent native states and tribal territories, the Spanish possessions,
                    th&lt;e Portuguese possessions, the Dutch possessions, the English possessions,
                    and the state of Sarawak. The Dutch are by far the most influential power in the
                    archipelago. The Spanish authority is confined to the Philippines and the Sulu
                    archipelago,—the latter rendered tributary to them by the native sultan ia
                    August 1878 in return for an annual subsidy of 2400 dollars. The English, if the
                    island of Singapore be considered as belonging rather to the Malacca Peninsula,
                    possess only the island of Labuan (19,350 acres), acquired in 1847,—though the
                    establishment of the British Bornean Company in the north of the island may
                    prove the beginning of a new acquisition. To the Portuguese are subject part of
                    Timor and the island of Kambing, in all 6192 square miles. The Dutch on the
                    other hand claim, besides an area of 149,820 square miles in western New Guinea,
                    a total territory in the archipelago of 566,383 square miles, or forty-four
                    times as much as the governing country. Of the really independent native states
                    the largest is that belonging to the sultan of Brunei (Borneo); it is estimated
                    to have an area of about 88,000 square miles</p>
                <p>The Dutch divide their territory into two great divisions—(1) ∣ Java and Madura,
                    and (2) the Outer Possessions. The former, 1 which comprises also Bali and
                    Lombok, is administratively divided 1 into twenty-three residencies, which are
                    subdivided into departments or assistant residencies. The Outer Possessions are
                    organized in a similar manner, but several portions of them—the West Coast of
                    Sumatra, Celebes and its dependencies, and Achin or Atjh—constitute governments
                    with residencies under them. Of the other residencies the principal are those of
                    the East and South-East coasts of Sumatra, Riouw and its dependencies, the
                    island of Banka, Western Borneo, Southern and Eastern Borneo, Menado in the
                    north of Celebes, Timor, Amboyna, and Ternate, the last being nominally the most
                    extensive of all, from including an unusually large proportion of native
                    territory.</p>
                <p>The accusation frequently made against the Dutch that they furnished little
                    information about their East Indian possessions has long ceased to have any
                    foundation in fact. The Government publish at Batavia a large annual <hi

                    (including Armenians and Persians) and 1421 Arabs. Slavery was abolished in the
                    strictly Dutch portions of the Indies on the 1st of January 1860, and under
                    Dutch influence it is being abandoned by the native states.</p>
                <p>The functions of the governor-general of the Dutch possessions may briefly be
                    described as those of a viceroy. He has command over the land and sea forces,
                    and supreme supervision of all parts of the general administration. His also is
                    the right of declaring war and peace, and of concluding treaties with the native
                    princes and peoples. No sentence of death can be executed in time of peace
                    without his authority, and he enjoys the right of mercy and amnesty within
                    certain definite limits.</p>
                <p>The governor-general is assisted by a council <hi rend="italic">{Road van Ned er
                    - landsch Indie),</hi> consisting of a vice-president and four members (all
                    named by the king), assisted by a secretary. . In relation to the executive the
                    council is an advising body; but in the exercise of the legislative functions,
                    and in certain definite cases, if the governorgeneral disagrees with his
                    council, he must appeal to the king for direction. The council has its seat at
                    Batavia, and meets every Friday.</p>
                <p>The governor-general has besides a cabinet called the ‘ ‘ general secretariat,”
                    the head of which is the general secretary (assisted by two Government
                    secretaries), who acts as referee and adviser of the administration. Besides his
                    strictly secretarial duties he compiles the <hi rend="italic">StaaisblaR van
                    Nederlandsch Indie</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">Regerings</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Almanak voor Nederlandsch Indie</hi> (published since 1816). A
                    general chamber of accounts for the Dutch East Indies, consisting of a president
                    and six members, has its seat in Batavia.</p>
                <p>The administrative departments have undergone considerable changes from time to
                    time. At present there are five directors—(1) of inland administration, (2) of
                    education, religion, and industry, (3) ofpublic civil works, (4) of finances,
                    and (5) of justice, the last added in 1869. To the department of justice belong,
                    not only the supervision of the courts and law business, but that of the <hi
                    rend="italic">wecskamcrs</hi> and <hi rend="italic">boedel-kamers</hi> or
                    chambers of wardship and legacies, the granting of right of residence, the
                    control of the press, and the right of public meeting. The supreme court has its
                    seat at Batavia, and there is an elaborate and intricate system of subordinate
                    courts of justice, European and native. It is only the chief officials that are
                    Europeans, in accordance with the dominant policy in the whole constitution of
                    the departments of inland administration and justice, that the relations of
                    native with native should be left as much as possible in the hands of native
                    courts. In all about two hundred native princes are tributary to the Dutch
                    authorities.</p>
                <p>To the department of finance belong (1) the taxes and resources of the colony,
                    farmed or unfarmed, so far as they do not depend on some other department; (2)
                    the control of public auctions; (8) ti e mint; and (4) various duties connected
                    with the colonial budget and the colonial treasury. The custom of farming a
                    large part of the revenue has long been in vogue, and despite the theoretical
                    objections to the system, it has one great advantage, it pays. The sale of opium
                    is one of the principal Government “farms.” The cultivation of the poppy is
                    absolutely forbidden in the archipelago, and the demand is satisfied by imports
                    from British India and the Levant. From the Government supply so obtained the
                    contractor is obliged to take a certain definite quantity at a high fixed price;
                    beyond this he may purchase at ordinary cost price what he finds requisite. The
                    total gain from this monopoly was .£1,259,212 in 1879, though the local
                    authorities are instructed to do all in their power to prevent the spread of
                    opium-eating. The whole of what are called “the lesser resources” of the
                    Government, consisting of a curious miscellany of taxes, do not yield a third of
                    the opium revenue. Of the branches of the revenue not farmed, the chief are the
                    customs or import and export duties. The average these yielded for the five
                    years 1874-78 was £720,378. Two important taxes, known as the personal tax and
                    the income tax, both levied on Europeans, were introduced in 1879.</p>
                <p>The most striking feature in the administration of the Dutch East Indies is
                    undoubtedly this that, instead of being a drain on the resources of Holland, the
                    colony pays annually a most important contribution into the national exchequer.
                    When these possessions were taken over by the mother country they were burdened
                    with a large debt, and the financial state of the colony remained very
                    unsatisfactory for many years; but on the introduction of the culture system in
                    1830 the aspect of affairs was speedily changed, and in the fourteen years from
                    1865 to 1878 there was a clear gain of about £18,000,000 from the colonial
                    administration.</p>
                <p>On December 31, 1878, the strength of the military forces in the East Indies was
                    38,106 men, of whom nearly one half were Europeans. This, however, does not
                    include the militia corps, which were established in certain places. At the same
                    date the East Indian navy comprised 27 ships and 154 cannon. The strength of the
                    military manne was 2934 Europeans and 969 natives, while the vessels were manned
                    by 2630 Europeans and 1012 natives.</p>
                <p>There is an elaborate department of education, public worship, and industry; but
                    it is astonishing how little has hitherto been accomplished in the European
                    instruction and Christianizing of the natives.</p>
                <p>The educational organization consists of two departments—a European and a native;
                    but it is only within recent years that the latter has begun to attract the
                    active interest of the Government. For secondary European education the great
                    institution is the Gymnasium Willem Ill. at Batavia. In 1878 there were 68
                    Government primary schools for Europeans in Java and Madura, and 28 in the Outer
                    Possessions, with a total attendance of 7223 children. With the exception of
                    certain medical colleges, all the institutions in the native department are for
                    primary instruction. At the end of 1878 these schools numbered 376; 214 of them
                    were in the Outer Possessions. In Java and Madura there is a grand total of
                    28,000 native children receiving vernacular education, and if the Outer
                    Possessions are included the number must be more than doubled. There are nine
                    training schools for native teachers, most of them established since 1870; and
                    in 1879 four schools were opened for sons of the native princes and
                    aristocracy.</p>
                <p>The Protestant churches of the Dutch Indies compose a church union, administered
                    very much according to Presbyterian usage. The number of preachers and assistant
                    preachers is limited by Government, the former to 35 and the latter to 21, by a
                    royal decree of 1863. The Boman Catholics are under a vicar-apostolic, who is
                    also bishop of Batavia, and 20 of their ecclesiastics are paid by the state.
                    Christianity has not as yet made much progress among the natives, the returns
                    for 1878 showing only 174,462 native Christians, of whom 225 were Chinese. In
                    Java and Madura the Christians do not number so much as 1 in 2300 of the
                    population. Mahometanism is the religion of a large proportion of the natives,
                    and is at present making more advances in relation to the heathen population
                    than Christianity. The Dutch Government grants passes for about a shilling each
                    to those who wish to make the pilgrimage to Mecca; and the numbers who set out
                    in 1877, 1878, and 1879 respectively were 6893, 5632, and 5438, besides about
                    1500 from the native states.</p>
                <p>The administration of the department of public works shows that the Dutch have
                    not belied their European reputation for civil engineering and industrial
                    activity in their Indian colony. The roads and bridges, canals and irrigation
                    works, which they have executed in their central island win the admiration of
                    foreign visitants. Java is the only island which has even the beginning of a
                    railway system, but considerable progress has been made there; and the postal
                    and telegraph services are being rapidly developed.</p>
                <p>The total imports of private trade (including specie) amounted in 1876 to
                    116,392,762 florins (1 florin = Is. 8d.), and in 1877 to 126,066,462; and at the
                    same time 5,118,938 florins and 27,637,954 florins respectively were imported in
                    name of the Government. Of the 109,177,424 florins of general imports (excluding
                    specie) in 1876, 47,694,270 florins were from Holland, 33,042,854 from other
                    qountries outside of the archipelago, and no less than 27,632,294 from Singapore
                    alone; and of the Government imports 2,207,611 florins were from Holland and
                    2,033,910 from Singapore. In 1877 cotton manufactures figure among the general
                    imports for 43,566,127 florins, and yams for 3,325,323; rice for 7,798,348;
                    petroleum, 5,430,103; cigars, 2,892,369; tea, 2,405,511; coals, 2,268,520; and
                    iron and iron goods 2,362,525. The opium is the most extensive of the Government
                    imports.</p>
                <p>The general exports (specie excluded) were 154,229,384 florins for 1876 and
                    161,863,449 for 1877; those of the Government, 51,168,108 and 57,116,672. In
                    1876 the more important articles showed as follows:—coffee (private trade)
                    34,347,870 florins, (Government) 54,208,868 florins; sugar, 62,583,164 florins;

                <p>The Portuguese were the first Europeans to visit the Indian archipelago. Prior to
                    their appearance off Sumatra in 1509 under· Diogo Lopez la Sequiera, a Hindu
                    civilization, having, its chief seat in Java, had flourished and waned, and
                    Mahometanism had succeeded to a considerable share of its inheritance. In 1521,
                    when the Portuguese name had become familiar in the islands, the Spaniards under
                    Magellan made their appearance from the east. Hostilities ensued, which
                    continued till the treaty of 1529, by which the boundary between Spaniards and
                    Portuguese was fixed at 17° E. of the Moluccas,—a line which afterwards proved
                    matter of dispute. The two powers were undisturbed except by an unimportant
                    French expedition till 1596, when the Dutch reached what was destined to be the
                    scene of their greatest colonial achievements. In that year Cornelis Houtman
                    appeared before Bantam, the chief town of a powerful kingdom in Java, and his
                    expedition was but the precursor of many others from Holland. The commercial
                    success of these enterprises led in 1602 to the establishment of the Dutch East
                    Indian Company, which obtained by Government <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0912-0845-0820"/> charter the monopoly of the Dutch trade of the
                    countries between the Straits of Magellan and the Cape of Good Hope, with the
                    right of concluding treaties, appointing governors, &amp;c. The first fleet sent
                    out by the new Company under Van der Hagen was instrumental in capturing the
                    Portuguese fort of Amboyna, and the peace of Treves in 1609 set the Dutch free
                    from interference on the part of the Spaniards. In the same year the
                    states-general appointed a governor-general of the East Indies, giving the
                    Company the right of appointing his successor, subject to their approval.</p>
                <p>The instructions given to Pieter Both, the first governor, struck the key-note of
                    that policy which has brought so much obloquy on the Dutch name, and prevented
                    the better features of their colonial administration from being appreciated. He
                    was to “give all endeavour in order that the commerce of the Moluccas, Amboyna,
                    and Banda should belong to the Company, and that no other nation in the world
                    should have the least part.” When he came into power there were already Dutch
                    forts at Jilolo, Ternate, and Batchian, and the people of Banda had granted the
                    Dutch the monopoly of nutmegs. It was to the fourth governor (J. P. Coen,
                    1619-23 and 1627-29) that the Company were most indebted for their territorial
                    aggrandizement. He was the founder of Batavia (1620), and the first to introduce
                    a regular system of accounts in the affairs of the Company. During his rule a
                    treaty was concluded between the English and Dutch companies, but unfortunately
                    the goodwill which might have resulted from it was not of long duration. Specx
                    (1629-32) gave a start to the trade with Japan, which afterwards grew to vast
                    and various issues. The governorship of Van Diemen (1636-45) was signalized by a
                    series of successes over the Portuguese, and the introduction of the first code
                    of laws. The Dutch power in the archipelago extended rapidly during the latter
                    part of the century. Peace was made with the Portuguese (1661), and various
                    native kingdoms acquired. In the beginning of the 18th century the expense of
                    the necessary military operations and general administration, with other causes,
                    brought the colony into financial difficulties, and in the latter part of the
                    century it was greatly damaged by the rapidly growing predominance of the
                    English in India and Ceylon. The loss of their possessions in India, however,
                    caused the Dutch to give more attention to the archipelago, and they continued
                    to increase their territory. At the same time the state of the finances grew
                    worse and worse, leading to the complete abolition of the Company’s authority in
                    1800, when their possessions and liabilities were both appropriated by the
                    nation. During the term of office of H. W. Daendels (1808-11), the English, who
                    some years before had threatened Batavia and captured Teraate, made themselves
                    masters of the Moluccas, and his successor Janssens was obliged in 1811 to
                    surrender the colony and its capital to Lord Minto.<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>See <hi rend="italic">Life of Lord
                    Minto.</hi></p></note> The British occupation lasted for five years, and during
                    most of this time the post of governor-general was held by Sir Stamford Raffles,
                    who acted perhaps too much on the supposition that the English occupation would
                    be permanent, and was undoubtedly biased by strong prejudice against the Dutch,
                    but at the same time did not forget Lord Minto’s advice “to do as much good as
                    he could.” To the Dutch themselves this temporary government by the English did
                    ultimate service. The example set by Raffles, when he showed so keen an interest
                    in all that related to the country and the people, proved a stimulus to his
                    Dutch successors; and the whole relation of the Government to scholarship and
                    investigation has been placed on a more liberal and European footing. The
                    restoration of the East Indian possessions to the Dutch was decided by the
                    treaty of 1814, but was not carried out till 1816, when Baron van der Capellan
                    became governor-general.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"
                    ><p>The following is a list of the Dutch governors from that date :—Godert A. G.
                    P. Baron van der Capellan (19th August 1816 to 1st January 1826); Hendrik Mercus
                    de Kock (lieut.-gov.-gen., 1826 to 16th January 1830); Count Johannes van den

                    of local disturbances followed the change of government, and a more serious war
                    in Java (1825-30) required a special expedition from Holland. The year 1830 saw
                    the beginning of that famous “culture” system, under Van den Bosch, to which so
                    much of the financial success and peaceful administration of the modern Dutch
                    government must be ascribed. In 1846 a new code of laws was introduced. The
                    recent history of the colony may be briefly described as a gradual but steady
                    extension of the authority of the Dutch Government, marked by a succession of
                    revolts, disturbances, expeditions, skirmishes, and subjugations; a gradual but
                    steady endeavour to develop the resources of the country; and, it may happily be
                    added, an endeavour growing ever stronger and more enlightened to improve the
                    condition of the subject races.</p>
