                <p><label type="entry">ICE-HOUSE</label>. An ice-house, to supply ice for domestic
                    use during the summer months, is one of the desirable adjuncts of a country
                    residence. The old form of icehouse was a well several feet deep, dug out on
                    sloping ground or against a bank. The bottom was made to slope towards a sunk
                    drain, covered by an iron grating, to permit the water from the melted ice to
                    pass away quickly; while a dip in the drain or a bend in the pipe prevented air
                    from entering at the bottom of the well. The ice was filled in through an
                    opening in the dome, which had to be carefully closed.</p>
                <p>A good form of ice-house is that recommended many years ago by Mr Bailey,
                    gardener at Nuneham Park, Oxford, and described in the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Gardener’s Magazine of Botany</hi> (i. 82). This house is shown in section and
                    plan in fig. 1, where the dotted line indicates the ground level. The well or
                    receptacle for the ice <hi rend="italic">a</hi> is 10 fest 6 inches wide at the
                    base, and 3 feet wider near the top; the walls are hollow, the outer portion
                    being built of dry rough stone, and the inner wall and dome <hi rend="italic"
                    >f</hi> of brick. The outer wall <hi rend="italic">e</hi> might be replaced by a
                    puddling of clay, carried up as the work proceeds. Over the top is a mound of
                    clay and soil <hi rend="italic">g,</hi> which is planted with shrubs to keep the
                    surface cool in summer. The drain <hi rend="italic">i</hi> carries off the water
                    formed by the melted ice, and is provided with a trap <hi rend="italic">h</hi>
                    to prevent the ingress of air through the drain. There is a porch or lobby <hi
                    rend="italic">b</hi> provided with an outer and an inner door <hi rend="italic"
                    >c, c</hi>; and there are apertures at <hi rend="italic">d, d,</hi> to get rid
                    of the condensed moisture, which, if not removed, would waste the ice. These
                    ventilating doors should be opened every night, and closed again early in the
                    morning. The most important conditions to be secured are dryness of the soil and
                    of the enclosed atmosphere, compactness in the body of ice, which should be
                    broken fine and closely rammed, and the exclusion as far as possible of air.</p>
                <p>The Americans, who use large quantities of ice, always store it above ground. One
                    of their ice-houses, of which the elevation is shown in fig. 2 and the plan in
                    fig. 3, described in Allan’s <hi rend="italic">Rural Architecture,</hi> is both
                    simple and ornamental in character. The house may be 12 feet square, or any
                    larger size. A series of posts in pairs are set up 1 ∣ feet apart and 8 feet
                    high, about 1 foot being inserted firmly in the ground; the distance between
                    each pair is 3 feet. The tops being cut level all round, a plate 6 inches wide
                    and 4 to 6 inches deep is spiked on to each line of posts, the two plates being
                    strongly stayed by cross pieces so as to form a double frame. The inner face of
                    each line of posts is now boarded up closely, leaving a space 6∣ feet by 3 feet
                    at the sides, which are also boarded, to form a door-casing on each side. The
                    spaces between the two lines of boards thus form a continuous box, which is to
                    be completely filled up with moist tan, bark, or sawdust, well packed
                    throughout. There must be a drain to carry off all water from the interior.
                    Within the enclosed space some level joists are laid down, and on them loose
                    planks to form a floor, which when covered 1 foot thick with straw is ready to
                    receive the ice. The roof is formed of rafters, 4 inches by 3, long enough to
                    project at least 4 feet outside the plates, to which they must be well secured
                    by spikes. The rafters are tobe boarded over and covered with shingle, and a
                    small opening left at the top to admit a pipe 8 inches in diameter for a
                    ventilator,over which a small ornamental cap, supported on four little posts, is
                    to be placed. As a finish to the projecting roof, brackets of 3 by 4 inch
                    scantling, if the joists are of sawed stuff, or of rough limbs of trees to match
                    the posts, if these are rough, may be introduced. After the ice is stored, a
                    close floor of boards should be laid on joists resting loosely on the wall plate
                    (to admit of this upper floor being removed while the house is being filled),
                    and they must be covered with 6 inches of tan or sawdust, or failing these with
                    straw. A good layer of tan or sawdust should also be placed on the top of the
                    ice when it is put in. There should be two doors, inside and outside the lining,
                    both opening outwards. A shady place is desirable, but not essential.</p>
                <p>A still less expensive way of storing ice has been described by the late Mr
                    Pearson of Kinlet in the <hi rend="italic">Gardener’s Journal</hi> (iii. 10). In
                    this case the ice-stack was made on sloping ground close to the pond whence the
                    ice was derived. The ice was beaten small, well rammed, and gradually worked up
                    into a cone or mound 15 feet high, with a base of 27 feet, and protected by a
                    compact covering of fern 3 feet thick. A dry situation with a sloping surface is
                    necessary where this plan is adopted, and a small ditch should surround the
                    heap, to drain away any water that may come from melted ice or from other
                    sources.</p>
