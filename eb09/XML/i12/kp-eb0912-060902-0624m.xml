                    Khaldoun ibn Othmân, who came over with a band of Arab warriors and settled at
                    Carmona in Spain. The family afterwards established itself in Seville, which it
                    quitted for Tunis on the approach of Ferdinand III. Ibn Khaldoun at an early age
                    applied himself to the study of the various branches of Arabic learning with
                    very great success, and entered the employment of the sultan as private
                    secretary at the age of twenty-one. Not believing, however, in the stability of
                    his master’s throne, he soon afterwards took refuge with and obtained employment
                    under the Merinide sultan Abu Einân at Fez. In the beginning of the year 1356,
                    his integrity hiving been suspected, he was thrown into prison until the death
                    of Abu Einân in 1358, when the vizier El Hasan ibn Omar set him at liberty, and
                    reinstated him in his rank and offices. He here continued to render great
                    service to Abu Salem, Abu Einân’s successor, but, having offended the prime
                    minister, his position became less pleasant at court, and he sought and obtained
                    permission to emigrate to Spain, where, at Granada, he was received with great
                    cordiality by Ibn el Ahmer, who had been greatly indebted to his good offices
                    when an exile at the court of Abu Salem. The favours and honours he received
                    from the sovereign soon, however, excited the jealousy of the vizier, and he was
                    driven back to Africa, where he was received with great cordiality by the sultan
                    of Bujaiye, Abu Abdallah, who had been formerly his companion in prison.
                    Jealousies and intrigues again drove him forth, this time to take refuge with
                    the lord of Biskera, Ahmed ibn el Mozni. In answer to an appeal from the sultan
                    of Tlemcen, Ibn Khaldoun raised a large force amongst the desert Arabs of the
                    district, and passed over to the service of that prince. A few years later he
                    was taken prisoner by Abd el Aziz, who had defeated the sultan of Tlemcen and
                    seized upon the thtone. He then entered a monastic establishment, and occupied
                    himself with scholastic duties, until in the year 1370 he was sent for to
                    Tlemcen by the new sultan, Abd el Aziz. After the death of Abd el Aziz he
                    resided at Fez, enjoying the patronage and confidence of the regent. After some
                    further vicissitudes he entered the service of the sultan of his native town of
                    Tunis, where he devoted himself almost exclusively to his studies. Having
                    received permission to make the pilgrimage to Mecca, he set out and reached
                    Cairo, where his reputation had already preceded him, and was presented to the
                    sultan, El Melek ed Dhaher Berkouk, who insisted on his remaining there, and in
                    the year 1384 promoted him to the high rank of grand cadi of the Malekite rite
                    for Cairo. This office he filled with great prudence and probity, and succeeded
                    in removing a mass of abuses with which the administration of justice in Egypt
                    was overgrown. A terrible misfortune now fell upon him; the ship in which his
                    wife and family, with all his property, were coming to join him, was
                    shipwrecked, and every one on board lost. He endeavoured to find consolation in
                    fresh devotion to his studies, and to the completion of his great work the <hi
                    rend="italic">History of the A rabs of Spain,</hi> in which he had long been
                    engaged. At the same time he was removed from his office of cadi, which gave him
                    still more leisure for his work. Three years later he made the pilgrimage to
                    Mecca, and on his return lived in strict retirement at the village of Faiyoum
                    until 1399, when he was again called upon to resume his functions as cadi. He
                    was removed and reinstated in the office no less than five times.</p>
                <p>In the month of Rabi a I. 803 <hi rend="smallcaps">a.h.</hi> (October to November
                    1400 A.D.), he was sent to Damascus, in connexion with the expedition intended
                    to oppose the celebrated Timur or Tamerlane. When Timur had become master of the
                    situation, Ibn Khaldoun let himself down from the walls of the city by a rope,
                    and presented himself before the conqueror, who, charmed with his dignified
                    appearance and his learned discourse, permitted him to return to Egypt. Ibn
                    Khaldoun died on the 25th Ramadhan 808 A.H. (16th March 1406), at the age of
                    sixty-four.</p>
                <p>The great work by which he is known is a “Universal History,” but it deals more
                    particularly with the history of the Arabs of Spain and Africa. Its Arabic title
                    is <hi rend="italic">KitΛb el</hi><hi rend="italic superscript"> i</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Iber, wα diwdη el Mubtadd u·a</hi> ’ <hi rend="italic">l
                    Khaber,</hi><hi rend="italic">fi</hi><hi rend="italic">aiydm el 'Arab wa</hi> ’
                    <hi rend="italic">l 'Ajam wa</hi> ’ <hi rend="italic">l Berber</hi>; that is,
                    “The Book of Examples and the Collection of Origins and Information respecting
                    the History of the Arabs, Foreigners, and Berbers.” It consists of three books,
                    an introduction, and an autobiography. Book i. treats of the influence of
                    civilization upon man; book ii. of the history of the Arabs and other peoples
                    from the remotest antiquity until the author’s own times; book iii. of the
                    history of the Berber tribes and of the kingdoms founded by that race in North
                    Africa. The introduction is an elaborate treatise on the science of history and
                    the development of society, and the autobiography contains the history, not only
                    of the author himself, but of his family and of the dynasties which ruled in
                    Fez, Tunis, and TIemcen during his lifetime. An admirable edition of the Arabic
                    text has been printed at Boulak (Cairo), and a part of the work has been
                    translated by the late Baron de Sh∣ne under the title of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Histoire des Berbères</hi> (Algiers, 1852-56); it contains an admirable account
                    of the author and analysis of his work. (E. H. P.)</p>
