                    occupiec∣ by fruitful gardens and orchards, forming an oasis in the midst of
                    wide-stretching barrenness and desolation. The numerous richly adorned mosques,
                    chapels, shrines, and monuments attest the former importance of the city when in
                    the zenith of its power and prosperity, and lend additional brightness and
                    picturesqueness to its appearance as seen from a distance; but on closer
                    inspection the splendour is seen to be so intermixed with squalor and decay as
                    to degenerate into tawdriness. Ancient walls about 2 miles in circumference
                    surround the older part of the town, but one half of the inhabited portion is
                    outside their boundaries. These walls were built by the Seljuk sultans in the
                    13th century of large square blocks of stone which have evidently formed part of
                    more ancient edifices; and they are flanked by square towers richly adorned with
                    cornices, demi-lions couchant, eagles with outspread wings, and Arabic
                    inscriptions. The gateways are ornamented with alto-rilievos representing
                    figures in procession. Great part of the space inside the walls is occupied by
                    crumbling ruins of houses, and by dilapidated mosques half-buried in rubbish and
                    overgrown by weeds. Of the ancient Greek city there are now no remains, but
                    Greek inscriptions are to be found in the ancient walls erected by the Turkish
                    conquerors, and bas-reliefs and other relics have been dug up at various
                    periods. Modern Konieh lies to the south-west of the old town, half of it being
                    outside the walls. The houses are one-storied, unplastered, and built mostly of
                    sun-dried bricks and wood. Among the numerous monuments of saints and sheiks is
                    the famous green monument of Mevlana-Djelâl-eddin-Rûmi, the poet and founder of
                    the spinning dervishes, large numbers of whom have taken up their quarters in
                    the surrounding gardens. The most beautiful building of the city is the court
                    mosque, with a lofty and finely tapering minaret glittering with porcelain. Of
                    the old residence castle situated on the hill within the boundaries there are
                    now only a few remains, great part of it having been used in building the Konak
                    or palace of the pasha. Adjoining the ruins of the castle there is an old
                    Byzantine chapel dedicated to St Thecla. Below the castle, and forming part of
                    the western wall of the town, there is another fortress in a pretty good state
                    of preservation, and for many years used as a state prison. The bazaar has a
                    miserable appearance, and the principal goods exposed for sale are English and
                    Swiss cottons and Nuremberg wares, the oppressive regulations of the Turkish
                    Government in regard to the importation of salt having rendered the rearing of
                    sheep wholly unprofitable, and thus entirely destroyed the native cloth-weaving
                    industry. The number of dwelling-houses is about 7000, of which 150 are
                    Armenian; and the population numbers in all probability between 40,000 and
                    50,000.</p>
                <p>Iconium was situated on the military road between Antioch of Pisidia and Derbe.
                    By Strabo (xii. 6, 1) it is spoken of as a small town <hi rend="italic"
                    >(πολιχνών),</hi> but by Pliny (Zf. <hi rend="italic">N.,</hi> v. 25) as a very
                    celebrated city. Xenophon <hi rend="italic">(Anαb.,</hi> i. 2, 19) mentions it
                    as the nearest town to Phrygia; but Cicero <hi rend="italic">(Ad Div.,</hi> iii.
                    6-8; xv. 4) calls it the capital of Lycaonia; while Ammianus Marcellinus (xiv.
                    2) reckons it as belonging to Pisidia. In the time of Pliny its territory formed
                    a tetrarchy which embraced fourteen cities, many of them of considerable size.
                    The apostle Paul visited Iconium on his first missionary tour from Antioch, and
                    founded a Christian community there, but on account of the hostility of the Jews
                    he deemed it expedient to retire to Lystra. Subsequently he twice visited the
                    city; and it is the scene of the apocryphal story of Paul and Thecla, mentioned
                    by many of the early fathers. About this time it became a Roman <hi
                    rend="italic">cοlοnia,</hi> its Roman name being <hi rend="italic">Claudia</hi>
                    or <hi rend="italic">Claudiconium.</hi> A Christian synod met at Iconium in 235.
                    Under the rule of the Byzantine emperors the city continued to flourish, but in
                    708 it was conquered by the Arabs and incorporated in the caliphate. Having been
                    conquered by the Seljuk Turks in 1074, Kilidj Arslan 1. in 1097 made it his
                    residence, and the capital of a kingdom whose rulers were named sultans of
                    Iconium, and which may be regarded as the cradle of the Ottoman power. On May
                    18, 1190, Frederick Barbarossa, after a victory over the Turks on the 7th,
                    captured the town, but failed to storm the castle. From 1244 the sultans were
                    alternately deposed and reinstated by the khans of the Mongols, until the
                    dismemberment of the sultanate on the death of Masoud II. in 1294, when their
                    territories were added to Caramania, which in 1392 acknowledged the sovereignty
                    of the Porte, and in 1486 was incorporated with the Ottoman empire. On 30th
                    December 1832 the city was the scene of a victory over the Turks by Ibrahim
                    Pasha. See Kinneir, <hi rend="italic">Travels in Asia Minor',</hi> Hamilton, <hi
