                    (see vol. viii. p. 122) being the resin of <hi rend="italic">Boswellia

                    coast of Cutch, is used as incense in the temples of western India. The animal
                    excreta, musk and civet, also enter into the composition of modern European
                    pastils and clous fumants. Balsam of Tolu, produced by <hi rend="italic"
                    >Myroxylon toluiferum,</hi> a native of Venezuela and New Granada; balsam of

                    quotes a faculty granted by Pope PiusV. (August 2, 1571) to the bishops of the
                    West Indies permitting the substitution of balsam of Peru for the balsam of the
                    East in the preparation of the chrism to be used by the Catholic Church in
                    America. The <hi rend="italic">Sangre del drago</hi> of the Mexicans is a resin

                <p>Probably nowhere can the actual historical progress from the primitive use of
                    animal sacrifices to the later refinement of burning incense be more clearly
                    traced than in the pages of the Old Testament, where no mention of the latter
                    solemnity occurs before the period of the Mosaic legislation; but in the
                    monuments of ancient Egypt the authentic traces of the use of incense which
                    still exist carry us back to a much earlier date. From Meroe to Memphis the <pb

                    interiors of the temples is that of some contemporary Phrah or Pharaoh
                    worshipping the presiding deity with oblations of gold and silver vessels, rich
                    vestments, gems, the firstlings of the flock and herd, cakes, fruits, flowers,
                    wine, anointing oil, and incense. Generally he holds in one hand the censer, and
                    with the other darts the pastils or osselets of incense into it; sometimes he
                    offers incense in one hand and makes the libation of wine with the other. One of
                    the best known of these representations is that carved on the memorial stone
                    placed by Thothmes IV. (1533 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi>) on the breast of

                    the sun-god Ra, pouring a libation of wine on one side and offering incense on
                    the other. The ancient Egyptians used various substances as incense. They
                    worshipped Ra at sunrise with resin, at mid-day with myrrh, and at sunset with
                    an elaborate confection called <hi rend="italic">huphi,</hi> compounded of no
                    fewer than sixteen ingredients, among which were honey, wine, raisins, resin,
                    myrrh, and sweet calamus. While it was being mixed, holy writings were read to
                    those engaged in the operation. According to Plutarch, apart from its mystic
                    virtues arising from the magical combination of 4 χ 4, its sweet odour had a
                    benign physiological effect on those who offered it.<note anchored="true"

                    Isis, the carcase of the steer, after evisceration, was filled with fine bread,

                    was roasted, being basted all the while by pouring over it large quantities of
                    sweet oil, and then eaten with great festivity.</p>
                <p>How important the consumption of frankincense in the worship of the gods became
                    in Egypt is shown by two of its monuments, which are of the greatest interest
                    and value for the light they throw on the early history of the commerce of the
                    Indian Ocean. One is an inscription in the rocky valley of Hammamat, through
                    which the desert road from the Red Sea to the valley of Egypt opens on the green
                    fields and palm groves of the river Nile near Coptos. It was cut on the rocks by
                    an Egyptian nobleman named Hannu, who states that he was sent by Pharaoh
                    Sankhara, 2500 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.,</hi> with a force gathered out of the
                    Thebaid, from Coptos to the Red Sea, there to take command of a naval expedition
                    to the Holy Land of Punt, “to bring back odoriferous gums.” Punt is identified
                    with the Somali country, which is now known to be the native country of the
                    trees that yield the bulk of the frankincense of commerce. The other bears the
                    record of a second expedition to the same land of Punt, undertaken by command of
                    Queen Hasop, 1600 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> It is preserved in the vividly
                    chiselled and richly coloured decorations which portray the history of the reign
                    of this famous Pharaoh on the walls of the “Stage Temple” at Thebes. The temple
                    is now in ruins, but the entire series of gorgeous pictures recording the
                    expedition to “the balsam land of Punt,” from its leaving to its returning to
                    Thebes, still remains intact and undefaced.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                <p>These are the only authenticated instances of the export of incense trees from
                    the Somali country until Colonel Playfair, then political agent at Aden, in
                    1862-64, collected and sent to Bombay the specimens from which Dr Birdwood
                    prepared his descriptions of them for theLinnean Society in 1868. King Antigonus
                    is said to have had a branch of the true frankincense tree sent to him.</p>
                <p>Homer tells us that the Egyptians of his time were emphatically a nation of
                    druggists (OcZ. iv. 229, 230). This characteristic, in which, as in many others,
                    they remarkably resemble the Hindus, the Egyptians have maintained to the
                    present day · and, although they have changed their religion, the use of incense
                    among them continues to be as familiar and formal as ever. The <hi rend="italic"
                    >hohl</hi> or black powder with which the modern, like the ancient, Egyptian
                    ladies paint their languishing eyelids, is nothing but the smeeth of charred
                    frankincense, or other odoriferous resin, which is brought with frankincense,
                    and phials of water from the well of Zem-zem, by the returning pilgrims from
                    Mecca. They also melt frankincense as a depilatory, and smear their hands with a
                    paste into the composition of which frankincense enters, for the purpose of
                    communicating to them an attractive perfume. Herodotus (iv. 75) describes a
                    similar artifice as practised by the women of Scythia (compare also Judith x. 3,
                    4). In cold weather the Egyptians warm their rooms by placing in them a brazier,
                    “chafing-dish,” or “standing-dish,” filled with charcoal, in which incense is
                    burnt; and in hot weather they refresh them by occasionally swinging a hand
                    censer by a chain through them—frankincense, benzoin, and aloe wood being
                    chiefly used for the purpose.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                <p>In the authorized version of the Bible, the word “incense” translates two wholly
                    distinct Hebrew words. In various passages in the latter portion of Isaiah
                    (xl.-lxvi.), in Jeremiah, and in Chronicles, it represents the Hebrew <hi
                    rend="italic">lebôndh,</hi> more usually rendered “frankincense”; elsewhere the
                    original word is <hi rend="italic">hetoreth</hi> (Ex. xxx. 8, 9, Lev. x. 1, Num.
                    vii. 14, &amp;c.), a derivative of the verb <hi rend="italic">hitter</hi> (Pi.)
                    or <hi rend="italic">hihtir</hi> (Hiph.), which verb is used, not only in Ex.
                    xxx. 7, but also in Lev. i. 9, iii. 11, ix. 13, and many other passages, to
                    denote the process by which the “savour of satisfaction” in any burnt offering,
                    whether of flesh or of incense is produced. Sometimes in the authorized version
                    (as in 1 Kings iii. 3, 1 Sam. ii. 28) it is made to mean explicitly the burning
                    of incense with only doubtful propriety. The expression “incense (ketoreth) of
                    rams” in Ps. Ixvi. 15 and the allusion in Ps. cxli. 2 ought both to be
                    understood, most probably, of ordinary burnt offerings.<note anchored="true"

                    be regarded as most holy, and the imitation of which was prohibited under the
                    severest penalties, was compounded of four “sweet scents” (sammim),<note

                    “put before the testimony” in the “tent of meeting.” It was burnt on the altar
                    of incense (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Altar,</hi> vol. i. p. 640) by the priest
                    every morning when the lamps were trimmed in the holy place, <pb break="no"

                    up” (Ex. XXX. 7, 8). A handful of it was also burnt once a year in the holy of
                    holies by the high priest on a pan of burning coals taken from the altar of
                    burnt-offering (Lev. xvi. 12, 13). Pure frankincense (lebonah) formed part of
                    the meat offering (Lev. ii. 16, vi. 15), and was also presented along with the
                    shew bread (Lev. xxiv. 7) every Sabbath day (probably on two golden saucers; see
                    Jos., <hi rend="italic">Ant.,</hi> iii. 10, 7). The religious significance of
                    the use of incense, or at least of its use in the holy of holies, is distinctly
                    set forth in Lev. xvi. 12, 13.</p>
                <p>The Jews were also in the habit of using odoriferous substances in connexion with
                    the funeral obsequies of distinguished persons (see 2 Chron. xvi. 14, xxi. 19;
                    Jer. xxxiv. 5). In Am. vi. 10 “he that burneth him’’probably means “he that
                    burns perfumes in his honour.” References to the domestic use of incense occur
                    in Cant. iii. 6, Prov. xxvii. 9, <hi rend="italic">cf.</hi> vii. 17.</p>
                <p>The “marbles” of Nineveh furnish frequent examples of the offering of incense to
                    the sun-god and his consort (2 Kings xxiii. 5). The kings of Assyria united in
                    themselves the royal and priestly offices, and on the monuments they erected
                    they are generally represented as offering incense and pouring out wine to the
                    tree of life. They probably carried the incense in the sacred bag which is so
                    frequently seen in their hands and in those also of the common priests.
                    According to Herodotus (i. 183), frankincense to the amount of 1000 talents’
                    weight was offered every year, during the feast of Bel, on the great altar at
                    his temple in Babylon.</p>
                <p>The monuments of Persepolis and the coins of the Sassanians show that the
                    religious use of incense was as common in ancient Persia as in Babylonia and
                    Assyria. Five times a day the priests of the Persians (Zoroastrians) burnt
                    incense on their sacred fire altars. In the Avesta <hi rend="italic">(
                    Vendidad,</hi> Fargard xix. 24, 40), the incense they used is named <hi
                    rend="italic">υohu gaonο.</hi> It has been identified with benzoin, but was
                    probably frankincense. Herodotus (iii. 97) states that the Arabs brought every
                    year to Darius as tribute 1000 talents of frankincense. The Parsees still
                    preserve in western India the pure tradition of the ritual of incense as
                    followed by their race from probably the most ancient times.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Ramayaηa</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Mahabharata</hi> afford
                    evidence of the employment of incense by the Hindus, in the worship of the gods
                    and the burning of the dead, from the remotest antiquity. Its use was obviously
                    continued by the Buddhists during the prevalence of their religion in India, for
                    it is still used by them in Nepal, Tibet, Ceylon, Burmah, China, and Japan.
                    These countries all received Buddhism from India, and a large proportion of the
                    porcelain and earthenware articles imported from China and Japan into Europe
                    consists of innumerable forms of censers. The Jains all over India burn sticks
                    of incense before their Jina. The commonest incense in ancient India was
                    probably frankincense. The Indian frankincense tree, <hi rend="italic"
                    >Boswellia</hi><hi rend="italic">thurifera,</hi> Colebrooke (which certainly
                    includes <hi rend="italic">B. glabra,</hi> Roxburgh), is a doubtful native of
                    India. It is found chiefly where the Buddhist religion prevailed in ancient
                    times, in Bihar and along the foot of the Himalayas and in western India, where
                    it particularly flourishes in the neighbourhood of the caves of Ajanta. It is
                    quite possible therefore that, in the course of their widely extended commerce
                    during the one thousand years of their ascendency, the Buddhists imported the
                    true frankincense trees from Africaand Arabia into India, and thatthe accepted
                    Indian species are merely varieties of them. Now, however, the incense in
                    commonest use in India is benzoin. But the consumption of all manner of
                    odoriferous resins, gum resins, roots, woods, dried leaves, flowers, fruits, and
                    seeds in India, in social as well as religious observances, is enormous. The
                    grateful perfumed powder <hi rend="italic">abir</hi> or <hi rend="italic"
                    >randa</hi> is composed either of rice, flour, mango bark or deodar wood,
                    camphor, and aniseed, or of sandalwood or wood aloes, zerumbet, zedoary, rose
                    flowers, camphor, and civet. The incense sticks and pastils known all over India
                    under the names of <hi rend="italic">ud-buti</hi> (“benzoin-light”) or <hi
                    rend="italic">aggar-ki-buti</hi> (“wood aloes light ”) are composed of benzoin,
                    wood aloes, sandalwood, rock lichen, patchouli, rose·malloes, <hi rend="italic"
                    >Flacourtia</hi> leaf <hi rend="italic">(tajisput-tree),</hi> mastic, and sugar
                    candy or gum. The <hi rend="italic">abir</hi> and <hi rend="italic">aggir
                    butis</hi> madeat the Mahometan city of Bijarpur in the Mahratta country are
                    celebrated all over western India. The Indian Mussulmans indeed were rapidly
                    degenerating into a mere sect of Hindus before the Wahabi revival, and the more
                    recent political propaganda in support of the false caliphate of the sultans of
                    Turkey; and we therefore find the religious use of incense among them more
                    general than among the Mahometans of any other country. They use it at the
                    ceremonies of circumcision, <hi rend="italic">bismil·lah</hi> (teaching the
                    child “the name of God ”), virginity, and marriage. At marriage they burn
                    benzoin with <hi rend="italic">nim</hi> seeds to keep off evil spirits, and
                    prepare the bridecakes by putting a quantity of benzoin between layers of
                    wheaten dough, closed all round, and frying them in clarified butter. For days
                    the bride is fed on little else. In their funeral ceremonies, the moment the
                    spirit has fled incense is burnt before the corpse until it is carried out to be
                    buried. The begging fakirs also go about with a lighted stick of incense in one
                    hand, and holding out with the other an incense-holder (literally, “incense
                    chariot”), into which the coins of the pious are thrown. Large “incense trees”
                    resembling our Christmas trees, formed of incense-sticks and pastils and
                    osselets, and alight all over, are borne by the Shiah Mussulmans in the annual
                    procession of the Mohurrum, in commemoration of the martyrdom of the sons of
                    Ali. The worship of the <hi rend="italic">tulsi</hi> plant, or holy basil, by
                    the Hindus is popularly explained by its consecration to Vishnu and Krishna. It
                    grows on the four-horned altar before the house, or in a pot placed in one of
                    the front windows, and is worshipped every morning by all the female members of
                    every Hindu household. It is possible that its adoration has survived from the
                    times when the Hindus buried their dead in their houses, beneath the family
                    hearth. When they came into a hot climate the fire of the sacrifices and
                    domestic cookery was removed out of the house; but the dead were probably still
                    for a while buried in or near it, and the <hi rend="italic">tulsi</hi> was
                    planted over their graves, at once for the salubrious fragrance it diffuses and
                    to represent the burning of incense on the altar of the family lar.</p>
                <p>As to the <hi rend="italic">θveα</hi> mentioned in Homer <hi rend="italic"

                    Days,</hi> 338), there is some uncertainty whether they were incense offerings
                    at all, and if so, whether they were ever offered alone, and not always in
                    conjunction with animal sacrifices. That the domestic use, however, of the

                    was known in the Homeric age, is shown by the case of Calypso <hi rend="italic"
                    >(OL</hi> v. 60), and the very similarity of the word <hi rend="italic"
                    >θvov</hi> to <hi rend="italic">θvo&lt;s</hi> may be taken as almost
                    conclusively proving that by that time the same wood was also employed for
                    religious purposes. It is not probable that the sweet smelling gums and resins
                    of the countries of the Indian Ocean began to be introduced into Greece before
                    the 8th or 7th century B.C., and doubtless <hi rend="italic">λ</hi><hi

                    Psammetichus (670 B.C.). The new Oriental word is frequentlyemployed by
                    Herodotus; and there are abundant references to the use of the thing among the
                    writers of the golden age of Attic literature (see, <pb break="no"

                    >Clouds,</hi> 426; <hi rend="italic">Wasps,</hi> 96, 861). Frankincense,
                    however, though the most common, never became the only kind of incense offered
                    to the gods among the Greeks. Thus the Orphic Hymns are careful to specify, in
                    connexion with the several deities celebrated, a great variety of substances
                    appropriate to the service of each; in the case of many of these the selection
                    seems to have been determined not at all by their fragrance but by some occult
                    considerations which it is now difficult to divine.</p>
                <p>Among the Romans the use of religious fumigations long preceded the introduction
                    of foreign substances for the purpose (see, for example, Ovid, <hi rend="italic"
                    >Fast.</hi> i. 337 <hi rend="italic">sq.,</hi> “Et non exiguo laurus adusta sono
                    ”). Latterly the use of frankincense (“mascula thura,” Virg., <hi rend="italic"
                    >Ecl.</hi> viii. 65) became very prevalent, not only in religious ceremonials,
                    but also on various state occasions, such as in triumphs (Ovid, <hi
                    rend="italic">Trist.</hi> iv. 2, 4), and also in connexion with certain
                    occurrences of domestic life. In private it was daily offered by the devout to
                    the <hi rend="italic">lar familiaris</hi> (Plaut., <hi rend="italic"
                    >Aulul.,</hi> prol., 23); and in public sacrifices it was not only sprinkled on
                    the head of the victim by the pontifex before its slaughter, and afterwards
                    mingled with its blood, but was also thrown upon the fl ιmes in which it was
                    roasted.</p>
                <p>No perfectly satisfactory traces can be found of the use of incense in the ritual
                    of the Christian Church during the first four centuries. It obviously was not
                    contemplated by the author of the epistle to the Hebrews; its use was foreign to
                    the synagogue services on which, and not on those of the temple, the worship of
                    the primitive Christians is well known to have been originally modelled; and its
                    associations with heathen solemnities, and with the evil repute of those who
                    were known as “thurificati,” would still further militate against its
                    employment. Various authors of the ante-Nicene period have expressed themselves
                    as distinctly unfavourable to its religious, though not of course to its
                    domestic, use. Thus Tertullian, while <hi rend="italic">{De Cor. Mil.,</hi> 10)
                    ready to acknowledge its utility in counteracting unpleasant smells (“si me odor
                    alicujus loci offenderit, Arabiae aliquid incendo”), is careful to say that he
                    scorns to offer it as an accompaniment to his heartfelt prayers <hi
                    rend="italic">{Apοl.,</hi> 30, <hi rend="italic">cf.</hi> 42). Athenagoras also
                    <hi rend="italic">{Legat.,</hi> 13) gives distinct expression to his sense of
                    the needlessness of any such ritual (“the Creator and Father of the universe
                    does not require blood, nor smoke, nor even the sweet smell of flowers and
                    incense ”); ahd Arnobius <hi rend="italic">{Adv. Gent.,</hi> vii. 26) seeks to
                    justify the Christian neglect of it by the fact, for which he vouches, that
                    among the Romans themselves incense was unknown in the time of Numa, while the
                    Etruscans had always continued to be strangers to it. Cyril of Jerusalem,
                    Augustine, and the Apostolic Constitutions make no reference to any such feature
                    either in the public or private worship of the Christians of that time. The
                    earliest mention, it would seem, occurs in the Apostolic Canons (can. 3), where
                    the <hi rend="italic">θυplαpα</hi> is spoken of as one of the requisites of the
                    eucharistie service. It is easy to perceive how it should inevitably have come
                    in along with the whole circle of ideas involved in such words as “temple,”
                    “altar,” “priest,” which about this time came to be so generally applied in
                    ecclesiastical connexions. Evagrius (vi. 21) mentions the gift of a <hi
                    rend="italic">θυμιατηριον</hi> by Chosroes the king of Persia to the church of
                    Jerusalem; and all the Oriental liturgies of this period provide special prayers
                    for the thu-rification of the eucharistie elements. The oldest <hi rend="italic"
                    >Ordο</hi><hi rend="italic">Romanus,</hi> which perhaps takes us back to within
                    a century of Gregory the Great, enjoins that in pontifical masses a subdeacon,
                    with a golden censer, shall go before the bishop as he leaves the secretarium
                    for the choir, and two, with censers, before the deacon gospeller as he proceeds
                    with the gospel to the ambo. And less than, two centuries afterwards we read an
                    order in one of the capitularies of Hiuc-mar of Rheims, to the effect that every
                    priest ought to be provided with a censer and incense. That in this portion of
                    their ritual, however, the Christians of that period were not universally
                    conscious of its direct descent from Mosaic institutions may be inferred perhaps
                    from the “benediction of the incense” used in the days of Charlemagne, which
                    runs as follows: “May the Lord bless this incense to the extinction of every
                    noxious smell, and kindle it to the odour of its sweetness.” Even Thomas Aquinas
                    (p. iii. qu. 83, art. 5) gives prominence to this idea.</p>
                <p>The character and order of these historical notices of incense would certainly,
                    were there nothing else to be considered, justify the conclusion which has been
                    generally adopted, that its use was wholly unknown in the worship of the
                    Christian Church before the 5th century. On the other hand, we know that in the
                    first Christian services held in the catacombs under the city of Rome, incense
                    was burnt as a sanitary fumigation at least. Tertullian also distinctly alludes
                    to the use of aromatics in Christian burial: “the Sabaeans will testify that
                    more of their merchandise, and that more costly, is lavished on the burial of
                    Christians, than in burning incense to the gods.” And the whole argument from
                    analogy is in favour of the presumption of the ceremonial use of incense by the
                    Christians from the first. It is natural that little should be said of so
                    obvious a practice until the fuller development of ritual in a later age. The
                    slighting references to it by the Christian fathers are no more an argument
                    against its existence in the primitive church, than the similar denunciations by
                    the Jewish prophets of burnt offerings and sacrifices are any proof that there
                    were no such rites as the offering of incense, and of the blood of bulls and fat
                    of rams, in the worship of the temple at Jerusalem. There could be no real
                    offence to Christians in the burning of incense. Malachi (i. 11) had already
                    foretold the time when among the Gentiles, in every place, incense should be
                    offered to God. Gold, with myrrh and frankincense were offered by the Persian
                    Magi to the infant Jesus at his birth; and in Revelation viii. 3, 4 the image of
                    the offering incense with the prayers of the saints, before the throne of God,
                    is not without its significance. If also the passage in Ambrose of Milan (on
                    Luke i. 11), where he speaks of “us” as “adolentes altaria” is to be translated
                    “incensing the altars,” and taken literally, it is an unequivocal testimony to
                    the use of incense by the Christian Church in, at least, the 4th century.</p>
                <p>The Missal of the Roman Church now enjoins incensa-tion before the introit,
                    before the gospel, and again at the offertory, in every high mass; the use of
                    incense also occurs when the sacrament is exhibited, at consecrations of
                    churches and the like, in processions, in the office for the burial of the dead,
                    and at the exhibition of relics. On high festivals the altar is censed at
                    vespers and lauds.</p>
                <p>In the Church of England the use of incense was gradually abandoned after the
                    reign of Edward VI., until the ritualistic revival of the present day. Its use,
                    however, has never been abolished by law. A “Form for the Consecration of a
                    Censer” occurs in Sancroft’s <hi rend="italic">Form of Dedication and
                    Consecration of α Church or Chapel</hi> (1685). In various works of reference
                    (as, for example, in <hi rend="italic">Notes and Queries,</hi> 3d set., vol.
                    viii. p. 11) numerous sporadic cases are mentioned in which incense appears to
                    have been burnt in churches; the evidence, however, does not go so far as to
                    show that it was used during divine service, least of all that it was used
                    during the communion office. At the coronation of George III., one of the king’s
                    grooms appeared “in a scarlet dress, holding a perfuming pan, burning perfumes,
                    as at previous coronations.” <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0912-0741-0722"/> For the manufacture of the incense now used in
                    the Christian churches of Europe there is no fixed rule. The books of ritual are
                    agreed that Ex. xxx. 34 should be taken as a guide as much as possible. It is
                    recommended that frankincense should enter as largely as possible into its
                    composition, and that if inferior materials be employed at all they should not
                    be allowed to preponderate. In Rome olibanum alone is employed; in other places
                    benzoin, storax, aloes, cascarilla bark, cinnamon, cloves, and musk are all said
                    to be occasionally used. In the Russian Church, benzoin is chiefly employed. The
                    Armenian liturgy, in its benediction of the incense, speaks of “this perfume
                    prepared from myrrh and cinnamon.”</p>
                <p>The preparation of pastils of incense has probably come down in a continuous
                    tradition from ancient Egypt, Babylonia, and Phoenicia. Cyprus was for centuries
                    famous for their manufacture, and they were still known in the middle ages by
                    the names of pastils or osselets of Cyprus.</p>
                <p>Maimonides, in his <hi rend="italic">More Nevochim,</hi> states that the use of
                    incense in the worship of the Jews originated as a corrective of the
                    disagreeable odours arising from the si ιughter and burning of the animals
                    offered in sacrifice. There can be no doubt that its use throughout the East is
                    based on sanitary considerations; and in Europe even, in the time when the dead
                    were buried in the churches, it was recognized that the burning of incense
                    served essentially to preserve their salubrity. But evidently the idea that the
                    odour of a burnt-offering <hi rend="italic">(cf.</hi> the <hi rend="italic"
                    >κνlσηs η8vς avτμτj</hi> of <hi rend="italic">Odyss.</hi> xii. 369) is grateful
                    to the deity, being indeed the most essential part of the sacrifice, or at least
                    the vehicle by which alone it can successfully be conveyed to its destination,
                    is also a very early one, if not absolutely primitive; and survivals of it are
                    possibly to be met with even among the most highly cultured peoples where the
                    purely symbolical nature of all religious ritual is most clearly understood and
                    maintained. Some such idea plainly underlies the familiar phrase “a sweet
                    savour,” more literally “a savour of satisfaction,” by which an acceptable
                    offering by fire is so often denoted in the Bible (Gen. viii. 21, Lev. L 9, <hi
                    rend="italic">et</hi><hi rend="italic">passim; cf.</hi> Eph. v. 2). It is easy
                    to imagine how, as men grew in sensuous appreciation of pleasant perfumes, and
                    in empirical knowledge of the sources from which these could be derived, this
                    advance would naturally express itself, not only in their domestic habits, but
                    also in the details of their religious ceremonial, so that the custom of adding
                    some kind of incense to their animal sacrifices, and at length that of offering
                    it pure and simple, would inevitably arise. Ultimately, with the development of
                    the spiritual discernment of men, the “offering of incense” became a mere
                    symbolical expression for prayer (see Rev. v. 8, viii. 3, 4). Clement of
                    Alexandria expresses this in his well-known words: “The true altar of incense is
                    the just soul, and the perfume from it is holy prayer.” (So also Crigen, <hi
                    rend="italic">Cont. Cels.,</hi> viii. 17, 20.) The ancients were familiar with
                    the sanitary efficacy of fumigations. The energy with which Ulysses, after the
                    slaughter of the suitors, calls to Euryclea for “fire and sulphur” to purge
                    (literally “fumigate”) the dining-hall from the pollution of their blood <hi
                    rend="italic">(Cd.</hi> xxii. 481, 482) would startle those who imagine that
                    sanitation is a peculiarly modern science. There is not the slightest doubt that
                    the censing of things and persons was first practised for acts of purification,
                    and thus became symbolical of consecration, and finally of the sanctification of
                    the soul. The Egyptians understood the use of incense as symbolical of the
                    purification of the soul by prayer. Catholic writers generally treat it as
                    typifying contrition, the preaching of the gospel, the prayers of the faithful,
                    and the virtues of the saints. <hi rend="smallcaps">(g. b.)</hi></p>
