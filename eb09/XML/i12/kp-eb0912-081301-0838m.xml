                    Central States of the American Union, lies between 37° 47' and 41° 50' N. lat.,
                    and 84° 49' and 88° 2' W. long. It is bounded on the E. by the State of Ohio,
                    from which it is separated by a line drawn due north from the mouth of the Great
                    Miami river; on the S. by the Ohio river, separating it from Kentucky, between
                    the mouths of the Great Miami and the Wabash; on the W. by Illinois, from which
                    it is separated by the Wabash river from its mouth to a point where a line drawn
                    due north from Vincennes last touches the western bank of that stream, thence
                    north on that line to a point 10 miles north of the southern extreme of Lake
                    Michigan; on the N. by a line drawn from that point due east until it intersects
                    the eastern boundary, separating the State from Michigan. A small portion of
                    Lake Michigan is included within the northern boundary. The coast-line is about
                    60 miles in length. Michigan City is the only lake harbour in the State. The
                    extreme length of the State is 276 miles, with an average breadth of 145 miles;
                    and the area is 33,809 square miles.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Topography.—</hi> Indiana occupies a broad table-land, for the
                    most part level or gently undulating, except along the Ohio, where the plain has
                    been deeply grooved by the affluent streams into hills and valleys. There are no
                    elevations that could properly be termed mountains or mountain ranges. With the
                    exception of a small portion which drains into the great lakes, the whole State
                    inclines gently towards the south-west. The highest point (except a knob in
                    Brown county) is found in the southern portion of Randolph county, and is 1253
                    feet above the sea; the lowest, at the mouth of the Wabash, is 370 feet. From
                    careful surveys the mean altitude of the State is estimated at 735 feet above
                    sea-level. It is well watered by numerous streams and rivers,, but, with the
                    exception of the Ohio and Wabash, few of them are navigable. The Wabash is the
                    largest river that has its course mainly within the State; and, together with
                    its branches, it drains three-fourths of the entire surface. It rises in the
                    west of Ohio, and flows first in a north-west direction, and then south-west
                    till it meets the boundary of Illinois, which it follows southward for more than
                    100 miles, till it falls into the Ohio, after a course of upwards of 500 miles.
                    The Ohio forms the entire southern boundary of the State. The other principal
                    rivers of Indiana are tributaries of the Wabash. The White River, the most
                    important of these, is formed by the W. and E. Forks,—two rivers respectively
                    about 300 and 200 miles long,—which unite about 100 miles above its confluence
                    with the Wabash. The Maumee is formed by the St Joseph and St Mary in the
                    north-east, and falls into Lake Erie. The Upper St Joseph, with its tributaries,
                    passes through the northern counties, and falls into Lake Michigan. That portion
                    south of the Wabash was originally covered with heavy forests of oak, beech,
                    maple, walnut, ash, and other hard woods; north of that river was principally
                    prairie, interspersed with small lakes.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Geology and Minerals.—</hi> Lower Silurian strata are well
                    developed in the south-eastern part of the State, with a thickness of 800 feet.
                    Next, to the west and north, in succession occur rocks of the Upper Silurian,
                    with a thickness of 200 feet, and those of Devonian age, 180 feet thick. The
                    last two formations spread over all the northern third of the State, deeply
                    covered with glacial drift, and at points deeply eroded by ice and water flow of
                    that age. The Coal-measures occupy over 7000 square miles in the western and
                    south-western parts, furnishing seven workable seams, at a depth of 50 to 220
                    feet, and averaging 80 feet below the surface; the seams vary in thickness from
                    2⅛ to 11 feet, averaging 4 J feet; the quality is from fair to good , an area of
                    600 square miles in this field yields a superior “block” or splint coal. This,
                    being free from sulphur and phosphorus, is used in blast furnaces as it comes
                    from the mine, without coking, and is well adapted for the preparation of
                    Bessemer steel. The Sub-Carboniferous or Mountain Limestone borders the
                    Coal-measures on the south and east; it yields giant bands of choice limestone
                    for building purposes, 30 to 50 feet thick, unlimited in extent, homogeneous,
                    elastic to compensate for inequalities of temperature, and with endurance to
                    bear the climatic changes. Near Leavenworth, in the southern part of the State,
                    there is a remarkable calcareous cavern, the Wyandotte Cave. One of its chambers
                    is 350 feet long and 245 in height. It abounds with stalactites and stalagmites
                    of great variety and size.</p>
                <p>Inexhaustible beds of fire clay, potter’s clay, kaolin, and lime, as well as
                    paving and building stone, are found in the southern parts of the State.</p>

                    of railway in the State, traversing eighty-five counties, and appraised for
                    taxation at $38,442,941. So completely does the railway system cover the State
                    that one can go from the capital to almost any county and return the same day.
                    The geographical position of the State is such that all the main railroad
                    through-lines between the east and west have to cross Indiana.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Administration.—</hi> The State is divided into ninety-two
                    counties, containing about 400 square miles each. The governor is elected for
                    four years. The legislature, which meets biennally, consists of a senate of
                    fifty, elected for four years, and a house of representatives of one hundred,
                    elected for two years. The judges (five) of the supreme court are elected for
                    six years. The State has thirteen representatives and two senators in Congress.

                    declares that no debts shall be incurred by the State except to meet casual
                    deficits in the revenue, or to provide for the public defence, repel invasion,
                    and suppress insurrection. On the organization of Indiana as a territory in
                    1800, Vincennes was made the capital; when the State Government was formed in
                    1816, the capital was fixed temporarily at Corydon, until provision could be
                    made for the permanent seat at Indianapolis, to which it was removed in
                    1824.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Education.—</hi> The foundation of the free school system was
                    laid by Congress when, in admitting the State into the Union, the Government
                    presented a section of land in each township to the inhabitants for free
                    schools. A great advance was made in 1851, when in framing the new constitution
                    it was provided that certain funds then belonging to the State, with all penal
                    fines and forfeitures accruing, should constitute a common school fund, the
                    principal to remain a perpetual fund, to be increased, but never diminished, and
                    the annual income used for tuition only. This fund in 1880 amounted to
                    $9,220,708, and is increasing. In the same year there were 9647 schoolhouses in
                    the State, valued at $11,817,954. Of the children of school age (six to

                    Mississippi by way of the Maumee, Wabash, and Ohio rivers. Trading posts for
                    barter with the natives were established at the head of the Maumee, where is now
                    the city of Fort Wayne; at Ouantenon, on the Wea Prairie, near the city of
                    Lafayette; and at Vincennes on the Wabash. Missionary stations were also
                    established by the Jesuit fathers, in their endeavour to convert the Indians. At
                    the close of the French war in 1763-4, the territory east of the Mississippi and
                    north of the Ohio passed under British dominion. Pending the war between Great
                    Britain and the American colonies, Colonel George Rogers Clark of Virginia, with
                    an armed force, took possession of the territory, raising the American flag at
                    Vincennes in 1778. By the treaty of 1783 between England and the United States
                    this territory was recognized as belonging to the latter; inasmuch as Virginia
                    had fitted out Clark’s expedition, she was entitled by the law of conquest to
                    claim this vast dominion. During the colonial war Congress recommended the
                    several States to cede their claims to unappropriated lands in the western
                    country to the general government for the common benefit of the Union. Virginia,
                    in pursuance of this request, yielded up her claims to the territory north-west
                    of the Ohio. The deed of cession, executed on March 1, 1784, was signed by
                    Thomas Jefferson, James Monroe, Arthur Lee, and Samuel Hardy. In 1787 Congress
                    passed an ordinance for the government of the north-west territory, which
                    provided, among other things, that not more than five States should ever be
                    formed thereof, prohibiting slavery, and declaring that “religion, morality, and
                    knowledge being necessary to good government and the happiness of mankind,
                    schools and the means of education shall for ever be encouraged.” This territory
                    was subsequently divided into the States of Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, Michigan,
                    and Wisconsin. Indiana was admitted into the Union as a State by Congress on
                    April 19,1816, being the sixth State received after the formation of the
                    government by the thirteen original States and the adoption in 1787 of the
                    present constitution. (A. C. H.)</p>
