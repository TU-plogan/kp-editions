                <p><label type="entry">INDIA</label><hi> INDIA</hi> is a grbat empire of Asia,
                    composed of twelve provinces under direct British administration, and about one
                    hundred and fifty feudatory states and principalities, which equally with the
                    British provinces acknowledge the paramount sovereignty of the British crown.
                    The whole empire contains close on 1⅛ million square miles, and 240 millions of
                    inhabitants. The area, therefore, is almost equal to, and the population is just
                    equal to, the area and population of all Europe, less Russia. The people exactly
                    double Gibbon’s estimate of 120 millions for all the races and nations which
                    obeyed Imperial Rome.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">The Name.—</hi> The natives of India can scarcely be said to
                    have a word of their own by which to express their common country. In Sanskrit,
                    it would be called “Bhârata-varsha,” from Bharata, a legendary monarch of the
                    Lunar line; but Sanskrit is no more the vernacular of India than Latin is of
                    Europe. The name “Hindustân,” which was at one time adopted by European
                    geographers, is of Persian origin, meaning “the land of the Hindus,” as
                    Afghanistan means “the laud of the Afghans.” According to native usage, however,
                    “Hindustân” is limited either to that portion of the peninsula lying north of
                    the Vindhyâ mountains, or yet more strictly to the upper basin of the Ganges
                    where Hindi is the spoken language. The “East Indies,” as opposed to the “West
                    Indies,” is an old-fashioned and inaccurate phrase, dating from the dawn of
                    maritime discovery, and still lingering in certain parliamentary papers.
                    “India,” the abstract form of a word derived through the Greeks from the
                    Persicized form of the Sanskrit <hi rend="italic">sindhu</hi><hi rend="italic
                    subscript"> i</hi> a “river,” pre-eminently the Indus, has become familiar since
                    the British acquired the country, and is now officially recognized in the
                    imperial title of the sovereign.</p>

                    India, as thus defined, is the middle of the three irregularly shaped peninsulas
                    which jut out southwards from the mainland of Asia, thus corresponding roughly
                    to the peninsula of Italy in the map of Europe. Its form is that of a great
                    triangle, with its base resting upon the Himâlayan range, and its apex running
                    far into the ocean. The chief part of its western side is washed by the Arabian
                    Sea, and the chief part of its eastern side by the Bay of Bengal. It extends
                    from the 8th to the 35th degree of north latitude, that is to say, from the
                    hottest regions of the equator to far within the temperate zone. The capital,
                    Calcutta, lies in 88° E. long.; so that when the sun sets at six o’clock there,
                    it is just past mid-day in England, and early morning in New York. The length of
                    India from north to south, and its greatest breadth from east to west, are both
                    about 1900 miles; but the triangle tapers with a pear-shaped curve to a point at
                    Cape Comorin, its southern extremity. To this compact dominion the English have
                    added, under the name of British Burmah, the strip of country on the eastern
                    shores of the Bay of Bengal. But on the other hand, the adjacent island of
                    Ceylon has been artificially severed, and placed under the colonial office. Two
                    groups of islands in the Bay of Bengal, the Andamans and the Nicobars; one group
                    in the Arabian sea, the Laccadives; and the outlying station of Aden at the
                    mouth of the Red Sea, are all politically included within the Indian empire;
                    while dots on the shore of the peninsula itself, representing Portuguese and
                    French settlements, break at intervals the continuous line of British
                    territory.</p>
                <p>India is shut off from the rest of Asia on the north by a vast mountainous
                    region, known in the aggregate as the Himâlayas, amid which lie the independent
                    states of Bhutân and Nepâl, with the great table-land of Tibet behind. The
                    native principality of Kashmir occupies the north-western angle of India, with
                    Eastern Turkestân stretching to the north beyond it. At this north-western angle
                    (in 35° N. lat., 74° E. long.) the mountains curve southwards, and India is
                    separated by the well-marked ranges of the Sufed Koh and Sulâimân from
                    Afghânistân; and by a southern continuation of lower hills (the Hâlas,&amp;c.)
                    from Baluchistân. The last part of the western land frontier of India is formed
                    by the river Hab, and the boundary ends at Cape Monze, at the mouth of its
                    estuary, in 24° 50' N. lat., 66° 38' E. long. Still farther southwards, India is
                    bounded along the W. and S.W. by the Arabian Sea and Indian Ocean. Turning
                    northwards from the southern extremity at Cape Comorin (8° 4' 20" N. lat., 77°
                    35' 35" E. long.), the long sea-line of the Bay of Bengal forms the main part of
                    its eastern boundary. But on the north-east, as on the northwest, India has
                    again a land frontier. The Himâlayan ranges at the north-eastern angle (in about
                    28° N. lat., 97° E. long.) throw off spurs and chains to the south-east. These
                    spurs, which have been but imperfectly explored, and may possibly constitute an
                    independent mountain system, separate the British provinces of Assam and Eastern
                    Bengal from Independent Burmah. They are known successively as the Abar, Nâgà,
                    Patkoi, and Barel ranges. Turning almost due south in 25° lat., they culminate
                    in the Blue Mountain (7100 feet), in 22° 37' N. lat., 93° 10' E. long., and then
                    stretch southwards under the name of the Arakan Yomas, separating British Burmah
                    from Independent Burmah, until they again rise into the mountain of Myeng-mateng
                    (4700 feet), in 19⅜° of N. lat. Up to this point, the eastern frontier follows,
                    generally speaking, the watershed which divides the river systems of the
                    Brahmaputra, Meghna, Kuladan (Koladyne), &lt;fcc., in Bengal and British Burmah,
                    from the Irawadi basin in Independent Burmah. But from near the base of the
                    Myeng-mateng Mountain, in about 19^ <hi rend="superscript"> o</hi> lat., the
                    British frontier stretches almost due east, in an artificial line which divides
                    the lower districts and delta of the Irawadi in British Burmah from the middle
                    and upper districts of that river in Independent Burmah. Stretching
                    south-eastwards from the delta of the Irawadi, a confused succession of little
                    explored ranges separates the British province of Tenasserim from the native
                    kingdom of Siam. The boundary line runs down to Point Victoria at the extremity
                    of Tenasserim (9° 59' N. lat., 98° 32' E. long.), following in a somewhat rough
                    manner the watershed between the rivers of the British territory on the west and
                    of Siam on the east.</p>
                <p>The empire included within these boundaries is rich in varieties of scenery and
                    climate, from the highest mountains in the world to vast river deltas raised
                    only a few inches above the level of the sea. It forms a continent rather than a
                    country. But if we could look down on the whole from a balloon, we should find
                    that India consists of three separate and well-defined tracts. The first
                    includes the lofty Himâlaya mountains, which shut it out from the rest of Asia;
                    and which, although for the most part beyond the British frontier, form an
                    overruling factor in the physical geography of northern India. The second region
                    stretches southwards from the base of the Himâlayas, and comprises the plains of
                    the great rivers which issue from them. The third region slopes upward again
                    from the edge of the river plains, and consists of a high three-sided
                    table-land, supported by the Vindhyâ mountains on the north, and by the <pb
                    break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit12newyrich/page/n755/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0912-0755-0732"/> Eastern and Western Ghâts, which run down the
                    coast on either side till they meet at a point near Cape Comorin. The interior
                    three-sided table-land thus enclosed is broken by peaks and ranges, interspersed
                    with broad expanses of level uplands, and covers the whole southern half of the
                    peninsula.</p>
                <p>The first of the three regions is the Himalaya mountains and their offshoots to
                    the southward. The Himalayas— literally, the “Dwelling-place of Snow,” from the
                    Sanskrit <hi rend="italic">hima,</hi> frost (Latin, <hi rend="italic"
                    >hiems,</hi> winter), and <hi rend="italic">dlaya,</hi> a house— comprise a
                    system of stupendous ranges, the loftiest in the world. They are the <hi
                    rend="italic">Emodus</hi> of Ptolemy (among other names), and extend in the
                    shape of a scimitar, with its edge facing southwards, for a distance of 1500
                    miles along the northern frontier of India. At the north-eastern angle of that
                    frontier, the Dihang river, the connecting link between the Tsan-pu (Sangpu) of
                    Tibet and the Brahmaputra of Assam, bursts through the main axis of the range.
                    At the opposite or north-western angle, the Indus in like manner pierces the
                    Himälayas, and turns southwards on its course through the Punjab. The Himâlayan
                    region has been fully described in a separate article, vol. xi. p. 821.</p>
                <p>This wild region is in many parts impenetrable to man, and nowhere yields a
                    passage for a modern army. It should be mentioned, however, that the Chinese
                    outposts extend as far as a point only 6000 feet above the Gangetic plain, north
                    of Khatmandu. Indeed, Chinese armies have seriously threatened Khatmandu itself;
                    and Sir David Ochterlony’s advance from the plains of Bengal to that city in
                    1816 is a matter of history. Ancient and well-known trade routes exist, by means
                    of which merchandise from the Punjab finds its way over heights of 18,000 feet
                    into Eastern Turkestan and Tibet. The Muztagh (Snowy Mountain), the Karakoram
                    (Black Mountain), and the Changchenmo are the most famous of these passes.</p>
                <p>The Himälayas not only form a double wall along the north of India, but at both
                    their eastern and western extremities send out ranges to the south, which
                    protect its north-eastern and north-western frontiers. On the north-east, those
                    offshoots, under the name of the Nâgâ and Patkoi mountains, &amp;c., form a
                    barrier between the civilized British districts and the wild tribes of Upper
                    Burmah. The southern continuations of these ranges, known as the Yornas,
                    separate British from Independent Burmah, and are crossed by pa ses, the most
                    historic of which, the Aeng or An, rises to 4668 (formerly given at 4517) feet,
                    with gradients of 472 feet to the mile.</p>
                <p>On the opposite or north-western frontier of India, the mountainous offshoots run
                    down the entire length of the British boundaries from the Himälayas to the sea.
                    As they proceed southwards, their best marked ranges are in turn known as the
                    Sufed Koh, the Sulâimân, and the Hâla mountains. These massive barriers have
                    peaks of great height, culminating in the Takht-i-Sulâimân or Throne of Solomon,
                    11,317 feet above the level of the sea. But the mountain wall is pierced at the
                    corner where it strikes southwards from the Himalayas by an opening through
                    which the Kâbul (Cabul) river flows into India. An adjacent opening, the Khyber
                    Pass (rising to 3373 feet), the Kuram Pass to the south of it, the Gwalari Pass
                    near Derâ Ismâil Khân, the Tâl Pass debouching near Derâ Ghâzi Khân, and the
                    famous Bolân Pass (5800 feet at top) still farther south, furnish the gateways
                    between India and Afghanistan. The Hâla, Brahui, and Pab mountains form the
                    southern hilly offshoots between India and Baluchistân, and have a much less
                    elevation.</p>
                <p>The wide plains watered by the Himâlayan rivers form the second of the three
                    regions into which we have divided India. They extend from the Bay of Bengal on
                    the east to the Afghân frontier and the Arabian Sea on the west, and contain the
                    richest and most densely crowded provinces of the empire. One set of invaders
                    after another has from prehistoric times entered by the passes at their eastern
                    and north-western frontiers. They followed the courses of the rivers, and pushed
                    the earlier comers southwards before them towards the sea. About 150 millions of
                    people now live on and around these river plains, in the provinces known as the
                    lieutenant-governorship of Bengal, Assam, the North-Western Provinces and Oudh,
                    the Punjab, Sind, Râjputâna, and other native states.</p>
                <p>The vast level tract which thus covers northern India is watered by three
                    distinct river systems. One of these systems takes its rise in the hollow trough
                    beyond the Himälayas, and issues through their western ranges upon the Punjab as
                    the Sutlej and Indus. The second of the three river systems also takes its rise
                    beyond the double wall of the Himälayas, not very far from the sources of the
                    Indus and the Sutlej. It turns, however, almost due east instead of west, enters
                    India at the eastern extremity of the Himälayas, and becomes the Brahmaputra of
                    Assam and Eastern Bengal. These rivers collect the drainage of the northern
                    slopes of the Himalayas, and convey it, by long and tortuous although opposite
                    routes, into India. Indeed, the special feature of the Himalayas is that they
                    send down the rainfall from their northern as well as from their southern slopes
                    to the Indian plains. Of the three great rivers of northern India, the two
                    longest, namely the Indus with its feeder the Sutlej and the Brahmaputra, take
                    their rise in the trough on the north of the Himalayas. The third river system
                    of northern India receives the drainage of their southern slopes, and eventually
                    unites into the mighty stream of the Ganges. In this way the rainfall, alike
                    from the northern and southern slopes of the Himälayas, pours down into the
                    river plains of Bengal.</p>
                <p>Throughout the river plains of northern India, two harvests, and in some
                    provinces three, are reaped each year. These crops are not necessarily taken
                    from the same land; but in many districts the best fields have to yield two
                    harvests within the twelve months. In Lower Bengal, pease, pulses, oil-seeds,
                    and green crops of various sorts are reaped in spring; the early rice crops in
                    September; the great rice harvest of the year, and other grains, in November and
                    December. Before these last have been gathered in, it is time to prepare the
                    ground for the spring crops, and the Bengal husbandman knows no rest except
                    during the hot weeks of May, when he is anxiously waiting for the rains. But it
                    should always be remembered that rice is the staple crop in only a limited area
                    of India, and that it forms the everyday food of only a comparatively small
                    proportion of the population. It has been estimated that, in the absence of
                    irrigation, the rice crop requires an annual rainfall of at least 36 inches; and
                    an Indian province requires an average fall of not less than 50 or 60 inches in
                    order to grow rice as its staple crop. A line might almost be drawn across
                    Behar, to the north of which the food of the people ceases to be rice and
                    becomes wheat and millets, &amp;c. There are, indeed, great rice-growing tracts
                    in irrigated or low-lying districts of north-western India, but their produce is
                    consumed by the richer classes or exported.</p>
                <p>A detailed account of the most important products will be found under the heading
                    of “Agriculture,” fartheron in the present article. They are here alluded to
                    only so far as is necessary to give a general idea of the scenery of the river
                    plains. In the northern and drier regions along the upper courses of the rivers,
                    the country rises gently from their channels in fertile undulations, dotted with
                    mud villages and adorned with noble trees. Mango groves scent the air with their
                    blossom in spring, and yield their abundant fruit <pb break="no"

                    colonnades of hanging roots; the stately <hi rend="italic">pipal,</hi> with its
                    green masses of foliage; the leafless wild cotton-tree, glowing with heavy
                    crimson flowers; the tall, feathery tamarind, and the quick-growing <hi
                    rend="italic">babul,</hi> rear their heads above the fields. As the rivers
                    approach the coast, the palms begin to take possession of the scene. The
                    ordinary landscape in the delta is a flat stretch of rice-fields, fringed round
                    with evergreen masses of bamboos, cocoa-nuts, date-trees, areca, and other
                    coronetted palms. This densely peopled tract seems at first sight bare of
                    villages, for each hamlet is hidden away amid its own grove of plantains and
                    wealthgiving trees. The bamboo and cocoa-nut play a conspicuous part in the
                    industrial life of the people; and the number of products derived from them,
                    including rope, oil, food, and timber, has been dwelt on with admiration by many
                    writers.</p>
                <p>The crops also change as we sail down the rivers. In the north, the principal
                    grains are wheat, barley, Indian corn, and a variety of millets, such as <hi
                    rend="italic">joär</hi><hi rend="italic">{Holcus</hi><hi rend="italic"

                    spicatus).</hi> In the delta, on the other hand, rice is the staple crop and the
                    universal diet. In a single district, Rangpur, 295 separate kinds of rice are
                    known to the peasant, who has learned to grow his favourite crop in every
                    locality, from the solid field, which yields the <hi rend="italic">ciman</hi>
                    harvest, to the swamps 12 feet deep, on the surface of whose waters the rice
                    ears may be seen struggling upwards for air. Sugar-cane, oil-seeds, flax,
                    mustard, sesamum, palma-christi, cotton, tobacco, indigo, safflower, turmeric,
                    ginger, coriander, capsicum, cummin, and many precious spices and dyes are grown
                    both in the North-Western or Upper Provinces, and in the moister valleys and
                    delta of Lower Bengal. A whole pharmacopoeia of native medicines, from the
                    well-known aloe and castoroil to obscure but valuable febrifuges, is derived
                    from shrubs, herbs, and roots. Resins, gums, varnishes, scents, and a hundred
                    articles of commerce or luxury are collected in the fields or forests.
                    Vegetables of many sorts, both indigenous and imported from Europe, form a large
                    part of the food of the people. The melon and huge yellow pumpkin spread
                    themselves over the thatched roofs; fields of potatoes, yams, and <hi
                    rend="italic">brinjal</hi> are attached to the homesteads. The tea-plant is
                    reared on the hilly ranges that skirt the plains both in the north-west and in
                    Assam; the opium poppy about half down the Ganges, around Benares and Patnâ; the
                    silk-worm mulberry still farther down in Lower Bengal; while the jute fibre is
                    essentially a crop of the delta, and would exhaust any soil not fertilized by
                    river floods. Even the jungles yield the costly lac dye and <hi rend="italic"
                    >iasar</hi> silk cocoons. The <hi rend="italic">mahua,</hi> also a product of
                    the jungle, produces the fleshy flowers which form a staple article of food
                    among the hill tribes, and when distilled supply a cheap spirit. The <hi
                    rend="italic">säl,</hi><hi rend="italic">sissu, tun,</hi> and many other
                    indigenous trees yield excellent timber. Flowering creepers, of gigantic size
                    and gorgeous colours, festoon the jungle; while each tank bears its own
                    beautiful crop of the lotus and water-lilies. Nearly every vegetable product
                    that feeds and clothes a people, or enables it to trade with foreign countries,
                    abounds.</p>
                <p>We come now to the third division of India, namely the three-sided table-land
                    which covers the southern half or more strictly peninsular portion of India.
                    This tract, known in ancient times as the Deccan (Dakshin), literally “the right
                    hand or south,” comprises the Central Provinces, Berar, Madras, Bombay, Mysore,
                    and the native territories of the nizâm, Sindhia, Holkar, and other feudatory
                    states. It had in 1872 an aggregate population of over 90 millions. For the sake
                    of easy remembrance, therefore, we may take the inhabitants of the river plains
                    in the north to be now nearly 150 millions, and those of the southern
                    three-sided table-land at nearly 100 millions. The Deccan, in its local
                    acceptation, is restricted to the high tract between the Narbadâ (Nerbudda) and
                    the Kistnâ rivers; but it is popularly understood to include the whole country
                    south of the Vindhyâs as far as Cape Comorin. It slopes up from the southern
                    edge of the Gangetic plains. Three ranges of hills support its northern, its
                    eastern, and its western side; and the last two meet at a sharp angle near Cape
                    Comorin.</p>
                <p>The northern side rests on confused ranges, running with a general direction of
                    east to west, and known in the aggregate as the Vindhyâ mountains. The Vindhyâs,
                    however, are made up of several distinct hill systems. Two sacred peaks guard
                    the flanks in the extreme east and west, with a succession of ranges stretching
                    800 miles between. At the western extremity, Mount Abu, famous for its exquisite
                    Jain temples, rises, as a solitary outpost of the Aravalli hills, 5650 feet
                    above the Râjputâna plain, like an island out of the sea. Beyond the southern
                    limits of that plain, the Vindhyâ range of modern geography runs almost due east
                    from Guzerat, forming the northern wall of the Narbadâ valley. The Sâtpura
                    mountains stretch also east and west to the south of that river, and form the
                    watershed between it and the Tâpti. Towards the heart of India the eastern
                    extremities of these two converge in the highlands of the Central Provinces and
                    their lofty level plains. Passing still farther east, the hill system finds a
                    continuation in the Kâimur range and its congeners, which eventually end in the
                    outlying peaks and spurs that form the western boundary of Lower Bengal, and
                    abut on the old course of the Ganges under the name of the Râjraahâl hills. On
                    the extreme east, Mount Pârasnâth—like Mount Abu on the extreme west, sacred to
                    Jain rites— rises to 4400 feet above the level of the Gangetic plains. The
                    various ranges of the Vindhyâs, from 1500 to over 4000 feet high, form, as it
                    were, the northern wall and buttresses which support the central table-land.
                    Though now pierced by road and railway, they stood in former times as a barrier
                    of mountain and jungle between northern and southern India, and formed one of
                    the main obstructions to welding the whole into an empire. They consist of vast
                    masses of forests, ridges, and peaks, broken by cultivated valleys and broad
                    high-lying plains.</p>
                <p>The other two sides of the elevated southern triangle are known as the Eastern
                    and Western Ghâts (Ghauts). These start southwards from the eastern and western
                    extremities of the Vindhyâ system, and run along the eastern and western coasts
                    of India. The Eastern Ghâts stretch in fragmentary spurs and ranges down the
                    Madras Presidency, here and there receding inland and leaving broad level tracts
                    between their base and the coast. The Western Ghâts form the great sea-wall of
                    the Bombay Presidency, with only a narrow strip between them and the shore. In
                    many parts they rise in magnificent precipices and headlands out of the ocean,
                    and truly look like colossal “passes or landingstairs” <hi rend="italic"
                    >(ghdts)</hi> from the sea. The Eastern Ghâts have an average elevation of 1500
                    feet. The Western Ghâts ascend more abruptly from the sea to an average height
                    of about 3000 feet, with peaks up to 4700, along the Bombay coast, rising to
                    7000 and even 8760 in the upheaved angle which they unite to form with the
                    Eastern Ghâts, towards their southern extremity.</p>
                <p>The inner triangular plateau thus enclosed lies from 1000 to 3000 feet above the
                    level of the sea. But it is dotted with peaks and seamed with ranges exceeding
                    4000 feet in height. Its best known hills are the Nilgiris (Neilgherries), with
                    the summer capital of Madras, Utakamand, 7000 feet above the sea. The highest
                    point is Dodâbetta Peak (8760 feet), at the upheaved southern angle. The
                    interior plateau is approached by several <pb break="no"

                    western side. The Bor-Ghât, for example, ascends a tremendous ravine about 40
                    miles south-east of Bombay city, to a height of 1798 feet. In ancient times this
                    pass was regarded as the key of the Deccan, and could be held by a small band
                    against any army attempting to penetrate from the coast. A celebrated military
                    road was constructed by the British up the Bor-Ghât, and practically gave the
                    command of the interior to the then rising port of Bombay. A railway line has
                    now been carried up the pass, twisting round the shoulders of mountains,
                    tunnelling through intervening crags, and clinging by a narrow ledge to the face
                    of the precipices. At one point the zigzag is so sharp as to render a circuitous
                    turn impossible, and the trains have to stop and reverse their direction on a
                    levelled terrace. The Thall Ghât, to the north of Bombay, has in like manner
                    been scaled both by road and railway. Another celebrated pass, farther down the
                    coast, connects the military centre of Belgâum with the little port of Vingurla.
                    These “landing-stairs” from the sea to the interior present scenes of rugged
                    grandeur. The trap rocks stand out, after ages of denudation, like circular
                    fortresses flanked by round towers, from the mass of hills behind,—natural
                    fastnesses, which in the Marhattâ times were rendered impregnable to Oriental
                    warfare. To the south of Bombay, the passes climb up from the sea through thick
                    forests, the haunt of the tiger and the stately bison. Still farther down the
                    coast, the western mountain wall dips down into the Palghât valley, a remarkable
                    gap, 25 miles broad, and leading by an easy route, only 1500 feet above the sea
                    at its highest point, from the sea-board to the interior. A railway now extends
                    by this passage from Beypur across the peninsula to Madras.</p>
                <p>On the eastern side of India, the Ghâts form a series of spurs and buttresses for
                    the elevated inner plateau, rather than a continuous mountain wall. They are
                    traversed by a number of broad and easy passages from the Madras coast. Through
                    these openings the rainfall of the southern half of the inner plateau reaches
                    the sea. The drainage from the northern or Vindhyân edge of the three-sided
                    table-land falls into the Ganges. The Narbadâ (Nerbudda) and Tâpti carry the
                    rainfall of the southern slopes of the Vindhyâs and of the Sâtpura hills, in
                    almost parallel lines, into the Gulf of Cambay. But from Surat, in 21° 9' lat.,
                    to Cape Comorin, in 8° 4' lat., no large river succeeds in reaching the western
                    coast from the interior table-land. The Western Ghâts form, in fact, a lofty
                    unbroken barrier between the waters of the central plateau and the Indian Ocean.
                    The drainage has therefore to make its way across India to the eastwards, now
                    turning sharply round projecting ranges, now tumbling down ravines, or rushing
                    along the valleys, until the rain which the Bombay sea-breeze has dropped upon
                    the Western Ghâts finally falls into the Bay of Bengal. In this way the three
                    great rivers of the Madras Presidency, viz., the Godâvari, the Krishna, and the
                    Kâveri (Cauvery), rise in the mountains overhanging the western coast, and
                    traverse the whole breadth of the central table-land before they reach the sea
                    on the eastern shores of India.</p>
                <p>The physical geography and the political destiny of the two sides of the Indian
                    peninsula have been determined by the characteristics of the mountain ranges on
                    either coast. On the east, the country is comparatively open, and was everywhere
                    accessible to the spread of civilization. On the east, therefore, the ancient
                    dynasties of southern India fixed their capitals. Along the west, only a narrow
                    strip of lowland intervenes between the barrier range and the seaboard. The
                    inhabitants of those tracts remained apart from the civilization of the eastern
                    coast. To this day one of their ruling races, the Nairs, retain land-tenures and
                    social customs, such as polyandry, which mark a much ruder stage of human
                    advancement than Hinduism, and in other parts of India only linger among
                    isolated hill tribes. On the other hand, the people of the western coast enjoy a
                    bountiful rainfall, unknown in the inner plateau and the east. The monsoon
                    dashes its rain-laden clouds against the Western Ghâts, and pours from 250 to
                    100 inches of rain upon their maritime slopes from Khândesh down to Malabar. By
                    the time that the monsoon has crossed the Western Ghâts, it has dropped the
                    greater part of its aqueous burden, and central districts, such as Bangalore,
                    obtain only about 35 inches. The eastern coast also receives a monsoon of its
                    own; but, except in the neighbourhood of the sea, the rainfall throughout the
                    Madras presidency is scanty, seldom exceeding 40 inches in the year. The deltas
                    of the three great rivers along the Madras coast form, of course, tracts of
                    inexhaustible fertility; and much is done by irrigation on the thirsty inland
                    plateau to husband and utilize both the local rainfall and the accumulated
                    waters which the rivers bring down.</p>
                <p>In the valleys, and upon the' elevated plains of the central plateau, tillage has
                    driven back the jungle to the hilly recesses, and fields of rice and many kinds
                    of smaller grain or millets, tobacco, cotton, sugar-cane, and pulses spread over
                    the open country. The black soil of the Deccan is proverbial for its fertility;
                    and the level strip between the Western Ghats and the sea rivals even Lower
                    Bengal in its fruit-bearing palms, rice harvests, and rich succession of crops.
                    The deltas on the eastern side have from time immemorial been celebrated as
                    rice-bearing tracts. The interior of the table-land, as may be inferred from the
                    scanty rainfall, is liable to drought. The people contend against the calamities
                    of nature by varied systems of irrigation,—drawing their water-supply in some
                    districts from wells, in others from tanks and reservoirs, or from large
                    artificial lakes formed by damming up the ends of river valleys. They thus store
                    the rain brought during a few months by the monsoon, and husband it for use
                    throughout the whole year. The food of the common people consists chiefly of
                    small grains, such as <hi rend="italic">joâr,</hi><hi rend="italic">bdjra,</hi>
                    and <hi rend="italic">rdgi.</hi> The great export is cotton, with wheat from the
                    northern districts of Bombay. The pepper trade with Malabar dates far beyond the
                    age of Sindbad the Sailor, and probably reaches back to Roman times. Cardamoms,
                    spices' of various sorts, dyes, and many medicinal drugs are also grown.</p>
                <p>It is on the three-sided table-land, and among the hilly spurs which project from
                    it, that the mineral wealth of India lies hid. Coal-mining now forms a great
                    industry on the north-eastern side of the table-land, in Bengal, and also in the
                    Central Provinces. The commercial aspects of this and similar undertakings will
                    be dealt with in a later section of the present article. Beds of ironore and
                    limestone have been worked in several places, and hold out a possibility of a
                    new era of enterprise to India in the future. Many districts are rich in
                    building stone, marbles and the easily worked laterite. Copper and other metals
                    exist in small quantities. Gold dust has from very ancient times been washed out
                    of the river-beds, and gold-mining is being attempted on scientific principles
                    in Madras and Mysore.</p>
                <p>Of the three regions of India, now briefly surveyed, the first, or the
                    Hirnâlayas, lies for the most part beyond, the British frontier, but a knowledge
                    of it supplies the key to the ethnology and history of India. The second region,
                    or the great river plains in the north, formed the theatre of the ancient
                    race-movements which shaped the civilization and the political destinies of the
                    whole Indian peninsula. The third region, or the triangular table-land in the
                    south, has a character quite distinct from either of the other two divisions,
                    and a population which is now working out a separate development of its own.
                    Broadly speaking, the Hirnâlayas are peopled by Turanian tribes; the great river
                    plains of Hindustan are still the home of the Aryan race; the triangular
                    table-land has formed an arena for a long struggle between that gifted race from
                    the north and what is known as the Dravidian stock in the south.</p>
                <p>To this vast empire the English have added British Burmah, consisting of the
                    lower valley of the Irawadi (Irrawaddy) with its delta, and a long flat strip
                    stretching down the eastern side of the Bay of Bengal. Between the <pb

                    backbone of lofty ranges. These ranges, known as the Yoma (Roma) mountains, are
                    covered with dense forests, and both historically and geographically separate
                    the Irawadi valley from the strip of coast. The Yoma (Roma) ranges have peaks
                    exceeding 4000 feet, and culminate in the Blue Mountain (7100 feet). They are
                    crossed bypasses, one of which, the An or Aeng, rises to 4668 feet above the
                    sealevel. A thousand creeks indent the seaboard; and the whole of the level
                    country, both on the coast and in the Irawadi valley, forms one vast rice-field.
                    The river floats down an abundant supply of teak and bamboos from the north.
                    Tobacco, of an excellent quality, supplies the little cigars which all Burmese
                    (men, women, and children) smoke. Arakan and Pegu, or the provinces of the coast
                    strip and the Irawadi valley, contain mineral oil-springs. Tenasserim forms a
                    long narrow maritime province, which runs from the mouths of the Irawadi
                    southward to Point Victoria, where the British territory adjoins Siam. It is
                    rich in tin mines, and contains iron-ores equal to the finest Swedish, besides
                    gold and copper in smaller quantities, and a very pure limestone. Rice and
                    timber form the staple exports of Burmah; and rice is also the universal food of
                    the people. British Burmah, with Tenasserim, has an area of 88,556 square miles,
                    and had a population, in 1876, of just under 3 millions of persons.</p>

                <p>For geological purposes India may be mapped out into the three geographical
                    divisions of the Himalayan region, the Indo-Gangetic plain, and Peninsular
                    India.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">The Himalayan Region.—</hi> The geology of this district is far
                    more complex and less fully known than that of the Peninsular area. Until the
                    ground has been carefully gone over by the Geological Survey, many points must
                    remain doubtful; probably even then the problems will not be fully solved, as
                    large areas of the Himâlayas (Nepâl and Bhutân) are at present inaccessible to
                    Europeans. The oldest rock of the Himalayas is gneiss, but its age is quite
                    unknown. It generally differs in character from the gneiss of the Peninsula, and
                    also from that of Assam and Burmah. The Himâlayan gneiss is usually white and
                    grey, its felspars being orthoclase and albite; it contains much mica and mica
                    schist, and is generally much more uniform in character than the gneiss of the
                    Peninsula. The latter is usually pink, its felspar being orthoclase and
                    oligoclase; it contains little mica schist, but often has quartzite and
                    hornblendic rock. Hornblende occurs in the syenitic gneiss of the Northern
                    HimMayan (or Ladâkh) range. The Central Himalayan region may be roughly
                    described as consisting of two gneissic axes, with a trough or synclinal valley
                    between them, in which fossiliferous beds have been deposited and are now
                    preserved. The gneiss of the southern or main axis (the “central gneiss” of Dr
                    Stoliczka) is the oldest; that of the northern or Ladâkh axis comes next in age.
                    The gneiss of the Ladâkh axis is generally syenitic, or is that variety of the
                    Himâlayan gneiss already described as containing hornblende. It is probably an
                    extremely altered condition of ordinary marine sediment. The gneiss of the
                    central axis is the ordinary kind; it is penetrated by granite, which ranges
                    along some of the highest peaks. Between these two gneissic axes occurs the
                    basin-shaped valley, or the Hundes and Zanskar synclinal. In this valley
                    fossiliferous rocks are preserved, giving representatives of the Silurian,
                    Carboniferous, Triassic, Jurassic, and Cretaceous formations. All these seem
                    there to have followed each other without important breaks or unconformities;
                    but after the deposition of the Cretaceous rocks of the Himâlayan region, there
                    appear to have been important changes in physical geography. The Nummulitic
                    (Eocene) strata were laid down on the eroded edges of some of the older beds,
                    and in a long trough within the Silurian gneiss of the Ladâkh axis. On the south
                    of this true Himâlayan region there is a band of country known as the Lower
                    Himâlaya, in which the beds are often greatly disturbed, and even completely
                    inverted, over great areas, the old gneiss apparently overlying the sedimentary
                    rocks. This Lower Himâlayan region is about 50 miles wide, and consists of
                    irregular ridges, varying from 5000 to 8000 feet in height, and sometimes
                    reaching 12,000 feet.</p>
                <p>Resting upon the gneiss, but often through inversion apparently underlying it, in
                    the neighbourhood of Simla, is a series of unfossiliferous beds (schists,
                    quartzites, sandstones, shales, limestones, &amp;c.) known in descending order
                    as the Krôl, Infra-Kr01, Blaini, and Infra-Blaini beds. In the Krôl beds is a
                    massive limestone (Krôl limestone) probably representing the limestone of the
                    Pir Panjâl range, which is most likely of Carboniferous age, The Blaini and
                    Infra-Blaini beds are probably Silurian. The Lower Himâlayan range ends at the
                    Sutlej valley, west of which the continuation of the central range is followed
                    immediately by the third or Sub-Himâlayan range. This occurs almost always on
                    the south of the Lower Himâlayas; it is composed of later Tertiary rocks
                    (Siwâliks, &amp;c.), which range parallel with the main chain. Generally the
                    Sub-Himâlayas consist of two ranges, separated by a broad flat valley (“dùn” or
                    “doon ”); the southern slope, overlooking the great Indo-Gangetic plain, is
                    usually the steepest. Below Nâini Tâl and Dârjiling (Darjeeling), the
                    sub-Himâlayan range is wanting; on the Bhutân frontier the whole range is
                    occasionally absent, and then the great plain slopes up to the base of the Lower
                    Himâlayan region. It is within the Sub-Himâlayan range that the famous Siwâlik
                    beds occur, long since known for their vast stores of extinct mammalia. Of about
                    the same age are the Manchhar beds of Sind, which also contain a rich mammalian
                    fauna. The Lower Manchhars probably correspond to the Nâhan beds, the lowest of
                    the Siwâliks; they rest upon the Gaj beds, which are probably Upper Miocene.
                    From this it would seem that the lowest Siwâliks are not older than Upper
                    Miocene. The higher Siwâlik beds are considered by Mr W. T. Blanford to be
                    Pliocene, and to this later period he also refers the mammalian beds of Pikermi
                    in Greece. These have a large number of fossils in common with the Siwâliks; but
                    they contain, at their base, a marine band with Pliocene shells. The Manchhar
                    and Siwâlik beds are chiefly of freshwater origin.</p>
                <p>The Salt Range in the north-west of the Punjab has, in addition to its economic
                    value, a special geological importance; and from that point of view it is one of
                    the most interesting districts in India. Representatives of most of the great
                    European formations of Silurian and later epochs are found there; and throughout
                    all the vast length of time represented by these formations there is here no
                    direct evidence of any important break in succession, or unconformity. The
                    lowest beds (salt marl, probably Silurian) and the highest (Siwâliks) are found
                    throughout the range. But the others cannot all be traced continuously
                    throughout; some occur well developed in one place, some in another. All the
                    principal fossiliferous beds of the Jurassic, Triassic, and Carboniferous
                    formations are confined to the western part of the range.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Indo-Gangetic Plain</hi> covers an area of about 300,000
                    square miles, and varies in width from 90 to nearly 300 miles. It rises very
                    gradually from the sea at either end; the lowest point of the watershed between
                    the Punjab rivers and the Ganges is about 924 feet above the sea. This point, by
                    a line measured down the valley, but not following<pb break="no"

                    from the mouth of the Ganges and 850 miles from the mouth of the Indus, so that
                    the average inclination of the plain, from the central watershed to the sea, is
                    only about 1 foot per mile. It is less near the sea, where for long distances
                    there is no fall at all. It is generally more near the watershed; but there is
                    here no ridge of high ground between the Indus and the Ganges, and a very
                    trifling change of level would often turn the upper waters of one river into the
                    other. It is not unlikely that such changes have in past time occurred; and if
                    so an explanation is afforded of the occurrence of allied forms of freshwater
                    dolphins <hi rend="italic">{Platanista)</hi> and of many other animals in the
                    two rivers and in the Brahmaputra.</p>
                <p>There is no evidence that the Indo-Gangetic plain existed as such in Pre-Tertiary
                    times. It is highly probable that the Jurassic and Cretaceous coast-line ran
                    across the northern part of the Bay of Bengal, and that most of the area now
                    occupied by the Gangetic plain was then above the sea. Probably the Jurassic
                    traps of the Râjmahâl hills, west of the delta of the Ganges, were continuous
                    with those of Sylhet, east of the delta. Marine Jurassic and Cretaceous beds are
                    absent from the margins of the true Gangetic plain; so too are marine Eocene
                    beds. In Eocene times the sea spread up the Punjab; but that too was land only
                    in Miocene times.</p>
                <p>The alluvial deposits of the plain, as made known by the boring at Calcutta,
                    prove a gradual depression of the area through the later Tertiary times. There
                    are peat and forest beds, which must have grown quietly at the surface,
                    alternating with deposits of gravel, sand, and clay. The thickness of the delta
                    deposit is unknown; 481 feet was proved at the bore hole, but probably this
                    represents only a very small part of the deposit. Outside the delta, in the Bay
                    of Bengal, is a deep depression known as the “swatch of no ground”; all around
                    it the soundings are only of 5 to 10 fathoms, but they very rapidly deepen to
                    over 300 fathoms. Mr J. Ferguson has shown that the sediment is carried away
                    from this area by the set of the currents; probably then it has remained free
                    from sediment whilst the neighbouring sea bottom has gradually been filled up.
                    If so, the thickness of the alluvium is at least 1800 feet, and may be much
                    more.</p>
                <p>The Indo-Gangetic plain dates back to Eocene times; the origin of the Himalayas
                    may be referred to the same period. Numerous minor disturbances occurred in the
                    area which is now northern India during Palaeozoic and Secondary times, but the
                    great disturbance which has resulted in the formation of the existing chain of
                    the Himalayas took place after the deposition of the Eocene beds. Disturbances
                    even greater in amount occurred after the deposition of the Pliocene beds. The
                    Eocenes of the Sub-Himâlayan range were deposited upon uncontorted Palaeozoic
                    rocks, but the whole has since been violently contorted and disturbed. There are
                    some indications that the disturbing forces were more severe to the eastward
                    during middle Tertiary times, and that the main action to the westward was of
                    later date. It seems highly probable that the elevation of the mountain ranges
                    and the depression of the Indo-Gangetic plain were closely related. This view
                    gains some support from a glance at the map, where we see that the curves of the
                    great mountain chains are strictly followed by those of the great alluvial
                    plain. Probably both are due to almost contemporary movements of the earth’s
                    crust; these movements, though now of vastly diminished intensity, have not
                    wholly ceased. The alluvial deposits prove depression in quite recent geological
                    times; and within the Himâlayan region earthquakes are still common, whilst in
                    Peninsular India they are rare.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Peninsular India.—</hi> The oldest rocks of this area consist
                    of gneiss, which occurs in three districts :—a very large part of Bengal and
                    Madras, extending to Ceylon; the Aravalli; and Bundelkhand. Of these formations,
                    the gneiss of Bundelkhand is known to be the oldest, because the oldest
                    Transition rocks rest upon it; whereas the same Transition rocks are altered and
                    intersected by granitic dykes which proceed from the gneiss of the other
                    districts. The Transition rocks are of great but unknown age. The Vindhyan rocks
                    which succeed them are of very old Palaeozoic age, perhaps Pre-Silurian. But
                    long before the earliest Vindhyan rocks were laid down the Transition rocks had
                    been altered and contorted. The great movements of the earth’s crust which
                    produced that contortion are the latest which have taken place to any great
                    extent in the Indian Peninsula. In more recent times there have been local
                    disturbances, and large faults have in places been found; but the greater part
                    of the Peninsula rocks are only slightly disturbed, and the most recent of the
                    great and wide spread earth movements of this region date back to Pre-Vindhyan
                    times. The Vindhyan series are generally sharply marked off from older rocks;
                    but in the Godâvari valley there is no well-defined line between these and the
                    Transition rocks. The Vindhyan beds are divided into two groups. The lower, with
                    an estimated thickness of only 2000 feet, or slightly more, cover a large
                    area,—extending, with but little change of character, from the Son valley in one
                    direction to Cuddapah, and in a diverging line to near Bijâpur—in each case a
                    distance of over 700 miles. The upper Vindhyans cover a much smaller area, but
                    attain a thickness of about 12,000 feet. The Vindhyans are well stratified beds
                    of sandstone and shale, with some limestones. As yet they have yielded no trace
                    of fossils, and their exact age is consequently unknown. So far as the evidence
                    goes, it appears probable that they are of very ancient Palaeozoic age, perhaps
                    Pre-Silurian. The total absence of fossils is a remarkable fact, and one for
                    which it is difficult to account, as the beds are for the most part quite
                    unaltered. Even if they are entirely of freshwater origin, we should expect that
                    some traces of life from the waters or neighbouring land would be found.</p>
                <p>The Gondwâna series is in many respects the most interesting and important series
                    of the Indian Peninsula. The beds are almost entirely of freshwater origin. Many
                    subdivisions have been made, but here we need only note the main division into
                    two great groups :—Lower Gondwânas, 13,000 feet thick; Upper Gondwânas, 11,000
                    feet thick. The series is mainly confined to the area of country between the
                    Narbadâ and the Son on the north and the Krishna on the south; but the western
                    part of this region is in great part covered by newer beds. The lowest Gondwânas
                    are very constant in character, wherever they are found; the upper numbers of
                    the lower division show more variation, and this divergence of character in
                    different districts becomes more marked in the L <hi rend="superscript"> τ</hi>
                    pper Gondwâna series. Disturbances have occurred in the lower series before the
                    formation of the upper.</p>
                <p>The Gondwâna beds contain fossils which are of very great interest. In large part
                    these consist of plants which grew near the margins of the old rivers, and which
                    were carried down by floods, and deposited in the alluvial plains, deltas, and
                    estuarine areas of the old Gondwâna period. So vast was the time occupied by the
                    deposition of the Gondwâna beds that great changes in physical geography and in
                    the vegetation repeatedly occurred. The plants of the Lower Gondwânas consist
                    chiefly of acrogens <hi rend="italic">(Eqwisetaceoe</hi> and ferns) and
                    gymnogens (cycads and conifers), the former being the more abundant. The same
                    classes of plants occur in the Upper Gondwânas; but there the proportions are
                    reversed, the conifers, and still <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0912-0760-0737"/> more the cycads, being more numerous than the
                    ferns, whilst the <hi rend="italic">Equisetaceae</hi> are but sparingly found.
                    But even within the limits of the Lower Gondwâna series there are great
                    diversities of vegetation, three distinct floras occurring in the three great
                    divisions of that formation. In many respects the flora of the highest of these
                    three divisions (the Pânchet group) is more nearly related to that of the Upper
                    Gondwânas than it is to the other Lower Gondwâna floras.</p>
                <p>One of the most interesting facts in the history of the Gondwâna series is the
                    occurrence near the base (in the Tâlcher group) of large striated boulders in a
                    fine mud or silt, the boulders in one place resting upon rock (of Vindhyan age)
                    which is also striated. There seems good reason for believing that these beds
                    are the result of iceaction. They probably nearly coincide in age with the
                    Permian beds of Western Europe, in which Professor Ramsay long since discovered
                    evidence of glaciation. But the remarkable fact is that this old ice-action
                    occurred within the tropics, and probably at no very great height above the
                    sea.</p>
                <p>The Dâmodar series, the middle division of the Lower Gondwanas, is the chief
                    source of coal in Peninsular India, yielding more of that mineral than all other
                    formations taken together. The Karharbâri group is the only other coal-bearing
                    formation of any value. The Dâmodars are 8400 feet thick in theRâniganj
                    coal-field, and about 10,000 feet thick in the Sâtpura basin. They consist of
                    three divisions; coal occurs in the upper and lower, ironstone (without coal) in
                    the middle division. The Râniganj coalfield is the most important in India. So
                    far as is yet known, it covers au area of about 500 square miles, extending
                    about 18 miles from north to south and about 39 miles from east to west; but it
                    extends further to the east under the laterite and alluvium. It is traversed by
                    the Dâmodar river, along which run the road from Calcutta to Benares and the
                    East Indian Railway. From its situation and importance this coal-field is better
                    known than any other in India. Much has been learnt concerning it since the last
                    examination by the Geological Survey, and our remarks are in great part based on
                    recent reports by Mr H. Bauerman. The upper or Râniganj series (stated by the
                    Geological Survey to be 5000 feet thick) contains eleven seams, having a total
                    thickness of 120 feet, in the eastern district, and thirteen seams, 100 feet
                    thick, in the western district. The average thickness of the seams worked is
                    from 12 to 18 feet, but occasionally a seam acquires a great thickness— 20 to 80
                    feet. The lower or Barâkhar series (2000 feet thick) contains four seams, of a
                    total thickness of 69 feet. Compared with English coals those of this coal-field
                    are of but poor quality; they contain much ash, and are generally non-coking.
                    The seams of the lower series are the best, and some of these at Sânktoria, near
                    the Barâkhar river, are fairly good for coke and gas. The best coal in India is
                    in the small coal-field at Karharbâri. The beds there are lower in the series
                    than those of the Râniganj field; they belong to the upper part of the Tâlcher
                    group, the lowest of the Gondwâna series. The coal-bearing beds cover an area of
                    only about 11 square miles; there are three seams, varying from 9 to 33 feet
                    thick. The lowest seam is the best, and this is as good as English steam coal.
                    This coalfield, now largely worked, is the property of the East Indian Railway,
                    which is thus supplied with fuel at a cheaper rate than any other railway in the
                    world. Indian coal usually contains phosphoric acid; which greatly lessens its
                    value for iron-smelting.</p>
                <p>The Dâmodar series, which, as we have seen, is the chief source of coal in India,
                    is also one of the most important sources of iron. The ore occurs in the middle
                    division, coal in the highest and lowest. The ore is partly a clay ironstone,
                    like that occurring in the Coal-measures of England, partly an oxide of iron or
                    haematite. It generally contains phosphorus, which prevents its use in the
                    preparation of the finer qualities of steel. A similar difficulty attends the
                    use of the Cleveland ore of North Yorkshire. Experiments have been in progress
                    for years in search of a process which shall, in an economical manner, obtain
                    iron from Cleveland ore free from phosphorus, latterly, it is hoped, with some
                    success. If this be so, India will be a great gainer. Excellent iron-ore occurs
                    in the Metamorphic rocks south of the Dâmodar river. Laterite (see below) is
                    sometimes used as ore. It is very earthy and of a low percentage; but it
                    contains only a comparatively small proportion of phosphorus.</p>
                <p>The want of limestone for flux, within easy reach, is generally a great drawback
                    as regards iron-smelting in India. <hi rend="italic">Kankar</hi> or <hi
                    rend="italic">ghutin</hi> (concretionary carbonate of lime) is collected for
                    this purpose from the river beds and alluvial deposits. It sometimes contains as
                    much as 70 percent, of carbonate of lime; but generally the amount is much less
                    and the fluxing value proportionally diminished. The real difficulty in India is
                    to find the ore, the fuel, and the flux in sufficiently close proximity to yield
                    a profit.</p>
                <p>The enormous mass of basaltic rock known as the Deccan trap is of great
                    importance in the geological structure of the Indian Peninsula. It now covers an
                    area of about 200,000 square miles, and probably formerly extended over a much
                    wider area. Where thickest, the traps are at least 6000 feet thick. They form
                    the most striking physical features of the country, many of the most prominent
                    hill ranges being the denuded edges of the basaltic flows. The great volcanic
                    outbursts which produced this trap commenced in the Cretaceous period and lasted
                    on into the Eocene period.</p>
                <p>Laterite is a ferruginous and argillaceous rock, varying from 30 to 200 feet
                    thick, which often occurs over the trap area, but is also found in other
                    districts. As a rule it makes rather barren land; it is highly porous, and the
                    rain rapidly sinks into it. Laterite may be roughly divided into two kinds,
                    high-level and low-level laterites. The former, which covers a large area of the
                    high basaltic plains, is believed by Mr R. B. Foote to be very frequently the
                    product of decomposition of the trap, and to have been thus formed in the place
                    in which it is now-found. Sometimes the high-level laterite overlies gneiss or
                    other rocks; and in these cases it has probably been transported. The low-level
                    laterite is generally more sandy in character, and is often associated with
                    gravels. In most cases this has clearly been carried down to its present
                    position, probably largely by subaerial action, aided by rains and streams.
                    Possibly in some cases it has been spread out along the coasts by marine action.
                    The low-level laterite fringes the coast of the Peninsular more or less from
                    near Bombay on the west and Orissa on the east to Cape Comorin. It is not
                    continuous throughout these districts; and it is of very varying width and
                    elevation. The age of the high-level laterite is unknown. Its formation probably
                    extended throughout a long period of time, much of which must be of very ancient
                    date; for the laterite, together with the underlying basalt, has suffered
                    extensive denudation.</p>
                <p>The mercantile aspects of the coal, iron, and other mineral products of India
                    will be fully treated of under a subsequent section (pp. 764-66). The geologist
                    comes in this matter to the same conclusion as the economist, viz., that the
                    mineral wealth of India, as represented by its precious stones, was the product
                    of forced labour, and that the search for them in our days can scarcely repay
                    the working expenses.</p>

                <p>The great peninsula of India, with its lofty mountain ranges behind and its
                    extensive seaboard exposed to the first violence of the winds of two oceans,
                    forms an exceptionally valuable and interesting field for the study of
                    meteorological phenomena. But only within the last few years have trustworthy
                    statistics been obtained for some of its most important registration
                    stations.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Meteorological Geography.—</hi> After the general description
                    of the country which has been given at the beginning of this article, it is only
                    necessary here to sketch very briefly the meteorological geography of the
                    peninsula. The following sentences are condensed from an interesting account in
                    the first <hi rend="italic">Report on the Meteorology of India</hi> (for 1875),
                    by Mr H. F. Blanford. From the gorge of the Indus to that of the Dihong
                    (Brahmaputra), a distance of 1400 miles, the Himalayas form an unbroken
                    watershed, the northern flank of which is drained by the upper valleys of these
                    two rivers; while the Sutlej (Satlaj), starting from the southern foot of the
                    Kailas Peak, breaks through the watershed, dividing it into two very unequal
                    portions, that to the north-west being the smaller. The average elevation of the
                    Himâlaya crest may be taken at not less than 19,000 feet, and therefore equal to
                    the height of the lower half of the atmosphere; and indeed few of the passes are
                    under 16,000 or 17,000 feet. Across this mountain barrier there appears to be a
                    constant flow of air, more active in the day-time than at night, northwards to
                    the arid plateau of Tibet. There is no reason to believe that any transfer of
                    air takes place across the Himalayas in a southerly direction, unless, indeed,
                    in those most elevated regions of the atmosphere which lie beyond the range of
                    observation; but a nocturnal flow of cooled air, from the southern slopes, is
                    felt as a strong wind where the rivers debouch on the plains, more especially in
                    the early morning hours; and this probably contributes in some degree to lower
                    the mean temperature of that belt of the plains which fringes the mountain
                    zone.</p>
                <p>At the foot of the great mountain barrier, and separating it from the more
                    ancient land which now forms the highlands of the peninsula, a broad plain, for
                    the most part alluvial, stretches from sea to sea. On the west, in the dry
                    region, this is occupied partly by the alluvial deposits of the Indus and its
                    tributaries and the saline swamps of Kahhch (Cutch), partly by the rolling sands
                    and rocky surface of the desert of Jâisalmir and Bikanir, and the more fertile
                    tracts to the eastward watered by the Lûnai. Over the greater part of this
                    region rain is of rare occurrence; and not infrequently more than a year passes
                    without a drop falling on the parched surface. On its eastern margin, however,
                    in the neighbourhood of the Aravalli hills, and again on the northern Punjab,
                    rain is more frequent, occurring both in the south-west monsoon, and also at the
                    opposite season in the cold weather. As far south as Sirsa and Mùltân (Mooltan),
                    the average rainfall does not much exceed 7 inches.</p>
                <p>The alluvial plain of the Punjab passes into that of the Gangetic valley without
                    visible interruption. Up or down this plain, at opposite seasons, sweep the
                    monsoon winds, in a direction at right angles to that of their nominal course;
                    and thus vapour which has been brought by winds from the Bay of Bengal is
                    discharged as snow and rain on the peaks and hillsides of the Western Himalayas.
                    Nearly the whole surface is under cultivation, and it ranks among the most
                    productive as well as the most densely populated regions of the world. The
                    rainfall diminishes from 100 inches in the south-east corner of the Gangetic
                    delta to less than 30 inches at Agra and Delhi, and there is an average
                    difference of from 15 to 25 inches between the northern and southern borders of
                    the plain.</p>
                <p>Eastward from the Bengal delta, two alluvial plains stretch up between the hills
                    which connect the Himälayan system with that of the Burmese peninsula. The
                    first, or the valley of Assam and the Brahmaputra, is long and narrow, bordered
                    on the north by the Himalayas, on the south by the lower plateau of the Gâro,
                    Khâsi, and Nâgâ hills. The other, short and broad, and in great part occupied by
                    swamps and <hi rend="italic">fhils,</hi> separates the Gâro, Khâsi, and Nâgâ
                    hills from those of Tipperah and the Lushâi country. The climate of these plains
                    is damp' and equable, and the rainfall is prolonged and generally heavy,
                    especially on the southern slopes of the hills. A meteorological peculiarity of
                    some interest has been noticed, more especially at the stations of Sibsâgar and
                    Silchâr, viz., the great range of the diurnal variation of barometric pressure
                    during the afternoon hours,—which is the more striking, since at Rürki
                    (Roorkee), Lahore, and other stations near the foot of the Western Himâlayas,
                    this range is less than in the open plains.</p>
                <p>The highlands of the peninsula, which are cut off from the encircling ranges by
                    the broad Indo-Gangetic plain, are divided into two unequal parts, by an almost
                    continuous chain of hills running across the country from west by south to east
                    by north, just south of the Tropic of Cancer. This chain may be regarded as a
                    single geographical feature, forming one of the principal watersheds of the
                    peninsula, the waters to the north draining chiefly into the Narbadâ and the
                    Ganges, those to the south into the Tâpti, the Godâvari, the Mahânadi, and some
                    smaller streams. In a meteorological point of view it is of considerable
                    importance. Together with the two parallel valleys of the Narbadâ (Nerbudda) and
                    Tâpti (Taptee), which drain the flanks of its western half, it gives, at
                    opposite seasons of the year, a decided easterly and westerly direction to the
                    winds of this part of India, and condenses a tolerably copious rainfall during
                    the south-west monsoon.</p>
                <p>Separated from this chain by the valley of the Narbadâ on the west, and that of
                    the Son on the east, the plateau of Mâlwâ and Baghelkhand occupies the space
                    intervening between these valleys and the Gangetic plain. On the western edge of
                    the plateau are the Aravalli hills, which run from near Ahmadâbâd up to the
                    neighbourhood of Delhi, and include one hill, Mount Abu, over 5000 feet in
                    height. This range exerts an important influence on the direction of the wind,
                    and also on the rainfall. At Ajmir (Ajmere), an old meteorological station at
                    the eastern foot of the range, the wind is predominantly south-west, and there
                    and at Mount Abu the south-west monsoon rains are a regularly recurrent
                    phenomenon,—which can hardly be said of the region of scanty and uncertain
                    rainfall that extends from the western foot of the range and merges in the
                    Bikanir desert.</p>
                <p>The peninsula south of the Sâtpura range consists chiefly of the triangular
                    plateau of the Deccan, terminating abruptly on the west in the Sahyâdri range
                    (Western Ghâts), and shelving to the east (Eastern Ghâts). This plateau is swept
                    by the south-west monsoon, but not until it has surmounted the western barrier
                    of the Ghâts; and hence the rainfall is, as a rule, light at Poona and places
                    similarly situated under the lee of the range, and but moderate over the more
                    easterly parts of the plateau. The rains, however, are prolonged some three or
                    four weeks later than in tracts to the north of the Sâtpuras, since they are
                    also brought by the easterly winds which blow from the Bay of Bengal in October
                    and the early part of November, when the recurved southerly wind ceases to blow
                    up the Gangetic valley, and sets towards the south-east coast. This was formerly
                    thought to be a north-east monsoon, and is still so spoken of by certain
                    writers; but the rainy wind is really a diversion of the south-west monsoon.</p>

                <p>At the junction of the Eastern and Western Ghâts rises the bold triangular
                    plateau of the Nilgiris, and to the south of them come the Anamalais, the Palnis
                    (Pulneys), and the hills of Travancore. These ranges are separated from the
                    Nilgiris by a broad depression or pass known as the Pâlghât Gap, some 25 miles
                    wide, the highest point of which is only 1500 feet above the sea. This gap
                    affords a passage to the winds which elsewhere are barred by the hills of the
                    Ghât chain. The country to the east of the gap receives the rainfall of the
                    south-west monsoon; and during the north-east monsoon ships passing Bey pur meet
                    with a stronger wind from the land than is felt elsewhere on the Malabar coast.
                    According to Captain Newbold, this gap “affords an outlet to those furious
                    storms from the eastward which sweep the Bay of Bengal, and, after traversing
                    the peninsula, burst forth through it to the neighbouring sea.”</p>
                <p>In the strip of low country that fringes the peninsula below the Gluιts, the
                    rainfall is heavy and the climate warm and damp, the vegetation being dense and
                    characteristically tropical, and the steep slopes of the Ghàts, where they have
                    not been artificially cleared, thickly clothed with forest.</p>
                <p>In Burmah, the country around Ava, as well as the hill country to the north, has
                    suffered from severe earthquakes, one of which destroyed Ava in 1839. The
                    general meri-dianal direction of the ranges and valleys determines the direction
                    of the prevailing surface winds, this being, however, subject to many local
                    modifications. But it would appear, from Dr Anderson’s observations of the
                    movement of the upper clouds, that throughout the year there is, with but slight
                    interruption, a steady upper current from the south-west, such as has been
                    already noticed over the Himalayas. The rainfall in the lower part of the Ira
                    wadi valley, viz., the delta and the neighbouring part of the province of Pegu,
                    is very heavy; and the climate is very mild and equable at all seasons. But
                    higher up the valley, and especially north of the Pegu frontier, the country is
                    drier, and is characterized by a less luxuriant vegetation, and a retarded and
                    more scanty rainfall.</p>

                    :—“In conclusion, the following are the more important inferences that the
                    meteorology of India in the years 1877 and 1878 appear to suggest, if not to
                    establish. There is a tendency at the minimum sun-spot periods to prolonged
                    excessive pressure over India, to an unusual development of the winter rains,
                    and to the occurrence of abnormally heavy snowfall over the Himalayan region (to
                    a greater extent probably in the western than the eastern Himalayas). This

                    monsoon are—great irregularity in the distribution of the rainfall over the
                    whole of India, and the occurrence of heavy local rainfalls, which tend, by a
                    law of rainfall and of air-motion, to recur over the same limited areas. The
                    irregularity of rainfall distribution is often shown by the persistent and
                    prolonged absence of rain over considerable areas. These areas of drought and
                    famine are partly marked off by nature, depending to a certain extent on the
                    geographical features and position of the district. Thus the rains are more
                    likely to fall below the amount necessary for cultivation in the dry region of
                    the Deccan or in Upper India, than over the Malabar coast area or the province

                <p>Unlike many other large geographical areas, India is remarkable for having no
                    distinctive botanical features peculiar to itself. It differs conspicuously in
                    this respect from such countries as Australia or South Africa. Its vegetation is
                    in point of fact of a composite character, and is constituted by the meeting and
                    more or less blending of adjoining floras,—of those of Persia and the
                    south-eastern Mediterranean area to the north-west, of Siberia to the north, of
                    China to the east, and of Malaya to the south-east.</p>
                <p>Our space does not admit of any minute discussion of the local features peculiar
                    to separate districts, but regarded broadly, four tolerably distinct types
                    present themselves.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Himalayan.—</hi> The base of the Himalayas is occupied by a
                    narrow belt forming an extreme north-western extension of the Malayan type
                    described below. Above that there is a rich temperate flora which in the eastern
                    chain may be regarded as forming an extension of that of northern China,
                    gradually assuming westwards more and more of a European facies. <hi

                    the Atlantic cedar and to the cedar of Lebanon, a form of which has recently
                    been found in Cyprus. A notable further instance of the connexion of the western

                <p>The upper levels of the Himalayas slope northwards gradually to the Tibetan
                    uplands, over which the Siberian temperate vegetation ranges. This is part of
                    the great temperate flora which, with locally individualized species, but often
                    with identical genera, ranges over the whole of the temperate zone of the
                    northern hemisphere. In the western Himâlayas this upland flora is marked by a
                    strong admixture of European species, such as the columbine <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Aguilegia)</hi> and hawthorn <hi rend="italic">(Cratoegus</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Oxyacantha).</hi> These disappear rapidly eastward, and are
                    scarcely found beyond Kumâun.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">North-Western.—</hi> This is best marked in Sind and the
                    Punjab, where the climate is very dry (the rainfall averaging less than 15
                    inches), and where the soil, though fertile, is wholly dependent on irrigation
                    for its cultivation. The flora is a poor one in number of species, and is
                    essentially identical with that of Persia, southern Arabia, and Egypt. The low
                    scattered jungle contains such characteristic species as <hi rend="italic"
                    >Capparis aphylla, Acacia arabica</hi> (babùl), <hi rend="italic"
                    >Populus</hi><hi rend="italic">euphratica</hi> (the “willows” of Ps. cxxxvii.
                    2), <hi rend="italic">Salvadora persica</hi> (erroneously identified by Royle
                    with the mustard of Matt, xiii. 31), tamarisk, <hi rend="italic"
                    >Zizyphus,</hi><hi rend="italic">Lotus,</hi> &amp;c. More than nine-tehths of
                    the Sind vegetation is estimated to be indigenous to Africa. The dry flora
                    extends somewhat in a southeast direction, and then blends insensibly with that
                    of the western peninsula; some species representing it are found in the upper
                    Gangetic plain, and a few are widely distributed in dry parts of the
                    country.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Malayan.—</hi> This Sir Joseph Hooker describes as forming “the
                    bulk of the flora of the perennially humid regions of India, as of the whole
                    Malayan peninsula, the Upper Assam valley, the Khâsi mountains, the forests of
                    the base of the Himalaya from the Brahmaputra to Nep41, of the Malabar coast,
                    and of Ceylon.” It is not of course intended that over this wide and disjointed
                    area there is an actual identity of species; but the affinities and general
                    agreement of facies are sufficiently close to leave no doubt that they belong
                    essentially to one and the same flora. A few illustrations must suffice
                    :—pitcher-plants <hi rend="italic">(Nepenthes),</hi> so richly developed in
                    Borneo, occur at Singapore, on the Khâsï mountains, and in Ceylon, while they
                    are absent from the western peninsula; wood-oil trees <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Diptcrocarpeoe),</hi> which abound in the forests of the Malayan archipelago,
                    are well represented by species individualized by isolation in the Malayan
                    peninsula, Ceylon, and southern India; the gamboge of Singapore is scarcely
                    distinguishable botanically from the Ceylon species; rubber-yielding trees are
                    characteristic, such are the climbing <hi rend="italic">Apocynaceoe</hi> found
                    in the Malayan peninsula and Borneo, and the well-known <hi rend="italic">Picus
                    elastica,</hi> indigenous to Assam and Java; numerous palms and several species
                    of <hi rend="italic">Cycas</hi> also distinguish this flora from that of the
                    western peninsula. Teak <hi rend="italic">(Tectona</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >grandis),</hi> which is indigenous to the Malayan archipelago, is native to
                    both peninsulas as far as 25° N. lat., and is more tolerant of a dry climate
                    than most of its associates.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Western Peninsula.—</hi> This type is difficult to
                    characterize, and is in many respects intermediate between the two just
                    preceding. It occupies a comparatively dry area, with a rainfall under 75
                    inches. In respect to positive affinities, Sir Joseph Hooker has pointed out·
                    some relations with the flora of tropical Africa as evidenced by the prevalence
                    of such genera as <hi rend="italic">Grewia</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >Impatiens,</hi> and the absence, common to both countries, of oaks and pines
                    which abound in the Malayan archipelago. The annual vegetation which springs up
                    in the rainy season includes numerous genera, such as <hi rend="italic"
                    >Sida</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Indigofera,</hi> which are largely represented
                    both in Africa and Hindustân. Palms also in both countries are scanty, the most
                    notable in southern India being the wild date <hi rend="italic">(Phoenix</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">sylvestris)</hi><hi rend="italic">; Borassus</hi> and the
                    cocoa-nut are cultivated. The forests, though occasionally very dense, as in the
                    western Ghâts, are usually drier and more open than those of the Malayan type,
                    and are often scrubby. The most important timber trees are the toon <hi

                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Wild Animals.</hi><hi rend="italic">Mammals.—</hi> First
                    among the wild animals of India must be mentioned the lion <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Felis</hi><hi rend="italic">led),</hi> which is known to have been not
                    uncommon within historical times in Hindustan Proper and the Punjab. At present,
                    the lion is supposed to be confined to the sandy deserts of Guzerat. A peculiar
                    variety is there found, marked by the absence of a mane; but whether this
                    variety deserves to be classed as a distinct species naturalists are not yet
                    determined. The former extent of the lion’s range, or at least the degree to
                    which its presence impressed the imagination, may be inferred from the common
                    personal names, Sinh or Sing, Sher, and Hyder, which all signify “lion.” The
                    characteristic beast of prey in India is the tiger <hi rend="italic">(F.</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">tigris),</hi> which is found in every part of the country from the
                    slopes of the Himalayas to the Sundarban swamps. Sir Joseph Fayrer, the highest
                    living authority on this subject, believes that 12 feet is the maximum length of
                    the tiger, when measured from nose to tip of tail immediately after death. The
                    advance of cultivation, even more than the incessant attacks of sportsmen, has
                    gradually caused the tiger to become a rare animal in large tracts of country;
                    but it is scarcely probable that he will ever be exterminated from India. The
                    malarious <hi rend="italic">tardi</hi> fringing the Himalâyas, the uninhabitable
                    swamps of the Gangetic delta, and the wide jungles of the central plateau, are
                    at present the chief home of the tiger. His favourite food appears to be deer,
                    antelope, and wild hog. When these abound he will disregard domestic cattle.
                    Indeed, the natives are disposed to consider him as in some sort their
                    protector, as he saves their crops from destruction by the wild animals on which
                    he feeds. But when once he develops a taste for human blood, then the slaughter
                    he works becomes truly formidable. The confirmed man-eater, which is generally
                    an old beast, disabled from overtaking his usual prey, seems to accumulate his
                    tale of victims in sheer cruelty rather than for food. A single tiger is known
                    to have killed 108 people in the course of three years. Another killed an
                    average of about 80 persons per annum. A third caused thirteen villages to be
                    abandoned, and 250 square miles of land to be thrown out of cultivation. A
                    fourth, so late as 1869, killed 127 people, and stopped a public road for many
                    weeks, until the opportune arrival of an English sportsman, who at last killed
                    him. Such cases are, of course, exceptional, and generally refer to a period
                    long past, but they explain and justify the superstitious awe with which the
                    tiger is regarded by the natives. The favourite mode of shooting the tiger is
                    from the back of elephants, or from elevated platforms <hi rend="italic"
                    >(machdnd)</hi> of boughs in the jungle. In Central India they are shot on foot.
                    In Assam they are sometimes speared from boats, and in the Himalayas they are
                    said to be ensnared by bird-lime. Rewards are given by Government to native <hi
                    rend="italic">shikaris</hi> for the heads of tigers, varying in time and place
                    according to the need. In 1877, 819 persons and 16,137 cattle were reported to
                    have been killed by tigers; on the other side of the account, 1579 tigers were
                    reported slain, and £3777 was paid in rewards. The leopard or panther <hi
                    rend="italic">(F. pardud)</hi> is far more common than the tiger in all parts of
                    India, and at least equally destructive to life and property. The greatest
                    length of the leopard is about 7 feet 6 inches. A black variety, as beautiful as
                    it is rare, is sometimes found in the extreme south of the peninsula, and also
                    in Java. The cheetah or hunting leopard <hi rend="italic">(Gueparda</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">jubata)</hi> must be carefully distinguished from the leopard
                    proper. This animal appears to be a native only of the Deccan, where it is
                    trained for hunting the antelope. In some respects it approaches the dog more
                    nearly than the cat tribe. Its limbs are long, its hair rough, and its claws
                    blunt and only partially retractile. The speed with which it bounds upon its
                    prey, when loosed from the cart, exceeds the swiftness of any other mammal If it
                    misses its first attack, it scarcely ever attempts to follow, but returns to its
                    master. Among other species of the family <hi rend="italic">Felidae</hi> found
                    in India may be mentioned the ounce or snow leopard (#. <hi rend="italic"
                    >uncia),</hi> the clouded tiger <hi rend="italic">(F. macroscelid),</hi> the
                    marbled tiger cat <hi rend="italic">(F.</hi><hi rend="italic">marmorata),</hi>
                    the jungle cat <hi rend="italic">(P∙</hi><hi rend="italic">chaud)</hi> and the
                    common viverrine cat <hi rend="italic">(F. viverrind).</hi></p>
                <p>Wolves <hi rend="italic">(Canis</hi><hi rend="italic">lupus)</hi> abound
                    throughout the open country, but are rare in the wooded districts. Their
                    favourite prey is sheep, but they are also said to run down antelopes and hares,
                    or rather catch them by lying iu ambush. Instances of their attacking man are
                    not uncommon. In 1827 upwards of thirty children were carried off by wolves in a
                    single <hi rend="italic">pargand;</hi> and the story of Romulus and Remus has
                    had its counterpart in India within recent times. The Indian wolf has a dingy
                    reddish-white fur, some of the hairs being tipped with black. By some
                    naturalists it is regarded as a distinct species, under the name of <hi
                    rend="italic">Canis</hi><hi rend="italic">ρallipes.</hi> Three distinct
                    varieties, the white, the red, and the black wolf, are found in the Tibetan
                    Himâlayas. The Indian fox <hi rend="italic">(Vulpes</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >bengalensid)</hi> is comparatively rare, but the jackal <hi rend="italic">(C.
                    aureus)</hi> abounds everywhere, making night hideous by its
                    never-to-be-forgotten yells. The jackal, and not the fox, is usually the animal
                    hunted by the packs of hounds occasionally kept by Europeans. The wild dog or
                    dhole <hi rend="italic">(C. dhola)</hi> is found in all the wilder jungles of
                    India, including Assam and British Burmah. Its characteristic is that it hunts
                    in packs, sometimes containing thirty dogs, and does not give tongue. when once
                    a pack of wild dogs has put up any animal, whether deer or tiger, that animal’s
                    doom is sealed. They do not leave it for days, and finally bring it to bay, or
                    run it down exhausted. These wild dogs have sometimes been half domesticated,
                    and trained to hunt for the use of man. A peculiar variety of wild dog exists in
                    the Karen hills of Burmah, thus described from a specimen in confinement. It was
                    black and white, as hairy as a skye-terrier, and as large as a medium-sized
                    spaniel. It had an invariable habit of digging a hole in the ground, into which
                    it crawled backwards, remaining there all day with only its nose and ferrety
                    eyes visible. Among other dogs of India are the pariah, which is merely a
                    mongrel, run wild and half starved; the poligar dog, an immense creature
                    peculiar to the south; the grey-hound, used for coursing; and the mastiff of
                    Tibet and Bhutan. The striped hyaena <hi rend="italic">(Hyoena</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">striata)</hi> is common, being found wherever the wolf is absent.
                    Like the wolf, it is very destructive both to the flocks and to children.</p>
                <p>Of bears, the common black or sloth bear <hi rend="italic">(Ursus</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">labiatιιs)</hi> is common throughout India wherever rocky hills
                    and forests occur. It is distinguished by a white horse-shoe mark on its breast.
                    Its food consists of ants, honey, and fruit. When disturbed it will attack man,
                    and it is a dangerous antagonist, for it always strikes at the face. The
                    Hiπtalayan or Tibetan sun bear <hi rend="italic">(U. tibetaηus)</hi> is found
                    along the north, from the Punjab to Assam. During the summer it remains high up
                    in the mountains, near the limit of snow, but in the winter it descends to 5000
                    feet and even lower. Its congener, the Malayan sun bear <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Helarctos malayanud),</hi> is found in British Burmah, where also there is a
                    smaller species <hi rend="italic">(H. euryspil·ud),</hi> and a very large animal
                    reported to be as big as the American grizzly.</p>
                <p>The elephant <hi rend="italic">(Elephas</hi><hi rend="italic">indiens)</hi> is
                    found in many parts of India, though not in the north-west. Contrary to what
                    might be anticipated from its size and from the habits of its African cousin,
                    the Indian elephant is now, at any rate, an inhabitant, not of the plains, but
                    of the hills; and even on the hills it is usually found among the higherridges
                    and plateaus, and not in the valleys. From the peninsula of <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0912-0765-0742"/> India the elephant has been gradually
                    exterminated, being only found now in the primaeval forests of Cυorg, Mysore,
                    and Travancore, and in the tributary states of Orissa. It still exists in
                    considerable number along the <hi rend="italic">tardi</hi> or submontane fringe
                    of the Himâlayas. The main source of supply at the present time is the confused
                    mass of hills which forms the north-east boundary of British India, from Assam
                    to Burmah. Two varieties are there distinguished, the <hi rend="italic"
                    >gunda</hi> or tusker, and the <hi rend="italic">makna</hi> or <hi rend="italic"
                    >hine,</hi> which has no tusks. The reports of the height of the elephant, like
                    those of its intelligence, seem to be exaggerated. The maximum is probably 12
                    feet. If hunted, the elephant must be attacked on foot, and the sport is
                    therefore dangerous, especially as the animal has but few parts vulnerable to a
                    bullet. The regular mode of catching elephants is by means of a <hi
                    rend="italic">kheda</hi> or gigantic stockade, into which a wild herd is driven,
                    then starved into submission, and tamed by animals already domesticated. The
                    practice of capturing them in pitfalls is discouraged as cruel and wasteful.
                    Elephants now form a Government monopoly everywhere in India. The shooting of
                    them is prohibited, except when they become dangerous to man or destructive to
                    the crops; and the right of capturing them is only leased out upon conditions. A
                    special law, under the title of “The Elephants Preservation Act” (No. VI. of
                    1879), regulates this licensing system. Whoever kills, captures, or injures an
                    elephant, or attempts to do so, without a licence, is punishable by a fine of
                    500 rupees for the first offence; and a similar fine, together with six months’
                    imprisonment, for a second offence. In the year 1877-78 a total of two hundred
                    and sixty-four elephants were captured in the province of Assam, yielding to
                    Government a revenue of £3600. In the season of 1873-74 no less than fifty-three
                    were captured at one time by Mr Sanderson, the superintendent of the Kheda
                    Department in Mysore, who has made a special study of the Indian elephant, as
                    Sir S. Baker has of the same animal in Ceylon. Though the supply is decreasing,
                    elephants continue to be in great demand. Their chief use is in the timber
                    trade, and for Government transport. They are also bought up by native chiefs at
                    high prices for purposes of ostentation. Of the rhinoceros, four distinct
                    varieties are enumerated, two with a single and two with a double horn. The most
                    familiar is the <hi rend="italic">Rhinoceros unicornis,</hi> commonly found in
                    the Brahmaputra valley and in the Sundarbans. It has but one horn, and is
                    covered with massive folds of naked skin. It sometimes attains a height of 6
                    feet; its horn, which is much prized by the natives for medicinal purposes,
                    seldom exceeds 14 inches in length. It frequents swampy, shady spots, and
                    wallows in mud like a pig. The inveterate antipathy of the rhinoceros to the
                    elephant seems to be mythical. The Javan rhinoceros (J?, <hi rend="italic"
                    >sondaicus)</hi> is found in the same localities. It also has but one horn, and
                    mainly differs from the foregoing in being smaller, and having less prominent
                    “shields.” The Sumatran rhinoceros <hi rend="italic">(R. sumatrensis)</hi> is
                    found from Chittagong southwards through Burmah. It has two horns and a bristly
                    coat. The hairy-eared rhinoceros <hi rend="italic">(R. lasiotis)</hi> is only
                    known from a specimen captured at Chittagong.</p>
                <p>The wild hog <hi rend="italic">(Sus</hi><hi rend="italic">scrofa,</hi> var. <hi
                    rend="italic">indica)</hi> is well known as affording the most exciting sport in
                    the world—“pigsticking.” It frequents cultivated situations, and is the most
                    mischievous enemy of the villager. A rare animal, called the pigmy hog <hi
                    rend="italic">(Porculia salviania),</hi> exists in the <hi rend="italic"
                    >tardi</hi> of Nepâl and Sikkim, and has been shot in Assam. Its height is only
                    10 inches, and its weight does not exceed 12 lb.</p>
                <p>The wild ass (Λsιzms <hi rend="italic">onager)</hi> is confined to the sandy
                    deserts of Sind and Kachhch (Cutch), where, from its speed and timidity, it is
                    almost unapproachable.</p>
                <p>Many wild species of the sheep and goat tribe are to be found in the Himâlayan
                    ranges. The <hi rend="italic">Ovis ammon</hi> and <hi rend="italic">O. poli</hi>
                    are Tibetan rather than Indian species. The <hi rend="italic">urial</hi> and the
                    <hi rend="italic">shapu</hi> are kindred species of wild sheep, found
                    respectively in Ladâkh and the Sulâimân range. The former comes down to 2000
                    feet above the sea, the latter is never seen at altitudes lower than 12,000
                    feet. The <hi rend="italic">barhal,</hi> or blue wild sheep, and the <hi
                    rend="italic">markhur</hi> and <hi rend="italic">tahr</hi> (both wild goats)
                    also inhabit the Himâlayas. A variety of the ibex is also found there, as well
                    as in the highest ranges of southern India. The <hi rend="italic">sarau</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">(Nemorhaedus</hi><hi rend="italic">rubida),</hi> allied to the
                    chamois, has a wide range in the mountains of the north, from the Himâlayas to
                    Assam and Burmah.</p>
                <p>The antelope tribe is represented by comparatively few species, as compared with
                    the great number peculiar to Africa. The antelope proper <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Antilope</hi><hi rend="italic">bezoartica),</hi> the “black buck” of
                    sportsmen, is very generally distributed. Its special habitat is salt plains, as
                    on the coast-line of Guzerat and Orissa, where herds of fifty does may be seen,
                    accompanied by a single buck. The doe is of a light fawn colour, and has no
                    horns. The colour of the buck is a deep brown-black above, sharply marked off
                    from the white of the belly. His spiral horns, twisted for three or four turns
                    like a corkscrew, often reach the length of 30 inches. The flesh is dry and
                    unsavoury, but is permitted meat for Hindus, even of the Brâhman caste. The <hi
                    rend="italic">nilgai</hi> or blue cow <hi rend="italic">(Portax</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">picta)</hi> is also widely distributed, but specially abounds in
                    Hindustan Proper and Guzerat. As with the antelope, the male alone has the dark
                    blue colour. The <hi rend="italic">nilgai</hi> is held peculiarly sacred by
                    Hindus, from its fancied kinship to the cow, and on this account its destructive
                    inroads upon the crops are tolerated. The four-horned antelope <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Tetraceros quadricornis)</hi> and the gazelle <hi rend="italic">(Gazella
                    bennetti)</hi> are also found in India. The <hi rend="italic">chiru (Pantholops
                    hodgsoni)</hi> is confined to the Himâlayan plateaus.</p>
                <p>The king of the deer tribe is the <hi rend="italic">sdmbhar</hi> or <hi
                    rend="italic">gerau</hi><hi rend="italic">(Rusa</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >amstotelis),</hi> erroneously called “elk” by sportsmen. It is found on the
                    forest-clad hills in all parts of the country. It is of a deep-brown colour,
                    with hair on its neck almost like a mane; and it stands nearly <hi rend="italic"
                    >5</hi> feet high, with spreading antlers nearly 3 feet in length. Next in size
                    is the swamp deer or <hi rend="italic">bara-singha,</hi> signifying “twelve
                    points” <hi rend="italic">(Rucervus duvaucelli),</hi> which is common in Lower
                    Bengal, and Assam. The <hi rend="italic">chitdl</hi> or spotted deer <hi
                    rend="italic">(Axis</hi><hi rend="italic">maculata)</hi> is generally admitted
                    to be the most beautiful inhabitant of the Indian jungles. Other species include
                    the hog deer <hi rend="italic">(Cervus porcinus),</hi> the barking deer or
                    muntjac <hi rend="italic">(Cervulus</hi><hi rend="italic">vaginalis),</hi> and

                    The musk deer <hi rend="italic">(Moschus</hi><hi rend="italic">moschiferus)</hi>
                    is confined to Tibet.</p>
                <p>The ox tribe is represented in India by some of its 1 noblest species. The <hi
                    rend="italic">gaur (Bibos gau/rus),</hi> the “bison” of sportsmen, is found in
                    all the hill jungles of the country, in the Western Ghâts, in Central India, in
                    Assam, and in British Burmah. This animal sometimes attains the height of 20
                    hands (close on 7 feet), measuring from the hump above the shoulder. Its short
                    curved horns and skull are enormously massive. Its colour is dark chestnut, or
                    coffeebrown. From the difficult nature of its habitat, and from the ferocity
                    with which it charges an enemy, the pursuit of the bison is no less dangerous
                    and no less exciting than that of the tiger or the elephant. Akin to the <hi
                    rend="italic">gaur,</hi> though not identical, are the <hi rend="italic"
                    >gaydl</hi> or <hi rend="italic">mithan (B. frontalis),</hi> confined to the
                    hills of the north-east frontier, where it is domesticated for sacrificial
                    purposes by the aboriginal tribes, and the <hi rend="italic">tsine</hi> or <hi
                    rend="italic">banting (B. soηdaicus),</hi> found in Burmah. The wild buffalo <hi
                    rend="italic">(Bubal·us arni)</hi> differs from the tame 1 buffalo only in being
                    larger and more fierce. The finest specimens come from Assam and Burmah. The
                    horns of the bull are thicker than those of the cow, but the horns of the cow
                    are larger. A head has been known to measure 13 feet 6 inches in circumference,
                    and 6 feet 6 inches <pb break="no"

                    The colour is a slaty black; the hide is immensely thick, with scanty hairs.
                    Alone perhaps of all wild animals in India, the buffalo will charge unprovoked.
                    Even tame buffaloes seem to have an inveterate dislike to Europeans.</p>
                <p>The rat and mouse family is only too numerous. Conspicuous in it is the loathsome
                    bandicoot <hi rend="italic">(Hus bandicota),</hi> which sometimes measures 2
                    feet in length, including its tail, and weighs 3 lb. It burrows under houses,
                    and is very destructive to plants, fruit, and even poultry. More interesting is
                    the tree rat <hi rend="italic">(H.</hi><hi rend="italic">arboreus),</hi> a
                    native of Bengal, about 7 inches long, which makes its nest in cocoa-nut palms
                    and bamboos. The voles or field mice (genus <hi rend="italic">Arvicola)</hi>
                    occasionally multiply so exceedingly as to diminish the out-turn of the local
                    harvest, and to require special measures to be organized for their
                    suppression.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Birds.—</hi> The ornithology of India, though it is not
                    considered so rich in specimens of gorgeous and variegated plumage as that of
                    other tropical regions, contains many splendid and curious varieties. Some are
                    clothed in nature’s gay attire, others distinguished by strength, size, and
                    fierceness. The parrot tribe is the most remarkable for beauty. So various are
                    the species that we cannot even enumerate them, and must refer for details to

                    Itinerant showmen carry about these serpents, and cause them to assume a dancing
                    motion for the amusement of the spectators. They also give out that they render
                    snakes harmless by the use of charms or music,—in reality it is by extracting
                    the venomous fangs. But, judging from the frequent accidents which occur, they
                    sometimes dispense with this precaution. All the salt-water snakes in India are
                    poisonous, while the freshwater forms are wholly innocuous. Sir J. Fayrer has
                    demonstrated that there is no cure for the bite of the cobra, if the snake is
                    full-grown, and if its poison fang is full and is not interfered with by
                    clothing. The most hopeful remedy in all cases of snake bite is the injection of
                    ammonia. The loss of life from this cause in India is painful to contemplate,
                    nor does any means of diminishing the evil seem feasible. It is impossible to
                    exterminate poisonous snakes altogether, even in England. In India the
                    impossibility is yet more evident, from the greater number of the snakes, the
                    character of the country, and the scruples of the people. Something, however, is
                    being effected by the offer of rewards. In 1877 a total of 16,777 persons are
                    reported to have been killed by snakes, as compared with only 819 by tigers. In
                    the same year, rewards to the amount of £811 were given for the destruction of
                    127,295 snakes.</p>

                    irrigation dams to breeding fish, are said to be causing a sensible diminution
                    in the supply in certain rivers. Measures of conservancy have been suggested,
                    but their execution would be almost impracticable. Among Indian fishes, the <hi
                    rend="italic">Cyprinidoe</hi> or carp family and the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Siluridoe</hi> or cat-fishes are best represented. From the angler’s point of
                    view, by far the finest fish is the <hi rend="italic">mahsir,</hi> found in all
                    hill streams, whether in Assam, the Punjab, or the South. One has been caught
                    weighing 60 fib, which gave play for more than seven hours. Though called the
                    salmon of India, the <hi rend="italic">rnahsir</hi> is really a species of
                    barbel. The most recent authority on Indian fishes and their economic aspects is
                    Dr Francis Day.</p>
                <p>In this connexion may be mentioned the <hi rend="italic">susu</hi> or Gangetic
                    dolphin <hi rend="italic">(Platanista gangetica),</hi> which is often
                    erroneously called a porpoise. Both the structure and habits of this animal are
                    very singular. It measures from 6 to 12 feet in length, and in colour is
                    sooty-black. Its head is globular, with a long, narrow, spoon-shaped snout. Its
                    eyes are rudimentary, like those of the mole; and its ear-orifices are no bigger
                    than pin-holes. Its dentition, also, is altogether abnormal. It frequents the
                    Ganges and Indus from their mouths right up to their tributaries within the
                    hills. A specimen has been taken at least 1000 miles above Calcutta. Ordinarily
                    its movements are slow, for it wallows in the muddy bed of the river, and but
                    rarely comes to the surface to blow. The <hi rend="italic">susu</hi> belongs to
                    the order <hi rend="italic">Cetacea;</hi> and inquiries have recently been
                    directed to the point whether its blubber might not be utilized in commerce.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Insects.—</hi> The insect tribes in India may be truly said to
                    be innumerable; nor has anything like a complete classification been given of

                <p>The heat and the rains give incredible activity to noxious or troublesome
                    insects, and to others of a more showy class, whose large wings surpass in
                    brilliancy the most splendid colours of art. Stinging musquitoes are
                    innumerable, and moths and ants of the most destructive kind, as well as others
                    equally noxious and disagreeable. Amongst those which are useful are the bee,
                    the silk-worm, and the insect that produces lac. - Clouds of locusts
                    occasionally appear, which leave no trace of green behind them, and give the
                    country over which they pass the appearance of a desert. Dr Buchanan saw a mass
                    of these insects in his journey from Madras to the Mysore territory, about 3
                    miles in length, like a long narrow red cloud near the horizon, and making a
                    noise somewhat resembling that of a cataract. Their size was about that of a
                    man’s finger, and their colour reddish. They are swept north by the wind till
                    they strike upon the outer ranges of the Himalayas, <hi rend="smallcaps">The

                <p>The population of India, with. British Burmah, amounts to 240 millions, or, as
                    already mentioned, exactly double the number which Gibbon estimated for the
                    Roman empire in the height of its power. But the English Government, like the
                    Roman, has respected the rights of native chiefs who are willing to govern
                    peaceably and well, and one-third of the country still remains in the hands of
                    hereditary rulers. Their subjects (including Mysore) make up 54 millions, or
                    over one-fifth of the whole Indian people. The British territories (including
                    Mysore, temporarily under British administration), therefore comprise only
                    two-thirds of the area of India, and less than four-fifths, or 191 millions, of
                    its inhabitants.</p>
                <p>For the first time in the history of India an attempt was made in the· years
                    1871-72 to ascertain the population of the country by actual counting. The
                    results obtained on that occasion, though in certain points they leave much to
                    be desired, may be accepted generally as a tolerable approximation to the truth.
                    Prior to this census, occasional enumerations had been made, with varying
                    degrees of accuracy, in some of the provinces; while in others mere conjectural
                    estimates had been allowed to pass uncriticized. In Bengal, for example, where
                    statistical inquiry was in a backward state, the Government had year by year
                    accepted a loose estimate of 42 millions for the population under its control,
                    and based upon this all its calculations for legislation and finance. The census
                    of 1872 disclosed a total of nearly 67 millions for Bengal and Assam, being an
                    increase upon the estimate of more than one-half. In Berar, or the Assigned
                    Districts of Hyderabad, a census had been taken in 1867, in the Punjab in 1868,
                    and in Oudh in 1869. In these provinces, therefore, it was considered impolitic
                    to trouble the people by a fresh enumeration. Throughout all the rest of India
                    under British administration, including the native state of Mysore, a general
                    census was effected on uniform principles, which may be said to have begun in
                    November 1871 and ended in August 1872. So far as possible, the work was done in
                    a single night; but in certain remote and uncivilized tracts it was of necessity
                    prolonged over several months. Considering the absolute novelty of the
                    undertaking, at least in some provinces, and the scanty means at the disposal of
                    the authorities, the general accuracy of the results may be regarded with not a
                    little satisfaction. Subsequent local investigations tend to show that the
                    numbers were under rather than overstated. In a few cases paid enumerators were
                    engaged; but generally the Work was left to the ordinary staff of each district,
                    assisted by the police, the landlords, and their agents. The total expenditure
                    throughout all British India was only £82,203, being at the rate of less than
                    half a farthing per head. The suspicions of the ignorant villagers were
                    naturally aroused by the counting, which they imagined to be preliminary to some
                    fresh exaction by the Sarkâr or Government. Only in two or three cases was any
                    real opposition offered; and there is little reason to believe thatany material
                    evasion was accomplished.</p>
                <p>The total population of British India was ascertained to amount to 191,096,603
                    persons, on an area of 898,381 square miles, being an average of 212 persons per
                    square mile. Deducting the frontier province of Assam and British Burmah beyond
                    the sea, the average is 243 persons per square mile. The population of the
                    several native states is returned, partly from actual énumération and partly
                    from mere guessing, at 49,155,746 persons, on an area of 575,265 square miles,
                    being an average of 85 persons to the square mile. The French possessions have
                    an area of 178 square miles and a population of 271,460 persons; the Portuguese
                    possessions, 1086 square miles and 407,712 persons. The aggregate figures for
                    all India, therefore, are 1,474,910 square miles and 240,931,521 persons, or an
                    average of 163 persons per square mile.</p>

                <p>According to the report of the registrar-general upon the English census of 1871,
                    “any density of a large country approaching 200 to a square mile implies mines,
                    manufactures, or the industry of cities.” But in India a density of thrice this
                    limit, or 600 to the square mile, is often attained throughout large districts
                    which are entirely dependent upon agriculture. Sâran, for example, in North
                    Behar, with an area of 2654 square miles and no town exceeding 50,000
                    inhabitants, has an average density of 778 to the square mile, with a maximum of
                    984 in the purely agricultural <hi rend="italic">thana</hi> or police circle of
                    Mashrak. Taking the valley of the Ganges as a whole, from Sahâranpur down to
                    Calcutta, the average density is about 500 to the square mile, or nearly double
                    that of the United Kingdom.</p>
                <p>This high density is obtained without the presence of many large towns or centres
                    of manufacturing life. Of the total number of 493,444 towns and villages in
                    British India, only 44 are returned as having more than 50,000 inhabitants, 374
                    as having from 10,000 to 50,000, and 1070 as having from 5000 to 10,000. The 44
                    towns with more than 50,000 inhabitants have an aggregate urban population of a
                    little more than 5⅜ millions, or less than 3 per cent, of the total population
                    of British India; whereas the 34 towns in England and Wales exceeding the same
                    limit have an aggregate urban population of nearly 7⅜ millions, or 32 per cent,
                    of the total. Taking a lower limit, there are 139 towns in British India with
                    more than 20,000 inhabitants, having an aggregate of 8,484,066, or less than 4 J
                    per cent, of the total.</p>

                <p>The total number of inhabited houses enumerated in British India is 37,041,259.
                    The average number of houses per square mile is 41, ranging from 102 in Oudn to
                    6 in British Burmah. The average number of persons per house is 5'15, being
                    pretty uniform throughout. Contrary to the experience of the United Kingdom it
                    is found that the number of inmates to each house is lower in the towns than in
                    the country, the reason assigned being that the shopkeepers do not bring their
                    families into the towns with them. The houses are grouped into a total of
                    493,444 villages or townships, giving an average of 75 houses and 386 persons to
                    each. The average area of each village or township is ’ 55 of a square mile. The
                    villages seem to be largest in Bombay, with 614 inhabitants each, and smallest
                    in British Burmah, with 195 inhabitants.</p>
                <p>Out of the total of 191,096,603 persons in British India, 98,055,381 are returned
                    as males and 92,580,886 as females, leaving 460,336 of whom the sex was
                    unspecified. The proportion of males to females is thus as 100 to 94. In England
                    the females outnumber the males in the proportion of 105 to 100, an excess
                    attributed mainly to emigration. In India, whence there is practically no
                    emigration, it might be expected that this excess of females would disappear,
                    and the two sexes be found on an equality. In the two great provinces of Bengal
                    and Madras this is practically the case, the excess of females being not greater
                    than 1 per cent., and the proportion being maintained uniformly throughout the
                    districts. But in Oudh the excess of males is 7 per cent., in Bombay 8 per
                    cent., in the North-Western Provinces 12 per cent., and in the Punjab as high as
                    16 per cent. We have no reason to suppose that the approximate equality of boys
                    and girls does not hold good in the births throughout India, as in other
                    countries; and therefore this great excess of males can only be assigned to two
                    causes—(1) defective registration of females, especially of girls, and (2)
                    female infanticide formerly, and carelessness of infant female life at the
                    present day. Of the existence of these causes we possess independent testimony.
                    In 1870 an act of the legislature was passed applying special regulations to
                    villages or tracts suspected of infanticide, which is the besetting sin of
                    certain high caste tribes of Rajputs. In one tribe of Meerut district only 8
                    girls under 12 were found to 80 boys. The act is put in force wherever there are
                    less than 54 girls to 100 boys, but the exact limit is at the discretion of
                    Government. The crime is now almost stamped out.</p>
                <p>The returns according to age throw some light upon this question. Children under
                    12 number altogether 66,969,764, and adults above 12 number 123,200,022, leaving
                    926,817 unspecified. The proportion of children to adults is, therefore, as 54
                    to 100, the corresponding proportion in England being 41 to 100. The highest
                    proportion of children (62 to 100) is found in the Central Provinces, where the
                    aboriginal tribes are strongest; and the lowest proportion (50 to 100) in the
                    North-Western Provinces. An examination of the Bengal returns, district by
                    district, also leads to the conclusion that the aboriginal tribes are more
                    prolific than the Hindus proper. Subdividing these returns according to sex, we
                    discover an extraordinary disparity. Of the adults, 62,022,461 are males and
                    61,197,561 are females. The proportion of male adults to females is, therefore,
                    about 100 to 99, as compared with 100 males to 94 females in the general
                    population. But on turning to the children under 12, we findas many as
                    35,787,564 boys to only 31,182,200 girls, or 100 boys to only 87 girls. This
                    arises from the defective registration of girls, females under 12 being often
                    returned as women.</p>
                <p>The following table shows the population of British India as roughly subdivided
                    according to religion. Broadly speaking, it may be said that at least nineteen
                    out of every twenty people in India are either Hindus or Mahometans, and that
                    there are seven of the former to two of the latter.</p>

                <p>The schedules of the census fail entirely to give a satisfactory classification
                    of the races among which the vast population of India is divided. Using language
                    as our criterion, the people might perhaps be arranged in five classes :—(1) The
                    old races of the south, known as the Dravidian stock, which includes, not only
                    the great peoples using the literary languages of Tamil, Telugu, Malayâlam, and
                    Kanarese, but also scattered tribes speaking dialects of the same family, who
                    are found as far north as the hills of Chutià Nâgpur; (2) the hill tribes of
                    Central India, from the Bhils of Bombay to the Santâls of Bengal, whose physical
                    characteristics are negroid, and whose family of languages has received the name
                    of Kolarian; (3) the tribes of Indo-Chinese origin, who inhabit the southern
                    slopes of the Himalayas, the greater part of the Assam valley, and the whole of
                    Burmah;—it seems probable that the semi-Hinduized low castes of Northern Bengal
                    also belong to this stock; (4) high-caste Hindus, or that offshoot of the august
                    Aryan race which has imposed its language, its religion, and its name upon the
                    greater part of the country; (5) successive waves of Mahometan conquerors, Arab,
                    Afghân, Mughal, and Persian, who form in the aggregate but an infinitesimal
                    element in the general population. Whether pure Aryans are now to be traced in
                    any other class than that of the Brâhmans <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0912-0769-0746"/> may perhaps be disputed. Even the so-called
                    Ràjputs have probably a considerable admixture of Scythic blood. The Vaisya or
                    third caste of Manu’s system is admitted to be almost extinct, while his Sιidras
                    are to be found in the pre-existing non-Aryan population.</p>

                <p>Among Mahometans, who number in all 40,227,552, four classes are commonly
                    distinguished. <hi rend="italic">Mughals.,</hi> or the descendants of the last
                    conquering race, number only 219,755, of whom nearly half are to be found in the
                    Punjab. <hi rend="italic">Afghdns</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Pathdns</hi> on the
                    other hand, from their proximity to the frontier, are much more strongly
                    represented, numbering 1,841,693 in all, chiefly in the Punjab and in the
                    Rohilkhand division of the North-West. <hi rend="italic">Sayyids,</hi> who claim
                    to be lineally descended from the prophet, number 790,984; and <hi rend="italic"
                    >Shaikhs,</hi> 4,700,320. The remainder are unspecified, but the following
                    tribes or classes among Indian Musalmàns are worthy of notice. In Bengal the
                    vast majority of the Mahometans manifestly belong to the same race as the lowest
                    castes of Hindus. They are themselves subdivided into many classes, which in
                    their devotion to hereditary occupations are scarcely to be distinguished from
                    Hindu castes. Of late years a reforming spirit has arisen, leading them to
                    abandon the polytheistic customs and festivals which they shared with their
                    Hindu fellow-villagers. In the Punjab, besides the Pathân immigrants from across
                    the frontier, Islam has taken a strong hold of the native population. The census
                    returned upwards of 1,300,000 Jâts, 700,000 Ràjputs, and 424,000 Gujars among
                    the Musalmàns. Here, again, the Mahometans are not strongly distinguished from
                    their Hindu brethren. Baluchis from beyond the frontier number 235,000 in the
                    Punjab, and 145,000 in Sind. Bombay possesses three peculiar classes of
                    Musalmàns, each of which is specially devoted to maritime trade,—the <hi
                    rend="italic">Memons,</hi> numbering 49,000, chiefly in Sind; the <hi
                    rend="italic">Borahs,</hi> 86,000, mainly in Guzerat; the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Khojahs,</hi> nearly 18,000, of whom half live in the island of Bombay. In
                    southern India the majority are known as Dakhani Musalmàns, being descendants of
                    the armies led by the kings and nawàbs of the Deccan. But the two peculiar races
                    of the south are the <hi rend="italic">Moplas</hi> (613,000) and the <hi
                    rend="italic">Labbays</hi> (312,000), both of which are seated along the coast
                    and follow a seafaring life. They are descended from the Arab traders who
                    settled there in very early times, and have been recruited partly by voluntary
                    adhesions and partly by forcible conversions during the persecutions of Hyder
                    All and Tipù Sultân. The Moplas of Malabar are notorious for repeated outbreaks
                    of bloody fanaticism.</p>
                <p>The Mahometans are most numerous, as might be expected, along the valley of the
                    Indus, from Karàchi (Kurrachee) to Peshàwar. In the Bombay province of Sind they
                    number 78 per cent, of the total population. In the Punjab generally the
                    proportion is 53 per cent., rising to 93 per cent, in the frontier district of
                    Peshàwar. In the North-Western Provinces and also in Oudh the proportion of
                    Mahometans nowhere exceeds 23 per cent., though that part of the country was the
                    seat of successive Musalmân empires for many centuries. In Lower Bengal, on the
                    other hand, the faith of Islam has exercised a more permanent effect upon the
                    population, especially in the valley of the Brahmaputra. The average of
                    Mahometans in the whole province is 33 per cent., rising to 80 per cent, in the
                    deltaic districts of Bogrà and Râjshâbi. Here, again, it is found that the
                    Mahometans are not most numerous in the neighbourhood of the great Musalmân
                    capitals, Gaur, Râjmahàl, Dacca, and Murshidàbâd, but in the densely populated
                    agricultural tracts, where the semi-aboriginal tribes appear to have willingly
                    embraced Islam in preference to remaining outcasts beyond the exclusive pale of
                    Hinduism.</p>
                <p>The Sikhs are almost entirely confined to the Punjab, where they number only 6'50
                    per cent, of the population. Their stronghold is the country between the rivers
                    Râvi and Sutlej (Satlaj), including the historical cities of Lahore, Amritsar,
                    Ambàla (Umballa), and Jalandhar. In no district do they form more than 17 per
                    cent.</p>
                <p>Of the total number of 897,682 Christians, about 250,000 are believed to be
                    Europeans or to have European blood in their veins. The south of India is the
                    only part where the exertions of the missionaries can be said to be visible in
                    the statistics of population. In the Madras presidency generally, Christians
                    number 533,760, or 1 <hi rend="superscript"> -</hi> 71 per cent, of the total.
                    Of these, about 416,000 are returned as Roman Catholics, and about 118,000 as
                    Protestants. Nearly one-fifth of all the Christians are found in the single
                    district of Tinnevelli, and they are numerically next strongest in Madura,
                    Tanjore, Trichinopoli, South Kànara, and Malabar. Christianity has been known in
                    southern India for many centuries. A Pehlevi inscription in the ancient church
                    of the St Thomas’ Mount near Madras city indicates a settlement of Manichaeans
                    or Persian Christians on the eastern coast, as well as on the west; and
                    tradition speaks of the preaching of the apostle St Thomas in Madras,
                    Tinnevelli, and Malabar. The adherents of the Syrian church in Malabar,
                    Travancore, and Cochin are the most ancient Christian community in the south.
                    After these come the Roman Catholics, who trace their origin to the teaching of
                    St Xavier and the Madura Jesuits. The Protestant churches date only from about
                    the beginning of the present century, but their progress since that time has
                    been considerable. In Bombay there are 126,063 Christians, of whom nearly
                    83,000, chiefly Indo-Portuguese, are returned as Roman Catholics. In Bengal the
                    Christians number only 90,763, but since the date of the census missionary
                    effort has been very successful among the hill tribes of Chutiâ Nàgpur. In the
                    North-Western Provinces there are 22,196 Christians, in the Punjab 22,154, in
                    the Central Provinces 10,477, in Mysore 25,676, in Coorg 2410, and the remainder
                    are scattered over Assam, Berar, and Ajmir. In British Burmah the Christians are
                    proportionately more numerous than in any other province, amounting to 52,299,
                    or 1 ’ 90 per cent., chiefly converts from the hill tribe of Karens. It should
                    be remembered that the above figures are exclusive of the native states, in
                    which the Christians amount to about 700,000, making a total in round numbers of
                    1J millions for all India.</p>
                <p>An attempt was made at the time of the census to ascertain the professions and
                    occupations of the male adults, but the results cannot be accepted as even
                    approximately accurate. The totals, <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit12newyrich/page/n770/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0912-0770-0747"/> however, are here given for what they may be
                    worth. Out of a classified total of about 62,000,000 adult males, 2,232,000, or
                    3 <hi rend="superscript"> -</hi> 6 per cent., were returned as professional or
                    in Government service; 3,844,000, or 6 <hi rend="superscript"> -</hi> 2 per
                    cent., as in domestic service; 34,844,000, or 56 <hi rend="italic">2</hi> per
                    cent., as agricultural; 3,224,000, or 5'2 per cent., as commercial; 8,122,000,
                    or 13’1 per cent., as industrial; 7,626,000, or 12'3 per cent., as labourers;
                    and 2,108,000, or 3 <hi rend="superscript"> ,</hi> 4 per cent., as independent
                    and non-productive.</p>
                <p>An attempt was also made to collect statistics of persons afflicted with certain
                    specific infirmities, but here again the results possess little value. The
                    number of insane persons and idiots was returned at 67,000, or 1 in 2700 of the
                    population, being less than ∣th of the rate prevailing in England. The deaf and
                    dumb numbered 134,000, or 1 in 1340, a proportion about half as great again as
                    in England; the blind numbered 354,000, or rather less than 1 in 500, which is
                    double the English rate; the lepers numbered 96,000, or 1 in 1875.</p>
                <p>Returns of both births and deaths are now regularly collected over almost the
                    entire area under British administration. In towns the returns are furnished
                    through the municipalities, while in the rural tracts the agency employed is the
                    police. The figures thus obtained are for the most part so evidently inadequate
                    that it would only be misleading to reproduce them in this place. Suffice it to
                    say that the sanitary commissioner accepts as approximately correct a
                    calculation which estimates the average duration of life in India at thirty
                    years and eight months, which is equivalent to an annual death-rate of 32 <hi
                    rend="superscript"> -</hi> 57 per thousand. During 1877, the year of famine, the
                    ascertained death-rate in Madras rose to 53 <hi rend="superscript"> -</hi> 2,
                    while the ascertained birth-rate fell to 16 ’ 3 per thousand. Both these rates
                    are, of course, mere approximations to the truth, but they serve to indicate how
                    famine attacks a people from two sides. In 1877 the death-rate among European
                    troops in India was 12'71 per thousand, being the lowest ever recorded; among
                    native troops, 13’38 per thousand; and in the public jails, 61'95 per thousand,
                    rising to 176Ό1 per thousand in the jails of Madras.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Agriculture.</hi></p>
                <p>The cultivation of the soil is the occupation of the Indian people, in a sense
                    which is difficult to realize in England, and which cannot be adequately
                    expressed by figures. As the land tax forms the mainstay of the imperial
                    revenue, so the <hi rend="italic">rdyat</hi> or cultivator constitutes the unit
                    of the social system. The organized village community contains many other
                    members besides the cultivators, but they all exist for his benefit, and all
                    alike are directly maintained from the produce of the village fields. Even in
                    considerable towns, the traders and handicraftsmen almost always possess plots
                    of land of their own, on which they raise sufficient grain to supply their
                    families with food. The operations of rural life are familiar to every class.
                    They are enveloped in a cloud of religious sanctions, and serve to mark out by
                    their recurring periods the annual round of common life. According to the
                    returns of the general census of 1872, the number of adult males engaged in
                    agriculture amounts to nearly 35 millions, or 56 ’ 2 per cent, of the total. To
                    these ought to be added almost all the labourers, an additional 7⅛ millions, or
                    12 ’ 3 per cent.,— thus raising the grand total of persons directly supported by
                    the land to more than two-thirds of the entire number of adult males, besides
                    those indirectly or incidentally connected with it.</p>
                <p>But though agriculture thus forms the staple industry of the country, its
                    practice is pursued in different provinces with infinite variety of detail.
                    Everywhere the same perpetual assiduity is found, but the inherited experience
                    of generations has taught the cultivators to adapt their simple methods to
                    differing circumstances. For irrigation, native patience and ingenuity have
                    devised means which compare favourably with the colossal projects of Government.
                    Manure is copiously applied to the more valuable crops whenever manure is
                    available, its use being limited by poverty and not by ignorance. The rotation
                    of crops is not adopted as a principle of cultivation; but in practice it is
                    well known that a succession of exhausting crops cannot be taken in consecutive
                    seasons from the same field, and the advantage of fallows is widely recognized.
                    The periodicity of the seasons usually allows two, and sometimes three, harvests
                    in the year, but not necessarily, nor indeed usually, on the same fields. For
                    inexhaustible fertility, and for retentiveness of moisture in a dry year, no
                    soil in the world can surpass the <hi rend="italic">regar</hi> or “black
                    cotton-soil” of the Deccan. In the broad river basins, the inundations deposit
                    annually a fresh top-dressing of silt, thus superseding the necessity of
                    manures.</p>
                <p>The name of rice has from time immemorial been so closely associated with Indian
                    agriculture, that it is difficult to realize how comparatively small an area is
                    planted with this crop. If we except the deltas of the great rivers and the long
                    strip of land fringing the western coast, rice may be called an occasional crop
                    throughout the remainder of the peninsula. But where rice is grown, it is grown
                    to the exclusion of all other crops. In British Burmah, out of a total
                    cultivated area of 2,833,520 acres in 1877-78, as many as 2,554,853 acres, or 90
                    per cent., were under rice. Independent Burmah, on the other hand, grows no
                    rice, but imports largely from British territory. For Bengal, unfortunately, no
                    general statistics are available. But taking Rangpur as a typical district, it
                    was there found that 1∣ million acres, out of a classified total of a little
                    over 1∣ million acres, or 88 per cent., were devoted to rice. Similar
                    proportions hold good for the province of Orissa, the deltas of the Godâvari,
                    Kistna, and Kâveri (Cauvery), and the lowlands of Travancore, Malabar, Kanara,
                    and the Concan. For the North-Western Provinces and Oudh, again, no agricultural
                    statistics are available; but though rice, grown in damp localities, or with the
                    help of irrigation, forms a favourite food for the upper classes, the local
                    supply requires to be supplemented by importation from Bengal. Throughout the
                    remainder of the country, except in Assam, which is agriculturally a
                    continuation of the Bengal delta, the cultivation of rice occupies but a
                    subordinate place. The average out-turn per acre in Bengal has been estimated at
                    15 <hi rend="italic">maunds,</hi> or 1200 lb, of cleaned rice. In the years
                    1877-78, when famine was raging in southern India, the total exports of rice
                    from Calcutta amounted to more than 16 million cwts. In British Burmah there is
                    but a single rice harvest in the year, corresponding to the <hi rend="italic"
                    >drnaη</hi> of Bengal. The grain is reddish in colour and of a coarse quality;
                    but the out-turn is much higher than in Bengal, reaching in some places an
                    average of 2000 and 2500 lb per acre. The annual exports of rice from Burmah
                    amount to about 12 million cwts. Besides being practically the sole crop grown
                    in the deltaic swamps, rice is raised in patches in all the hill-valleys, from
                    Coorg to the Himalayas.</p>
                <p>Wheat is grown to some extent in almost every district; but, broadly speaking, it
                    may be said that wheat does not thrive where rice does, nor, indeed, anywhere
                    south of the Deccan. The great wheat-growing tract of India is the Punjab,
                    where, in 1877-78, nearly 7 million acres, or 37 per cent, of the total
                    cultivated area, were under this crop. For the North-Western Provinces and Oudh,
                    in default of actual statistics, it has been estimated that the total area under
                    wheat is as large as in the Punjab, though the relative proportion is less.
                    Wheat is also grown in Behar and in the districts of Bengal that lie south of
                    the Ganges. In the Central Provinces, in 1877-78, wheat was grown on 23 per
                    cent, of the cultivated area, being the chief crop in the districts of
                    Hoshangàbâd, Narsinhpur, and Siigar. In Bombay the corresponding proportion was
                    less than 5 per cent., and in Sind 12 per cent. It has been conjectured that the
                    total area under wheat in India is equal to the area under the same crop in the
                    United States. Nor is the general out-turn contemptible, averaging about 13
                    bushels per acre in the Punjab, as compared with an average of 15⅜ bushels for
                    the whole of France. The quality, also, of the grain is high enough to satisfy
                    the demands of English millers; and “Calcutta Club No. 1” commands a price in
                    Mark Lane not much below that of the <pb break="no"

                    Unfortunately, when a prosperous trade with Europe seemed on the point of
                    establishing itself, the terrible year 1877-78 supervened, and India will now
                    have to fight against the position of vantage occupied by the United States.
                    According to the system of classification in Upper India, wheat ranks as a <hi
                    rend="italic">rabi</hi> or spring crop, being reaped at the close of the cold
                    weather in April and May. Wherever possible, it is irrigated; and the extension
                    of canals through the Gangetic Doab has largely contributed to the substitution
                    of wheat for inferior cereals.</p>
                <p>Taking India as a whole, it may be affirmed that the staple food grain is neither
                    rice nor wheat, but millet, which is probably the most prolific grain in the
                    world, and the best adapted to the vicissitudes of a tropical climate. Excluding
                    the special rice-growing tracts, varieties of millet are grown more extensively
                    than any other crop from Madras, in the south, at least as far as Râjputâna, in
                    the north. The two most common kinds are great millet <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Holcus</hi><hi rend="italic">Sorghum</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Sorghum</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">vulgare),</hi> known as <hi rend="italic">joar</hi> or <hi
                    rend="italic">jaινdri</hi> in the languages derived from the Sanskrit, as <hi
                    rend="italic">jοnna</hi> in Telugu, and as <hi rend="italic">clιolam</hi> in
                    Tamil; and spiked millet <hi rend="italic">(Holcus spicatus</hi> vel <hi
                    rend="italic">Penicillaria spicata),</hi> called <hi rend="italic">bajra</hi> in
                    the north and <hi rend="italic">kambu</hi> in the south. In Mysore and the
                    neighbouring districts <hi rend="italic">rdgi (Pleusine coracand),</hi> called
                    <hi rend="italic">ηdchani</hi> in Bombay, takes the first place. According to
                    the Madras system of classification, these millets all rank as “dry crops,”
                    being watered only by the local rainfall, and sown under either monsoon; farther
                    north, they are classed with the <hi rend="italic">kharif</hi> or autumn
                    harvest, as opposed to wheat. Indian corn is cultivated to a limited extent in
                    all parts of the country; barley, in the upper valley of the Ganges, throughout
                    the Punjab, and in Himalayan valleys; oats, only as an experimental crop by
                    Europeans. <hi rend="italic">Joär</hi> and <hi rend="italic">ragî,</hi> but not
                    <hi rend="italic">bajra,</hi> are invaluable as fodder for cattle.</p>
                <p>Oil-seeds also form an important crop in all parts of the country, being perhaps
                    more universally grown than any other, as oil is necessary, according to native
                    customs, for application to the person, for food, and for burning in lamps. In
                    recent years the cultivation of oil-seeds has received an extraordinary stimulus
                    owing to the demand for export to Europe, especially to France; but as they can
                    be grown after rice, &amp;c., as a second crop, this increase has hardly at all
                    tended to diminish the production of food grains. The four chief varieties grown
                    are mustard or rape seed, linseed, <hi rend="italic">til</hi> or gingelly
                    (sesamum), and castor-oil. Bengal and the North-Western Provinces are at present
                    the chief sources of supply for the foreign demand, but gingelly is largely
                    exported from Madras, and, to a smaller extent, from Burmah.</p>
                <p>Vegetables are everywhere cultivated in garden plots for household use, and also
                    on a larger scale in the neighbourhood of great towns. Among favourite native
                    vegetables, the following may be mentioned :—the egg-plant, called <hi
                    rend="italic">brinjal</hi> or <hi rend="italic">baigan</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >(Solanum</hi><hi rend="italic">Melong end),</hi> potatoes, cabbages,
                    cauliflower, radishes, onions, garlic, turnips, yams, and a great variety of
                    cucurbitaceous plants, including <hi rend="italic">Cucumis sativus,
                    Cucurbita</hi><hi rend="italic">maxima, Lagenaria vulgaris, Trichos-antlies
                    di&lt;jica,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Benincasa cerifera.</hi> Of these,
                    potatoes, cabbages, and turnips are of recent introduction. Almost all English
                    vegetables can be raised by a careful gardener. Potatoes thrive best on the
                    higher elevations, such as the Khâsi hills, the Nilgiris, the Mysore uplands,
                    and the slopes of the Himâlayas; but they are also grown even in lowland
                    districts. They were first introduced into the Khâsi hills in 1830, and they now
                    constitute the principal crop, the annual export to the Calcutta market being
                    more than 7000 tons, valued at £50,000.</p>
                <p>Among cultivated fruits are the following:—Mango <hi rend="italic">(Hangifera
                    indicd),</hi> plantain <hi rend="italic">(A/usa ρaradisiacd),</hi> pine-apple
                    <hi rend="italic">(Ananassa</hi><hi rend="italic">sativa),</hi> pomegranate <hi

                    >decumana),</hi> and several varieties of fig, melon, orange, lime, and citron.
                    According to the universal verdict of Europeans, no native fruits can compare
                    with those of England. But the mangoes of Bombay, of Mùltân, and of Maldah in
                    Bengal, and the oranges of the Khâsi hills, enjoy a high reputation; while the
                    guavas of Madras are made into an excellent preserve.</p>
                <p>Among spices, for the preparation of curry and other hot dishes, turmeric and
                    chillies hold the first place, being very generally cultivated. Next in
                    importance come ginger, coriander, aniseed, black cummin, and fenugreek. Pepper
                    proper is confined to the Malabar coast, from Kanara to Travancore. Cardamoms
                    are a valuable crop in the same locality, and also in the Nepâlese Himalayas.
                    <hi rend="italic">Pan</hi> or betel-leaf is grown by a special caste in most
                    parts of the country. Its cultivation requires constant care, but is highly
                    remunerative. Betel-nut or areca is chiefly grown in certain favoured
                    localities, such as the deltaic districts of Bengal and the highlands of
                    southern India.</p>
                <p>Besides betel-nut <hi rend="italic">(Areca Catechu),</hi> the palms of India
                    include the cocoa-nut <hi rend="italic">(Cocos ηuciferd),</hi> the bastard date
                    <hi rend="italic">(Phoenix</hi><hi rend="italic">sylvestris),</hi> the palmyra
                    <hi rend="italic">(Borassus flabelliformis),</hi> and the true date <hi
                    rend="italic">(Phoenix dactyliferd).</hi> The cocoa-nut, which loves a sandy
                    soil and a moist climate, is found in greatest perfection along the strip of
                    coast-line that fringes the west of the peninsula, where it ranks next to rice
                    as the staple product. The bastard date, grown chiefly in the country round
                    Calcutta and in the northeast of the Madras presidency, supplies both the
                    jaggery sugar of commerce and intoxicating liquors for local consumption. Spirit
                    is also distilled from the palmyra, especially in the neighbourhood of Bombay
                    and in the southeast of Madras. The true date is almost confined to Sind.</p>
                <p>Sugar is manufactured both from the sugar-cane and from the bastard date-palm,
                    but the total production is inadequate to the local demand. The best cane is
                    grown in the North-Western Provinces, on irrigated land. It is an expensive
                    crop, requiring much attention, and not yielding a return within the year; but
                    the profits are proportionately large. In Bengal the manufacture of sugar for
                    exportation has declined during the century; but in Jessor district the
                    preparation of date-sugar is a thriving and popular industry. The manufacture of
                    sugar is everywhere in the hands of natives, except in the case of the Aska
                    factory in the Madras district of Ganjâm, and the Ashtagram factory in Mysore.
                    Both these factories, which use sugarcane and not date, have received honourable
                    notice at exhibitions in Europe.</p>
                <p>Cotton holds the first place among agricultural products grown for export. From
                    the earliest times, cotton has been grown in sufficient quantities to meet the
                    local demand, and even in the last century there was some slight export which
                    was carefully fostered by the East India Company. But the present importance of
                    the crop dates only from the crisis in Lancashire caused by the American War.
                    Prior to 1860 the exports of raw cotton from India used to average less than 3
                    millions sterling a year; but after that date they rose by leaps, until in 1866
                    they reached the enormous total of 37 millions. Then came the crash, caused by
                    the restoration of peace in the United States, and the exports fell, until they
                    now average little more than 8 millions a year. The fact is that Indian cotton
                    has a short staple, and cannot compete with the best American cotton for
                    spinning the finer qualities of yarn. But while the cotton famine was at its
                    height, the cultivators were intelligent enough to make the most of their <pb
                    break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit12newyrich/page/n772/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0912-0772-0749"/> opportunity. The area under cotton increased
                    enormously, and the growers managed to retain in their own hands a fair share of
                    the profit.</p>
                <p>The principal cotton -growing tracts are the plains of Guzerat and Kathiawar,
                    whence Indian cotton has received in the Liverpool market the historic name of
                    Surat; the highlands of the Deccan; and the deep valleys of the Central
                    Provinces and Berar. The best native varieties are found in the Central
                    Provinces and Berar, passing under the trade names of Hin ganghat and Amrâoti.
                    These varieties have been successfully introduced into the Bombay district of
                    Khândesh. Experiments with seed from New Orleans have been conducted for several
                    years past on the Government farms in many parts of India; but it cannot be said
                    that they have resulted in success except in the Bombay district of Dhârwâr,
                    where exotic cotton has now generally supplanted the indigenous staple. In
                    1875-76 the total area under cotton in the Bombay presidency, including Sind and
                    the native states, amounted to 4,516,587 acres, with a yield of 2,142,835 cwts.
                    Of this total, 583,854 acres, or 13 per cent., were sown with exotic cotton,
                    including that from the Central Provinces and also that from New Orleans, with a
                    yield of 248,767 cwts. The average yield was about 53 lb of cleaned cotton per
                    acre, the highest being in Sind and Guzerat, and the lowest in the southern
                    Marhattâ country. In the same year the total exports were 3,887,808 cwts.,
                    valued at £10,673,761. In 1877-78 the area under cotton in the Central Provinces
                    was 837,083 acres, or 5 per cent, of the total cultivated area, chiefly in the
                    districts of Wardha, Nâgpur, and Raipur. The average yield was about 59 lb per
                    acre. The total exports to Bombay, including re-exports from Berar, were about
                    300,000 cwts., chiefly in compressed bales, valued at £672,000. In the same year
                    the area under cotton in Berar was 2,078,273 acres, or 32 per cent, of the total
                    cultivated area, chiefly in the two districts of Akola and Amraoti. The average
                    yield was as high as 67 lb of cleaned cotton per acre. The total export was
                    valued at £2,354,946, almost entirely railway-borne. In Madras the average area
                    under cotton is about 1,500,000 acres, chiefly in the upland districts of
                    Bellary and Karnùl, and the low plains of Kistna and Tinnevelli. The total
                    exports in 1875-76 were 733,420 cwts., valued at £1,652,849. In Bengal the
                    cultivation of cotton is on the decline. The local demand is satisfied by
                    imports from the North-Western Provinces and from the bordering hill tracts,
                    where a very short-stapled variety of cotton is extensively cultivated. The
                    total area under cotton in Bengal is estimated at only 162,000 acres, yielding
                    138,000 cwts. of cleaned cotton. Of this, 31,000 acres were in Sâran, 28,000 in
                    the Chittagong hill tracts, and 20,000 in Cuttack. Throughout the North-Western
                    Provinces, and also the Punjab, sufficient cotton is grown to meet the wants of
                    the village weavers. The total exports of raw cotton from Indian ports in
                    1878-79 were 2,966,569 cwts., valued at £7,914,091,besides cotton twist and yarn
                    to the value of £937,698, and cotton manufactures valued at £1,644,125.</p>
                <p>Jute ranks next after cotton as a fibre crop. The extension of its cultivation
                    has been equally rapid, and it is yet more limited in its area, being confined
                    to northern and eastern Bengal. In this tract, which extends from Purniah to
                    Goâlpârâ, north of the Ganges for the most part, and along both banks of the
                    Brahmaputra, jute is grown on almost every variety of soil. The chief
                    characteristic of the cultivation is that it remains entirely under the control
                    of the cultivator. Practically a peasant proprietor, he increases or diminishes
                    his cultivation according to the state of the market, and keeps the profits in
                    his own hands. The demand for jute in Europe has contributed more than any
                    administrative reform to raise the average standard of comfort throughout
                    eastern Bengal. In 1872, when speculation was briskest, it is estimated that
                    about 1 million acres were under jute, distributed over sixteen districts, which
                    had a total cultivable area of 23 million acres. The total export from Calcutta
                    in that year was about 7 million cwts., valued at £4,142,548. Both quantities
                    and prices have since somewhat declined, but the business remains on a stable
                    footing. In 1878-79 the total export of raw jute from India was 6,021,382 cwts.,
                    valued at £3,800,426, besides jute manufactures to the value of £1,098,434.</p>
                <p>Indigo, though relatively of less importance than formerly, is still the foremost
                    staple grown by European capital. In Bengal Proper its cultivation has greatly
                    declined since the early years of this century. English planters have abandoned
                    the districts of Hιigli (Hooghly),the Twenty-four Parganàs, Dacca, Faridpur,
                    Rangpur, and Pabnâ, which are dotted with the sites of ruined factories. In
                    Nadiyâ, Jessor, Murshidâbâd, and Maldah, the industry is still carried on, but
                    it has not recovered from the depression caused by the indigo riots of 1860, and
                    the emancipation of the peasantry by the Land Act of 1859. Dye of superior
                    quality is manufactured in Midnapur, along the frontier of the hill tracts. But
                    indigo cultivation on the old scale still flourishes in North Behar, from which
                    is derived one-half of the total exports from Calcutta. No accurate statistics
                    of area are available; but in Tirhut alone there are fifty-six principal
                    concerns, with seventy outworks, producing annually about 20,000 <hi

                    the total amount of money annually distributed by the planters of North Behar
                    cannot be less than 1 million sterling. Across the border, in the North-Western
                    Provinces, indigo is grown and manufactured to a considerable extent by native
                    cultivators. In the Punjab, also, indigo is an important crop, especially in the
                    districts of Mùltân, Muzaffargarh, and Derâ Ghazi Khân. In Madras, where it is
                    grown and manufactured entirely by the natives, the total area under indigo is
                    about 300,000 acres, chiefly in the north-east of the presidency, extending
                    along the coast from Kistna to South Arcot, and inland to Karnùl and Cuddapah.
                    The exports of indigo from all India in 1878-79 amounted to 105,051 cwts., of
                    the value of £2,960,463.</p>
                <p>The opium of commerce is grown and manufactured in two special tracts,—(1) the
                    valley of the Ganges round Patnâ and Benares, and. (2) a fertile table-land in
                    Central India, corresponding to the old kingdom of Mâlwâ, for the most part
                    still under the rule of native chiefs, among whom Sindhia and Holkar rank first.
                    In the latter of these two regions the cultivation of poppy is free, and the
                    duty is levied as the opium passes through the British presidency of Bombay; in
                    the former, the cultivation is a strict Government monopoly. Opium is also grown
                    for local consumption throughout Râjputâna, and to a very limited extent in the
                    Punjab and the Central Provinces. Throughout the rest of India it is absolutely
                    prohibited. In the Ganges valley, the cultivation is supervised from two
                    agencies, with their headquarters at Patnâ and Ghâzipur, at which two towns
                    alone the manufacture is conducted. In 1872 the total area under poppy was
                    560,000 acres; the number of chests of opium sold was 42,675; and the sum
                    realized was £6,067,701, giving a net revenue of £4,259,376. The whole of this
                    was exported from Calcutta to China and the Straits Settlements. The amount of
                    opium grown in native states and exported from Bombay is about equal, thus
                    raising the average exports of opium to about 12 millions sterling, of which
                    about 7⅜ millions represent net profit to Government. In 1878-79, 91,200 chests
                    of opium were exported, of the value of £12,993,985, of which £7,700,000
                    represented the net profit to Government.</p>
                <p>Under the Bengal system annual engagements are entered into by the cultivators to
                    sow a certain quantity of land with poppy; and it is a fundamental principle
                    that they may agree or refuse to engage as they please. As with most other
                    Indian industries, a pecuniary advance is made to the cultivator before he
                    commences operations, which is balanced when he delivers over the opium at the
                    subordinate agencies. He is compelled to deliver his whole produce, being paid
                    at a fixed rate according to quality. In the beginning of April the cultivators
                    bring in their opium to the subordinate Government agencies, where it is
                    examined and weighed, and the accounts are settled. The final process of
                    preparing the drug in balls for the Chinese market is conducted at the two
                    central Government agencies at Patna and Ghazipur. This generally lasts until
                    the end of July, but the balls are not dry enough to be packed in chests until
                    October.</p>

                <p>Tobacco is grown in every district of India for local consumption. The soil and
                    climate are favourable; but up to the present time the quality of native-cured
                    tobacco is so inferior that it finds no market in Europe. The principal
                    tobacco-growing tracts are Rangpur and Tirhut in Bengal, Kaira in Bombay, and
                    the delta of the Godâvari and Coimbatore and Madura districts in Madras. The two
                    last-mentioned districts supply the raw material for the well-known
                    “Trichinopoli cheroot,” almost the only form of Indian tobacco that finds any
                    favour with Europeans; the produce of the <hi rend="italic">laιιkds</hi> or
                    alluvial islands in the Godâvari is manufactured into “coconadas.” The tobacco
                    of northern Bengal is largely exported to British Burmah, for the Burmese, who
                    are great smokers, do not grow sufficient for their own needs. In the year
                    1876-77 the total registered imports of tobacco into Calcutta were 400,000 cwt.,
                    valued at £261,000, of which more than half came from the single district of
                    Rangpur. Tobacco is also grown for export in the hill tracts of Chittagong. The
                    tobacco of Tirhut is chiefly exported towards the west. The total area under
                    tobacco in that district is estimated at 40,000 acres, the best quality being
                    grown in <hi rend="italic">pargand</hi> Saressa of the Tâjpur subdivision.</p>
                <p>Since 1875 a private firm of capitalists, backed by Government support, has begun
                    to grow tobacco and manufacture it for the European market. The scene of
                    operations is two abandoned studfarms at Gh⅛zipur in the North-Western
                    Provinces, and at Pusa in the Bengal district of Tirhut. In the year 1878-79
                    about 240 acres in all were cultivated with tobacco, and the total crop was
                    about 160,000 lb. No less than five English or American curers were employed.
                    Some of the produce was exported to England as ‘ ‘ cured leaf”; but the larger
                    part was put upon the Indian market in the form of “manufactured smoking
                    mixture.” This mixture is in demand at regimental messes and canteens, and has
                    already found its way to Australia. The enterprise may now be said to have
                    passed beyond the stage of experiment, and has probably opened a new sphere
                    alike for Indian agriculture and European capital. The one essential condition
                    of success is skilled supervision in the delicate processes of tobacco-curing.
                    Tobacco to the value of £128,239 was exported from India in 1878—79.</p>
                <p>The cultivation of coffee is confined to southern India, though attempts have
                    been made to introduce the plant both into British Burmah and into the Bengal
                    district of Chittagong. The coffee tract may be roughly defined as a section of
                    the landward slope of the Western Ghâts, extending from Kânara in the north to
                    Travancore in the extreme south. That tract includes almost the whole of Coorg,
                    the districts of Kâdur and Hassan in Mysore, and the Nilgiri hills, enlarged by
                    the recent annexation of the Wainâd. Within the last few years the cultivation
                    has extended to the Shevaroy hills in Salem district, and to the Palni hills in
                    Madura.</p>
                <p>Unlike tea, coffee was not introduced into India by European enterprise; and even
                    to the present day its cultivation is largely followed by the natives. The
                    Malabar coast has always enjoyed a direct commerce with Arabia, and at an early
                    date gave many converts to Islam. One of these converts, Baba Budan by name, is
                    said to have gone on a pilgrimage to Mecca and to have brought back with him the
                    coffee berry, which he planted on the hill range in Mysore still called after
                    him. According to local tradition this happened about two centuries ago. The
                    shrubs thus sown lived on, but the cultivation did not spread until the
                    beginning of the present century. The state of Mysore and the Baba Budan range
                    also witnessed the first opening of a coffee-garden by an English planter about
                    1840. The success of this experiment led to the extension of coffee cultivation
                    into the neighbouring tract of Manjarâ-bad, also in Mysore, and into the Wainad
                    subdivision of the Madras district of Malabar. From 1840 to 1860 the enterprise
                    made slow progress; but since the latter date it has spread with great rapidity
                    along the whole line of the Western Ghats, clearing away the primaeval forest,
                    and opening a new era of prosperity to the labouring classes. The following
                    statistics show the area under coffee for the year 1877-78 :—in Mysore, 128,438
                    acres, almost confined to the two districts of Hassan and Kâdur; in Madras,
                    58,988 acres, chiefly in Malabar, the Nilgiris, and Salem; in Coorg, 45,150
                    acres; total, 232,576 acres, exclusive of Travancore. The average rate of
                    produce is estimated at about 3 cwts. per acre of mature plant. The total export
                    of coffee in 1878-79 was 342,268 cwts . valued at £1,548,481.</p>
                <p>The cultivation of tea in India commenced within the memory of men still living
                    in 1881, and the industry now rivals indigo as a field for European capital.
                    Unlike coffeeplanting the enterprise owes its origin to the initiation of
                    Government, and has never attracted the attention of the natives. Early
                    travellers reported that the tea-plant was indigenous to the southern valleys of
                    the Himalayas; but they were mistaken in the identity of the shrub, which was
                    the <hi rend="italic">O</hi><hi rend="italic">syris</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >ηepalensis.</hi> The real tea(7‰α <hi rend="italic">viridis),</hi> a plant akin
                    to the camellia, grows wild in Assam, being commonly found throughout the hilly
                    tract between the valleys of the Brahmaputra and the Bârak. There it sometimes
                    attains the dimensions of a large tree; and from that, as well as from other
                    indications, it has been plausibly inferred that Assam is the original home of
                    the plant, which was thence introduced at a prehistoric date into China. The
                    real progress of tea-planting in Assam dates from about 1851, and was greatly
                    assisted by the promulgation of the Waste-land Rules of 1854. By 1859 there were
                    already fifty-one gardens in existence, owned by private individuals; and the
                    enterprise had extended from its original headquarters in Lakhimpur and Sibsâgar
                    as far down the Brahmaputra as Kâmrùp. In 1856 the tea-plant was discovered wild
                    in the district of Câchâr in the Bârak valley, and European capital was at once
                    directed to that quarter. At about the same time tea-planting was introduced
                    into the neighbourhood of the sanatorium of Dârjiling (Darjeeling), among the
                    Sikkim Himalayas. The success of these undertakings engendered a wild spirit of
                    speculation in tea companies both in India and at home, which reached its climax
                    in 1865. The industry recovered but slowly from the effects of this disastrous
                    crisis, and did not again reach a stable position until 1869. Since that date it
                    has rapidly but steadily progressed, and has been ever opening new fields of
                    enterprise. At the head of the Bay of Bengal in Chittagong district, side by
                    side with coffee on the Nilgiri hills, on the forest-clad slopes of Chutiâ
                    Nâgpur, amid the low-lying jungle of the Bhutàn Dwars, and even in Arakan, the
                    energetic pioneers of tea-planting have established their industry. Different
                    degrees of success may have rewarded them, but in no case have they abandoned
                    the struggle. The market for Indian tea is practically inexhaustible. There is
                    no reason to suppose that all the suitable localities for its growth have yet
                    been tried; and we may look forward to the day when India shall not only rival
                    but supersede China in her staple product.</p>

                    Brahmaputra and the Barak valleys, was 736,082 acres, of which 538,961 acres
                    were fit for cultivation; the total number of separate estates was 1718; the
                    total out-tura was 23,352,298 lb, at the average rate of 286 lb per acre under
                    mature plant. In Bengal, the area taken up was 62,642 acres, of which 20,462
                    acres were under mature plant, including 18,120 acres in the single district of
                    Darjiling; the number of gardens was 221; the out-turn was 5,768,654 lb, at the
                    rate of 282 lb per acre under mature plant. In the North-Western Provinces,
                    there were, in 1876, 25 estates in the districts of Kumâun and Garhwal, with an
                    out-turn of 578,000 lb, of which 350,000 lb were sold in India to Central Asia
                    merchants; and in 1871, 19 estates in Dehra Dùn, with 2024 acres under tea, and
                    an out-turn of 297,828 lb. In the Punjab, there were 10,046 acres under tea,
                    almost entirely confined to Kangrâ district, with an out-turn of 1,113,106 lb,
                    or 111 lb per acre. In Madras, the area under tea on the Nilgiris was 3160
                    acres; the exports from the presidency were 183,178 lb, valued at £19,308.
                    Excluding the figures just given for Madras, the whole of the Indian tea is
                    shipped from the port of Calcutta, and almost the whole is sent to the United
                    Kingdom. The total exports for 1878-79 were 34,800,027 lb, valued at £3,170,118.
                    Of the total supply, about 26,000,000 lb came from Assam, about 8,000,000 lb
                    from Bengal, 787,000 lb from the North-Western Provinces, and 684,000 lb from
                    the Punjab. In the previous year the exports of tea from the Punjab to Central
                    Asia were returned at 1,217,840 lb, valued at £181,634, beinga considerable
                    decrease on the year before.</p>

                <p>The introduction of the quinine-yielding cinchona into India is a remarkable
                    example of success rewarding the indefatigable exertions of a single man. When
                    Mr Clements Markham undertook the task of transporting the seedlings from South
                    America in 1860, cinchona had never before been reared artificially. But the
                    novel experiment in arboriculture has not only been successfully conducted, but
                    has proved remunerative from a pecuniary point of view. A cheap febrifuge has
                    been provided, in the form of the mixed cinchona alkaloids, for the
                    fever-stricken population of the Indian plains, while the surplus bark sold in
                    Europe more than repays interest upon the capital expended. These results have
                    been produced from an expenditure of about &lt;£100,000. The headquarters of
                    cinchona cultivation are on the Nilgiri hills, where Government owns several
                    plantations covering an aggregate of about 1000 acres, with about 570,000
                    full-grown plants. From the Government plantations cinchona seeds and plants are
                    annually distributed to the public in large quantities; and there are now
                    several private plantations rivalling the Government estates in area, and
                    understood to be very valuable properties. The varieties of cinchona most
                    commonly cultivated are <hi rend="italic">C. officinalis</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">C. succirubra</hi>; but experiments are being conducted with <hi
                    rend="italic">C. Calisaya,</hi><hi rend="italic">C. pubescens,</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">C. lαnceolata,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">C. ρitayensis.</hi> When
                    the success of the enterprise was secure, Government somewhat curtailed the
                    extent of its own operations. No fresh land was taken up, but the plantations
                    were kept free from weeds. The quinologist’s department was abolished, and the
                    bark sold in its raw state. From the central establishment on the Nilgiris
                    cinchona has been introduced into the Palni hills in Madura district, into the
                    Wainâd, and into the state of Travancore. Plantations have also been
                    successfully opened by Government near Merkara in Coorg, on the Bâba Budan hills
                    in Mysore, and in Sitang district in British Burmah. Failure has attended the
                    experiments made at Mahâbaleshwar in the Bombay presidency, and at Nongklao in
                    the Khâsi hills, Assam. But the success of the Government plantation at
                    Dâijiling, in northern Bengal, rivals that of the original plantation on the
                    Nilgiris. The area has been gradually extended to more than 2000 acres, and the
                    bark is manufactured into quinine on the spot by a Government quinologist. The
                    species mostly grown is <hi rend="italic">C. succirubra,</hi> which supplies a
                    red-coloured bark, rich in its total yield of alkaloids but comparatively poor
                    in quinine proper. Efforts are being made to increase the cultivation of <hi
                    rend="italic">C. Calisaya,</hi> which yields the more valuable bark, but is
                    difficult to propagate.</p>
                <p>The following are the financial results of the two Government plantations in
                    1877-78. On the Nilgiris the crop was 138,808 ft, of which 132,951 ft were
                    shipped to England, and the rest supplied to the Madras and Bombay medical
                    departments. The total receipts were £35,875, and the total expenditure £6977,
                    thus showing a net profit of £28,898. At Darjiling the crop amounted to 344,225
                    ft of Dark, which was all handed over to the quinologist, and yielded 5162 ft of
                    the febrifuge. The total receipts were £9707, of which £6188 represents the
                    amount debited to Government departments for the sale of febrifuge and bark,
                    while £3519 was derived from sales to the public. The total expenditure was
                    £8554, of which £5790 was expended upon the plantation, and £2764 on the
                    quinologist’s department. The net profit, therefore, was £1153, which is
                    expected shortly to rise to £4000 a year, as more of the young plants come into
                    bearing.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Silk.—</hi> Sericulture in India is a stationary, if not a
                    declining, industry. The large production in China, Japan, and the Mediterranean
                    countries controls the European markets, and on an average of years the imports
                    of raw silk into India now exceed the exports. The East India Company from the
                    first took great pains to foster the production of silk. As early as 1767, two
                    years after the grant of the financial administration of Bengal had been
                    conferred upon the Company, we find the governor, Mr Vereist, personally urging
                    the <hi rend="italic">zaminddrs,</hi> gathered at Murshidâbâd for the ceremony
                    of the <hi rend="italic">puηyd,</hi> “to give all possible encouragement to the
                    cultivation of mulberry.” In 1769 a colony of reelers was brought from Italy to
                    teach the system followed in the filatures at Novi. The first silk prepared in
                    the Italian method reached England in 1772, and Bengal silk soon became an
                    important article of export. Similar efforts started at Madras in 1793 were
                    abandoned after a trial of five years. Sericulture is said to have been
                    introduced into Mysore by Tipù Sultân, and for many years continued to prosper.
                    But recently the worms have been afflicted by a mysterious epidemic; and despite
                    the enterprise of an Italian gentleman who imported fresh broods from Japan, the
                    business has dwindled to insignificance. Bengal has always been the chief seat
                    of mulberry cultivation. When the trading operations of the Company ceased in
                    1833, they owned eleven head factories in that province, each supplied by
                    numerous filatures to which the cultivators brought in their cocoons. The annual
                    export of raw silk from Calcutta was then about 1 million lb. But in those days
                    the weaving of silk formed a large portion of the business of the factories. In
                    1779 Rennel wrote that at Kasimbâzâr (Cossimbazar) alone about 400,000 δ&gt;
                    were consumed in the several European factories. In 1802 Lord Valentia describes
                    Jangipur as “the greatest silk station of the Company, with 600 furnaces, and
                    giving employment to 3000 persons.”</p>
                <p>When the Company abandoned trade on its own account, sericulture was forthwith
                    taken up by private enterprise, and it still clings to its old headquarters. At
                    the present time the cultivation of the mulberry is mainly confined to the
                    Râjshâhi and Bardwân divisions of Lower Bengal. That branch of agriculture,
                    together with the rearing of the silk-worms, is conducted by the peasantry
                    themselves, who are free to follow or abandon the business. The destination of
                    the cocoons is twofold. They may either be sent to small native filatures, where
                    the silk is roughly wound before being consumed in the hand-looms of the
                    country; or they may be brought to the great European factories, which generally
                    use steam machinery and consign their produce direct to Europe.</p>
                <p>The cultivation of the mulberry is chiefly carried on in the districts of
                    Râjshâhi, Bogrâ, Maldah, Murshidâbâd, Birbhùm, Bardwân, and Midnapur. No
                    accurate statistics are available, but in Râjshâhi alone the area under mulberry
                    is estimated at 80,000 acres. The variety <pb break="no"

                    fruit-tree that is common in England, but a comparatively small shrub.</p>
                <p>Besides the silk-worm proper <hi rend="italic">(Bombyx mori),</hi> fed upon the
                    mulberry, several other species of silk-yielding worms abound in the jungles of
                    India, and are utilized, and in some cases domesticated, by the natives.
                    Throughout Assam especially, an inferior silk, produced in this λvay, has from
                    time immemorial furnished the common dress of the people. These “wild silks” are
                    known to commerce under the generic name of <hi rend="italic">tasar</hi> or <hi
                    rend="italic">tusser,</hi> but they are really the produce of several distinct
                    varieties of worm, fed on many different trees. The worm that yields <hi
                    rend="italic">tasar</hi> silk in Chutia Nagpur has been identified as the
                    caterpillar of <hi rend="italic">Antheroea</hi><hi rend="italic">paphia.</hi>
                    When wild, it feeds indiscriminately upon the <hi rend="italic">sdl (Shorea
                    robusta), baer</hi><hi rend="italic">(Zizyphus</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Jujuba)</hi>, and other forest trees; but in a state of semi-domestication it
                    is exclusively reared upon the <hi rend="italic">dsan</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >(Terminalia alata),</hi> which grows conveniently in clumps. The cocoons are
                    sometimes collected in the jungle, but more frequently bred from an earlier
                    generation of jungle cocoons. The worms require constant attention while feeding
                    to protect them from crows and other birds. They give three crops in the year—in
                    August, November, and May—of which the second is by far the most important. The
                    <hi rend="italic">tasar</hi> silk-worm is also found and utilized throughout the
                    Central Provinces, in the hills of the Bombay presidency, and along the southern
                    slope of the Himalayas. During the past twenty years repeated attempts have been
                    made to raise this industry out of its precarious condition, and to introduce
                    <hi rend="italic">tasar</hi> silk into the European market. That the raw
                    material abounds is certain, but the great difficulty is to obtain it in a state
                    that will be acceptable to European manufacturers. Native spun silk is only fit
                    for native hand-looms. In Assam two distinct qualities of silk are made, known
                    as <hi rend="italic">erid</hi> and <hi rend="italic">mugd.</hi> The former is
                    obtained from the cocoons of <hi rend="italic">Phaloena</hi><hi rend="italic"

                    has tried, with small success, to place the industry upon a stable and
                    remunerative basis. Though lac is to be found everywhere, the foreign exports
                    are almost entirely confined to Calcutta, which draws its supplies from the
                    hills of Chutiâ Nâgpur, and to a less degree from Assam and Mirzâpur in the
                    North-Western Provinces. Lac is known to commerce both as a gum (shellac) and as
                    a dye. The total exports in 1879 were 91,983 cwts., valued at £300,072.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Farming.—</hi> The efforts of Government to improve the native
                    methods of agriculture, by the establishment of model farms under skilled
                    European supervision, have not been generally successful.<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Model farms have been abandoned in Bengal, in
                    Assam, and in the Punjab. In the North-Western Provinces valuable experiments
                    are prosecuted. In Bombay there are three model farms, and in the Central
                    Provinces one, on which the common crops of the country are raised at a loss.
                    The Saidapet farm, near the city of Madras, is the only establishment at which
                    important experiments have been conducted on a scale and with a perseverance
                    sufficient to yield results of value Tins farm was started by the governor, Sir
                    William Denison, in 1865, and has been for the past nine years under the
                    management of Mr Robertson. It now (1881) covers an area of 250 acres in a ring
                    fence. Many important experiments have been made, of which some have produced
                    encouraging results, indicating the general direction in which improvements may
                    be effected in the agricultural practice of the presidency. It has been proved
                    that many of the common “dry crops” can be profitably cultivated for fodder at
                    all seasons of the year. Those most strongly recommended are yellow cholam <hi
                    rend="italic">(Sorghum vulgäre),</hi> guinea grass <hi rend="italic"

                    excellent fodder when cut green. Attention has also been given to subsoil
                    drainage, deep ploughing, the fertilizing powers of various manures, and the
                    proper utilization of irrigation water. It has been decided to establish a
                    school of agriculture at Saidapet in connexion with the model farm, with
                    subordinate branches in the districts, so as to diffuse as widely as possible
                    the agricultural lessons that have been already learned. In the year 1877-78 the
                    total expenditure at Saidapet on both farm and school of agriculture was about
                    £6000.</p></note><hi rend="italic">Stock.—</hi> Throughout the whole of India,
                    except in Sind and the western districts of the Punjab, horned cattle are the
                    only beasts used for ploughing. The well-known humped breed of cattle
                    predominates everywhere, being divided into many varieties. Owing partly to
                    unfavourable conditions of climate and soil, partly to the insufficiency of
                    grazing ground, and partly to the want of selection in breeding, the general
                    condition of the cattle is miserably poor. As cultivation advances, the area of
                    waste land available for grazing steadily diminishes, and the prospects of the
                    poor beasts are becoming worse rather than better. Their only hope lies in the
                    introduction of fodder crops as a regular stage in the agricultural course.
                    There are, however, some fine breeds in existence. In Mysore the <hi
                    rend="italic">amrit mahdl,</hi> a breed said to have been introduced by Hyder
                    All for military purposes, is still kept up by Government. In the Madras
                    districts of Nellore and Karnùl the indigenous breed has been greatly improved
                    under the stimulus of cattle shows and prizes, founded by British officials. In
                    the Central Provinces there is a peculiar breed of trotting bullocks which is in
                    great demand for wheeled carriages. The large and handsome oxen of Guzerat in
                    Bombay and of Hariânâ in the Punjab are excellently adapted for drawing heavy
                    loads in a sandy soil. The worst cattle are to be found always in the deltaic
                    tracts, but there their place is to a large extent taken by buffaloes. These
                    last are: more hardy than ordinary cattle; their, character is maintained by
                    crossing the cows with wild bulls, and their milk yields the best <hi
                    rend="italic">ghi,</hi> or clarified butter. In British-Burmah, the returns show
                    that the total number of buffaloes is just equal to that of cows and bullocks,
                    being about 700,000. Along the valley of the Indus, and in the sandy desert
                    which stretches into Râjputâna, camels supersede cattle for agricultural
                    operations. In the Punjab, the total estimated number of camels is 170,000. The
                    breed of: horses has generally deteriorated since the demand for military
                    purposes has declined with the establishment of British supremacy. In Bengal
                    Proper, and also in Madras, it may be broadly said that horses are not bred. The
                    chief breeds in Bombay are those of the Deccan and of Kâthiâwâr, in both of
                    which provinces Government maintains establishments of stallions. The Punjab,
                    however, is the chief source of remounts for the cavalry regiments, the total
                    number of horses in that province being returned at 80,000, in addition to
                    50,000 ponies. About the beginning of the present century, a stud department was
                    organized to breed horses for the use of the Bengal army, but this system was
                    abolished as extravagant and inefficient under the governor-generalship of Lord
                    Mayo. Remounts are now obtained in the open market; but the Government of the
                    Punjab still maintains about 130 stallions, including 60 imported from England
                    and 40 Arabs. The best horses are bred by the Baluchi tribes along the western
                    frontier. The best ponies come from Burmah, Manipur (the original home of the
                    now well-known game of polo), and Bhutân. Four great horse fairs are held in the
                    year—at Râwal Pindi, Derâ Ghâzi Khân, Jhang, and Derâ Ismâil Khân—at which about
                    4500 horses were exhibited in 1877-78, and a total sum of about £1300 was
                    awarded in prizes; the average price given for native cavalry remounts was only
                    £17. In recent years much attention has been paid in the Punjab to the breeding
                    of mules for military purposes; and the value of these animals was conspicuously
                    proved in the course of <pb break="no"

                    Government maintains about fifty donkey stallions, of which four were imported
                    from Spain, twenty-eight from Arabia, and twelve from Bokhara. Some of the mules
                    bred reach the height of 15 hands. The catching of elephants is now a Government
                    monopoly or under Government supervision, except in Malabar and Travancore where
                    the old proprietors retain the right. The chief source of supply is the
                    north-east frontier, especially the range of hills running between the valleys
                    of the Brahmaputra and the Bârak (see <hi rend="italic">ante,</hi> p. 742).
                    Sheep and goats are commonly reared in the wilder parts of the country for the
                    sake of their wool. Both their weight for the butcher and their yield of wool
                    are exceedingly low. In Mysore, and with considerable success at the Saidapet
                    farm, attempts have been made to improve the breed of sheep by crossing with
                    merino rams. Pigs of great size and most repulsive appearance are reared, and
                    eaten by the lowest of out-castes.</p>

                <p>The forests of India, both as a source of natural wealth and as a department of
                    the administration, are beginning to receive their proper share of attention. Up
                    to a recent date the destruction of forests by timber cutters, by charcoal
                    burners, and above all by nomadic cultivation, was allowed to go on everywhere
                    unchecked. The extension of cultivation was considered as the chief care of
                    Government, and no regard was paid to the improvident waste going on on all
                    sides. But as the pressure of population on the soil became more dense, and the
                    construction of railways increased the demand for fuel, the question of forest
                    conservation forced itself into notice. It was recognized that the inheritance
                    of future generations was being recklessly sacrificed to satisfy the immoderate
                    desire for profit. And at the same time the importance of forests as affecting
                    the general meteorology of a country was being learned from bitter experience in
                    Europe. On many grounds, therefore, it became necessary to preserve what
                    remained of the forests in India, and to repair the mischief of previous neglect
                    even at considerable expense. In 1844 and 1847 the subject was actively taken up
                    by the Governments of Bombay and Madras. In 1864 Dr Brandis was appointed
                    inspector-general of forests to the Government of India, and in the following
                    year an act of the legislature was passed (No. VII. of 1865). The regular
                    training of candidates for the Forest Department in the schools of France and
                    Germany dates from 1867. In the short interval that has since elapsed, sound
                    principles of forest administration have been gradually extended. Indiscriminate
                    timber-cutting has been prohibited, the burning of the jungle by the hill tribes
                    has been confined within bounds, large areas have been surveyed and demarcated,
                    plantations have been laid out, and, generally, forest conservation has become a
                    reality.</p>
                <p>From the point of view of adjninistration, the forests are classified as
                    “reserved” or “open.” The reserved forests are those under the immediate control
                    of officers of the Forest Department; they are managed as the property of the
                    state, with a single eye to conservancy and their future development as a source
                    of national wealth. Their limits are demarcated after survey, nomadic
                    cultivation by the hill tribes is prohibited, cattle are excluded from grazing,
                    destructive creepers are cut down, and the hewing of timber, if permitted at
                    all, is placed under stringent regulations. The open forests are less carefully
                    guarded; but in them also certain kinds of timber-trees are preserved. A third
                    class of forest lands consists of plantations, on which large sums of money are
                    spent annually. It is impossible to present in a single view the entire result
                    of the labours of the Forest Department. In 1872-73 the total area of reserved
                    forests in India was estimated at more than 6,000,000 acres; and the area has
                    probably been doubled since that date. In the same year the total forest revenue
                    was £477,000, as compared with an expenditure of £295,000, thus showing a
                    surplus of £182,000. By 1877-78 the revenue had increased to £664,102, of which
                    £160,308 was derived from British Burmah, and £126,163 from Bombay. The forest
                    exports in that year included—teak, valued at £406,652; lac and lac-dye,
                    £362,008; caoutchouc, £89,381; and gums, £183,685. But no figures that can be
                    given exhibit adequately the labour and the benefits of the Forest Department,
                    which is gradually winning back for the country the fee-simple of her forest
                    wealth, when it was on the point of being squandered beyond possibility of
                    redemption.</p>
                <p>The practice of nomadic cultivation by the hill tribes may conveniently be
                    described in connexion with forest conservation, of which it is the most
                    formidable enemy. In all the great virgin forests of India, in Arakan, on the
                    north-east frontier of Assam and Chittagong, throughout the Central Provinces,
                    and along the line of the Western Ghâts, the aboriginal tribes raise their crops
                    of rice, cotton, &lt;fcc., in this manner. A similar system has been found to
                    prevail in Madagascar; and indeed, from its simplicity and its appropriateness
                    it may fairly be called the most primitive mode of agriculture known to the
                    human race. Known as <hi rend="italic">toungya</hi> in Burmah, <hi rend="italic"
                    >fam</hi> on the north-east frontier, <hi rend="italic">dαhya</hi> in Central
                    India, <hi rend="italic">kil</hi> in the Himâlayas, and <hi rend="italic"
                    >kumdri</hi> in the Western Ghâts, it is practised, without any material
                    differences, by tribes of the most diverse origin. Its essential features are
                    the burning down of a patch of forest, and sowing the crop with little or no
                    tillage on the clearing thus formed. The tribes of the western coast break up
                    the cleared soil with a sort of hoe-pick and spade or even with the plough; in
                    other parts the soil is merely scratched with a knife, or the seed is scattered
                    on its surface without any cultivation at all. In some cases a crop, is taken
                    off the same clearing for two or even three years in succession, but more
                    usually the tribe moves off every year to a fresh field of operations. To these
                    nomad cultivators the words rhetorically used by Tacitus of the primitive
                    Germans are strictly applicable— <hi rend="italic">Arνa per</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">annos</hi><hi rend="italic">mutant;</hi><hi rend="italic">et
                    superest</hi><hi rend="italic">ager.</hi> The wanton destruction thus wrought in
                    the forests is simply incalculable. In addition to the timber-trees deliberately
                    burned down to clear the soil, the fire thus started not unfrequently runs wild
                    through the forest, and devastates many square miles. Wherever timber has any
                    value from the proximity of a market, the first care of the Forest Department is
                    to prohibit<pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit12newyrich/page/n777/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0912-0777-0754"/> these fires, and to assign heavy penalties for
                    any infringement of its rules. The success of a year’s operations is mainly
                    estimated by the degree in which the reserves have been saved from the
                    flame.</p>
                <p>But vast tracts of country yet remain in which it would be equally useless and
                    impossible to place restraint upon nomad cultivation, which is admitted to yield
                    a larger profit than ordinary cultivation with the plough. A virgin soil,
                    manured many inches deep with ashes and watered by the full burst of a tropical
                    rainfall, returns forty and fifty-fold of rice, which is the staple grain thus
                    raised. In addition to rice, Indian corn, millet, oil-seeds, and cotton are
                    sometimes grown in the same clearing, the seeds being all thrown into the ground
                    together, and each crop ripening in succession at its own season. Except to the
                    eyes of a forest officer, a patch of <hi rend="italic">jum</hi> cultivation is a
                    very picturesque sight Men, women, and children all work together with a will,
                    for the trees must be felled and burned, and the seed sown, before the monsoon
                    breaks.</p>
                <p>Irrigation is everywhere dependent upon the two supreme considerations of water
                    supply and land level. The sandy desert that extends from the hills of Ràjputâna
                    to the basin of the Indus is more absolutely closed to irrigation than the
                    confused system of hill and valley in Central India. Farther west, in the Indus
                    valley, irrigation becomes possible, and in no part of India has it been
                    conducted with greater perseverance and success. The entire province of Sind,
                    and hardly less the lower districts of the Punjab, are absolutely dependent upon
                    the floods of the Indus. Sind has been compared to Egypt, and the Indus to the
                    Nile; but, in truth, the case of the Indian province is the less favourable of
                    the two. In Sind the average rainfall is barely 10 inches in the year, the soil
                    is a thirsty sand, and, above all, the river does not run in confined banks, but
                    wanders at its will over a wide valley. The rising of the Nile is a beneficent
                    phenomenon, whose effects can be calculated with tolerable precision, and which
                    the industry of countless generations has brought under control for the purposes
                    of cultivation. In Sind the inundation is an uncontrolled torrent, which
                    oftentimes does as much harm as good. Broadly speaking, no crop can be grown in
                    Sind except under irrigation, and therefore the total cultivated area of about 3
                    million acres may be regarded as entirely dependent upon artificial
                    water-supply. The supply is derived from the river by two main classes of canals
                    —(1) inundation channels, which only fill when the Indus is in flood, and (2)
                    perennial channels, which carry off water by means of dams at all seasons of the
                    year. The former are for the most part the work of ancient rulers of the
                    country, or of the cultivators themselves; the latter have been constructed
                    since the British conquest. In both cases care has been taken to utilize
                    abandoned channels of the river. It is impossible to present a complete view of
                    the results of irrigation, for in some provinces, as in Sind, it is treated as a
                    department of land administration, while in others it is almost entirely
                    conducted by private enterprise.</p>
                <p>In 1876-77 about 900,000 acres in Sind were returned as irrigated from works for
                    which, capital and revenue accounts are kept, the chief being the Ghâr, Eastern
                    and Western Nara, Sakhar (Sukkur), Phuleli, and Pinyari; the total receipts were
                    about £190,000, almost entirely credited under the head of land revenue. In the
                    same year about 445,000 acres were irrigated from works of which revenue
                    accounts only are kept, yielding about £75,000 in land revenue. Throughout the
                    remainder of the Bombay presidency irrigation is conducted on a comparatively
                    small scale, and mainly by private enterprise. In the Concan, along the coast,
                    the heavy local rainfall and the annual flooding of the numerous small creeks
                    permit rice to be grown without artificial aid. In Guzerat the supply is drawn
                    from wells, and in the Deccan from tanks; but both these are liable to fail in
                    years of deficient rainfall. Government has now undertaken a few comprehensive
                    schemes of irrigation, which mostly conform to a common type—damming up the end
                    of a hill valley so as to form an immense reservoir, and then conducting the
                    water over the fields by channels, which are in some cases of considerable
                    length. In 1876—77 the total area in Bombay (excluding Sind) irrigated from
                    Government works was about 180,000 acres, yielding a revenue of about £42,000.
                    In the same year the total expenditure on irrigation (inclusive of Sind) was
                    £235,000,—£65,000 under the head of extraordinary and £170,000 of ordinary
                    outlay.</p>
                <p>In some parts of the Punjab irrigation is only one degree less necessary than in
                    Sind, but the sources of supply are more numerous. In the northern tract, under
                    the Himalayas, and in the upper valleys of the rivers, water can be obtained by
                    digging wells from 10 to 30 feet below the surface. In the south, towards Sind,
                    inundation channels are usual; while the upland tracts that rise between the
                    basins of the main rivers are now in course of being supplied by the perennial
                    canals of the Government. According to the returns for 1877-78, out of a grand
                    total of 22,640,894 acres under cultivation, 5,000,481 were irrigated by private
                    individuals and 1,618,854 by public channels, giving a total under irrigation of
                    6,619,335 acres, or 29 per cent of the cultivated area. The principal Government
                    works are the Western Jumna canal, the Bari Doâb canal, and the Sirhind, the
                    last of which, with the largest expenditure of all, is still incomplete. Up to
                    the close of 1877-78 the total outlay had been £3,645,189; the total income in
                    that year was £263,053, of which £171,504 was classified as direct and £91,549
                    as indirect; the total revenue charges on works in operation were £224,316, of
                    which £146,419 was for maintenance and £77,897 for interest, thus showing a
                    surplus of £38,737. On the Western Jumna canal alone the net profit was
                    £83,112.</p>
                <p>The North-Western Provinces present in the great <hi rend="italic">doâb,</hi> or
                    high land between the Ganges and the Jumna, a continuation of the physical
                    features to be found in the Upper Punjab. The local rainfall, indeed, is higher,
                    but before the days of artificial irrigation occasional deficiency repeatedly
                    resulted in terrible famines. It is in this tract that the British Government
                    has been perhaps most successful in averting the calamity of drought. In Sind
                    irrigation is an absolute necessity; in Lower Bengal it may be regarded almost
                    as a luxury; but in the great river basins of Upper India it serves the twofold
                    object of saving the population from the vicissitudes of the season and of
                    introducing more valuable crops and a higher stage of agriculture. Concerning
                    private irrigation from wells in the North-Western Provinces no information is
                    available. The great Government works are the Ganges canal, the Eastern Jumna
                    canal, the Agra canals, and the Lower Ganges canal, the last of which is not yet
                    complete. Up to the close of 1877-78 the total outlay had been £5,673,401. The
                    gross income in that year was £438,136, of which £337,842 was derived from water
                    rates and £100,294 from enhanced land revenue; the working expenses amounted to
                    £143,984, leaving £294,152 for surplus profits, or 6.77 per cent, on the total
                    capital expended on works in operation. The total area irrigated was 1,461,428
                    acres, of which more than two-thirds were supplied by the Ganges canal. Of the
                    total area, 415,659 acres were under wheat and 139,374 under sugar-cane.</p>
                <p>Into Oudh no irrigation works have yet been introduced by Government. A tolerable
                    local rainfall, the annual overflow of the rivers, and an abundance of low-lying
                    swamps combine to furnish a water supply that is ample in all ordinary years.
                    According to the settlement returns, out of a total cultivated area of 8,276,174
                    acres, 2,957,397 acres, or nearly 36 per cent., are irrigated by private
                    individuals; but this figure must include low lands watered by natural
                    overflow.</p>
                <p>Throughout the greater part of Bengal there is no demand for artificial
                    irrigation, but the solicitude of Government has undertaken to construct works
                    in those exceptional tracts where experience has shown that occasional drought
                    is to be feared. In the lower valleys of the Ganges and the Brahmaputra, and
                    along the deltaic seaboard, flood is a more formidable enemy than drought, and
                    embankments there take the place of canals. The Public Works Department has
                    altogether about 2800 miles of embankments under its charge, upon which £79,105
                    was expended in 1877-78, either as direct outlay or in advances to landowners.
                    The broad strip of northern Bengal and Behar, stretching between the Himalayas
                    and the Ganges, is also rarely visited by drought; though, when drought does
                    come, the excessive density of the population brings the danger of famine very
                    near. In Saran alone it has been found necessary to carry out a comparatively
                    small scheme for utilizing the discharge of the river Gandak. The great
                    irrigation works in Bengal are two in number, and belong to two different types.
                    (1.) In the delta of Orissa an extensive system of canals has been constructed
                    on the pattern of those lower down on the Coromandel coast, which are intended
                    to avert the danger of both drought and flood, and alsβ to be useful for
                    navigation. In average seasons, <hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> in five yean out of
                    six, the local rainfall is sufficient for the rice crop, which is there the sole
                    staple of cultivation; and therefore it is not to be expected that these canals
                    will be directly remunerative. But on the other hand, if they save the province
                    from a repetition of the disastrous year 1865-66, the money will not have been
                    expended in vain. (2. ) In South Behar the flood discharge of the Son has been
                    intercepted, after the system of engineering followed in the North-West, so as
                    to irrigate a comparatively thirsty strip of land extending along the south bank
                    of the Ganges, where distress has ere now been severely felt. In this case also,
                    the expenditure <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit12newyrich/page/n778/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0912-0778-0755"/> must be regarded rather as an insurance fund
                    against famine than as reproductive outlay. The works are not yet complete, but
                    the experience already gained proves that irrigation is wanted even in ordinary
                    seasons. Up to the close of 1877-78 the total expenditure on capital account for
                    all the irrigation works in Bengal was £4,653,903; the gross income for the year
                    was £49,477; the working expenses were £70,286; and the estimated interest on
                    capital, at 4⅛ per cent., amounted to £203,971, thus showing a net deficit of
                    £224,780. The area irrigated was about 400,000 acres.</p>
                <p>In the Madras presidency, and generally throughout southern India, facilities for
                    irrigation assume a decisive importance in determining the character of
                    agriculture. Crops dependent on the rainfall are distinguished as “dry crops,”
                    comprehending the large class of millets. Rice can only be grown on “wet land,”
                    which means land capable of being irrigated. Except on the Malabar or western
                    coast, the local rainfall is nowhere sufficiently ample or sufficiently steady
                    to secure an adequate water supply. Everywhere else water has to be brought to
                    the fields from rivers, from tanks, or from wells. Out of the total cultivated
                    area of Madras, only 15 per cent, is classified as “wet land;” the rest is at
                    the mercy of the monsoons. From time immemorial an industrious population has
                    made use of all the means available to store up the rainfall and direct the
                    river floods over their fields. The upland areas are studded with tanks, which
                    sometimes cover square miles of ground; the rivers are crossed by innumerable
                    anicuts, or dams by which the floods are diverted into long aqueducts. Most of
                    these works are now the property of Government, which annually expends large
                    sums of money in maintenance and repairs, looking for remuneration only to the
                    augmented land revenue. The average rate of assessment is 9s. 6d. per acre on
                    irrigated land, as compared with only2s. 3d. per acre on unirrigated land. It
                    is, therefore, not only the duty but the manifest advantage of Government to
                    extend the facilities for irrigation wherever the physical aspect of the country
                    will permit. The deltas of the Godavari, the Kistna, and the Kâveri (Cauvery)
                    have within recent years been traversed by a network of canals and thus
                    guaranteed against any risk of famine. Smaller works of a similar nature have
                    been carried out in other places; while a private company, with a Government
                    guarantee, has undertaken the more difficult task of utilizing on a grand scale
                    the waters of the Tungabhadra amid the hills and vales of the interior.
                    According to the latest statistics, the total irrigated area of the presidency
                    is about 5 million acres, yielding a land revenue of about 2 millions sterling.
                    Of this total, 1,680,178 acres, with a revenue of £739,778, are iιτigated by
                    eight great systems, for which revenue and capital accounts are kept. The minor
                    works consist of about 35,000 tanks and irrigation canals, and about 1140
                    anicuts or dams across streams.</p>
                <p>_ In Mysore, tanks, anicuts, and wells dug in the dry beds of rivers afford the
                    means of irrigation, but wet cultivation is there even rarer than in Madras.
                    After the disastrous famine of 1876-78 some comprehensive schemes of throwing
                    embankments across river valleys were undertaken by Government. In the Central
                    Provinces irrigation still remains a matter of private enterprise. According to
                    the settlement returns, out of a total cultivated area of 13,610,503 acres,
                    804,370 acres, or 6 per cent., are irrigated by private individuals. The only
                    Government work is a tank in the district of Nimar. In British Burmah, as in
                    Lower Bengal, embankments take the place of canals, being classed as ‘ ‘
                    irrigation works” in the annual reports. Within the last few years Government
                    has spent about £318,000 under this heading, in order to save the low
                    rice-fields along the Irawadi from destructive inundation.</p>
                <p>The following figures, applying to India as a whole, partially show how the
                    Government has performed its duty as a landlord in undertaking productive public
                    works. During the ten years ending March 1878 a total sum of £10,457,702 was
                    expended on irrigation under the budget heading of “extraordinary,” as compared
                    with £18,636,321 expended on state railways in the same period. In the twelve
                    months ending at the same date irrigation yielded a gross income of £495,142, as
                    compared with £548,528 derived from state railways; while £370,747 was charged
                    to revenue account against irrigation and £420,754 against state railways.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Internal Communication.</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Railways.—</hi> The existing system of railway communica tion in India dates
                    from the administration of Lord Dalhousie, who brought to bear upon this
                    question an experience gained at the Board of Trade when railway speculation in
                    England was at its height. The first Indian line was projected in 1843 by Sir
                    Macdonald Stephenson, who was afterwards active in forming the East India
                    Railway Company; but that premature scheme was blighted by the financial panic
                    that followed soon afterwards in England. Bombay, the city that has most
                    benefited by railway enterprise, saw the first sod turned in 1850, and the first
                    line of 3 miles to Thânâ (Tanna) opened in 1853. The elaborate minute drawn up
                    by Lord Dalhousie in the latter year still faithfully represents the railway map
                    of India at the present day, though modified in detail by Lord Mayo’s reform of
                    1869. Lord Dalhousie’s scheme consisted of a few trunk lines, traversing the
                    length and breadth of the peninsula, and connecting all the great cities and
                    military cantonments. These trunk lines were to be constructed by private
                    companies, to whom Government should guarantee a minimum of 5 per cent, interest
                    on their capital expended, and from whom it should demand in return a certain
                    measure of subordination. The system thus sketched out was promptly carried into
                    execution, and by 1871 Bombay was put into direct railway communication with the
                    sister presidencies of Calcutta and Madras. The task Lord Mayo had to undertake
                    was the development of traffic by means of feeders which should tap the
                    districts of production and thus open up the entire country. The means he
                    determined to adopt was the construction of minor lines by the direct agency of
                    the state, on a narrower gauge, and therefore at a cheaper rate, than the
                    existing guaranteed railways.</p>
                <p>The guaranteed lines, including the East Indian, which was transferred to
                    Government in 1879 in accordance with terms applicable to all alike, comprise
                    the following :—the East Indian, running up the valley of the Ganges from
                    Calcutta (Howrah) as far as Delhi, with a branch to Jabalpur; the Great Indian
                    Peninsular, which starts from Bombay and sends one arm north-east to Jabalpur,
                    with a branch to Nagpur, and another south-east to the frontier of Madras; the
                    Madras line, with its terminus similarly at Madras city, and two arms running
                    respectively to the Great Indian Peninsular junction at Râichur and to Beypur on
                    the opposite coast, with branches to Bangalore and Bellary; the Oudh and
                    Rohilkhand, connecting Lucknow and Moradâbâd with Cawnpur and Benares; the
                    Bombay, Baroda, and Central India, which runs due north from Bombay through the
                    fertile plain of Guzerat, and is destined ultimately to be extended across
                    Rajputana to Delhi; the Sind, Punjab, and Delhi, consisting of three sections,
                    one in Lower Sind, another from Delhi to Lahore, and the third from Lahore to
                    Mùltân; the South Indian (the only one on the narrow gauge), in the extreme
                    south, from Cape Comorin to Madras city; and the Eastern Bengal, traversing the
                    richest portion of the Gangetic delta. The state lines are too numerous to be
                    described singly. They include the extension from Lahore to Peshawar on the
                    north-west frontier, which at present stops short at Jhelum; the “missing link,”
                    from Mùltân to Hyderabad, thus bringing the Punjab into direct connexion with
                    its natural seaport at Karachi (opened throughout in 1878); the line up the
                    valley of the Irawadi from Rangoon to Prome; and several short lines which have
                    been constructed entirely at the expense of native states.</p>

                <p>These figures show 1 mile of railway to every 109 square miles of the area of
                    British India, or to every 179 square miles of the area of the entire peninsula.
                    The average cost of construction per mile is almost exactly £14,000. The
                    guaranteed railways, embracing the great trunk lines throughout India, are on
                    the “broad gauge” of 5 feet 6 inches; the state lines follow as a rule the
                    narrow or metre gauge of 3 ’ 281 feet.</p>

                    xml:id="kp-eb0912-0779-0756"/> diminishes. From a military point of view, rapid
                    communication by rail has now superseded the old marching routes as completely
                    as in any European country. Like Portsmouth in England, Bombay in India has
                    become the national harbour for the embarkation and debarkation of troops. On
                    landing at Bombay, all troops proceed for a short rest to the healthy station of
                    Deolâli on the plateau of the Deccan, whence they can reach their ultimate
                    destinations, however remote, by easy railway stages. The Grand Trunk Road,
                    running up the valley of the Ganges from Calcutta to the north-west frontier,
                    which was first planned in the 16th century by the Afghan emperor Sher Shâh and
                    was brought to completion under the administration of Lord George Bentinck, is
                    now for the most part untrodden by troops. But though the railway system
                    occupies the first place for military and commercial purposes, the actual
                    mileage and economic importance of roads have greatly increased. They do not
                    figure in the imperial balance-sheet, nor do they strike the popular
                    imagination, but their construction and repair constitute two of the most
                    important duties of the district official. A few lines, such as the continuation
                    of the Grand Trunk Road in the Punjab, are still substitutes for the railways of
                    the future. Others, which climb the passes of the Himâlayas, the Western Ghâts,
                    or the Nilgiris, will probably never be superseded. The great majority, however,
                    are works of local utility, serving to promote that ease and regularity of
                    communication upon which the existence of civilization so largely depends. The
                    substitution of the post-cart for the naked runner, and that of wheeled traffic
                    for the pack-bullock, are silent revolutions effected under British rule.</p>
                <p>The more important roads are all carefully metalled, the material employed in
                    most provinces being <hi rend="italic">kankar</hi> or calcareous limestone. In
                    Lower Bengal and other deltaic tracts, where no kind of stone exists, bricks are
                    roughly burnt and then broken up to supply metal for the roads. The minor
                    streams are crossed by permanent bridges, with foundations of stone, and not
                    unfrequently iron girders. The larger rivers have temporary bridges of boats
                    thrown across them during the dry season, which give place to ferries in time of
                    flood. Avenues of trees afford shade and material for timber. Most of these main
                    lines are under the charge of the Public Works Department. The burden of
                    maintaining the minor roads has, by a recent administrative reform, been thrown
                    upon the local authorities, who depend for their pecuniary resources upon
                    district committees and are often compelled to act as their own engineers. No
                    statistics are available to show the total mileage of roads in British India, or
                    the total sum expended on their maintenance.</p>
                <p>Inland navigation is almost confined to the four great rivers, the Ganges, the
                    Brahmaputra, the Indus, and the Irawadi. These all flow through broad valleys,
                    and from time immemorial have been the chief means of conveying the produce of
                    the interior to the sea. South of the Gangetic basin there is not a single river
                    that can be called navigable. Most of the streams in that tract, though mighty
                    torrents in the rainy season, dwindle away to mere threads of water and stagnant
                    pools during the rest of the year. The Godâvari and the Narbadâ, whose volume of
                    water is ample, are both obstructed by rocky rapids which engineering skill has
                    hitherto been unable to overcome. A total sum of 1∣ millions sterling has been
                    in vain expended upon the former river. Indeed, it may be doubted whether water
                    carriage is able to compete, as regards the more valuable staples, with
                    communication by rail. After the East Indian Railway was opened, steamers ceased
                    to ply upon the Ganges; and the steam flotilla on the Indus similarly shrank to
                    insignificance when through communication by rail became possible between Mùltân
                    and Karâchi. On the Brahmaputra and its tributary the Bârak, and on the Irawadi,
                    steamers still run secure from competition. But it is in the Gangetic delta that
                    river navigation attains its highest development. There the population may be
                    regarded as half amphibious. Every village can be reached by water in the rainy
                    season, and every family keeps its boat. The main channels of the Ganges and
                    Brahmaputra and their larger tributaries are navigable all the year through.
                    During the rainy months road-carriage is altogether superseded. All the minor
                    streams are swollen by the rainfall on the hills, and the loeal downpour; while
                    fleets of boats sail down with the produce that has accumulated in warehouses on
                    the river banks. The statistics of this subject belong rather to the department
                    of internal trade, but it may be mentioned here that the number of laden boats
                    registered at certain of the river-stations in Bengal in the year 1877-78 was
                    401,729.</p>
                <p>The great majority of the Bengal rivers require no attention from Government, but
                    the system known as the three Nadiyâ rivers is only kept open for traffic by
                    close supervision. A staff of engineers is constantly employed to watch the
                    shifting bed, to assist the scouring action of the current, and to advertize the
                    trading community of the depth of water from time to time. In the year 1877-78 a
                    total sum of £9522 was expended on this account, while an income of £32,494 was
                    derived from tolls.</p>
                <p>The artificial water channels of India may be divided into two classes—(1) those
                    confined to navigation, and (2) those primarily constructed for purposes of
                    irrigation. Of the former class the most important examples are to be found in
                    the south of the peninsula. On both the Malabar and the Coromandel coasts the
                    strip of lowland lying between the mountains and the sea affords natural
                    facilities for the construction of an inland canal running parallel to the
                    shore. In Malabar the salt-water lagoons or lakes, which form such a prominent
                    feature in the local geography, merely required to be supplemented by a few
                    cuttings to supply continuous water communication from the port of Calicut to
                    Cape Comorin. On the east coast, the Buckingham canal, running north from Madras
                    city as far as the delta of the Kistna, has been completed without any great
                    engineering difficulties. In Bengal there are a few artificial canals of old
                    date, but of no great magnitude, in the neighbourhood of Calcutta. The principal
                    of these form the system known as the Calcutta and Eastern eanals, which consist
                    for the most part of natural channels, artificially deepened in order to afford
                    a safe boat route through the Sundarbans. Up to the close of the year 1877-78 a
                    capital sum of £360,332 had been expended by Government on these canals, and the
                    gross income in that year was £44,120; after deducting cost of repairs, &amp;c.,
                    charged to revenue account, and interest at the rate of 4⅜ per cent., a net
                    profit was left amounting to £8748. The Hijilf tidal canal in Midnapur district,
                    which cuts off a difficult corner of the Hùgli (Hooghly) river, yielded a net
                    revenue of £3171 in the same year.</p>
                <p>Most of the great irrigation works, both in northern and southern India, have
                    been so constructed as to be available also for navigation. The general features
                    of these works have been already described. The works of the Madras Irrigation
                    Company on the Tungabhadra were not made available for navigation until 1879. A
                    scheme is now under the consideration of the Bengal Government for joining the
                    Midnapur and Orissa canal systems, and extending the line of water communication
                    farther southward through the Chilkà Lake as far as Ganjam, 400 miles from
                    Calcutta.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Commerce.</hi></p>
                <p>The trade of India may be considered under four heads: —(1) sea-borne trade with
                    foreign countries; (2) coasting trade; (3) frontier trade, chiefly across the
                    northern mountains; (4) internal traffic within the limits of the empire.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Sea-borne Trade.</hi> —With an extensive seaboard, India has
                    but few ports. Calcutta monopolizes the commerce, not only of Lower Bengal, but
                    of the entire basins of the Ganges and the Brahmaputra. Bombay is the sole
                    outlet for the agricultural wealth of Guzerat, the Deccan, and the Central
                    Provinces; while Karâchi (Kurrachee) performs a similar office for the Indus,
                    and Rangoon for the Irawadi. The natural value of these four ports has been
                    permanently confirmed by the construction of the main lines of railway
                    communication. In the south of India only is sea-borne <pb break="no"

                    side has a succession of tolerable harbours, from Goa to Cochin. On the east
                    there is not a single safe roadstead nor a navigable river, but ships anchor
                    some distance off the shore at Madras, and at other points, generally near the
                    mouths of the rivers. Of the total foreign trade of India, Calcutta and Bombay
                    control about 40 per cent, each; Madras has 6 per cent., Rangoon 4 per cent.,
                    and Karachi 2 per cent., leaving a balance of only 8 per cent, for all the
                    remaining ports of the country. Calcutta and Bombay may be called the two
                    centres of collection and distribution, to a degree without a parallel in other
                    countries; and the growth of their prosperity is identical with the development
                    of Indian commerce.</p>

                <p>The preceding table, which has been compiled from materials furnished by the <hi
                    rend="italic">Parliamentary Abstract</hi> for 1879, demands a few words of
                    explanation. The average of quinquennial periods has been taken in order to conn
                    · teract, as far as possible, accidental fluctuations. The two columns giving
                    the imports of treasure and the exports of raw cotton both show exceptional
                    increases between 1855 and 1869, due mainly to the effects of the Mutiny and of
                    the American War. Far more instructive are the three columns giving the imports
                    of cotton manufactures and of total merchandise and the exports of total
                    merchandise. Each of these three, without exception, exhibits a progressive
                    increase in every one of the eight quinquennial periods. In the full period of
                    forty years the value of cotton goods imported has multiplied sixfold; the value
                    of total merchandise imported has multiplied fivefold; and the value of total
                    merchandise exported has multiplied more than fourfold.</p>
                <p>Before examining in detail the history of some of the chief staples of trade, it
                    may be convenient to give in this place the statistics of a single
                    year,—1877-1878, which was a year of inflation, despite the incidence of famine
                    in southern India. In 1877-78 the aggregate volume of foreign sea-borne trade
                    exceeded 126 millions sterling in value. The transactions of Government show an
                    import of £2,138,182 and an export of £36,615. The imports of merchandise were
                    £39,336,003, and of treasure £17,355,460; total imports, £56,691,463. The
                    exports of merchandise were £65,185,713, and of treasure £2,155,136; total
                    exports, £67,340,849. These figures show an excess of exports over imports
                    (including treasure) amounting to £8,494,250, and an excess of treasure imported
                    to the amount of £15,200,324. The total number of vessels that entered and
                    cleared was 12,537, with an aggregate of 5,754,379 tons, or an average of 459
                    tons each. Of the total tonnage 76 per cent, was British, 7 per cent. British
                    Indian, 4 per cent, native, and 13 per cent, foreign,—American, Italian, and
                    French being best represented in the latter class. There was also a land-borne
                    frontier trade estimated at 7f millions—imports into India 4} millions, exports
                    3⅛ millions. The grand total of the land-borne and sea-borne foreign trade of
                    India in 1878, was 134 millions.</p>
                <p>The following tables give the principal items, together with the totals, of
                    import and export for 1877-78, showing the quantities wherever possible, as well
                    as the values :—</p>

                <p>As regards the imports, the first thing to notice is the enormous predominance of
                    two items—cotton goods and treasure. On an average of the last forty years,
                    cotton goods form 33 per cent., or exactly one-third of the total, and treasure
                    an additional 30 per cent. Next in order come metals (copper, which is largely
                    used by native smiths, slightly exceeding iron); Government stores, including
                    munitions of war, boots, liquor, and clothing for soldiers, and railway plant;
                    liquors, entirely for European consumption; coal, for the use of the railways
                    and mills; railway plant for the guaranteed companies; provisions, <pb
                    break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit12newyrich/page/n781/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0912-0781-0758"/> machinery and mill-work, and manufactured silk.
                    It will thus be seen that, with the single exception of Manchester goods, no
                    articles of European manufacture are in demand for native consumption, but only
                    for the needs of the civilized administration, and no raw produce, except
                    copper, iron, and salt.</p>
                <p>Considering that England’s export trade with India thus mainly depends upon
                    piece-goods, it is curious to recollect the history of cotton manufacture. In
                    the beginning of the 17th century the industry had not been introduced into
                    England, and whatever demand there was for cotton in that country was satisfied
                    by circuitous importations from India itself, where cotton-weaving is an
                    immémorial industry. In 1641 “Manchester cottons,” in imitation of Indian
                    calicoes and chintzes, were still made of wool. Cotton is said to have been
                    first manufactured in England in 1676. To foster the nascent industry, a
                    succession of statutes were passed prohibiting the wear of imported cottons; and
                    it was not until after the inventions of Arkwright and others and the
                    application of steam as a motive power had secured to Manchester the advantage
                    of cheap production that these protective measures were entirely removed. In the
                    present century Lancashire has rapidly distanced her instructors. During the
                    five years 1840-45 the annual import of cotton manufactures into India averaged
                    a little over £3,000,000 sterling. In each subsequent quinquennial period there
                    has been a steady increase, until in the year 1877-78 the import reached the
                    unprecedented total of £20,000,000 sterling, or an increase of more than sixfold
                    in less than forty years.</p>
                <p>The importation of treasure is perhaps still more extraordinary, when we bear in
                    mind that it is not consumed in the using, but remains permanently in the
                    country. During the same period of forty years the net import of treasure,
                    deducting export, has reached the enormous aggregate of just 319 millions
                    sterling, or more than £1, 6s. 6d. per head of the 240 million inhabitants of
                    the peninsula. Of course, by far the larger portion of this was silver, but the
                    figures for gold are by no means inconsiderable. During the ten years ending
                    with 1875, when the normal value of silver in terms of gold was but little
                    disturbed, the total net imports of treasure into India amounted to just 99
                    millions; of this total 62J millions were in silver and 36⅜ millions in gold,
                    the proportion of the latter metal being thus considerably more than one-third
                    of the whole. On separating the re-exports from the imports, the attraction of
                    gold to India appears yet more marked. Of the total imports of gold only 7 per
                    cent, was re-exported, while for silver the corresponding proportion was 19 per
                    cent. Roughly speaking, it may be concluded that India then absorbed about
                    £3,000,000 sterling of gold a year. The supply is drawn chiefly from China,
                    Ceylon, Great Britain, and Australia. The depreciation of silver that has since
                    taken place has caused an enormous increase in the import of silver and a
                    corresponding increase in the export of gold. The figures since 1876 do not show
                    the normal state of things. But even in 1877-78, when the value of silver was at
                    its lowest, though India drew upon its hoards of gold for export to the amount
                    of more than 1 million sterling, it yet imported more than 1∣ millions, showing
                    a net import of half a million of gold. It has been estimated that the gold
                    circulation of India amounts to about 1,620,000 gold <hi rend="italic"
                    >mohars,</hi> as compared with £158,000,000 of silver and £2,960,000 of copper.
                    In addition, 10 million . sovereigns are said to be hoarded in India, mainly in
                    the Bombay presidency, where the impression of St George and the Dragon is
                    valued on religious grounds.</p>
                <p>When we turn to the exports, the changes that have taken place in relative
                    magnitude demand notice.</p>
                <p>In 1877-78 raw cotton for the first time for many years falls into the second
                    place, being surpassed by the aggregate total of food grains; oil-seeds show as
                    a formidable competitor to cotton; jute surpasses indigo, and tea comes close
                    behind; while cotton manufactures are nearly as valuable as coffee. The imports
                    of sugar, in value though not in quantity, exceed the exports; the trade in raw
                    silk is about equally balanced; while spices, once the glory of Eastern trade,
                    were exported to the value of only £226,515, as compared with imports more
                    valuable and also twofold larger.</p>
                <p>The export of raw cotton has been subject to excessive variations. At the close
                    of the last century cotton was sent to England in small quantities, chiefly the
                    produce of the Central Provinces, collected at Mirzapur and shipped at Calcutta,
                    or the produce of Guzerat, despatched from Surat. In the year 1805 the total
                    export of cotton from Surat was valued at £108,000; in the same year the English
                    returns show only 2000 bales of East Indian cotton imported into Great Britain.
                    But this figure was far below the average, for by 1810 the corresponding number
                    of bales had risen to 79,000, to sink again to 2000 in 1813, and to rise to
                    248,000 in 1818. Bombay did not begin to participate in this trade until 1825,
                    but has now acquired the practical monopoly, since the railway has diverted to
                    the west the produce of the Central Provinces. In 1834, when the commerce of
                    India was first thrown open, 33,000,000 lb were exported. Analysing the exports
                    of cotton during the forty years since 1840, we find that in the first
                    quinquennial period they averaged 2⅛ millions sterling in value, and did not
                    rise perceptibly until 1858, when they first touched 4 millions. From that date
                    the increase was steady, even before the American exports were cut off by war in
                    1861. India then made the most of her opportunity, though quantity and quality
                    did not keep pace with the augmented price. The highest figures of value was
                    attained with 37⅜ millions sterling in 1865, and the highest figure of quantity
                    with 803,000,000 lb in 1866. Thenceforth the decline has been constant, though
                    somewhat irregular, the lowest figures both of quantity and value being those of
                    1878-79. The most recent feature of the trade is the comparatively small amount
                    shipped to the United Kingdom, and the even distribution of the rest among
                    Continental ports. The export of raw cotton in 1878-79 amounted to £7,914,091,
                    and of twist and cotton goods to £2,581,823.</p>
                <p>Second in,importance to cotton as a raw material of British manufacture comes
                    jute, the trade in which is a creation of less than thirty years. At the time of
                    the London Exhibition of 1851 jute fibre was practically untried and unknown,
                    while attention was even then actively drawn to rhea or China grass, which
                    remains to the present day unmanageable by any cheap process. From time
                    immemorial jute has been grown in the swamps of Eastern Bengal, and has been
                    woven into coarse fabrics for bags and even clothing. As early as 1795 Dr
                    Roxburgh called attention to the commercial value of the plant, which he grew in
                    the Botanical Gardens of Calcutta and named “jute,” after the language of his
                    Orissa gardeners, the Bengali word being <hi rend="italic">pat</hi> or <hi
                    rend="italic">kοshta.</hi> In 1828-29 the total exports of jute were only 364
                    cwts., valued at £62. From that date the trade steadily grew, until in the
                    quinquennial period ending 1847-48 the exports averaged 234,055 cwts. The
                    Crimean war, which cut off the supplies of Russian flax and hemp from the
                    Forfarshire weavers, made the reputation of jute. Taking quinquennial periods,
                    the export of jute rose from an average of 969,724 cwts. in 1858-63 to 2,628,100
                    cwts. in 1863-68 and 4,858,162 cwts. in 1868-73. The highest figures reached
                    were in the year 1872-73, with 7,080,912 cwt⅛., valued at £4,142,548. The export
                    of raw jute in 1878-79 reached £3,800,426, and of manufactured jute
                    £1,098,434.</p>
                <p>The export of grain, as already noticed, is now in the aggregate larger than that
                    of cotton. The two chief items are rice ana wheat Rice is exported from British
                    Burmah, from Bengal, and from Madras. From the point of view of the English
                    produce market rice means only Burmese rice, which is annually exported to the
                    large amount of about 12 million cwts., valued at 3 millions sterling. In the
                    Indian tables this is all entered as consigned to the United Kingdom, though, as
                    a matter of fact, the rice fleets from Burmah only call for orders at Falmouth,
                    and are thence diverted tc various English or Continental ports. India has a
                    practical monopoly of the European market. An export duty is levied on rice in
                    India at the rate of 3 <hi rend="italic">dnnds</hi> per <hi rend="italic"
                    >rnaund,</hi> or about 6d. per cwt. A similar duty on wheat was repealed in
                    1875, and that trade has since conspicuously advanced. In 1874-75 the export of
                    wheat was about 1 million cwts. Forthwith it increased year by year, until in
                    1877-78 it exceeded 6J million cwts., valued at nearly 3 millions sterling. In
                    the following year the quantity fell away to almost nothing, owing to the
                    general failure of the harvest in the producing districts. The Punjab is the
                    principal wheat-growing tract in India, but hitherto the chief supplies have
                    come from the NorthWestern Provinces and Oudh, being collected at Cawnpur and
                    thence despatched by rail to Calcutta. The total export of grains in 1879 was
                    valued at £9,802,363.</p>
                <p>Oil-seeds, also, were freed in 1875, the duty previous to that date having been 3
                    per cent, <hi rend="italic">ad valorem.</hi> Ten years before, the average <pb
                    break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit12newyrich/page/n782/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0912-0782-0759"/> export was only about 4 million cwts. a year; but
                    the fiscal change, σoinciding with an augmented demand in Europe, has caused an
                    increase of threefold. In 1877-78 the total export amounted to 12,187,020 cwts.,
                    valued at more than 7∣ millions sterling. Of this Bengal contributed 7,799,220
                    cwts., and Bombay 3,179,475 cwts. Linseed and rape are consigned mainly to the
                    United Kingdom, while France takes almost the entire quantity of <hi
                    rend="italic">til</hi> or gingelly. The export of oil-seeds in 1878-79 was
                    valued at £4,682,512.</p>
                <p>In actual amount, though not in relative importance, indigo holds its own in the
                    face of competition from aniline dyes. The export of 1877-78 amounted to 120,605
                    cwts., valued at £3,494,334, being the highest figures on record. Of this total
                    Bengal yielded 99,402 cwts., and Madras 16,899 cwts.· In 1878-79 the export of
                    indigo amounted to 105,051 cwts., valued at £2,960,463. The most noticeable
                    feature in this trade is the diminishing proportion sent direct to England, and
                    the wide distribution of the remainder. Of other dyes, safflower has greatly
                    fallen off, being now only in demand for a rouge in China and Japan; the export
                    in 1877-78 was 3698 cwts., valued at £14,881. The export of myrobalans, on the
                    other hand, was greatly stimulated by the Russo-Turkish war, which interrupted
                    the supply of valonia and galls from Asia Minor. The quantity rose from 286,350
                    cwts. in 1875-76 to 537,055 cwts. in 1877-78, valued in the latter year at
                    £230,526. Practically the whole is sent to the United Kingdom. Turmeric, also,
                    exhibits an increase to 146,865 cwts. in 1877-78, valued at £123,766, of which
                    the United Kingdom took about one-half. Lac-dye, like other kinds of lac, shows
                    a depressed trade, the exports in 1877-78 having been 9570 cwts., valued at
                    £29,009.</p>
                <p>No other export has made such steady progress as tea, which has multiplied more
                    than fourfold in the space of ten years. In 1867-68 the amount was only
                    7,811,429 lb; by 1872-73 it had reached 17,920,439 lb; and in 1878-79, without a
                    single step of retrogression, it had further risen to 34,800,027 lb, valued at
                    £3,170,118. Indian tea has now a recognized position in the London market,
                    generally averaging about 4d. per ft&gt; higher in value than Chinese tea, but
                    it has failed to win acceptance in most other countries, excepting Australia.
                    The exports of coffee from India are stationary, if not declining. The highest
                    amount during the past ten years was 507,296 cwts. in 1871-72, the lowest amount
                    298,587 cwts. in 1877-78, valued at £1,338,499. In 1878-79 the export was
                    342,268 cwts., valued at £1,548,481.</p>
                <p>Of manufactured goods, cotton and jute deserve notice, though by far the greater
                    part of the produce of the Indian mills is consumed locally. The total value of
                    cotton goods exported in 1878-79 was £1,644,125, being an increase of nearly
                    threefold as compared with J 874-75. The exports of twist and yarn, spun in the
                    Bombay mills, increased from 3 million lb in 1874-75 to 15⅜ million lb in
                    1877-78, valued in thé latter year at £682,058. The chief places of destination
                    were—China, 13,762,133 lb; Aden, 1,181,120 lb; and Arabia, 393,371 lb. The
                    export of twist and yarn in 1878-79 was valued at £937,698. Piece-goods belong
                    to two classes. Coloured goods, woven in hand-looms, are exported from Madras to
                    Ceylon and the Straits, to the annual value of about £230,000, the quantity
                    being about 8 million yards; while in 1877-78 grey goods from the Bombay mills
                    were sent to Aden, Arabia, Zanzibar, and the Mekran coast, amounting to over 10
                    million yards, and valued at £141,509. Jute manufactures consist of gunny bags,
                    gunny cloths, and rope and twine, almost entirely the produce of the Calcutta
                    mills. In all of these the value of the exports is increasing faster than the
                    quantity, having multiplied nearly fourfold in the last five years. In 1877-78
                    the total export of jute manufactures was valued at £771,127, and in 1878-79 at
                    £1,098,434. Gunny bags, for the packing of wheat, rice, and wool, were exported
                    in 1877-78 to the number of more than 26⅜ millions, valued at £729,669. Of tliis
                    total £298,000 (includ∙ ing by far the most valuable bags) was sent to
                    Australia, £162,000 to the Straits, £80,000 to the United States, £77,000 to
                    Egypt, £32,000 to China, and £81,000 to other countries, this comprising a
                    considerable quantity destined for England. In 1878-79 the export of gunny bags
                    had increased to 45⅜ millions, valued at a million sterling. Of gunny cloth in
                    pieces nearly 3 million yards were exported in 1877-78, almost entirely to the
                    United States, valued at £35,610; in 1878-79 these exports had increased to
                    upwards of 4∣ million yards. Of rope and twine 4428 cwts. were exported, valued
                    at £5443.</p>
                <p>The following tables, being taken from Indian returns, do not in all cases show
                    the real origin of the imports or the ultimate destination of the exports, but
                    primarily the countries with which India has direct dealings. London still
                    retains its historical pre-eminence as the first Oriental mart in the world,
                    whither buyers flock from the other countries of Europe to satisfy their wants.
                    Germans go there for wool, Frenchmen for jute, and all nations alike for rare
                    dyes, spices, and drugs. Though the opening of the Suez Canal has restored to
                    the maritime cities of the Mediterranean some share of the business that they
                    once monopolized, yet, on the other hand, the advantage of prior possession, the
                    growing use of steamers, and the certainty of being able to obtain a return
                    freight, all tend to favour trade with England carried in English bottoms. As
                    the result of these conflicting influences, the trade of India with the United
                    Kingdom, while in actual amount it remains pretty constant, shows a relative
                    decrease as compared with the total trade.</p>

                <p>The opening of the Suez Canal in 1869, while it has stimulated every department
                    of trade into greater activity, has not materially changed its character. As
                    might be anticipated, the imports, being for the most part of small bulk and
                    high value, first felt the advantages of this rou te. In 1875-76 as much as 85
                    per cent, of the imports fromEuropeand Egypt (excluding treasure) passed through
                    the canal, but only 29 per cent, of the exports. In 1878-79 the proportion of
                    imports was substantially the same, while that of exports had risen to 64 per
                    cent., showing that such bulky commodities as cotton, grain, oil-seeds, and jute
                    were beginning to participate in the advantages of rapid traffic. The actual
                    values of canal trade in 1877-78, the year of its greatest development, were 29
                    millions sterling for imports, and 23 millions for exports. It is estimated that
                    the canal has reduced the length of the voyage from London to India by the
                    equivalent of thirty-six days, the route round the Cape being more than 11,000
                    miles, that through the canal less than 3000 miles.</p>
                <p>In 1873-74, which may be regarded as a normal year, though the figures are not
                    altogether free from suspicion, the total number of vessels engaged in the
                    coasting trade that cleared and entered was 294,374, with an aggregate of
                    10,379,862 tons; the total value of both exports and imports was returned at
                    £34,890,445. Of the total number of vessels, 280,913, with 4,843,668 tons, were
                    native craft. Bombay and Madras divide between them nearly all the native craft;
                    while in Bengal and Burmah a large and increasing proportion of the coasting
                    traffic is carried in British steamers. In 1877-78, the year of famine, the
                    number of ships increased to 319,624, the tonnage to 15,732,246 tons, and the.
                    value to £67,814,446. By far the largest item was grain, of which a total of
                    1,137,690 tons, valued at 13 millions sterling, was thrown into the
                    famine-stricken districts from the seaboard. Next in importance come raw cotton
                    and cotton goods. The trade in raw cotton amounted to 387,438 cwts., valued at
                    £957,900, much of which was merely transshipped from one port to another in the
                    Bombay presidency. Cotton, twist, and yarn amounted to 17,425,993 lt&gt;, valued
                    at £965,038, of which the greater part was sent from Bombay to Bengal and
                    Madras. The total value of the cotton piece-goods was £620,866, including about
                    24 million yards of grey goods sent from Bombay to Bengal and to Sind in nearly
                    equal proportions, and about 2 million yards of coloured goods from Madras.
                    Stimulated by the activity of the grain trade, the exports of gunny bags from
                    Calcutta coastwise rose to a total value of nearly <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0912-0783-0760"/> £960,000. The trade in betel-nuts amounted to
                    nearly 44 million lb, valued at over £500,000. Burmah consumes most of these,
                    obtaining its supplies from Bengal; while Bombay gets considerable quantities
                    from Madras, from the Concan and Goa, and from Bengal. Sugar (refined and
                    unrefined) figures to the large amount of £900,000, of which the greater part
                    came from Bengal. The movements of treasure coastwise show a total of just 5
                    millions sterling, being exceptionally augmented by the conveyance of silver to
                    Burmah in payment for rice supplied to Madras.</p>

                <p>In any community raised above primitive barbarism the aggregate volume of its
                    internal trade must be far greater than that of its foreign commerce; but, from
                    the nature of the case, it is impossible to estimate its amount or even to
                    describe adequately its general character. On the one hand, there is the
                    wholesale business connected with foreign commerce in its earliest stages—the
                    collection of agricultural produce from a thousand little villages, its
                    accumulation at a few great central marts, and its despatch to the seaboard; in
                    return for which manufactured articles are distributed by the same channels,
                    though in the reverse direction. On the other hand, there is the interchange of
                    commodities of native growth and manufacture, sometimes between neighbours, but
                    also between distant provinces. With a few unimportant exceptions, free trade is
                    the rule throughout the vast peninsula of India, by land as well as by sea. The
                    Hindus possess a natural genius for commerce, as is shown by the daring with
                    which they have penetrated into the heart of Central Asia, and to· the east
                    coast of Africa. Among the benefits which British rule has conferred upon them
                    is the removal of the innumerable shackles that a short-sighted despotism had
                    imposed upon their talents.</p>
                <p>Broadly speaking, the greater part of the internal trade remains in the hands of
                    the natives. Europeans control the shipping business, and have a share in the
                    collection of some of the more valuable staples of exports, such as cotton,
                    jute, oil-seeds, and wheat. But the work of distribution and the adaptation of
                    the supply to the demand of the consumer naturally fall to those who are best
                    acquainted with native wants. Even in the presidency towns the retail shops are
                    generally owned by natives. The Vaisya, or trading caste of Manu, has no longer
                    any separate existence; but its place is occupied by several well-marked
                    classes. On the western coast the Pârsis, by the boldness and extent of their
                    operations, tread close upon the heels of the most prosperous English houses. In
                    the interior of the Bombay presidency, business is mainly divided between two
                    classes, the Baniyas of Guzerat and the Mârwâris from Râjputâna. Each of these
                    profess a peculiar form of religion, the former being Vishnu vites of the.
                    Vallabhâchâri sect, the latter Jains. In the Deccan their place is taken by
                    Lingâyats from the south, who again follow their own form of Hinduism, which is
                    an heretical species of Siva worship. Throughout Mysore, and in the north of
                    Madras, Lingâyats are still found, but along the eastern sea-board the
                    predominating classes of traders are those named Chetties and Komatis. In Bengal
                    many of the upper castes of Sùdras have devoted themselves to general trade; but
                    there again the Jain Mârwâris from Râjputâna and the North-West occupy the front
                    rank. Their head-quarters are in Murshidâbâd district, and their agents are to
                    be found throughout the valley of the Brahmaputra, as far up as the unexplored
                    frontier of China. They penetrate everywhere among the wild tribes; and it is
                    said that the natives of the Khâsi hills are the only hillmen who do their own
                    business of buying and selling. In the North-Western Provinces and Oudh the
                    traders are generically called Baniyas; ând in the Punjab are found the Khatris,
                    who have perhaps the best title of any to regard themselves as descendants of
                    the original Vaisyas. According to the general census of 1872, the total number
                    of persons in all India returned as connected with commerce and trade was
                    3,224,000, or 5 ’ 2 per cent, of the adult males.</p>
                <p>Local trade is conducted either at the permanent <hi rend="italic">bdzdrs:</hi>
                    of great towns, at weekly markets held in certain villages, at annual gatherings
                    primarily held for religious purposes, or by means of travelling brokers and
                    agents. The cultivator himself, who is the chief producer and also the chief
                    customer, knows little of the great towns, and expects the dealer to come to his
                    own door. Each village has at least one resident trader, who usually combines in
                    his own person the functions of money-lender, grain dealer, and cloth seller.
                    The simple system of rural economy is entirely based upon the dealings of this
                    man, whom it is the fashion sometimes to decry as a usurer, but who is really
                    the one thrifty person among an improvident population. Abolish the
                    money-lender, and the general body of cultivators would have nothing to depend
                    upon but the harvest of a single year. The money-lender deals chiefly in grain
                    and in specie. In those districts where the staples of export are largely grown,
                    the cultivators commonly sell their crops to travelling brokers, who re-sell to
                    larger dealers, and so on until the commodities reach the hands of the agents of
                    the great shipping houses. The wholesale trade thus rests ultimately with a
                    comparatively small number of persons, who have agencies, or rather
                    corresponding firms, at the great central marts. Buying and selling in their
                    aspects most characteristic of India are to be seen, not at these great towns,
                    nor even at the weekly markets, but at the fairs which are held periodically at
                    certain spots in most districts. Religion is always the original pretext of
                    these gatherings or <hi rend="italic">melds,</hi> at some of which nothing is
                    done beyond bathing in the river, or performing various superstitious
                    ceremonies. But in the majority of cases religion has become a mere excuse for
                    secular business. Crowds of petty traders attend, bringing all those
                    miscellaneous articles that can be packed into a pedlar’s wallet; and the
                    neighbouring villagers look forward to the occasion to satisfy alike their
                    curiosity and their household wants.</p>
                <p>It is, of course, impossible to express accurately in figures the extent of
                    internal trade, but the following statistics will serve in some measure to show
                    both its recent development and its actual amount. They are based upon the
                    registration returns that have been collected for some years past in certain
                    provinces. In 1863-64 the total external trade of the Central Provinces, both
                    export and import, was estimated to amount to 102,000 tons, valued at
                    £3,909,000. By 1868-69, after the opening of the Jabalpur through railway, it
                    had increased to 209,000 tons, valued at £6,795,000. In 1877-78, the year of
                    famine in southern India, the corresponding figures were 635,000 tons and
                    £9,373,000, showing an increase in fourteen years of more than sixfold in
                    quantity, and considerably more than twofold in value. The comparatively Small
                    increase in value is to be attributed to the exclusion from the later returns of
                    opium, which merely passes through in transit from Mâlwâ. In 1874-75 the total
                    external trade of the Punjab amounted to about 600,000 tons, valued (but
                    probably overvalued) at about £16,000,000. In 1877-78 it had increased to nearly
                    900,000 tons, valued at £17,500,000. The total trade of Behar in <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0912-0784-0761"/> 1877-78 was valued at £16,000,000. But perhaps
                    the significance of such enormous totals will become plainer if we take the case
                    of a single mart, Patna, which may claim to be considered one of the most
                    important centres of inland traffic in the world. Favourably situated on the
                    Ganges, near the confluence of the Son and the Gogra, where the principal trade
                    routes branch off to Nepal, it has become a great changing station for the
                    transfer of goods from river to rail. In the year 1876-77 the total registered
                    trade of Patna (excluding the Government monopoly of opium, and probably
                    omitting a good deal besides) was valued in the aggregate at 7⅜ millions
                    sterling. Many articles are included twice over, both as exported and imported,
                    but the imports alone amounted to more than 4 millions. Among the principal
                    items on one side or the other may be mentioned—European piece-goods,
                    £1,217,000; indigo, £789,000; oil-seeds, £557,000; salt, £389,000; sugar,
                    £274,000; food grains, £258,000; hides, £185,000; saltpetre, £156,000.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Manufactures.</hi></p>
                <p>Though India may be truly described as an agricultural and not a manufacturing
                    country, yet it would be erroneous to infer that it is destitute of the arts of
                    civilized life. It has no swarming hives of industry to compare with the factory
                    centres of Lancashire, nor a large mining population, living under the soil
                    rather than on it. In short, it has not reached that modern stage of industrial
                    development which is based upon the use of coal and the discoveries of physical
                    science. But in all manufactures requiring manual dexterity and artistic taste
                    India may challenge comparison with England in the last century. The
                    organization of Hindu society demands that the necessary arts, such as those of
                    the weaver, the potter, and the smith, should be practised in every village. The
                    pride and display of the rival kingdoms, into which the country was formerly
                    divided, gave birth to many arts of luxury that have not yet been entirely
                    forgotten in the decayed capitals. When the first European traders reached the
                    coast of India in the 16th century, they found a civilization among both “Moors”
                    and “Gentoos” at least as highly advanced as their own. In architecture, in
                    fabrics of cotton and silk, in goldsmith’s work and jewellery, the people of
                    India were then unsurpassed. But while the East has stood still, or rather
                    retrograded (for, in the face of keen competition, to stand still is to
                    retrograde), the West has advanced with a gigantic stride which has no parallel
                    in the history of human progress. On the one hand, the downfall of the native
                    courts has deprived the skilled workman of his chief market, while, on the
                    other, the English capitalist has enlisted in his service forces of nature
                    against which the village artisans in vain try to compete. The fortunes of India
                    are bound up with those of a country whose manufacturing supremacy depends upon
                    a great export trade. The tide of circumstances, more inexorable than artificial
                    enactments, has compelled the weaver to exchange his loom for the plough, and
                    has crushed out a multitude of minor handicrafts. Political economy, judging
                    only by the single test of cheapness, may approve the result; but the
                    philosopher will regret the increasing uniformity of social conditions, and the
                    loss to the world of artistic tendencies which can never be restored.</p>
                <p>Historically the most interesting, and still the most important in the aggregate,
                    of all Indian industries are those conducted in every rural village of the land.
                    The Hindu village system is based upon division of labour quite as much as upon
                    hereditary caste. The weaver, the potter, the blacksmith, the brazier, the
                    oil-presser, are each members of a community, as well as inheritors of a family
                    occupation. On the one hand, they have a secure market for their wares, and, on
                    the other, their employers have a guarantee that their trades shall be well
                    learned. Simplicity of life and permanence of employment are here happily
                    combined with a high degree of excellence in design and honesty of execution.
                    The stage of civilization below these village industries is represented by the
                    hill tribes, especially those on the north-east frontier, where the weaving of
                    clothes is done by the women of the family,—a practice which also prevails
                    throughout Burmah. A higher stage may be found in those villages or towns which
                    possess a little colony of weavers or braziers noted for some specialty. Yet one
                    degree higher is the case of certain arts of luxury, such as ivory carving or
                    the making of gold lace, which chance or royal patronage has fixed at some
                    capital now perhaps falling into decay. One other form of native industry owes
                    its origin to European interference. Many a village in Lower Bengal and on the
                    Coromandel coast still shows traces of the time when the East India Company and
                    its European rivals gathered large settlements of weavers round their little
                    forts, and thus formed the only industrial towns that ever existed in India. But
                    when the Company abandoned its manufacturing business in 1833, these centres of
                    industry rapidly declined; and the once celebrated muslins of India have been
                    driven out of the market of the world by Manchester goods.</p>
                <p>Cotton weaving may be called the oldest indigenous industry of India. The Greek
                    name for cotton fabrics, <hi rend="italic">sin-don</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >(σινδων),</hi> is etymologically the same as that of India or Sind; in later
                    days Calicut on the Malabar coast has given us “calico.” Cotton cloth, whether
                    plain or ornamented, has always been the single material of clothing for both
                    men and women, except in Assam and Burmah, where silk is preferred, perhaps in
                    reminiscence of an extinct trade with China. When European adventurers found the
                    way to India, cotton and silk always formed part of the rich cargoes they
                    brought home. The English, in especial, appear to have been careful to fix their
                    earliest settlements amid a weaving population—at Surat, at Calicut, at
                    Ma-sulipataιn, at Hooghly. In delicacy of texture, in purity and fastness of
                    colour, in grace of design, Indian cottons may still hold their own against the
                    world; but in the matter of cheapness they have been unable to face the
                    competition of Manchester.</p>
                <p>In 1870 the Madras Board of Revenue published a valuable report upon hand-loom
                    weaving, from which the following local figures are taken. The total number of
                    looms at work in that presidency, with its general population of 31 millions,
                    was returned at 279,220, of which 220,015 were in villages and 59,205 in towns,
                    showing a considerable increase upon the corresponding number in 1861, when the
                    <hi rend="italic">mοhtarfa</hi> or assessed tax upon looms was abolished. The
                    total estimated consumption of twist was 31,422,712 lb, being at the rate of 112
                    fij per loom. Of this amount, about one-third was imported twist and the
                    remainder country-made. The total value of the cotton goods woven was returned
                    at 3⅜ millions sterling, or £12, 10s. per loom, but this was believed to be much
                    under the truth. The export of country-made cloth in the same year was about
                    £220,000. In the Central Provinces (population 8 millions), where hand-loom
                    weaving is still fairly maintained, and where statistics are more trustworthy
                    than in other parts, the number of looms is returned at 87,588, employing
                    145,896 weavers, with an annual out-turn valued at £828,000. In 1878-79 the
                    export of Indian piece-goods from the Central Provinces was valued at £162,642.
                    As regards Bengal, hand-loom weaving is generally on the decline. The average
                    consumption of piece-goods throughout the province is estimated at about 5s. per
                    head, and the returns of registered trade show that European piece-goods are
                    distributed from Calcutta at the rate of about 2s. 5d. per head. In Midnapur,
                    Nadiya, and Bardwân the native weavers still hold their own, appears from the
                    large imports of European twist; but in the eastern districts, which have to
                    balance their large exports of jute, rice, and oil-seeds, the imports of
                    European cloth rise to the high figure of 2s. 7d. per head. No part of India has
                    suffered more from English competition than Bombay, where, however, the
                    introdιιction of steam machinery is beginning to restore the balance. Twist from
                    the Bombay mills is now generally used by the hand-loom weavers of the
                    presidency, and is largely exported to China. But it is in the finer fabrics
                    produced for export that the west of India has suffered most. Taking Surat
                    alone, the export by sea of piece-goods at the beginning of the century was
                    valued at £360,000 a year. By 1845 the value had dropped to £67,000, rising
                    again to £134,000 in 1859; but in 1874 it was only £4188.</p>

                <p>universally affected as a mark of wealth. Throughout British Burmah, and also in
                    Assam, silk is the common material of clothing, being made up by the women of
                    the household. In Burmah the bulk of the silk is imported from China, generally
                    in a raw state; but in Assam it is obtained from two or three varieties of
                    worms, which are generally fed on jungle trees and may be regarded as
                    semi-domesticated. Bengal is the only part of India where sericulture, or the
                    rearing of the silk-worm proper on mulberry, can be said to flourish. The
                    greater part of the silk is wound in European filatures, and exported in the raw
                    state to Europe. The native supply is either locally consumed, or sent up the
                    Ganges to the great cities of the North-West. A considerable quantity of raw
                    silk, especially for Bombay consumption, is imported from China. <hi
                    rend="italic">Tasar</hi> silk, or that obtained from the cocoons of
                    semi-domesticated worms, does not contribute much to the supply. As compared
                    with cotton weaving, the manufacture of silk fabrics may be called a town and
                    not a village industry. These fabrics are of two kinds—(1) those composed of
                    pure silk, and (2) those with a cotton warp crossed by a woof of silk. Both
                    kinds are often embroidered with gold and silver. The mixed fabrics are known as
                    <hi rend="italic">mashru</hi> or <hi rend="italic">sufi,</hi> the latter word,
                    meaning “permitted,” being used because the strict ceremonial law will not allow
                    Mahometans to wear clothing of pure silk. They are largely woven in the towns of
                    the Punjab and Sind, at Agra, at Hyderabad in the Deccan, and at Tanjore and
                    Trichinopoli. Pure silk fabrics are either of simple texture, or highly
                    ornamented in the form of <hi rend="italic">kinkhabs</hi> or brocades. The
                    latter are a specialty of Benares, Murshidâbâd, Ahmadâbâd, and Trichinopoli.
                    Printed silks are woven at Surat for the wear of Pârsi and Guzerati women. Quite
                    recently mills with steam machinery have been established at Bombay, which weave
                    silk fabrics for the Burmese market, chiefly <hi rend="italic">lûngyis,</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">tarnains,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">patsoes.</hi> The silk
                    manufactures exported from India consist almost entirely of the handkerchiefs
                    known as <hi rend="italic">bandannas</hi> and <hi rend="italic">corahs,</hi>
                    with a small proportion of <hi rend="italic">tasar</hi> fabrics. The trade
                    appears to be on the decline, the total exports having decreased from 2,468,052
                    yards, valued at £238,000, in 1875-76 to 1,481,256 yards, valued at £147,000, in
                    1877-78. But in 1879 the value had again risen to £195,897; and the returns for
                    1874-77 were unusually high.</p>
                <p>Embroidery has already been referred to in the two preceding paragraphs. The
                    groundwork may be either silk, cotton, wool, or leather. The ornament is woven
                    in the loom, or sewn on afterwards with the needle. Muslin is embroidered with
                    silk and gold thread at Dacca, Patnâ, and Delhi. Sind and Cutch (Kachhch) have
                    special embroideries of coloured silk and gold. Leather-work is embroidered in
                    Guzerat. In some of the historical capitals of the Deccan, such as Gulbargah and
                    Aurangâbâd, velvet <hi rend="italic">(makhmaΓ)</hi> is gorgeously embroidered
                    with gold, to make canopies, umbrellas, and housings for elephants and horses,
                    f··ruse on state occasions. Not only the goldsmith, but also the jeweller lends
                    his aid to Indian embroidery.</p>
                <p>Carpets and rugs may be classified into those made of cotton and those made of
                    wool. The former, called <hi rend="italic">satranjis</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >daris,</hi> are made chiefly in Bengal and northern India, and appear to be an
                    indigenous manufacture. The woollen or pile carpets known as <hi rend="italic"
                    >kalin</hi> and <hi rend="italic">kαlicha</hi> are those which have recently
                    attained so much popularity in England, by reason of the low price at which the
                    outturn of the jail manufactories can be placed in the market. The art was
                    probably introduced into India by the Mahometans. The historical seats of the
                    industry are in Kashmir, the Punjab, and Sind, and at Agra, Mïrzâpur, Jabalpur,
                    Warangal in the Deccan, Malabar, and Masulipatam. Velvet carpets are also made
                    at Benares and Murshidâbâd, and silk pile carpets at Tanjore and Salem. At the
                    London Exhibition of 1851 the finest Indian rugs came from Warangal, the ancient
                    capital of the Andhra dynasty, about 80 miles east of Hyderabad. Their
                    characteristic feature was the exceedingly fine count of the stitches, about
                    12,000 to the square foot. “They were also perfectly harmonious in colour, and
                    the only examples in which silk was used with an entirely satisfactory effect”
                    (Birdwood). The price was not less than £10 per square yard. The common rugs,
                    produced in enormous quantities in the jails at Lahore, Jabalpur, Mïrzâpur,
                    Benares, and Bangalore, sell in England at 7s. 6d. each.</p>
                <p>Gold and silver and jewels, both from their colour and their intrinsic value,
                    have always been the favourite material of Oriental ornament. Even the hill
                    tribes of Central India and the Himalayas have developed some skill in hammering
                    silver into brooches and torques. Imitation of knotted grass and leaves seems to
                    be the origin of the simplest and most common form of gold ornament, the early
                    specimens consisting of thick gold wire twisted into bracelets, &amp;c. A second
                    archaic type of decoration is to be found in the chopped gold jewellery of
                    Guzerat. That is made of gold lumps, either solid or hollow, in the form of
                    cubes and octahedrons, strung together on red silk. Of artistic jeweller’s work,
                    the best known examples come from Trichinopoli, Cuttack, Delhi, and Kashmir.
                    Throughout southern India the favourite design is that known as <hi
                    rend="italic">swdmi,</hi> in which the ornamentation consists of figures of
                    Hindu gods in high relief, either beaten out from the surface or fixed upon it
                    by solder or screws. The hammered <hi rend="italic">repoussé</hi> silver work of
                    Cutch (Kachhch), though now entirely naturalized, is said to be of Dutch origin.
                    Similar work is done at Lucknow and Dacca. The goldsmith’s art contributes
                    largely to embroidery, as has already been mentioned. Gold and silver thread is
                    made by being drawn out under the application of heat. The operation is
                    performed with such nicety that one rupee’s worth of silver will make a thread
                    nearly 800 yards long. Before being used in the loom this metallic thread is
                    generally twisted with silk.</p>
                <p>Precious stones are lavishly used by Indian jewellers, who care less for their
                    purity and commercial value than for the general effect produced by a blaze of
                    splendour. “But nothing can exceed the skill, artistic feeling, and
                    effectiveness with which gems are used in India both in jewellery proper and in
                    the jewelled decoration of arms and jade” (Birdwood).</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Iron Work.—</hi> The chief duty of the village smith is, of
                    course, to make the agricultural implements for his fellowvillagers. But in many
                    towns in India, often the sites of former capitals, iron work, especially in the
                    manufacture of arms, still retains a high degree of artistic excellence.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Cutlery.—</hi> The blade of the Indian <hi rend="italic"
                    >talvvdr</hi> or sword is sometimes marvellously watered, and engraved with date
                    and name, sometimes sculptured in half-relief with hunting scenes, sometimes
                    shaped along the edge with teeth or notches like a saw. Matchlocks and other
                    firearms are made at several towns in the Punjab and Sind, at Monghyr in Bengal,
                    and at Vizianâgaram in Madras. Chain armour, fine as lacework and said to be of
                    Persian origin, is still manufactured in Kashmir, Râjputâna, and Cutch
                    (Kachhch). Ahmadnagar in Bombay is famous for its spear-heads. Both firearms and
                    swords are often damascened in gold, and covered with precious stones. In fact,
                    the characteristic of Indian arms, as opposed to those of other Oriental
                    countries, is the elaborate goldwork hammered or cut upon them and the unsparing
                    use of gems. Damascening on iron and steel, known as <hi rend="italic"
                    >kuft,</hi> is chiefly practised in Kashmir, and at Guzerat and Siâlkot in the
                    Punjab. Damascening in silver, which is chiefly done upon bronze, <pb break="no"

                    from the ruined capital of Bidar in the nizâm’s dominions, where it is still
                    chiefly carried on.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Brass and Copper.—</hi> The village brazier, like the village
                    smith, manufactures the necessary vessels for domestic use. Chief among these
                    vessels is the <hi rend="italic">lota,</hi> or globular bowl, universally used
                    in ceremonial ablutions. The form of the <hi rend="italic">lota,</hi> and even
                    the style of ornamentation, has been handed down unaltered from the earliest
                    times. Benares enjoys the first reputation in India for work in brass and
                    copper. In the south, Madura and Tanjore have a similar fame; and in the west,
                    Ahmadâbâd, Poona, and Nâsik. At Bombay itself large quantities of imported
                    copper are wrought up by native braziers. The temple bells of India are well
                    known for the depth and purity of their note. In many localities the braziers
                    have a special repute either for a peculiar alloy or for a particular process of
                    ornamentation. Silver is sometimes mixed with the brass, and in rarer cases
                    gold. The brass or rather bell-metal ware of Murshidâbâd, known as <hi
                    rend="italic">khdgrai,</hi> has more than a local reputation, owing to the large
                    admixture of silver in it.</p>
                <p>Pottery is made in almost every village, from the small vessels required in
                    cooking to the large jars used for storing grain, and occasionally as floats to
                    ferry persons across a swollen stream. But, though the industry is universal, it
                    has hardly anywhere risen to the dignity of a fine art. Sind is the only
                    province of India where the potter’s craft is pursued with any regard to
                    artistic considerations; and there the industry is said to have been introduced
                    by the Mahometans. Sind pottery is of two kinds, encaustic tiles and vessels for
                    domestic use. In both cases the colours are the same,—turquoise blue, copper
                    green, dark purple, or golden brown, under an exquisitely transparent glaze. The
                    usual ornament is a conventional flower pattern, pricked in from paper and
                    dusted along the pricking. The tiles, which are evidently of the same origin as
                    those of Persia and Turkey, are chiefly to be found in the ruined mosques and
                    tombs of the old Musalmân dynasties; but the industry still survives at the
                    little towns of Saidpur and Bubri. Artistic pottery is made at Hyderabad,
                    Karachi, Tatta, and Hâla, and also across the border, at Lahore and Mùltân in
                    the Punjab. The Madura pottery also deserves mention from the elegance of its
                    form and the richness of its colour. The North-Western Provinces have, among
                    other specialties, an elegant black ware with designs in white metal worked into
                    its surface.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Carving and Inlaying.—</hi> Stone sculpture is an art of the
                    highest antiquity in India, as may be seen in the early memorials of Buddhism.
                    Borrowing an impulse from Greek exemplars, the Buddhist sculptors at the
                    commencement of our era freed themselves from the Oriental tradition which
                    demands only the gigantic and the grotesque, and imitated nature with some
                    success. But with the revival of Brahmanism Hindu sculpture again degenerated;
                    and so far as the art can still be said to exist, it possesses a religious
                    rather than an aesthetic interest. In the cities of Guzerat, and in other parts
                    of India where the houses are built of wood, their fronts are ornamented with
                    elaborate carving. Wood-carving, an important industry in Western India, is
                    said, perhaps erroneously, to owe its origin to Dutch patronage, though the
                    models of the carvers are evidently taken from their own temples. The favourite
                    materials are blackwood, sandal-wood, and jack-wood. The supply of sandal-wood
                    comes from the forests of the Western Ghâts in Kânara and Mysore, but some of
                    the finest carving is done at Surat and Ahmadâbâd. Akin to sandal-wood carving
                    is the inlaying of the miscellaneous articles known as “Bombay boxes.” This art
                    is known to be of modern date, having been introduced from Shiraz in Persia
                    towards the close of the last century. It consists of binding together in
                    geometrical patterns strips of tin-wire, sandal-wood, ebony, ivory, and stag’s
                    horn. At Vizagapatam, in Madras, similar articles are made of ivory and stag’s
                    horn, with scroll-work edged in to suit European taste. At Mâinpuri, in the
                    North-Western Provinces, wooden boxes are inlaid with brass wire. The chief
                    seats of ivory-carving are Amritsar, Benares, Murshidâbâd, and Travancore, where
                    any article can be obtained to order, from a full-sized palanquin to a lady’s
                    comb. Human figures in clay, dressed to the life, are principally made at
                    Krishnagar in Bengal, Lucknow, and Poona.</p>
                <p>It remains to give some account of those manufactures proper, conducted by steam
                    machinery and under European supervision, which have rapidly sprung up in
                    certain parts of India during the past few years. These comprise cotton, jute,
                    silk, and beer.</p>
                <p>The first mill for the manufacture of cotton yarn and cloth by machinery worked
                    by steam was opened at Bombay in 1854. The enterprise grew with scarcely a
                    check, until by 1879 the total number of mills throughout India was 58, with
                    about 1⅛ million spindles and 12,000 looms, giving employment to upwards of
                    40,000 persons—men, women, and children. Of this total, 30 mills, or more than
                    half, were in the island of Bombay, which now possesses a busy manufacturing
                    quarter with tall chimney stalks, recalling the aspect of a Lancashire town; 14
                    were in the cotton-growing districts of Guzerat, also in the Bombay presidency;
                    6 were in Calcutta and its neighbourhood; 3 at Madras; 2 at Cawnpur in the
                    North-Western Provinces; 1 at Nagpur in the Central Provinces; 1 at Indore, the
                    capital of Holkar’s dominions; and 1 at Hyderabad, the residence of the nizam.
                    Like the jute mills of Bengal, the cotton factories of Bombay have suffered of
                    late years from the general depression of trade.</p>
                <p>The Indian mills are, almost without exception, the property of joint-stock
                    companies, the shares in which are largely taken up by natives. The overlookers
                    are skilled artisans brought from England, but natives are now beginning to
                    qualify themselves for the post. The operatives are all paid by the piece; and,
                    as compared with other Indian industries, the rate of wages is high. In 1877, at
                    Bombay, boys earned from 14s. to £1 a month; women, from 16s. to £1; and
                    jobbers, from £3 to £6, 10s. Several members of one family often work together,
                    earning among them as much as £10 a month. The hours of work are from six in the
                    morning to six at night, with an hour allowed in the middle of the day for meals
                    and smoking. A Factory Act, to regulate the hours of work for children and young
                    persons and to enforce the fencing of dangerous machinery, &amp;c., is now
                    (1881) under the consideration of the legislative council.</p>
                <p>Besides supplying the local demand, these mills are gradually beginning to find a
                    market in foreign countries, especially for their twist and yarn. Between
                    1872-73 and 1878-79 the export of twist from Bombay increased from 1,802,863
                    ff&gt;, valued at £97,162, to 21,271,059 ⅛&gt;, valued at £883,665, or an
                    increase of nearly twelvefold in quantity and ninefold in value. Within the same
                    period of èight years the export of grey piece-goods increased from 4,780,834
                    yards, valued at £75,495, to 14,993,336 yards, valued at £198,380. The twist and
                    yam are mostly sent to China and Japan, the piece-goods to the coast of Arabia
                    and Africa. The figures for the coasting trade also show a corresponding growth,
                    the total value of twist carried from port to port in 1878-79 having been
                    £804,996, and of piece-goods (including hand-loom goods) £654,553. Mr 0 <hi
                    rend="superscript"> r</hi> Conor, who has devoted much attention to the matter,
                    thus summarizes his opinion regarding the future of the Indian cotton mills in

                    it is certain that there is a sufficient outlet in India itself for the

                    managed, the manufactures of our mills must inevitably, in course of time,
                    supersede Manchester goods of the coarser kinds in the Indian market.”</p>
                <p>The jute mills of Bengal have sprung up to rival Dundee, just as Bombay competes
                    with Manchester; but in the former case the capital is mostly supplied by
                    Europeans. They cluster thickly round Calcutta, extending across the river into
                    Hooghly district; and one has been planted at Sirajganj, far away up the
                    Brahmaputra in the middle of the jute-producing country. In 1879 the total
                    number of jute mills in India was 21, of which all but two were in Bengal, and
                    the number is annually increasing. The weaving of jute into gunny cloth is an
                    indigenous industry throughout northern Bengal, chiefly in the district of
                    Puraiah and Dinâjpur. The gunny is made by the semi-aboriginal tribe of Koch,
                    Rajbansi or Pâli, both for clothing and for bags; and, as with other industries
                    practised by non-Hindu races, the weavers are the women of the family, and not a
                    distinct caste. In 1877-78 just three million bags were imported into Calcutta
                    from Pâbnâ district, being the product of the Sirajganj mills. The total exports
                    by sea and land of both power-loom and hand-made bags numbered 80 millions, of
                    which not more than 6 millions were hand-made. The East Indian Railway<pb

                    xml:id="kp-eb0912-0787-0764"/> took 20 millions for the grain marts of Behar and
                    the NorthWestern Provinces (chiefly Patna and Cawnpur); and 1 million went as
                    far as Ludhiana in the Punjab. The total exports by sea exceeded 57 millions, of
                    which 32 millions represent interportal, and 25 millions foreign trade. Bombay
                    took as many as 16 millions, and British Burmah 12 millions. In fact, Calcutta
                    supplies bagging for the whole of India. The foreign trade may be given in
                    greater detail, for gunny weaving is perhaps the single Indian industry that
                    aims at a foreign market. The total export of jute manufactures (both bags and
                    cloth) in 1872-73 was valued at £200,669. By 1878-79 the value had risen to
                    £1,098,434, or an increase of fivefold in six years. Within the same period the
                    exports to the United Kingdom alone increased from 21,200 bags, valued at £585,
                    to 7 million bags, valued at £184,400. The other countries which take Indian
                    gunny bags are the following, with the values for 1877-78:—Australia, £298,186;
                    Straits Settlements, £161,772; United States, £79,795; Egypt, £76,726; China,
                    £32,121.</p>
                <p>Brewing has recently become established as a prosperous business at the large
                    hill stations on the Himalayas. There are now about twelve breweries in India,
                    including five in the Punjab and NorthWestern Provinces, at Mari (Murree),
                    Simla, Kasauli, Masuri (Mus-soorie), and NâiniTâl, and two in the Madras
                    presidency, at Utakamand and Bellaτy. The total quantity of beer brewed was
                    returned at 2,162,888 gallons in 1877 and 1,522,769 gallons in 1878, the
                    diminution being due to the termination of a contract between the Commissariat
                    Department and one of the Masuri breweries. The total quantity of beer imported
                    in 1878-79 was 2 million gallons by Government and 1 million gallons on private
                    account, so that the Indian breweries now satisfy just one-third of the entire
                    demand. At Simla imported beer sells at over 18s. per dozen, while that from the
                    local brewery can be obtained for Ils. per dozen. The hops are entirely
                    imported, for the experimental plantation of 100 acres established by the râjâ
                    of Kashmir has not yet proved a practical success. The imports of hops show a
                    steady increase from 1529 cwts. in 1875—76 to 1807 cwts. in 1876—77, and 2135
                    cwts. in 1877-78.</p>
                <p>The steam paper-mills established in the neighbourhood of Calcutta and at Bombay
                    have almost entirely destroyed the local manufactures of paper which once
                    existed in many parts of the country. The hand-made article, which was strong
                    though coarse, and formed a Mahometan specialty, is now no longer used for
                    official purposes. Besides manufacturing munitions of war, the Government
                    possesses a large leather factory at Cawnpur, which turns out saddlery, &amp;c.,
                    of excellent quality. Indeed, leather manufactures are an important local
                    industry in Oudh and the NorthWestern Provinces, and are conducted on such a
                    scale as to preclude the import from England, except in the case of <hi

                <p>The Indian peninsula, with its wide area and diversified features, supplies a
                    great store of mineral wealth, characterized both by variety and unusual
                    richness. In utilizing this wealth, English enterprise has met with many
                    rebuffs. Much capital has been expended with no other result in many cases than
                    disappointment. But the experience has not been thrown away; and the mining
                    industry, now established on a sure basis, is rising into an important position
                    in a country which ought gladly to welcome any employment other than the
                    universal pursuit of agriculture.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Iron.—</hi> In purity of ore, and in antiquity of working, the
                    iron deposits of India probably rank first in the world. They are to be found in
                    every part of the country, from the northern mountains of Assam and Kurnaun to
                    the extreme south of the Madras presidency. Wherever there are hills, iron is
                    found and worked to a greater or less extent. The indigenous methods of smelting
                    the ore, which are everywhere the same, and have been handed down unchanged
                    through countless generations, yield a metal of the finest quality in a form
                    well suited to native wants. But they require an extravagant supply of charcoal;
                    and even with the cheapness of native labour the product cannot compete in price
                    with imported iron from England. European enterprise, attracted by the richness
                    of the ore and the low rate of wages, has repeatedly tried to establish
                    ironworks on a large scale; but hitherto every one of these attempts has ended
                    in failure, alike in Madras, in the Central Provinces, in the Râniganj
                    coal-field, and in Kumâun. At the present time iron is manufactured only by
                    peasant families of smelters, each working on a very small scale; and even this
                    industry is languishing under the competition of English imports. The initial
                    difficulty in India is to find the three elements of iron working— namely, the
                    ore, the flux, and the fuel—sufficiently near to each other; the second
                    difficulty is the choking of the furnaces from the excessive quantity of ash in
                    the coat</p>
                <p>Coal has been known to exist in India since 1774, and is said to have been worked
                    as far back as 17 75. There are now altogether fifty-eight collieries in the
                    country, with an annual out-turn of about 1 million tons. In India, as
                    elsewhere, coal-mining and railway extension have gone hand in hand. Coal is
                    comparatively worthless unless it can be brought to market by rail; and the
                    price of coal is the chief element in determining the expenses of railway
                    working. The history of coal in India has, on the whole, been one of continual
                    progress. The first mine, at Râniganj, dates from 1820, and has been worked
                    regularly up to the present time. In 1878 its output was 50,000 tons. For twenty
                    years no new mine was opened; but the commencement of the East India Railway in
                    1854 gave a fresh impetus to the industry, and since that date collieries have
                    been opened at the rate of two or three every year. The largest number of
                    additions was seven, in 1874. By 1878 the total number of collieries in
                    connexion with the East Indian system was fifty-six. From these are supplied,
                    not only the railway itself, but also the jute mills of Calcutta, and the river
                    steamers of Lower Bengal. In 1877-78 the railway used 308,000 tons of coal from
                    its own collieries at Karharbâri and Srirâmpur, and sent exactly the same
                    quantity to Calcutta. In that year the imports of coal into Calcutta by sea were
                    only 80,000 tons, so that Calcutta now uses about 80 per cent, of Indian to 20
                    per cent, of foreign coal. Bombay, on the other hand, and also Madras are
                    entirely supplied with coal from England. The collieries in the Central
                    Provinces, which are the only others worked on a large scale, are limited to the
                    supply of the Great Indian Peninsula Railway. They are two in number,—(1) the
                    Warora colliery, under the management of the Public Works Department, and (2)
                    the Mohpâni colliery, which has been leased to the Narbadâ Coal Company. The
                    total area of the Râniganj coal-field has been estimated at 500 square miles. In
                    this “black country” of India, which is dotted with tall chimney-stalks, six
                    European companies are at work, besides many native firms. At first coal was
                    raised from surface quarries, but regular mining is now carried on, according to
                    the system of “pillar and stall.” The seams are entirely free from gas, so that
                    the precautions usual in England against explosion are found unnecessary. The
                    miners are all drawn from the aboriginal low-castes, chiefly Santâls and Bauris,
                    who are noted for their endurance and docility. Bauris work with the pick, but
                    Santâls will consent to use no other tool than the crowbar. Wages are high, and
                    the men look well-fed, though they waste their surplus earnings in drink. The
                    great drawback of Indian coal is its large proportion of ash, varying from 14 to
                    20 per cent., as against 3 to 6 per cent, in English coal. This places it at a
                    great disadvantage alike for iron-smelting and locomotive purposes. But it has
                    been proved that, with efficient firegrates and proper manipulation, 135 lb of
                    Warora coal will do the work of 100 ft&gt; of English coal.</p>
                <p>Salt, an article of supreme necessity to the Indian peasant who eats no meat, is
                    derived from three main sources, exclusive of importation from Europe :—(1) by
                    evaporation from sea-water along the entire double line of seaboard from Bombay
                    to Orissa, but especially in Guzerat and on the Coromandel coast; (2) by
                    evaporation from inland lakes, of which the Sâmbhar Lake in Râjputâna affords
                    the chief example; (3) by quarrying solid hills of salt in <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit12newyrich/page/n788/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0912-0788-0765"/> the north-east of the Punjab. The last is the
                    only case in which salt can be said to exist as a mineral. It occurs in solid
                    cliffs, which for extent and purity are stated to have no rival elsewhere in the
                    world. The chief of these has given its name to the Salt Range, running across
                    the districts of Jhelum (Jhilam) and Shâhpur, from the bank of the Jhelum river
                    to Kâlàbâgh in Bannu district. Similar deposits are found beyond the Indus in
                    Kohât district, where the salt is of two kinds, red and green, and in the hill
                    state of Mandi bordering on Kângrâ district. The salt is found in the red marls
                    and sandstones of the Devonian group. In some cases it can be obtained from open
                    quarries; but more generally it is approached by regular mining by pick and
                    blasting, through wide galleries. The principal mine is at Keora in Jhelum
                    district, now called after Lord Mayo. The total annual out-turn in the Punjab is
                    returned at about 50,000 tons, yielding a revenue to Government of more than
                    .£400,000. In 1877-78 the actual figures of revenue were—(1) from the Salt
                    Range, .£426,000, (2) from Kohat, £8000, (3) from Mandi, £6000.</p>
                <p>In southern India salt made by evaporation is almost universally consumed. Lower
                    Bengal, especially eastern Bengal, uses salt imported from Cheshire at low rates
                    of freight, and paying the excise duty at Calcutta or other port of entry. In
                    Orissa and south-western Bengal both imported salt and salt made by solar
                    evaporation are consumed, the latter being alone considered pure for religious
                    purposes or for the priests.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Saltpetre.—</hi> At one time India had almost a monopoly of the
                    supply of saltpetre upon which Europe depended for its gunpowder. In combination
                    with other saline substances it occurs as a white efflorescence upon the surface
                    of the soil in many parts of the country, especially in the upper valley of the
                    Ganges. Its preparation leaves common salt as one of the residuary products; and
                    consequently fiscal reasons have tended to limit the manufacture to the most
                    remunerative region, which is found in North Behar. The manufacture is simple,
                    and entirely in the hands of a special caste of natives, called Nuniyâs, who are
                    conspicuous for their capacity of enduring hard work. As is the case with most
                    Indian industries, they work under a system of money advances from middle-men,
                    who are themselves sub-contractors under the large houses of business. In former
                    times the East India Company engaged in the manufacture on its own account; when
                    it abandoned all private trade, its works were taken over by European firms, but
                    these have in their turn retired from the business, which is now in a state of
                    decline, partly owing to the general fall in price, and partly to the
                    restrictions imposed by the salt preventive department. The exports of saltpetre
                    from Calcutta are fairly constant, averaging about 450,000 cwts. a year, of
                    which one-half goes to the United Kingdom. More than two-thirds of the total
                    comes from Behar, chiefly from the districts of Tirhût, Sâran, and Champâran,
                    though Patnâ is the railway station for despatch to Calcutta. Cawnpur, Ghâzipur,
                    Allahâbâd, and Benares, in the North-Western Provinces, send small quantities,
                    while a little comes from the Punjab.</p>
                <p>Gold exists in many parts and probably in considerable quantities. Herodotus
                    affirms that the Indians were the only nation who paid their tribute to Darius
                    in gold; and there is some reason for believing that the “Ophir” of King Solomon
                    is to be identified with the Malabar coast. Nearly every hill stream is washed
                    for gold, whether in the extreme south, in the central plateau, or on the
                    north-east and northwest frontiers. It is true that gold-washing is everywhere a
                    miserable business, affording the barest livelihood; but yet the total amount of
                    gold obtained in this way cannot be insignificant. In recent years attention has
                    been prominently drawn to the possibility of extracting gold from the quartz
                    formation of southern India, which bears many points of resemblance to the
                    auriferous quartz reefs of Australia. The principal localities are in the Wainâd
                    (Wynaad) subdivision of the Nilgiri district and in Kolâr district of Mysore.
                    Gold-washing has always been practised there; and the remains of old workings
                    show that at some unknown period operations have been conducted on a large
                    scale.</p>
                <p>From about 1875 to 1880 individual pioneers were prospecting in that region.
                    Crushing the quartz by rude native methods, they proved that it contained a
                    larger proportion of gold than is known to yield a profit in Australia. These
                    experiments on the southern ends of six reefs yielded an average of 7 dwts. per
                    ton of quartz, rising in one case to 11 dwts. The best assay of the gold showed
                    a fineness of slightly over 20 carats. In 1879 Government summoned a practical
                    mining engineer from Australia, whose report was eminently hopeful. He described
                    the quartz reefs as of great extent and thickness and highly auriferous. One
                    reef in Kolar, laid bare 100 feet longitudinally, gave an average of 1 oz. of
                    gold per ton. In order to attract capital, Government proposed to grant mining
                    leases at a dead rent of Rs. 5 (10s. ) per acre, subject to no royalty or
                    further tax. Up to 1880 the enterprise had scarcely passed beyond the stage of
                    laboratory experiments. If the results of actual working with elaborate
                    machinery realize the promise held out by competent investigators, gold-mining
                    will be established as an important industry in southern India.</p>
                <p>Copper is known to exist in many parts of the country in considerable quantities.
                    The richest mines are in the lower ranges of the Himalayas, from Dâijiling
                    westward to Kumâun. The ore occurs in the form of copper pyrites, often
                    accompanied by mundic, not in true lodes, but disseminated through the slate and
                    schist. The miners arc almost always Nepâlïs, and the remoteness of the
                    situation has deterred European capital. The extent of abandoned workings proves
                    that these mines have been known and worked for many years. The best seams show
                    a proportion of copper slightly above the average of Cornish ore, but the
                    ordinary yield is not more than about 4 per cent. The mines resemble magnified
                    rabbit-holes, meandering passages being excavated through the rock with little
                    system. The tools used are an iron hammer and chisel, and sometimes a small
                    pick. After extraction, the ore is pounded, washed, and smelted on the spot. The
                    price obtained for the metal is Rs. 2.8.0 per 3 <hi rend="italic">sers,</hi> or
                    at the rate of about lOd. a pound. Copper-ore, of fair purity and extending over
                    a considerable area, also occurs in Singbhùm district of Chutiâ Nâgpur, where
                    there are many deserted diggings and heaps of scoriae. In 1857 a company was
                    started to re-open the workings at these mines; but, though large quantities of
                    ore were produced, the enterprise did not prove remunerative, and was finally
                    abandoned in 1864. A similar attempt to work the copper found in Nellore
                    district of Madras also ended in failure.</p>
                <p>Lead occurs in the form of sulphuret or galena along the Himalayas on the Punjab
                    frontier, and has been worked at one place by an English company.</p>
                <p>Tin is confined to the Burmese peninsula. Very rich deposits, yielding about 70
                    per cent, of metal, occur over a large extent of country in Mergui and Tavoy
                    districts o£ the Tenasserim region. The ore is washed and smelted, usually by
                    Chinese, in a very rough and unscientific way. Recent experiments made by a
                    European firm seem to show that the deposits, though rich and extensive, are not
                    sufficiently deep to repay more elaborate processes.</p>
                <p>Antimony, in the form of <hi rend="italic">surmd,</hi> which is largely used by
                    the natives as a cosmetic, is chiefly derived from the hill states of the
                    Punjab. It is also found in Mysore and Burmah. The minerals of Râjputâna, which
                    have not yet been thoroughly ascertained, include an ore of cobalt used for
                    colouring enamel.</p>

                    Ye-nang-yaung in Upper Burmah, on the banks of the Irawadi, there are upwards of
                    one hundred pits or wells with a depth of about 250 feet, from which petroleum
                    bubbles up in inexhaustible quantities. The annual yield is estimated at 11,000
                    tons, of which a considerable quantity is exported. Petroleum wells are also
                    found in the British districts of Akyab, Kyouk-hpyu, and Thayet-myo, which first
                    attracted British capital with most promising results in 1877. In Assam
                    petroleum occurs in the neighbourhood of the coalfields in the south of
                    Lakhimpur district, and was worked in conjunction with the coal by a European
                    capitalist in 1866. In the Punjab petroleum is worked by the Public Works
                    Department at two spots in Râwal Pindi district. In 1873-74 the total yield was
                    only 2756 gallons.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Stone.—</hi> The commonest and also the most, useful stone of
                    India is <hi rend="italic">kaιιkar,</hi> a nodular form of impure lime, which is
                    found in almost every river valley, and is used universally for metalling the
                    roads. Lime for building is derived from two sources,—(1) from burning limestone
                    and <hi rend="italic">kankar,</hi> and (2) from the little shells so abundantly
                    found in the marshes. Calcutta derives its chief supply from the quarries of the
                    Khâsi hills in Assam, known as “Sylhet lime,” and from the Susunia quarries in
                    Bankura district. The Gangetic delta is destitute of stone, nor does the
                    alluvial soil afford good materials for brick-making or pottery. But a European
                    firm has recently established large pottery-works at Râniganj in Bardwân, which
                    employ about five hundred hands, and carry out contracts for drainage pipes and
                    stoneware. The centre of the peninsula and the hill country generally abound in
                    building-stone of excellent quality, which has been used locally from time
                    immemorial. Among the finest stones maybe mentioned the pink marble of
                    Râjputâna, of which the historical buildings at Agra were constructed, the trap
                    of the Deccan, the sandstone of the Godâvari and the Narbadâ, and the granite of
                    southern India. Quarries of slate are scattered through the peninsula, and are
                    sometimes worked by European capital. Mica and talc are also quarried to make
                    ornaments. Among the hills of Orissa and Chutiâ Nâgpur household vessels and
                    ornaments are skilfully carved out of an indurated variety of potstone.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Precious Stories.—</hi> Despite its legendary wealth, which is
                    really due to the accumulations of ages, India cannot be said to be naturally
                    rich in precious stones. Under the Mahometan rule diamonds were a distinct
                    source of state revenue; and Akbar is said to have received a royalty of £80,000
                    a year from the mines of Panna. But at the present day the search for them, if
                    carried on anywhere in British territory, is an insignificant occupation. The
                    name of Golconda has passed into literature; but that city, once the Musalmân
                    capital of the Deccan, was rather the home of diamond-cutters than the source of
                    supply. It is believed that the far-famed diamonds of Golconda actually came
                    from the sandstone formation which extends across the south-east borders of the
                    nizâm’s dominions into the Madras districts of Ganjâm and Godâvari. A few
                    worthless stones are still found in that region. Sambalpur, on the upper channel
                    of the Mahânadi river in the Central Provinces, is another spot once famous for
                    diamonds. So late as 1818 a stone is said to have been found there weighing 84
                    grains and valued at £500. The river valleys of Chutiâ Nâgpur are also known to
                    have yielded a tribute of diamonds to their Mahometan conqueror. At the present
                    day the only place where the search for diamonds is pursued as a regular
                    industry is the native state of Panna (Punnah) in Bundelkhand. The stones are
                    found by digging down through several strata of gravelly soil and washing the
                    earth. Even there, however, the pursuit is understood to be unremunerative, and
                    has failed to attract· European capital. About other gems little information is
                    available. ( Turquoises are said to be found near Mültân in the Pun-g jab,
                    though far inferior to the Persian stones. Independent Burmah yields many
                    valuable gems; and some excitement has been caused by the discovery of sapphire
                    mines just across the Siamese frontier. Poor pearl fisheries exist off the coast
                    of Madura district in the extreme south, and in the Gulf of Cambay; but the
                    great majority of Indian pearls come either from Ceylon or from the Persian
                    Gulf. In the year 1700 the Dutch obtained a lease of all the pearl fisheries
                    along the Madura coast, and sublet the right of fishing to native boatmen, of
                    whom seven hundred are said to have taken licences annually at the rate of 60
                    <hi rend="italic">ecus</hi> per boat. The town of Cambay in Guzerat is
                    celebrated for its carving in carnelian, agate, and onyx. The stones come from
                    the neighbourhood of Ratanpur, in the state of Râjpipla. They are dug up by Bhil
                    miners, and subjected to a process of burning before being carved. The most
                    valued colour for carnelians is red, but they are also found white and yellow.
                    Lapis lazuli is found in the mountains of the north, and freely used in the
                    decoration of temples and tombs.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Famines.</hi></p>
                <p>As the agriculture of India is mainly dependent upon the bounty of nature, so is
                    it peculiarly exposed to the vicissitudes of the seasons. In any country where
                    the population is dense and the means of communication backward, the failure of
                    a harvest, whether produced by drought, by flood, by blight, by locusts, or by
                    war, must always cause much distress. Whether that shall develop into famine is
                    merely a matter of degree, depending upon a combination of circumstances—the
                    comparative extent of the failure, the density of the population, and the
                    practicability of imports.</p>
                <p>Drought, or an inadequate supply of rain, is undoubtedly the great cause of
                    wide-spread famine. No individual foresight, no compensating influences, can
                    entirely prevent those recurring periods of continuous drought with which large
                    provinces of India are afflicted. An average rainfall, if irregularly
                    distributed, may affect the harvest to a moderate degree, as also may flood or
                    blight. The total failure of a monsoon may result in a general scarcity,
                    sufficiently severe to arouse the solicitude of Government. But famine proper,
                    or wide-spread starvation, is caused only by a succession of years of drought.
                    The cultivators of India are not dependent upon a single harvest or upon the
                    crops of one year. In the event of a partial failure, they can draw for their
                    food supply either upon their own grain pits or upon the stores of the village
                    merchants. The first sufferers, and those who suffer most in the end, are the
                    class who live by daily wages. But small is the number that can hold out, either
                    in capital or credit, against a second year of insufficient rainfall; and not
                    impossibly a third season may prove adverse. AU the great famines in India of
                    which we have record have been caused by drought, and usually by drought
                    repeated over a series of years.</p>
                <p>This being so, it becomes necessary to inquire into the water supply, which
                    varies extremely in different parts of the country. It can be derived only from
                    three sources— (1) local rainfall, (2) natural inundation, and (3) artificial
                    irrigation from rivers, canals, tanks, or wells. Any of these sources may exist
                    separately or together. In only a few parts of India can the rainfall be
                    entirely trusted, as both sufficient in its amount and regular in its
                    distribution. Those favoured tracts include the whole strip of coast beneath the
                    Western Ghâts, from Bombay to Cape Comorin; and the greater part of the
                    provinces of Assam and Burmah, together with the deltaic districts at the head
                    of the Bay <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit12newyrich/page/n790/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0912-0790-0767"/> of Bengal. There the annual rainfall rarely, if
                    ever, falls below 100 inches; artificial irrigation and famine are alike
                    unknown. The whole of the rest of the peninsula may be described as liable, more
                    or less, to drought. In Orissa, the scene of one of the most severe famines of
                    recent times, the average rainfall exceeds 60 inches a year; in Sind, which has
                    been exceptionally free from famine under British rule, the average falls to
                    less than 10 inches. The local rainfall, therefore, is not the only element to
                    be considered. Broadly speaking, artificial irrigation has protected, or is now
                    in course of protecting, certain fortunate regions, such as the eastward deltas
                    of the Madras rivers and the upper valley of the Ganges. The rest, and by far
                    the greater portion, of the country is still exposed to famine. Nor is it easy
                    to see any remedy. Meteorological science may teach us to foresee what is
                    coming; but it may be doubted whether it is in our power to do more than
                    alleviate. Lower Bengal and Oudh are watered by natural inundation as much as by
                    the local rainfall; Sind derives its supplies mainly from canals filled by the
                    floods of the Indus; the Punjab and the North-West Provinces are dependent
                    largely upon wells; the Deccan with the entire south is the land of tanks and
                    reservoirs. But in all these cases, when the rainfall has failed over a series
                    of years, the artificial supply must likewise fail after no long interval, so
                    that irrigation becomes a snare rather than a benefit. Water works on a scale
                    adequate to guarantee the whole of India from drought are not only above the
                    possibilities of finance; they are also beyond the reach of engineering
                    skill.</p>
                <p>Taking the example of the famine of 1876-78, the most • wide spread and the most
                    prolonged that India has yet known, we may say that the drought commenced in
                    Mysore by the failure of the monsoon in 1875, and that all fear of distress in
                    the North-West Provinces did not pass away until 1879. But it will always be
                    known in history as the great famine in the south. Over the entire Deccan, from
                    Poona to Bangalore, the south-west monsoon failed to bring its usual rainfall in
                    the summer of 1876. In the autumn of the same year the north-east monsoon proved
                    deficient in the south-eastern districts of the Madras presidency. The main food
                    crop, therefore, entirely perished throughout an immense tract of country; and,
                    as the harvest of the previous year had also been short, prices rapidly rose to
                    famine rates. In November 1876 it was first officially recognized that
                    starvation was abroad in the land, and that Government must adopt measures to
                    keep the people alive. From that time until the middle of 1878, a period of more
                    than eighteen months, the campaign against famine was strenuously conducted,
                    with various vicissitudes. The summer monsoon of 1877 proved a failure; some
                    relief was brought in October of that year by the autumn monsoon; but all
                    anxiety was not removed until the arrival of a normal rainfall in June 1878.
                    Meanwhile the wave of drought had reached northern India, where it found the
                    stocks of grain much depleted to meet the famine demand in the south. Bengal,
                    Assam, and Burmah were the only provinces that escaped scot free in that
                    disastrous year. The North-West Provinces, the Punjab, Râjputâna, and the
                    Central Provinces alike suffered from drought through all the summer of 1877,
                    and from its consequences well into the following year. When once famine gets
                    ahead of relief operations, all is over. The flood of distress bursts through
                    the embankment. Starvation and all the attendant train of famine diseases sweep
                    away their thousands. The total expenditure of Government upon famine relief on
                    this occasion may be estimated at about 8 millions sterling, not including the
                    indirect loss of revenue nor the amount debited against the state of Mysore. For
                    this large sum of money there is but little to show in the way of works
                    constructed. The largest number of persons in receipt of relief at one time in
                    Madras was 2,591,900 in September 1877; of these only 634,581 were nominally
                    employed on works, while the rest were gratuitously fed. From cholera alone the
                    deaths were returned at 357,430 for Madras, 58,648 for Mysore, and 57,252 for
                    Bombay. Dr Cornish, the sanitary commissioner of Madras, well illustrated the
                    effects of the famine by contrasting the returns of births and deaths over a
                    series of years. In 1876, when famine with its companion cholera was already
                    beginning to be felt, the births registered in Madras numbered 632,113 and the
                    deaths 680,381. In 1877, the year of famine, the births fell to 477,447, while
                    the deaths rose to 1,556,312. In 1878 the results of the famine showed
                    themselves by a still further reduction of the births to 348,346, and by the
                    still high number of 810,921 deaths. In 1879 the births recovered to 476,307,
                    still considerably below the average, and the deaths diminished to 548,158.
                    These figures are, of course, not accurate; but they serve to show how long the
                    results of famine are to be traced in the vital statistics of a people.<note

                    ordinarily healthy; and the statistical returns have made certain what has long
                    been suspected, that starvation and distress greatly check the fecundity of the
                    population. It is probable that from this cause the number of births during the
                    same period has been lessened by 2 millions; the total reduction of the
                    population would thus amount to about 7 millions. Assuming the ordinary death
                    roll, taken at the rate of 35 per <hi rend="italic">mille,</hi> on 190 millions
                    of people, the abnormal mortality of the famine period may be regarded as having
                    increased this total by about 40 per cent.” But when estimated over a period of
                    years the effect of famine as a check upon the population is small. The Famine
                    Commissioners calculate that, taking the famines of the past thirty years, as to
                    which alone an estimateof any value can be made, the abnormal deaths caused by
                    famine and its diseases have been less than 2 per <hi rend="italic">mille</hi>
                    of the Indian population per annum. As a matter of fact cultivation quickly
                    extended after the famine of 1877-78, and there were in Bombay and Madras
                    120,000 more acres under tillage after the long protracted scarcity than before
                    it.</p></note></p>
                <p>The first great famine of which we have any trustworthy record is that which
                    devastated the lower valley of the Ganges in 1769-70. One-third of the
                    population is credibly reported to have perished. The previous season had been
                    bad; and, as not uncommonly happens, the break-up of the drought was accompanied
                    by disastrous floods. Beyond the importation into Calcutta and Murshidabad of a
                    few thousand <hi rend="italic">ma∕ιmds</hi> of rice from the fortunate districts
                    of Bâkarganj and Chittagong, it does not appear that any public measures for
                    relief were taken or proposed. The next great famine was that which afflicted
                    the Carnatic from 1780 to 1783, and has been immortalized by the genius of
                    Burke. It was primarily caused by the ravages of Hyder Ali’s army. A public
                    subscription was organized by the Madras Government, from which sprang the
                    “Monegar Choultry,” or permanent institution for the relief of the native poor.
                    In 1783-84 Hindustan Proper suffered from a prolonged drought, which stopped
                    short at the frontier of British territory. Warren Hastings, then
                    governor-general, advocated the construction of enormous granaries, to be opened
                    only in times of necessity. One of these granaries or <hi rend="italic"
                    >golàs</hi> stands to the present day in the city of Patna, but it was never
                    used until thé scarcity of 1874. In 1790-92 Madras was again the scene of a two
                    years’ famine, which is memorable as being the first occasion on which the
                    starving people were employed by Government on relief works. No useful lesson of
                    administrative experience is to be learned from the long list of famines and
                    scarcities which afflicted the several provinces of India at recurring periods
                    during the first half of the present century. In 1860-61 a serious attempt was
                    made to alleviate an exceptional distress in the North-Western Provinces. About
                    half a million persons are estimated to have been relieved at an expenditure by
                    Government of about three quarters of a million sterling. Again, in 1865-66,
                    which will ever be known as the year of the Orissa famine, the Government
                    attempted to organize relief works and distribute charitable funds. But on
                    neither of these occasions can it be said that the efforts were successful. In
                    Orissa, especially, the admitted loss of one-fourth of <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit12newyrich/page/n791/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0912-0791-0768"/> the population proves the danger to which an
                    isolated province is exposed. The people of Orissa died because they had no
                    surplus stocks of grain of their own, and because importation was absolutely
                    impracticable. Passing over the prolonged drought of 1868-7θ in the North-West
                    Provinces and Râjputâna, we come to the Behar scarcity of 1873-74, which first
                    attracted the interest of England. Warned by the failure of the rains, and
                    watched and stimulated by the excited sympathy of the public at home, the
                    Government carried out in time a comprehensive scheme of relief. By the
                    expenditure of 6⅛ millions sterling, and the importation of one million tons of
                    rice, all risk even of the loss of life was prevented. The comparatively small
                    area of distress, and the facilities of communication by rail and river, alone
                    permitted the accomplishment of the feat, which remains unparalleled in the
                    annals of famine. During the recent famine in southern India the authorities
                    worked with no less energy, and charitable bounty was far more conspicuous, yet
                    the conditions of the case predestined failure. The stricken tract was many
                    times larger than Behar. No early warning was given. The rainfall failed, not
                    once, but for three successive seasons, and, above all, adequate importation and
                    distribution of grain were physical impossibilities. The people were dying while
                    the grain that could have kept them alive was rotting on the beach of Madras or
                    on the railway sidings of Upper India. What administrative enterprise can
                    accomplish where the circumstances are within the compass of human control may
                    be learned from the case of Bombay. In that presidency the famine affected about
                    34,000 square miles of country, with a population of about 5,000,000 souls. The
                    highest number of persons in receipt of relief at one time· was 529,000 in June
                    1877, of whom the great majority were employed on remunerative works. The
                    importation of grain was left entirely free; and within twelve months 268,000
                    tons were brought by rail and 166,000 tons by sea into the distressed districts.
                    The total gross cost to Government was estimated at 1⅛ millions, of which about
                    1 million will be returned.</p>

                    official members besides the viceroy, which may be compared with the cabinet of
                    a constitutional country. It meets regularly at short intervals, discusses and
                    decides upon questions of foreign policy and domestic administration, and
                    prepares measures for the legislative council. Its members divide among
                    themselves the chief departments of state, such as those of foreign affairs,
                    finance, war, public works, &amp;c.; while the viceroy combines in his own
                    person the duties both of constitutional sovereign and prime minister. Secondly,

                    type="authorial"><p>Originally identical with the executive council, upon which

                    member” (3 and 4 Will. IV. c. 85, § 40).</p></note> which is constituted by the
                    same members as the preceding, with the addition of the governor of the province

                    with certain nominated members representing the non-official native and European
                    communities. The meetings of the legislative council are held when and as
                    required. They are open to the public; and a further guarantee for publicity is
                    insured by the proviso that draft bills must be published a certain number of
                    times in the <hi rend="italic">Gazette.</hi> As a matter of practice, these
                    draft bills have usually been first subjected to the criticism of the several
                    provincial governments. In regard to the supreme judicial authority there is no
                    such uniform system. The presidencies of Madras and Bombay, and also two of the
                    three great provinces which have been created out of the old presidency of
                    Bengal, and are now known as the lieutenant-governorships of Bengal and the

                    Central Provinces, Oudh, Mysore, and Berar have each a judicial commissioner,
                    who sits alone; while in Assam and British Burmah the chief commissioner, or
                    supreme executive ofiicer, is also the highest judicial authority.</p>
                <p>The law administered in the Indian courts consists mainly of (1) the enactments
                    of the Indian legislative councils above described and of the bodies which
                    preceded them, (2) statutes of the British parliament which apply to India, (3)
                    the Hindu and Mahometan laws on domestic inheritance or other cases affecting
                    the Hindus and Mahometans, and (4) the customary law affecting particular castes
                    and races. Much has been done towards consolidating individual sections of the
                    Indian law; and in the Indian penal code, together with the codes of civil and
                    criminal procedure, we have memorable examples of such efforts.</p>
                <p>But, though the governor-general-in-council is theoretically supreme over every
                    part of India alike,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"
                    ><p>Will. IV. c, 85, §§ 39 and 65.</p></note> his actual authority is not
                    everywhere exercised in the same direct manner. For ordinary purposes of
                    administration British India is partitioned into provinces, each with a
                    government of its own; and certain of the native states are attached to those
                    provinces with which they are most nearly connected geographically. These
                    provinces, again, enjoy various degrees of independence, in accordance with the
                    course of their historical development. The two sister presidencies of Madras
                    and Bombay still retain many marks of their original equality with Bengal. They
                    each have an army and a civil service of their own. They are each administered
                    by a governor appointed direct from England, with an executive and a legislative
                    council, whose functions are analogous to those of the councils of the
                    governorgeneral.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Vict.
                    c. 67, § 42.</p></note> They thus possess a domestic legislature; and in
                    administrative matters, also, the interference of the viceroy is a somewhat
                    remote contingency. Of the other provinces, Bengal, or rather Lower Bengal,
                    occupies a peculiar position. Like the North-Western Provinces and the Punjab,
                    it is administered by a single official, with the style of lieutenant-governor,
                    who is controlled by no executive council; but, unlike those two provinces,
                    Bengal has a legislative council, so far preserving a sign of its early
                    preeminence. The remaining provinces, whether ruled by a lieutenant-governor or
                    by a chief commissioner, may be regarded from an historical point of view as
                    fragments of the original Bengal presidency, which as thus defined would be
                    co-extensive with all British India that is not appropriated either to Madras or
                    to Bombay. The lieutenant-governors and most of the chief commissioners are
                    chosen from the covenanted civil service. In executive matters they are the
                    practical rulers; but, excepting the lieutenant-governor of Bengal, they have no
                    legislative authority. To complete<pb break="no"

                    administration, it is necessary to add certain ⅛wαs∕-provinces, under the
                    immediate control of the viceroy. These consist of Ajmir (Ajmere), transferred
                    from Râjputàna; Berar, or the districts assigned by the nizâm of Hyderabad; the
                    state of Mysore, to be restored in 1881 upon terms to its native râjâ; and the
                    tiny territory of Coorg, in the extreme south.</p>
                <p>Another difference of administration, though now of less importance than in
                    former times, derives its name from the old regulations, or uniform rules of law
                    and practice which preceded the present system of acts of the legislature. These
                    regulations, originally intended to be universal in their application, have been
                    from time to time withdrawn so far as regards certain tracts of country which
                    from their backward state of civilization or other causes seemed to require
                    exceptional treatment. In non-regulation territory, broadly speaking, a larger
                    measure of discretion is allowed to the officials, both in the collection of
                    revenue and in the administration of civil justice; strict rules of procedure
                    yield to the necessities of the case, and the judicial and executive departments
                    are to a great extent combined in the same hands. Closely connected with this
                    indulgence in favour of the personal element in administration, a wider field is
                    also permitted for the selection of the administrative staff, which is not
                    confined to the covenanted civil service, but includes military officers on the
                    staff and also uncovenanted civilians. The title of the highest authority in a
                    non-regulation district is not that of collector-magistrate, but deputy
                    commissioner; and the supreme authority in a non-regulation province is usually
                    styled, not lieutenant-governor, but chief commissioner. The Central Provinces
                    and British Burmah are examples of non-regulation provinces; but non-regulation
                    districts are to be found also in Bengal and the North-Western Provinces, where
                    their existence can always be traced by the office of deputy commissioner</p>
                <p>Alike in regulation and in non-regulation territory the unit of administration is
                    the district,—a word of very definite meaning in official phraseology. The
                    district officer, whether known as collector-magistrate or as deputy
                    commissioner, is the sole responsible head of his jurisdiction</p>
                <p>Upon lιis energy and character rests ultimately the effiriency of the Indian
                    Government. Not only are his own special duties so numerous and so vast as to be
                    bewildering to the outsider, but the work of his subordinates, European and
                    native, largely depends upon the stimulus of his personal example. His position
                    has been compared to that of the French <hi rend="italic">préfet</hi>; but such
                    a comparison is un just in many ways to the Indian district officer: he is not a
                    creature of the Home Office, who takes his colour from his chief and represents
                    only officialism, but an active worker in every department of popular
                    well-being, with a large measure of individual initiative. As the very name of
                    collector-magistrate implies, his main functions are twofold. He is a fiscal
                    officer, charged with the collection of the revenue from land and other sources;
                    and he is a civil and criminal judge of first instance. But this explanation of
                    his title by no means exhausts his multifarious duties. He does in his local
                    sphere all that the home secretary is supposed to do in England, and a great
                    deal more; for he is the representative of a paternal and not of a
                    constitutional government. Police, jails, education, municipalities, roads,
                    sanitation, dispensaries, are all to him matters øl daily concern; while, in
                    addition, he is expected to make himself acquainted with every phase of the
                    social life of the natives and with each natural aspect of the country. Besides
                    being a lawyer, an accountant, and a clerk, he ought also to possess no mean
                    knowledge of agriculture, political economy, and engineering.</p>
                <p>The total number of districts in British India is two hundred and thirty-eight.
                    They vary greatly in size and in number of inhabitants. The average area is 3778
                    square miles, ranging from an average of 6612 square miles in Madras to an
                    average of 1999 square miles in Oudh. The average population is 802,927,
                    similarly ranging from an average of 1,508,219 in Madras to an average of
                    161,597 in Burmah, The Madras districts are thus both the largest and tu« most
                    populous. In every province but Madras, the districts are grouped into larger
                    areas, known as divisions, each under the charge of a commissioner. But these
                    divisions are not properly units of administration, as the districts are. They
                    are aggregates of units, formed only for convenience of supervision, so that an
                    intermediate authority may exercise the universal watchfulness which would be
                    impossible for a distant lieutenant-governor. The districts are again
                    partitioned out into lesser tracts, which are strictly units of administration,
                    though subordinate ones. The system of partitioning, and also the nomenclature,
                    vary in the different provinces; but generally it may be said that the
                    subdivision or <hi rend="italic">tahsil</hi> is the ultimate unit of
                    administration. The double name indicates the twofold principle of separation:
                    the subdivision is properly the charge of an assistant magistrate or executive
                    officer, the <hi rend="italic">tahsil</hi> is the charge of a deputy-collector
                    or fiscal officer; and these two offices may or may not be in the same hands.
                    Broadly speaking, the subdivision is characteristic of Bengal, where revenue
                    duties are in the background, and the <hi rend="italic">tahsil</hi> of Madras,
                    where the land settlement requires attention year by year. There is no
                    administrative unit below the subdivision or <hi rend="italic">tahsil.</hi> The
                    <hi rend="italic">thdmd,</hi> or police division, only exists for police
                    purposes. The <hi rend="italic">pargand,</hi> or fiscal division under native
                    rule, has now but an historical interest. The village still remains as the
                    agricultural unit, and preserves its independence for revenue purposes in
                    certain parts of the country. The township is peculiar to Burmah.</p>
                <p>The judicial jurisdictions coincide for the most part with the magisterial and
                    fiscal boundaries. But, except in Madras, where the districts are large, a
                    single civil and sessions judge, <hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> the supreme
                    judicial officer under the high court, sometimes exercises jurisdiction over
                    more than one district. As has been already mentioned, in non-regulation
                    territory judicial and executive functions are combined in the same hands.</p>
                <p>The preceding sketch of Indian administration would be incomplete without a
                    reference to the secretariat, or central office, which in some sense controls
                    and gives life to the whole. From the secretariat are issued the orders which
                    regulate or modify the details of administration; into the secretariat come all
                    the multifarious reports from the local officers, to be there digested for
                    future reference. But though the secretaries may enjoy the advantages of life at
                    the presidency capitals, with higher salaries and better prospects of promotion,
                    it is recognized that the efficiency of the empire rests ultimately upon the
                    shoulders of the district officers, who bear the burden and heat of the day,
                    with few opportunities of winning fame or reward.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Land Settlement.—</hi> As the land furnishes the main source of
                    Indian revenue, so the assessment of the land tax is the main work of Indian
                    administration. No technical term is more familiar to Anglo-Indians, and none
                    more strange to the English public, than that of land settlement. No subject has
                    given rise to more voluminous controversy. It will be enough in this place to
                    explain the general principles upon which the system is based, and to indicate
                    the chief differences of application in the several provinces, That the state
                    should appropriate to itself a direct share in the produce of the soil is a
                    fundamental maxim of Indian finance, that has been recognized throughout the
                    East from time immemorial. The germs of rival systems can be traced in the old
                    military and other service tenures of Assam, and in the poll tax of Burmah,
                    &lt;kc. The exclusive development of the land system is due to two conditions,—a
                    comparatively high state of agriculture and an organized plan of
                    administration,—both of which are supplied by the primitive village community.
                    During the lapse of untold genera tions, despite domestic anarchy and foreign
                    conquest, the Hindu village has in many parts preserved its simple customs,
                    written in the imperishable tablets of tradition. The land was not held by
                    private owners, but by occupiers under <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit12newyrich/page/n793/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0912-0793-0770"/> the petty corporation; the revenue was not due
                    from individuals, but from the community represented by its headman. The
                    aggregate harvest of the village fields was thrown into a common fund, and
                    before the general distribution the head-man was bound to set aside the share of
                    the state. No other system of taxation could be theoretically more just, or in
                    practice less obnoxious to the people. Such is an outline of the land system as
                    it may be found at the present day throughout large portions of India both under
                    British and native rule; and such we may fancy it to have been universally
                    before the Mahometan conquest. The Musalmâns brought with them the avarice of
                    conquerors, and a stringent system of revenue collection. Under the Mughal
                    empire, as organized by Akbar the Great, the share of the state was fixed at
                    one-third of the gross produce of the soil; and a regular army of tax-collectors
                    was permitted to intervene between the cultivator and the supreme government.
                    The entire vocabulary of the present land system is borrowed from the Mughal
                    administration. The· <hi rend="italic">zaminddr</hi> himself is a creation of
                    the Mahometans, unknown to the early Hindu system. He was originally a mere
                    taxcollector, or farmer of the land revenue, who agreed to furnish a lump sum
                    from the tract of country assigned to him. If the Hindu village system may be
                    praised for its justice, the Mughal farming system had at least the merit of
                    efficiency. Shah Jâhân and Aurangzeb extracted a larger land revenue than the
                    British do. When the government was first undertaken by the East India Company,
                    no attempt was made to understand the social system upon which the land revenue
                    was based. The <hi rend="italic">zaminddr vfvs&gt;</hi> conspicuous and useful;
                    the village community and the cultivating <hi rend="italic">rayat</hi> did not
                    force themselves into notice. The <hi rend="italic">zaminddr</hi> seemed a
                    solvent person, capable of keeping a contract; and his official position as
                    tax-collector was confused with the proprietary rights of an English landlord.
                    The superior stability of the village system was overlooked, and in the old
                    provinces of Bengal and Madras the village organization has gradually been
                    suffered to fall into decay. The consistent aim of the British authorities has
                    been to establish private property in the soil, so far as is consistent with the
                    punctual payment of the revenue. The annual Government demand, like the
                    succession duty in England, is universally the first liability on the land; when
                    that is satisfied, the registered landholder has powers of sale or mortgage
                    scarcely more restricted than those of a tenant in fee-simple. At the same time
                    the possible hardships, as regards the cultivator, of this absolute right of
                    property vested in the owner have been anticipated by the recognition of
                    occupancy rights or fixity of tenure, under certain conditions. Legal rights are
                    everywhere taking the place of unwritten customs. Land, which was before merely
                    a source of livelihood to the cultivator and of revenue to the state, has now
                    become the subject of commercial speculation. The fixing of the revenue demand
                    has conferred upon the owner a credit which he never before possessed, by
                    allowing him a certain share of the unearned increment. This credit he may use
                    improvidently, but none the less has the land system of India been raised from a
                    lower to a higher stage of civilization.</p>
                <p>The means by which the land revenue is assessed is known as settlement, and the
                    assessor is styled a settlement officer. In Bengal the assessment has been
                    accomplished once and for all, but throughout the greater part of the rest of
                    India the process is continually going on. The details vary in the different
                    provinces; but, broadly speaking, a settlement may be described as the
                    ascertainment of the agricultural capacity of the land. Prior to the settlement
                    is the work of survey, which first determines the area of every village and
                    frequently of every field also. Then comes the settlement officer, whose duty it
                    is to estimate the character of the soil, the kind of crop, the opportunities
                    for irrigation, the means of communication and their probable development in the
                    future, and all other circumstances which tend to affect the value of the
                    produce. With these facts before him, he proceeds to assess the Government
                    demand upon the land according to certain general principles, which may vary in
                    the several provinces. The final result is a settlement report, which records,
                    as in a Domesday Book, the entire mass of agricultural statistics concerning the
                    district.</p>
                <p>Lower Bengal and a few adjoining districts of the North-Western Provinces and of
                    Madras have a permanent settlement, <hi rend="italic">i,e.,</hi> the land
                    revenue has been fixed in perpetuity. When the Company obtained the <hi
                    rend="italic">diwdni</hi> or financial administration of Bengal in 1765, the
                    theory of a settlement, as described above, was unknown. The existing Mahometan
                    system was adopted in its entirety. Engagements, sometimes yearly, sometimes for
                    a term of years, were entered into with the <hi rend="italic">zaminddrs</hi> to
                    pay a lump sum for the area over which they exercised control. If the offer of
                    the <hi rend="italic">zaminddr</hi> was not deemed satisfactory, another
                    contractor was substituted in his place. But no steps were taken, and perhaps no
                    steps were possible, to ascertain in detail the amount which the country could
                    afford to pay. For more than twenty years these temporary engagements continued,
                    and received the sanction of Warren Hastings, the first titular governor-general
                    of India. Hastings’s great rival, Francis, was among those who urged the
                    superior advantages of a permanent assessment. At last, in 1789, a more accurate
                    investigation into the agricultural resources of Bengal was commenced, and the
                    settlement based upon this investigation was declared perpetual by Lord
                    Cornwallis in 1793. The <hi rend="italic">zaminddrs</hi> of that time were
                    raised to the status of landlords, with rights of transfer and inheritance,
                    subject always to the payment in perpetuity of a rent-charge. In default of due
                    payment, their lands were liable to be sold to the highest bidder. The aggregate
                    assessment was fixed at <hi rend="italic">sikkd</hi> Rs. 26,800,989, equivalent
                    to Co.’s Rs. 28,587,722, or say 2∣ millions sterling. By the year 1871-72 the
                    total land revenue realized from the same area had increased to Rs. 35,208,866,
                    chiefly owing to the inclusion of estates which had escaped the original
                    assessment for various reasons. While the claim of Government against the <hi
                    rend="italic">zaminddrs</hi> was thus fixed for ever, it was intended that the
                    rights of the <hi rend="italic">zaminddrs</hi><hi rend="italic smallcaps">
                    ovqt</hi> their own tenants should be equally restricted. But no detailed record
                    of tenant-right was inserted in the settlement papers, and, as a matter of fact,
                    the cultivators lost rather than gained in security of tenure. The same English
                    prejudice which made a landlord of the <hi rend="italic">zaminddr</hi> could
                    recognize nothing but a tenant-at-will in the <hi rend="italic">rdyat.</hi> By
                    two stringent regulations of 1799 and 1812 the tenant was practically put at the
                    mercy of a rack-renting landlord. If he failed to pay his rent, however
                    excessive, his property was rendered liable to distraint and his person to
                    imprisonment. At the same time the operation of the revenue sale law had
                    introduced a new race of <hi rend="italic">zaminddr»,</hi> who were bound to
                    their tenants by no traditions of hereditary sympathy, but whose sole object was
                    to make a profit out of their newly purchased property. The rack-rented
                    peasantry found no protection in the law courts until 1859, when an Act was
                    passed which restricted the land-' lord’s powers of enhancement in certain
                    specified cases. The <hi rend="italic">zaminddr</hi> is the only person
                    recognized by the revenue law; but in a large number of cases the <hi
                    rend="italic">zaminddr</hi> has in effect parted with all his interest in the
                    land by means of the creation of perpetual leases or <hi rend="italic"
                    >patnis.</hi> These leases are usually granted in consideration of a premium or
                    lump sum paid down, and there is nothing to prevent the <hi rend="italic"
                    >patnidar</hi> from creating an indefinite series of sub-tenures beneath his
                    own. The permanent settlement was not preceded by any systematic survey. But in
                    the course of the past thirty years the whole of Bengal has been subject to a
                    professional survey, which determined the boundaries of every village, and
                    issued maps on the scale of 4 inches to the mile.</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit12newyrich/page/n794/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0912-0794-0771"/>
                <p>This survey, however, has only a topographical value. No statistical inquiries
                    were made, and no record obtained of rights in the soil. Even the village
                    landmarks then set up have fallen into decay.</p>
                <p>The permanent settlement was confined to the three provinces of Bengal, Behar,
                    and Orissa, according to their boundaries at that time. Orissa Proper, which was
                    conquered from the Marhattâs in 1803, is subject to a temporary settlement, of
                    which the current term of thirty years will not expire until 1897. The
                    assessment is identical with that fixed in 1838, which was based upon a careful
                    field measurement and upon an investigation into the rights of every landholder
                    and under-tenant. The settlement, however, was made with the landholder, and not
                    with the tenant, and in practice the rights of the cultivators are no more
                    secure than in Bengal. In Assam Proper, or the valley of the Brahmaputra, the
                    system of settlement is simple and effective. The cultivated area is
                    artificially divided into <hi rend="italic">mauzds</hi> or blocks, over each of
                    which is placed a native official or <hi rend="italic">mauzdddr.</hi> Every year
                    the <hi rend="italic">mauzdddr</hi> ascertains the area actually under
                    cultivation, and then assesses the fields according to their character, at a
                    certain prescribed rate.</p>
                <p>The prevailing system throughout the Madras presidency is the <hi rend="italic"
                    >rdyatwdri,</hi> which takes the cultivator or peasant proprietor as its
                    rent-paying unit, somewhat as the Bengal system takes the <hi rend="italic"
                    >zaminddr.</hi> This system cannot be called indigenous to the country, any more
                    than the <hi rend="italic">zaminddη</hi> of Bengal. If any system deserves that
                    name, it is that of village assessment, which still lingers in the memories of
                    the people in the south. When the British declared themselves heir to the nawâb
                    of the Carnatic at the opening of the present century, they had no adequate
                    experience of revenue management. The authorities in England favoured the <hi
                    rend="italic">zaminddri</hi> system already at work in Bengal, which appeared at
                    least calculated to secure punctual payment. The Madras Government was
                    accordingly instructed to enter into permanent engagements with <hi
                    rend="italic">zaminddrs,</hi> and, where no <hi rend="italic">zaminddrs</hi>
                    could be found, to create substitutes out of enterprising contractors. The
                    attempt resulted in failure in every case, except where the <hi rend="italic"
                    >zaminddrs</hi> happened to be the representatives of ancient lines of powerful
                    chiefs. Several of such chiefs exist in the extreme south and in the north of
                    the presidency. Their estates have been guaranteed to them on payment of a <hi
                    rend="italic">peshkash</hi> or permanent tribute, and are saved by the custom of
                    primogeniture from the usual fate of subdivision. Throughout the rest of Madras
                    there are no <hi rend="italic">zaminddrs</hi> either in name or fact. The
                    influence of Sir Thomas Munro afterwards led to the adoption of the <hi
                    rend="italic">rdyatwdri</hi> system, which will always be associated with his
                    name. According to this system, an assessment is made with the cultivating
                    proprietor upon the land taken up for cultivation year by year. Neither <hi
                    rend="italic">zaminddr</hi> nor village officer intervenes between the
                    cultivator and the state, which takes directly upon its own shoulders all a
                    landlord’s responsibility. The early <hi rend="italic">rdyatwdri</hi>
                    settlements in Madras were based upon insufficient experience. They were
                    preceded by no survey, but adopted the crude estimates of native officials.
                    Since 1858 a department of revenue survey has been organized, and the old
                    assessments have been everywhere revised.</p>
                <p>Nothing can be more complete in theory and more difficult of exposition, than a
                    Madras <hi rend="italic">ràyatwdrî</hi> settlement. First, the entire area of
                    the district, whether cultivated or uncultivated, and of each field within the
                    district is accurately measured. The next step is to calculate the estimated
                    produce of each field, having regard to every kind of both natural and
                    artificial advantage. Lastly, a rate is fixed upon every field, which may be
                    regarded as roughly equal to one-third of the gross and one-half of the net
                    produce. The elaborate nature of these inquiries and calculations may be
                    inferred from the fact that as many as thirty-five different rates are sometimes
                    struck for a single district, ranging from 6d. to <hi rend="italic">£1,</hi> 4s.
                    per acre. The rates thus ascertained are fixed for a term of thirty years; but
                    during that period the aggregate rent-roll of a district is liable to be
                    affected by several considerations. New land may be taken up for cultivation, or
                    old land may be abandoned; and occasional remissions are permitted under no less
                    than eighteen specified heads. Such matters are discussed and decided by the
                    collector at <hi rend="italic">the jamahandi</hi> or court held every year for
                    definitely ascertaining the amount of revenue to be paid by each <hi
                    rend="italic">ràyat</hi> for the current season. This annual inquiry has
                    sometimes been mistake⅛by careless passers-by for an annual reassessment of each
                    <hi rend="italic">rdyat’s</hi> holding. It is not, however, a change in the
                    rates for the land which he already holds, but an inquiry into and record of the
                    changes in his former holding or of any new land which he may wish to take
                    up.</p>
                <p>In the early days of British rule no system whatever prevailed throughout the
                    Bombay presidency; and even at the present time there are tracts where something
                    of the old confusion survives. The modern “survey tenure,” as it is called,
                    dates from 1838, when it was first introduced into one of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >tdlukas</hi> of Poona district, and it has since been gradually extended over
                    the greater part of the presidency. As its name implies, the settlement is
                    preceded by survey. Each field is measured, and an assessment placed upon it
                    according to the quality of the soil and the crop. This assessment holds good,
                    without any possibility of modification, for a term of thirty years. The average
                    rate varies from a maximum of 4s. 6d. an acre in the rich black soil lands of
                    Guzerat to a minimum of lOd. an acre in the barren hills of the Concan.</p>
                <p>The primary characteristic of the Bombay system is its simplicity. The field is
                    the unit., and its actual occupier is the only person recognized by the revenue
                    law. He knows exactly what he will have to pay, and the state knows what it will
                    receive, during the currency of the term. The assessment is, in fact, a
                    rent-charge liable to be modified at intervals of thirty years. Secondly, the
                    system is characterized by its fairness to the tenant. He possesses “a
                    transferable and heritable property, continuable without question at the
                    expiration of a settlement lease, on his consenting to the revised rate.” To
                    borrow a metaphor from English law, his position has been raised from that of a
                    villein to that of a copyholder. In exchange for the mere leave to exist and
                    till the soil he has received a right of property in the soil he tills, and he
                    stands forth a free man. If the Bombay peasants have not reaped all the
                    advantages from this system that might have been hoped for, the fault rests, not
                    with the system, but with themselves. They were unequal to the responsibilities
                    of property which they had not won by their own exertions, but which the state
                    (perhaps prematurely) cast upon them.</p>
                <p>The North-Western Provinces and the Punjab have a similar land system. In that
                    part of India the village community has preserved its integrity more completely
                    than elsewhere. Government therefore recognizes the village, and not the <hi
                    rend="italic">zaminddr's</hi> estate or the <hi rend="italic">rdyat's</hi>
                    field, as the unit of land administration. Throughout the North Western
                    Provinces, indeed, the village is commonly owned by proprietors with the title
                    of <hi rend="italic">zaminddrs</hi> whereas in the Punjab the community is still
                    the proprietor. But this is a distinction of tenure rather than of
                    administration. In both cases alike the state recognizes only the village, and
                    makes its arrangement with the owners of the village, whether they be one or
                    many, whether they be individuals, a corporation, or a <hi rend="italic"
                    >bhdydchdra</hi> (brotherhood). The survey there becomes a more comprehensive
                    undertaking than in Madras or Bombay. In addition to measurement, and
                    agricultural appraisement and calculation, it includes the duty of drawing up an
                    exhaustive record of all rights and sub-tenures existing in every village. The
                    proprietors are alone responsible for the revenue; but, when the state limits
                    its claims against them, it is no less careful to define at the same time the
                    rights of other parties interested in the soil. The term of settlement both in
                    the NorthWestern Provinces and in the Punjab is thirty years. The principle of
                    assessment is that the Government revenue shall be equal to one-half of the
                    improved rent, leaving the other half as the share of the landlord, who is
                    liable for due payment, and has the trouble of collecting it from the <pb
                    break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit12newyrich/page/n795/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0912-0795-0772"/> cultivators. The average rate of assessment is
                    about 2s. lid. per acre in the North-Western Provinces, and Is. 4d. in the
                    Punjab.</p>
                <p>The Oudh <hi rend="italic">talukdärs</hi> resemble English landlords even more
                    closely than do the <hi rend="italic">zamindärs</hi> of Bengal. In origin the
                    majority were not revenue-farmers, but territorial magnates, whose influence was
                    derived from feudal authority as much as from mere wealth. Their present legal
                    status dates from the pacification that followed on the mutiny of 1857. The
                    engagement then entered into has been described as a political treaty rather
                    than a revenue assessment. The great <hi rend="italic">tdlukdars</hi> were
                    invited to become responsible each for a gross sum payable from the territory
                    over which he exercised feudal rights. This sum was fixed in perpetuity; and the
                    exceptional position of the <hi rend="italic">talukdars</hi> was recognized by
                    conferring upon them, not only the right of succession by primogeniture, but
                    also the privilege of bequest,—a privilege unknown alike to Hindu and Mahometan
                    law. Land not comprised in <hi rend="italic">tdlukdarι</hi> estates was settled
                    in the ordinary way with its proprietors or <hi rend="italic">zaminddrs</hi> for
                    a term of thirty years. The whole of Oudh has since been accurately
                    surveyed.</p>
                <p>The Central Provinces contain many varieties of land tenure, from the
                    feudatories, who pay only a light tribute, to the village communities, who are
                    assessed in the usual manner after survey. Population is sparse and agriculture
                    backward, so that the incidence of land revenue is everywhere low. The survey
                    was conducted generally on the Punjab system, adopting the village and not the
                    field as the unit of measurement. The current settlement for a term of thirty
                    years will expire in 1897.</p>
                <p>' In 1873-74 the total land revenue realized from territory under British
                    administration in India amounted to £20,919,256, which is raised to £22,768,144
                    by the inclusion of certain local rates and cesses levied on land. This latter
                    figure shows an average of 9 ’ 4d. per acre of gross area and 2s. 4 <hi
                    rend="superscript"> -</hi> 7d. per head of total population. The highest rate of
                    assessment appears to be that in Bombay, which is 3s. 10 ’ 4d. per head; the
                    lowest, Is. 2 ’ 7d. per head in Bengal and Assam.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Salt Administration.—</hi> Next to land, salt contributes the
                    largest share to the Indian revenue; and, where salt is locally manufactured,
                    its supervision becomes an important part of administrative duty. Up to within
                    quite recent times the tax levied upon salt varied extremely in different parts
                    of the country, and a strong preventive staff was required to be stationed along
                    a continuous barrier hedge, which almost cut the peninsula into two fiscal
                    sections. The reform of Sir J. Strachey in 1878, by which the higher rates were
                    reduced and the lower rates raised, with a view to their ultimate equalization
                    over the whole country, effectually abolished this old engine of oppression.
                    Communication is now free; and it has been found that prices are absolutely
                    lowered by thus bringing the consumer nearer to his market, even though the rate
                    of taxation be increased. In the Punjab and Râjputâna salt administration has
                    thus become, as in Lower Bengal, a simple matter of weighing quantities and
                    levying a uniform tax. In Bombay, also, the manufacture is now conducted with a
                    minimum of expense at large central dépôts in Guzerat under a thorough system of
                    excise supervision. Along the western coast, however, from Orissa to Cape
                    Comorin, the process of evaporating sea-water is everywhere carried on as a
                    private industry, though on Government account. As with poppy cultivation in
                    Bengal, the manufacture of salt is a monopoly, which can only be defended by the
                    peculiar circumstances of the case. No one is compelled to manufacture, and
                    rights of property in a salt-pan are strictly respected, while the state
                    contrives, by means of a careful staff of supervisors, to obtain the maximum of
                    profit with a minimum of interference. The system as at present carried on has
                    been gradually developed out of the experience of nearly a century. The
                    manufacturers belong to the same class as ordinary cultivators; and, as a rule,
                    their condition is somewhat more prosperous, for they possess an hereditary
                    privilege with a commercial value. They do not work upon a system of advances,
                    as is the case with so many other Indian industries; but they are paid at a
                    certain rate when they bring their salt to the Government dépôt. This rate of
                    payment, known as <hi rend="italic">kudivaram,</hi> is at present fixed at an
                    average of 1 <hi rend="italic">dnna</hi> 5 ’ 8 <hi rend="italic">pies</hi> per
                    <hi rend="italic">maund</hi> of 82γ ft&gt;; the other expenses of the salt
                    department, for supervision, &amp;c., raise the total cost to 3 <hi
                    rend="italic">dnnds</hi> 5 ’ 6 <hi rend="italic">pies</hi> per <hi rend="italic"
                    >maund.</hi> The price now charged to the consumer by the Madras Government is
                    Rs. 2.8.0 per <hi rend="italic">maund,</hi> the balance being net profit. The
                    equal rate of salt duty which will ultimately prevail throughout all India is
                    Rs. 2.8.0 per <hi rend="italic">maund,</hi> or 7s. a cwt. This rate is already
                    (1881) levied in Madras, Bombay, the North-Western Provinces, and the Punjab,
                    but in Bengal a higher rate is provisionally in force of Rs. 2.14.0 per <hi
                    rend="italic">maund,</hi> or 8s. a cwt. In British Burmah only 3 <hi
                    rend="italic">dnnds</hi> per <hi rend="italic">maund,</hi> or 6d. a cwt., is
                    charged for local consumption, and a transit duty of 1 per cent, <hi
                    rend="italic">ad valorem</hi> for salt sent across the frontier.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Excise.—</hi> Excise, like salt, is not only a department of
                    revenue collection, but also to a great extent a branch of the executive. In
                    other words, excise duties in India are not a mere tax upon lhe consumer, levied
                    for convenience through the manufacturer and retail dealer, but a species of
                    Government monopoly. The only excisable articles are intoxicants and drugs; and
                    the avowed object of the state is to check consumption not less than to raise
                    revenue. Details vary in the different provinces, but the general plan of
                    administration is the same. The right to manufacture and the right to retail are
                    both monopolies of Government permitted to private individuals only upon terms.
                    Distillation of country spirits is allowed according to two systems,—either to
                    the highest bidder under strict supervision, or only upon certain spots set
                    apart for the purpose. The latter is known as the <hi rend="italic">sαdr</hi> or
                    central distillery system. The right of sale is also usually farmed out to the
                    highest bidder, subject to regulations fixing the minimum quantity of liquor
                    that may be sold at one time. The brewing of beer from rice and other grains,
                    which is universal among the hill tribes and other aboriginal races, is
                    practically untaxed and unrestrained. The European breweries recently
                    established at several hill stations pay a tax at the rate of 6d. a gallon.
                    Apart from spirits, excise duties are levied upon the sale of a number of
                    intoxicating or stimulant drugs, of which the most important are opium and <hi
                    rend="italic">gàvjà</hi> or <hi rend="italic">bhang.·</hi> Opium is issued for
                    local consumption in India from the Government manufactories at Patna and
                    Benares, and sold through private retailers at a monopoly price. This drug is
                    chiefly consumed in Assam, Burmah, and the Punjab. <hi rend="italic">Gdnjd</hi>
                    is an intoxicating preparation made from the flowers and leaves of Indian hemp
                    <hi rend="italic">(Cannabis</hi><hi rend="italic">sativa,</hi> var. <hi
                    rend="italic">indica).</hi> The cultivation of hemp for this purpose is almost
                    confined to a limited area in Rajshahi district, Bengal, and to the farther
                    valleys of the Himalayas, whence the drug is imported under the name of <hi
                    rend="italic">charas.</hi> Its abuse is sometimes a cause, not only of crime,
                    but also of insanity. Government attempts to ch&lt; ck consumption—first, by
                    fixing the retail duty at the highest rate that will not encourage smuggling,
                    and, secondly, by continually raising that rate as experience allows.
                    Scientifically speaking, <hi rend="italic">gdnjd</hi> consists of the flowering
                    and fruiting heads of the female plant; <hi rend="italic">bhang</hi> or <hi
                    rend="italic">siddhi,</hi> of the dried leaves and small stalks, with a few
                    fruits; while <hi rend="italic">charas</hi> is the resin itself, collected in
                    various ways as it naturally exudes. No duty whatever is now levied upon tobacco
                    in any part of India. The plant is universally grown by the cultivators for
                    their own smoking, and, like everything else, was subject to taxation under
                    native rule; but the impossibility of accurate excise supervision has caused the
                    British Government to abandon the impost.</p>
                <p>The municipalities at present existing in India are a creation of the legislature
                    and a branch of the general system of administration. Their origin is to be
                    traced, not in the native <hi rend="italic">panchdyat,</hi> but in the necessity
                    for relieving the district officer of some of the details of his woιk. The <hi
                    rend="italic">panchdyat</hi> or elective council of five is one of the
                    institutions most deeply rooted in the Hindu mind. By it the village community
                    was governed, the head-man being only the executive official, not the legislator
                    or judge; by it all caste dis putes were settled; by it traders and merchants
                    were organized into powerful guilds, to the rules of which even European
                    outsiders have had to submit; by it the Sikh army of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >khdlsd</hi> was despotically governed, when the centralized system of Ranjit

                    xml:id="kp-eb0912-0796-0773"/> at his death. But the Hindu village organization
                    had been greatly broken up under Mughal rule. The modern municipal committee is
                    a body appointed by Government, on the nomination of the collector, to assist
                    iιi∣∣&gt; in the discharge of his local duties, and to assess new modes of
                    taxation. Police, roads, and sanitation are the three main objects for which a
                    municipality is constituted. Outside a municipality these objects are (in
                    different provinces) the care of the collector, of some member of his
                    subordinate staff, or of a local fund board. Within municipal limits they are
                    delegated to a committee, who practically derive their authority from the
                    collector’s sanction, implied or expressed. Except in the great towns, the
                    municipalities cannot be said to enjoy any of the attributes of corporate life.
                    However, as education advances, and with it the desire and capacity of
                    self-government, the municipal committee will doubtless form the germ from which
                    free local institutions will in the future be developed. In 1876-77, excluding
                    the three presidency capitals, there were altogether 894 municipalities in
                    British India, with 12,381,059 inhabitants, or just 7 per cent, of the total
                    population. Out of an aggregate number of 7519 members of municipal committees
                    concerning whom information is available, 1794 were Europeans and 5725 natives;
                    1863 were <hi rend="italic">ex-officio,</hi> 4512 nominated, and 1144
                    elected,—the last class being almost confined to the North-Western and Central
                    Provinces. The financial statistics of these municipalities are given in a
                    subsequent section.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Imperial Finance.—</hi> It is impossible to present a concise
                    view ' of Indian finance, such as shall be at once accurate and
                    intelligible.</p>
                <p>In the first place, the aggregate figures of revenue and expenditure are
                    officially returned according to a system which, though necessary for purposes
                    of account, usually misleads the English financier. T ie whole system of
                    administration is based upon the view that the British power is a paternal
                    despotism, which owns, in a certain sense, the entire soil of the country, and
                    whose duty it is to perform the various functions of a wealthy and enlightened
                    proprietor. In addition, it takes on itself the business of a manufacturer and
                    trader on a grand scale, as in the case of opium and salt. All these
                    considerations tend to swell the totals on both sides of the balance-sheet with
                    large items, which, on strict analysis, ought to be eliminated as mere matters
                    of account. The actual taxation on the people of British India for 1878, as will
                    be shown below, was 34f millions, or under 3s. 8d. per head of the population.
                    In the second place, the methods of keeping the public accounts have been
                    subjected to frequent changes during recent years, to such an extent as to
                    render comparative statements of totals valueless.</p>
                <p>The following table, which has been compiled from the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Parliamentary Abstract for</hi> 1877-78, exhibits the gross imperial revenue
                    and expenditure of India for that year, according to the system of accounts
                    adopted at the time. For the reasons already given, it is practically impossible
                    to analyse these statements in such a way as to show the actual amount raised by
                    taxation, and the actual amount returned in protection to person and property.
                    It is equally impossible to compare the totals with those for previous years.
                    The only profitable plan is to take some of the items and explain their real
                    meaning.</p>

                <p><hi rend="italic">Revenue.—</hi> It will be seen from the above statement that
                    the larger portion of the gross revenue is not derived from taxation at all.
                    Public works, including railways, alone yield about 7.⅛ millions sterling, or
                    nearly 13 per cent, of the total. If we add the items of post office and
                    telegraphs, which also represent payment for work done or services supplied, the
                    proportion rises to nearly 14 per cent. Then the sum of 9 millions gross, or 6⅜
                    millions net, derived , <hi rend="superscript"> 01</hi> P <hi rend="superscript"
                    > 0</hi> pium, being somewhat more than an additional 15 per cent, of the gross
                    revenue, is admitted to be no charge upon the native tax-payer, but a voluntary
                    contribution to the Indian exchequer by the Chinese consumer of the drug. Nearly
                    one-third of the total gross revenue is thus accounted for. The land revenue,
                    amounting to just 20 millions in an exceptionally bad year, cannot be passed
                    over so lightly. Whether it should be properly regarded as a tax, or only as
                    rent, is an abstruse problem for political economists to settle; but, in any
                    case, it is paid without question, as an immemorial perquisite of the state. It
                    yields 34 per cent, or more than one-third of the gross revenue. The importance
                    of the land tax from the point of view of administration has been considered in
                    a previous section. Setting aside provincial rates and assessed taxes as
                    insignificant in theiι∙ amount and variable in their incidence, we are left with
                    four principal headings,—excise, customs, salt, and stamps,—which together
                    constitute the indisputable taxation of the people. The total amount yielded by
                    these four items is just 14$ millions, being nearly 25 per cent., or one-fourth
                    of the whole. Salt alone yields 6⅜ millions, or 11 per cent. On the total
                    population of 191 millions, the gross revenue of 59 millions shows an incidence
                    of 6s. 2 jd. per head. The land tax alone shows an incidence of 2s. l∣d. per
                    head, the four taxes proper of Is. 61d. per head. The whole revenue of British
                    India of the nature ot actual taxation, including land revenue, excise, assessed
                    taxes, provincial rates, customs, salt, and stamps, amounted in 1878 to
                    £34,883,586, or 3s. 7∣d, per head. The rate was about 4s. per head in 1880.</p>
                <p>Of the four items, excise and stamps are both almost entirely creations of
                    British rule. Excise is simply a tax upon intoxicating liquors and deleterious
                    drugs, levied both on the manufacture and on the sale, according to different
                    systems in different provinces. Like the corresponding duty in England, it is
                    voluntarily incurred, and presses hardest upon the lowest classes. But, unlike
                    the English excise, it can hardly be called an elastic source of revenue, for
                    the rate is intentionally kept so high as to discourage consumption. No duty
                    whatever is levied upon tobacco. Stamps, as in England, is an ambiguous item.
                    The greater part is derived from fees on litigation, and only a comparatively
                    trifling amount from stamps proper on deeds of transfer, &amp;c. Customs are
                    divided into import and export duties, both of which have been so greatly
                    lightened in recent years that their permanent maintenance must be considered
                    doubtful. At the present time (1881) import duties, usually at the rate of 5 per
                    cent, <hi rend="italic">ad valorem,</hi> are levied upon a comparatively long
                    list of commodities, of which the chief are cotton goods above a certain degree
                    of fineness. All duties on exports have now been removed, with the single
                    exception of that on rice, which brings in about £500,000 a year. That is levied
                    at the rate of 3 <hi rend="italic">ànnds</hi> a <hi rend="italic">maund,</hi> or
                    about 6d. per cwt., being equivalent to an <hi rend="italic">ad valorem</hi>
                    rate of about 10 per cent. India, including Burmah, possesses a practical
                    monopoly of the supply of rice to Europe, and therefore the tax falls upon the
                    consumer· rather than upon the native producer. The salt tax is a matter of more
                    importance and of greater difficulty. As an impost upon an article of prime
                    necessity, and as falling with greatest severity upon the lowest classes, it
                    violates the elementary rules of political economy. On the other hand, it may be
                    urged that this tax is familiar to the people, and levied in a manner which
                    arouses no discontent, and that it is the only means available of spreading
                    taxation proper over the community. Recent reforms have tended to equalize the
                    incidence of the salt tax over the entire country, with the immediate result of
                    abolishing arbitrary and vexatious customs lines, and with a view to its
                    ultimate reduction.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Expenditure^—</hi> Putting aside the cost of collection and
                    civil administration, which explainthemselves, the most important items of
                    expenditure are army, interest on debt, famine relief, loss by exchange, and
                    public works, to which may be added the complex item of payments in England.
                    Military expenditure averages fully 16 millions a year, being thus considerably
                    more than the whole amount obtained from taxation proper. Of this total, about
                    12 millions represent payments in India, and 4 millions payments in England; On
                    non-effective services nearly 2 millions are expended in England and less than
                    £700,000 in India. Regimental pay accounts for nearly 7 millions, the
                    commissariat for about 2 millions in India, and stores for another million in
                    England. In 1877-78 the total capital of the Indian debt was returned at over
                    146$ millions sterling, being just 15s. 4d. per head of the population. The
                    total charge for interest was 5 millions, being at the rate of £3, 14s. 4d. per
                    cent.; but this excludes the interest to be credited against expenditure on
                    reproductive public works, which is entered under another heading. In 1840 the
                    debt amounted to only 30 millions, but it gradually increased to 52 millions in
                    1857. Then came the Mutiny, which added 42 millions of debt in four years. The
                    rate of increase was again gradual but slow till about 1874, when famine relief
                    conspired with public works to cause a rapid augmentation, which has continued
                    to the present time. The most significant feature in that augmentation is the
                    larger proportion of debt contracted in England. During the last ten years the
                    silver debt has risen only 10 millions, whereas the gold debt has risen 28
                    millions. No charge has recently pressed harder upon the Indian, exchequer than
                    that of famine relief. Apart from loss by reduced revenue, the two famines of
                    1874 and 1877-78 have caused a direct expenditure one haritable and relief
                    works, amounting in the aggregate to nearly 15 millions. Loss by exchange is an
                    item whichnaβ <pb break="no"

                    is due to the circumstance that large payments in gold require to be made in
                    England by means of the depreciated rupee. It is, of course, not a matter of
                    expenditure proper, but merely the result of a peculiar mode of book-keeping,
                    which estimates the rupee at the arbitrary value of 2s. In 1869-70 the loss by
                    exchange was more than balanced by an equally nominal entry of gain by exchange
                    on the other side of the ledger. In 1876-77 this item attained its maximum of
                    nearly 1J million net. The expenditure on public works is provided from three
                    sources—(1) the capital of private companies, with a Government guarantee, (2)
                    loans for the construction of railways and canals, (3) current revenue applied
                    towards such works as are considered to be not directly remunerative. In 1877-78
                    the total capital raised by the guaranteed railway companies was 95⅜ millions,
                    and the net earnings were 5 millions, thus showing on the average a satisfactory
                    balance-sheet. In the ten years ending with 1878 29 millions were expended under
                    the second head upon works classed as reproductive or extraordinary, of which 19
                    millions were appropriated to state railways and 10 millions to irrigation. The
                    amount spent from revenue upon ordinary public works in 1877-78 was nearly 3∣
                    millions. The division of the expenditure into that paid in India and that paid
                    in England becomes of importance when it is remembered that the latter portion
                    requires to be provided in gold. In 1877-78, out of the total expenditure of 62⅛
                    millions, 48.∣ millions, or 78 per cent., were paid in India, and 14 millions,
                    or 22 per cent., in England, including the guaranteed interest of the
                    railway.companies.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Local Finance.—</hi> Independent of imperial finance, and
                    likewise independent of certain sums annually transferred from the imperial
                    exchequer to be expended by the provincial governments, there is another Indian
                    budget for local revenue and expenditure. That consists of an income derived
                    mainly from cesses upon land, and expended to a great extent upon minor public
                    works. In 1877—78 local revenue and expenditure were each returned at about 3⅜
                    millions.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Municipal Finance.—</hi> Yet a third budget is that belonging
                    to the municipalities. The three presidency towns of Calcutta, Madras, and
                    Bombay had in 1876-77 a total municipal income of £668,400, of which £519,322.
                    was derived from taxation, being at the rate of 7s. per head of population. In
                    addition, there were 894 minor municipalities, with a total population of
                    12,381,059. Their aggregate income was £1,246,974, of which £979,088 was derived
                    from taxation, being at the rate of Is. 7d. per head. In the presidency towns,
                    rates upon houses, &amp;c., are the chief source of income; but in the district
                    municipalities, excepting Bengal, octroi duties are more relied upon. On the
                    side of expenditure the chief items are conservancy, roads, and police.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Army.—</hi> At the present time (1881) the entire constitution
                    of the Indian army is under the consideration of a commission. The existing
                    organization is based upon the historical division into the three Ïresidencies
                    of Bengal, Madras and Bombay There are still three ndian armies, each composed
                    of both European and native troops, with their own commanders-in-chief and
                    separate staff, though the commander-in-chief in Bengal exercises a supreme
                    authority over the other two. There is also a fourth army, known as the Punjab
                    frontier force, which, though on the Bengal establishment, is under the
                    immediate orders of the lieutenant-governor of the province.</p>

                    police of all kinds in British India in 1877 consisted of a total strength of
                    157,999 officers and men, being an average of one policeman to every 7∣ square
                    miles of total area or to every 1096 of the total population. The total cost of
                    maintenance was £2,511,704, of which £2,165,073 was payable from imperial or
                    provincial revenues. The former figure gives an average cost of £3 per square
                    mile of area and 3d. per head of population. The average pay of ∙ach constable
                    was 7 rupees a month, or £8, 8s. a year.</p>

                    in British India, including central and district jails and lock-ups, was 636;
                    the total number of prisoners admitted during the year, or remaining over from
                    the previous year, was 587,288; the daily average was 118,456—113,087 males and
                    5369 females. These figures show 1 male prisoner to every 868 of the male

                    prisoner to every 1618 of the total population of both sexes. The Ïlaces of
                    transportation for all British India are the Andaman and Γicobar Islands, where
                    there are two penal establishments; these βontained in 1877 a daily average of
                    9145 convicts.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Education.</hi></p>
                <p>The existing system of education in India is mainly dependent upon the
                    Government, being directly organized by the state, at least in its higher
                    departments, assisted throughout by grants-in-aid, and under careful inspection.
                    But at no period of its history has India been an altogether unenlightened
                    country. The origin of the Deva-Nâgari alphabet is lost in antiquity, though
                    that is generally admitted not to be of indigenous invention. Inscriptions on
                    stone and copper, the palm-leaf records of the temples, and in later days the
                    wide-spread manufacture of paper, all alike indicate, not only the general
                    knowledge, but also the common use, of the art of writing. From the earliest
                    times the caste of Brâhmans has preserved, by oral tradition as well as in MSS.,
                    a literature unrivalled alike in its antiquity and in the intellectual subtlety
                    of its contents. The Mahometan invaders introduced the profession of the
                    historian, which reached a high degree of excellence, even as compared with
                    contemporary Europe. Through all changes of government vernacular instruction in
                    its simplest form has always been given, at least to the children of respectable
                    classes, in every large village. On the one hand, the <hi rend="italic"
                    >tols</hi> or seminaries for teaching Sanskrit philosophy at Benares and Nadiyâ
                    recall the schools of Athens and Alexandria; on the other, the importance
                    attached to instruction in accounts reminds us of the picture which Horace has
                    left of a Roman education. Even at the present day knowledge of reading and
                    writing is, owing to the teaching of Buddhist monks, as widely diffused
                    throughout Burmah as it is in some countries of Europe. English efforts to
                    stimulate education have ever been most successful when based upon the existing
                    indigenous institutions.</p>
                <p>During the early days of the East India Company’s rule the promotion of education
                    was not recognized as a duty of Government. The enlightened mind of Warren
                    Hastings did indeed anticipate his age by founding the Calcutta <hi
                    rend="italic">madrasa</hi> for Mahometan teaching, and by affording steady
                    patronage alike to Hindu <hi rend="italic">pandits</hi> and European students.
                    But Wellesley’s schemes of imperial dominion did not extend beyond the
                    establishment of a college for English officials. Of the Calcutta colleges, that
                    of Sanskrit was founded in 1824, when Lord Amherst was governor-general, the
                    medical college by Lord William Bentinck in 1835, the Hooghly <hi rend="italic"
                    >madrasa</hi> by a wealthy native gentleman in 1836. The Sanskrit college at
                    Benares had been established in 1791, the Agra college in 1823. Meanwhile the
                    missionaries made the field of vernacular education their own. Discouraged by
                    the official authorities, and ever liable to banishment or deportation, they not
                    only devoted themselves with courage to their special work of evangelization,
                    but were also the first to study the vernacular dialects spoken by the common
                    people. Just as two centuries earlier the Jesuits at Madura, in the <pb
                    break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit12newyrich/page/n798/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0912-0798-0775"/> extreme south, composed works in Tamil, which are
                    still acknowledged as classical by native authors, so did the Baptist mission at
                    Serampur, near Calcutta, first raise Bengali to the rank of a literary dialect.
                    The interest of the missionaries in education, which has never ceased to the
                    present day, though now comparatively overshadowed by Government activity, had
                    two distinct aspects. They studied the vernacular, in order to reach the people
                    by their preaching and to translate the Bible; and they taught English, as the
                    channel of non-sectarian learning.</p>
                <p>At last the Government awoke to its own responsibility in the matter of
                    education, after the long and acrimonious controversy between the advocates of
                    English and vernacular teaching had worn itself out. The present system dates
                    from 1854, being based upon a comprehensive despatch sent out by Sir C. Wood
                    (afterwards Lord Halifax) in that year. At that time the three universities were
                    founded at Calcutta, Madras, and Bombay; English-teaching schools were
                    established in every district; the benefit of grants-in-aid was extended to the
                    lower vernacular institutions and to girls’ schools; and public instruction was
                    erected into a department of the administration in every province, under a
                    director, with a staff of inspectors. In some respects this scheme may have been
                    in advance of the time; but it supplied a definite outline, which has gradually
                    been filled up with each succeeding year of progress. A network of schools has
                    now been spread over the country, graduated from the indigenous village
                    institutions up to the highest colleges. All alike receive some measure of
                    pecuniary support, which is justified by the guarantee of regular inspection;
                    and a series of scholarships at once stimulates efficiency and opens a path to
                    the university for children of the poor. In 1877-78 the total number of
                    educational institutions of all sorts in British India was G6,202, attended by
                    an aggregate of 1,877,942 pupils, showing an average of one school to every 14
                    square miles, and nine pupils to every thousand of the population. In the same
                    year the total expenditure upon education from all sources was £1,612,775, of
                    which £782,240 was contributed by the provincial governments, £258,514 was
                    derived from local rates, and £32,008 from municipal grants. These items may be
                    said to represent state aid, while end owments yielded £37,218, subscriptions
                    £105,853, and fees and fines £277,039. The degree in which education has been
                    popularized and private effort has been stimulated may be estimated from the
                    fact that in Bengal the total of voluntary payments now exactly balances the
                    total of Government grants.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Universities.—</hi> The three universities of Calcutta, Madras,
                    and Bombay were incorporated in 1857, on the model of the university of London.
                    They are merely examining bodies, composed of a chancellor, vice-chancellor, and
                    senate, with the privilege of conferring degrees in arts, law, medicine, and
                    civil engineering. The governing body, or syndicate, consists of the
                    vice-chancellor and certain members of the senate. Quite recently a fourth
                    university, on the same plan, has been founded at Lahore for the Punjab. Though
                    not themselves places of instruction, the universities control the whole course
                    of higher education by means of their examinations. The entrance examination for
                    matriculation is open to all; but when that is passed candidates for higher
                    stages must enrol themselves in one or other of the affiliated colleges. In the
                    ten years ending 1877-78 9686 candidates successfully passed the entrance
                    examination at Calcutta, 6381 at Madras, and 2610 at Bombay. Many fall off at
                    that stage, and very few’ proceed to the higher degrees. During the same ten
                    years 952 graduated B. Λ., and only 254 Μ. A., with honours, at Calcutta; 496
                    B.A. and 14 Μ. A. at Madras; 217 B.A. and 28 Μ. A. at Bombay. Calcutta possesses
                    by far the majority of graduates in law and medicine, while Bombay is similarly
                    distinguished in engineering. In 1877—78 the total expenditure on the four
                    universities was £22,093.</p>
                <p>The colleges or institutions for higher instruction may be divided into two
                    classes,—those which teach the arts course of the universities, and those
                    devoted to special branches of knowledge. According to another principle, they
                    are classified into those entirely supported by Government and those which only
                    receive grants-in-aid. The latter class comprises the missionary colleges. In
                    1877-78 the total number of colleges, including medical and engineering colleges
                    and Mahometan <hi rend="italic">madrasas,</hi> was 82, attended by 8894
                    students. Of these, 35 colleges with 3848 students were in Bengal proper, and 21
                    colleges with 1448 students in Madras. In the same year the total expenditure on
                    the colleges was £186,162, or at the rate of £21 per student.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Boys' Schools.—</hi> This large class includes many varieties,
                    which may be subdivided either according to the character of the instruction.
                    givem or according to the proportion of Government aid they receive. The higher
                    schools are those in which not only is English taught, but that language is also
                    the medium of instruction. They educate up to the standard of the entrance
                    examination at the universities, and train generally those candidates who seek
                    employment in the upper grades of Government service. As far as possible one of
                    these schools, known as the <hi rend="italic">zild</hi> or district school, is
                    established by Government at the head-quarters of every district, and many
                    others receive grants-in-aid. The middle schools, as their name implies, are
                    intermediate between the higher and the primary schools. Generally speaking,
                    they are placed in the smaller towns and larger villages, and they provide that
                    measure of instruction which is recognized to be useful by the middle classes
                    themselves. Some of them teach English, but others only the vernacular. This
                    class includes the <hi rend="italic">tahsili</hi> schools, established at the
                    headquarters of every <hi rend="italic">tahsil</hi> or subdivision in the
                    North-Western Provinces. In 1877—78 the total expenditure on both higher and
                    middle schools was £478,250. The lower and primary schools complete the series.
                    They present every degree of efficiency, from the indigenous and unaided village
                    school to the vernacular schools in the presidency capitals. Their extension is
                    the chief test of the success of the educational system. No uniformity prevails
                    in this matter throughout the several provinces. In Bengal up to the last few
                    years primary instruction was sadly neglected; but, since the reforms
                    inaugurated by Sir G. Campbell in 1872, by which the benefit of the grant-in-aid
                    rules was extended to the <hi rend="italic">pdthsàlàs</hi> or village schools,
                    this reproach has been removed. In 1871—72 the total number of primary schools
                    under inspection was only 2451, attended by 64,779 pupils. By 1877—78 the number
                    of schools had risen to 16,042, and the number of pupils to 360,322, being an
                    increase of about sixfold in six years. In the latter year the total expenditure
                    from all sources was £78,000, towards which Government contributed only £27,000,
                    thus showing how state aid stimulates private outlay. The North-Western
                    Provinces owe their system of primary instruction to their great
                    lieutenant-governor, Mr Thomason, whose constructive talent can be traced in
                    every department of the administration. In addition to the <hi rend="italic"
                    >tahsili</hi> or middle schools already referred to, he drew up a scheme for
                    establishing <hi rend="italic">halkabandi</hi> or primary schools in every
                    central village (whence their name), to which the children from the surrounding
                    hamlets might resort. His scheme has since been largely developed by means of
                    the educational cess added to the land revenue. In Bombay the primary schools
                    are mainly supported out of local funds raised in a similar manner. In British
                    Burmah, on the other hand, primary education is still left to a great extent in
                    the hands of Buddhist monks, who receive no pecuniary support from Government.
                    The monastic schools are only open to boys, but there are also lay teachers who
                    admit girls to mixed classes. Government has hardly any schools of its own in
                    Burmah, the deficiency being supplied by several missionary bodies, who obtain
                    state aid. In many parts of the Madras presidency, also, the missionaries
                    possess a practical monopoly of education at the present day. In 1877-78 the
                    amount of money expended upon lower and primary schools in British India was
                    £406,135, or just one-fourth of the total educational budget.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Girls’ Schools.—</hi> Of late years something has been done,
                    though not much, to extend the advantages of education to girls. In this, as in
                    other educational matters, the missionaries nave been the pioneers of progress.
                    In a few exceptional places, such as Tinnevelli in Madras, the Khâsi hills of
                    Assam, and among the Karen tribes of Burmah, female education has a real
                    existence, for in these places the missionaries have influence enough to
                    overcome the prejudices of the people. But elsewhere, even in the large towns
                    and among the English-speaking classes, all attempts to develop the intelligence
                    of women are regarded with scarcely disguised aversion. Throughout the
                    North-Western Provinces, with their numerous and wealthy cities, and a total
                    female population of 15 millions, only 6550 girls attended school in 1877-78. In
                    Bengal, with just double the inhabitants, the corresponding number was less than
                    12,000. Madras, British Burmah, and to a small degree Bombay and the Punjab, are
                    the only provinces that contribute to the following statistics in any tolerable
                    proportion:—Total girls’ schools in 1877-78, 2002; number of pupils, 66,615;
                    mixed schools for boys and girls, 2955; pupils, 90,915; total amount expended on
                    girls’ schools, £78,729, of which £27,000 was devoted to the 12,000 girls of
                    Bengal.</p>

                    of nearly £7 per student. School mistresses, as well as masters, are trained in
                    these institutions; and there also the missionaries have shown themselves active
                    in anticipating a work which Government subsequently took up. Of schools of art,
                    the oldest is that founded by Dr A. Hunter at Madras in 1850, and taken in
                    charge by the Education Department in 1856. This school, as also those at
                    Calcutta and Bombay, has been very successful in developing the industrial
                    capacities of the people, and training workmen for public employment. Museums
                    have been established at the provincial capitals and many other large towns.
                    Schools for European and other foreign races have also attracted the attention
                    of Government. In 1877-78 the number of such institutions was 104, with 9121
                    pupils; the expenditure from all sources was £80,197, or an average of nearly £9
                    per pupil. Foremost among these are the asylums for the orphans of British
                    soldiers, established at hill stations <hi rend="italic">lp.g.</hi> Utakamand

                <p><hi rend="italic">Newspapers and Books.—</hi> Closely connected with the subject
                    of education is the steady growth of the vernacular press, which is ever busy
                    issuing both newspapers and books. The missionaries were the first to cast type
                    in the vernacular languages, and to employ native compositors. The earliest
                    newspaper was the Bengali <hi rend="italic">Samdchar Darpan,</hi> which was
                    issued in 1835 by the Baptist Mission at Serampur. For many years the vernacular
                    press preserved the marks of its origin, by being limited almost absolutely to
                    theological controversy. The missionaries continued their work; and they were
                    encountered with their own weapons by the theistic sect of the Brahma Sanιaj,
                    and also by orthodox Hindus. So late as 1850 the majority of newspapers were
                    still sectarian rather than political, but during the last twenty years the
                    vernacular press has gradually risen to become a powerful engine of political
                    discussion. The number of newspapers regularly published in the several
                    vernaculars at the present time is said to reach the formidable total of 230.
                    The aggregate number of copies issued is estimated by Mr Roper Lethbridge at
                    about 150,000; but the circulation proper, that is, the actual number of
                    readers, is infinitely larger. In Bengal the vernacular press suffers from the
                    competition of English newspapers, some of which are entirely owned and written
                    by natives. In the north-west, from Lucknow to Lahore, about 100 newspapers are
                    printed in Hindustani or Urdu, the vernacular of the Mahometans throughout
                    India. Many of these are conducted with considerable ability and enterprise, and
                    may fairly be described as representative of native opinion in the large towns.
                    The Bombay journals are almost equally divided between Marathi and Guzerathn
                    Those in the former language are characterized by the traditional independence
                    of the race of Sivaji; those in the latter language are the organs of the Parsis
                    and of the trading community. The newspapers of Madras printed in Tamil and
                    Telugu are politically unimpörtant, being still for the most part devoted to
                    religion.</p>
                <p>As regards books, or rather registered publications, in the vernacular languages,
                    Bengal takes the lead; while the Punjab, Bombay, the North-Western Provinces,
                    and Madras follow in order. In 1877-78 the total number of registered
                    publications was 4890, of which 544 were in English, 3064 in one of the
                    vernaculars, 719 in a classical language of India, and 563 bilingual. Of the
                    vernacular works, 709 dealt with religion, 663 with poetry and the drama, 330
                    with language, 195 with science, 181 with fiction, 146 with law, and 95 with

                    >History.</hi><hi rend="italic">Hon-Aryan or Aboriginal Races.</hi></p>
                <p>Our earliest glimpses of India disclose two races struggling for the soil. The
                    one was a fair-skinned people, who had lately entered by the north-western
                    passes—a people of Aryan (literally “noble”) lineage, speaking a stately
                    language, worshipping friendly and powerful gods. The other was a race of a
                    lower type, who had long dwelt in the land, and whom the lordly new-comers drove
                    back before them into the mountains, or reduced to servitude on the plains. The
                    comparatively pure descendants of these two races in India are now nearly equal
                    in number, there being about 18 millions of each; their mixed progeny, sprung
                    chiefly from the ruder stock, make up the mass of the present Indian
                    population.</p>
                <p>The lower tribes were an obscure people, who, in the absence of a race-name of
                    their own, are called the nonAryans or aborigines. They have left no written
                    records; indeed, the use of letters, or of the simplest hieroglyphics, was to
                    them unknown. The sole works of their hands which have come down to us are the
                    rude stone circles and upright slabs or mounds beneath which, like the primitive
                    peoples of Europe, they buried their dead. From these we only discover that, at
                    some far distant but unfixed period, they knew how to make round pots of hard,
                    thin earthenware, that they fought with iron weapons, and that they wore
                    ornaments of copper and gold. The coins of imperial Rome have been found in
                    their later graves. Earlier remains, lying in the upper soils of large areas,
                    prove that these ancient tombbuilders formed only one link in a chain of
                    primaeval races. Long before their advent, India was peopled, as far as the
                    depths of the Central Provinces, by tribes unacquainted with the metals, who
                    hunted and warred with polished flint axes and other deftly-wrought implements
                    of stone similar to those dug up in northern Europe. And even these were the
                    successors of yet ruder beings, who have left their agate knives and rough flint
                    weapons in the Narbadâ valley. In front of this far-stretching background of the
                    Bronze and Stone Ages, we see the so-called aborigines being beaten down by the
                    newly arrived Aryan race.</p>
                <p>The struggle is commemorated by the two names which the victors gave to the early
                    tribes, namely, the Dasyus, or “enemies,” and the Dâsas, or “slaves.” The last
                    remains to this day the family name of multitudes of the lower class in Bengal.
                    The new-comers from the north prided themselves on their fair complexion, and
                    their Sanskrit word for “colour” <hi rend="italic">(varna)</hi> came to mean
                    “race” or “caste.” Their earliest poets, at least three thousand and perhaps
                    four thousand years ago, praised in the <hi rend="italic">Rig-Veda</hi> their
                    gods, who, “slaying the Dasyus, protected the <hi rend="italic">Aryan
                    colour,</hi><hi rend="italic superscript"> η</hi> who “subjected the black-skin
                    to the Aryan man.” Moreover, the Aryan, with his finely-formed features, loathed
                    the squat Mongolian faces of the aborigines. One Vedic singer speaks of them as
                    “noseless” or flat-nosed, while another praises his own “beautiful-nosed” gods.
                    The same unsightly feature was commented on with regard to a non-Aryan Asiatic
                    tribe, by the companions of Alexander the Great on his Indian expedition, at
                    least a thousand years later. The Vedic hymns abound in scornful epithets for
                    the primitive tribes, as “disturbers of sacrifices,” “gross feeders on flesh,”
                    “raw-eaters,” “lawless,” “not-sacrificing,” “without gods,” and “without rites.”
                    As time went on, and these rude tribes were driven back into the forest, they
                    were painted in still more hideous shapes, till they became the “monsters” and
                    “demons” of the Aryan poet and priest. Their race-name Dasyu, “enemy,” thus grew
                    to signify a goblin or devil, as the old Teutonic word for enemy has become the
                    English “fiend.”</p>
                <p>Nevertheless, all of them could not have been savages. We hear of wealthy Dasyus,
                    and even the Vedic hymns speak much of their “seven castles” and “ninety forts.”
                    In later Sanskrit literature the Aryans make alliance with aboriginal princes;
                    and when history at length dawns on the scene, we find some of the most powerful
                    kingdoms of India ruled by dynasties of non-Aryan descent. Nor were they devoid
                    of religious rites, nor of cravings after a future life. “They adorn,” says a
                    very ancient Sanskrit treatise,<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>Chandogya Upanishad, quoted in Muir’s <hi rend="italic"

                    raiment, with ornaments, imagining that thereby they shall attain the world to
                    come.” These ornaments are the bits of bronze, copper, and gold, which we now
                    dig up from beneath their rude stone monuments. In the great Sanskrit epic which
                    narrates the advance of the Aryans into southern India, <hi rend="italic">a</hi>
                    non-Aryan chief describes his race as “of fearful swiftness, unyielding in
                    battle, in colour like a dark blue cloud.”<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                <p>Thrust back by the Aryans from the plains, these primitive peoples have lain
                    hidden away in the recesses of the mountains, like the remains of extinct
                    animals which zoologists find in hill-caves. India thus forms a great museum of
                    races, in which we can study man from his lowest to his highest stages of
                    culture.</p>
                <p>Among the rudest fragments of mankind are the isolated Andaman islanders in the
                    Bay of Bengal. The old Arab and European voyagers described them as dog-faced
                    man-eaters. The English officers sent to the islands in 1855 to establish a
                    settlement found themselves surrounded by quite naked cannibals of a ferocious
                    type, who daubed themselves when festive with red earth, and mourned in a suit
                    of olive-coloured mud. They used a noise like weeping to express friendship or
                    joy, bore only names of common gender, which they received before birth; and
                    their sole conception of a god was an evil spirit who spread disease. For five
                    years they repulsed every effort at intercourse by showers of arrows; but the
                    officers slowly brought them to a better frame of mind by building sheds near
                    the settlement, where these poor beings might find shelter from the tropical
                    rains, and receive medicines and food.</p>
                <p>The Anamalai hills, in southern Madras, form the refuge of a whole series of
                    broken tribes. Five hamlets of long-haired wildlooking Puliars live on jungle
                    products, mice, or any small animals they can catch, and worship demons. Another
                    clan, the Munda-vars, shrink from contact with the outside world, and possess no
                    fixed dwellings, but wander over the innermost hills .with their cattle,
                    sheltering themselves under little leaf-sheds, and seldom remaining in one spot
                    more than a year. The thick-lipped smallbodied Kaders, “Lords of the Hills,” are
                    a remnant of a higher race. They file the front teeth of the upper jaw as a
                    marriage ceremony, live by the chase, and wield some influence over the ruder
                    forest-folk. These hills, now very thinly peopled, abound in the great stone
                    monuments (kistvaens and dolmens) which the primitive tribes used for their
                    dead. Th® Nairs of south-western India still practice polyandry, according to
                    which a man’s property descends not to his own but to his sister’s children.
                    That system also appears among the Himalayan tribes at the opposite extremity of
                    India.</p>
                <p>In the Central Provinces the aboriginal races form a large proportion of the
                    population. In certain districts, as in the feudatory state of Bastar, they
                    amount to three-fifths of the inhabitants. The most important race, the Gonds,
                    have made some advances in civilization; but the wilder tribes still cling to
                    the forest, and live by the chase, and some of them are reported to have used,
                    within a few years back, flint points for their arrows. The Marias wield bows of
                    great strength, which they hold with their feet while they draw the string with
                    both hands. A still wilder tribe, the Maris, fly from their grass-built huts on
                    the approach of a stranger. Once a year a messenger comes to them from the local
                    raja to take their tribute of jungle products. He does not enter their hamlets,
                    but beats a drum outside, and then hides himself. The shy Maris creep forth,
                    place what they have to give in an appointed spot, and run back again into their
                    retreats.</p>
                <p>Further to the north-east, in the tributary states of Orissa, there is a poor
                    tribe, 10,000 in number, of Juangs or Patuas, literally the “leaf-wearers,”
                    whose women formerly wore no clothes. Their only vestige of covering was a few
                    strings of beads round the waist with a bunch of leaves tied before and behind.
                    Those under the British influence were clothed in 1871 by order of Government,
                    and their native chief was persuaded to do the same work for the others. This
                    leaf-wearing tribe had no knowledge of the metals till quite lately, when
                    foreigners came among them, and no word exists in their native language for iron
                    or any other metal. But their country abounds with flint weapons, so that the
                    Juangs form a remnant to our own day of the Stone Age. “Their huts,” writes the
                    officer who knows them best, “arc among the smallest that human beings ever
                    deliberately constructed as dwellings. They measure about 6 feet by 8. The head
                    of the family and all the females huddle together in this one shell, not much
                    larger than a dog-kennel.” The boys and the young men of the village live in one
                    large building apart by themselves; and this custom of having a common abode for
                    the whole male youth of the hamlet is found among many of the aboriginal tribes
                    in distant parts of India. The Kandhs of Orissa, who kept up their old tribal
                    ritual of human sacrifice until it was put down by the British in 1835-45, and
                    the Santals in the west of Lower Bengal, who rose in 1855, are examples of
                    powerful and highly developed non-Aryan tribes.</p>
                <p>Proceeding to the northern boundary of India, we find the slopes and spurs of the
                    Himalayas peopled by a great variety of rude tribes. As a rule they are fierce,
                    black, undersized, and ill-fed. They formerly eked out a wretched subsistence by
                    plundering the more civilized hamlets of the Assam valley,—a means oflivelihood
                    which they are but slowly giving up under British rule. Some of the wildest of
                    them, such as the independent Abars, are now employed as a sort of irregular
                    police, to keep the peace of the border, in return for a yearly gift of cloth,
                    hoes, and grain. Their very names bear witness to their former wild life. One
                    tribe, the Akas of Assam, is divided into two clans, known respectively as “The
                    eaters of a thousand hearths,” and “The thieves who lurk in the
                    cottonfield.”</p>
                <p>Whence came these primitive peoples, whom the Aryan invaders found in the land
                    more than three thousand years ago, and who are still scattered over India, the
                    fragments of a prehistoric world? Written records they do not possess. Their
                    oral traditions tell us little, but such hints as they yield feebly point to the
                    north. They seem to preserve dim memories of a time when the tribes dwelt under
                    the shadow of mightier hill ranges than any to be found on the south of the
                    river plains of Bengal. “The Great Mountain” is the race-god of the Santâls, and
                    an object of worship among other tribes. The Gonds, in the heart of of Central
                    India, have a legend that they were created at the foot of Dewâlagiri Peak in
                    the Himâlayas. Till lately they buried their dead with the feet turned
                    northwards, so as to be ready to start again for their ancient home in the
                    north.</p>
                <p>The language of the non-Aryan races, that record of a nation’s past more enduring
                    than rock inscriptions or tables of brass, is being slowly made to tell the
                    secret of their origin. It already indicates that the early peoples of India
                    belonged to three great stocks, known as the Tibeto-Burman, the Kolarian, and
                    the Dravidian. The Tibeto-Burman tribes cling to the skirts of the Himâlayas and
                    their north-eastern offshoots. They crossed over into India by the north-eastern
                    passes, and in some prehistoric time had dwelt in Central Asia, side by side
                    with the forefathers of the Mongolians and the Chinese. Several of the hill
                    languages in Eastern Bengal preserve Chinese terms, others contain Mongolian.
                    Thus the Nâgâs in Assam still use words for <hi rend="italic">three</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">water</hi> which might almost be understood in the streets of
                    Canton.</p>
                <p>The following are the twenty principal dialects of the Tibeto-Burman group:—(1)
                    Câchâri or Bodo, (2) Garo, (3) Tripura orMrung, (4) Tibetan or Bhutia, (5)
                    Gurung <hi rend="subscript"> l</hi> (6) Murmi, (7) Newar, (8) Lepcha, (9) Miri,
                    (10) Aka, (11) Mishmi dialects, (12) Dhimal, (13) Kanâwari dialects, (14) Mikir,
                    (15) Singpho, (16) Nâga dialects, (17) Kuki dialects, (18) Burmese, (19) Khyeng,
                    and (20) Manipuri.</p>
                <p>“It is impossible,” writes Mr Brandreth, “to give even an approximate number of
                    the speakers included in this group, as many of the languages are either across
                    the frontier or only project a short distance into our own territory. The
                    languages included in this group have not, with perhaps one or two exceptions,
                    both a cerebral and dental row of consonants, like the South-Indian languages;
                    some of them have aspirated forms of the surds, but not of the sonants; others
                    have aspirated forms of both. The languages of this group, even those which most
                    diverge from each other, have several words in common, and especially numerals
                    and pronouns, and also some resemblances of grammar. In comparing the resembling
                    words, the differences between them consist often less in any modification of
                    the root-syllable than in the various additions to the root. Thus in Burmese we
                    have <hi rend="italic">nd,</hi> ’ ear; ’ Tibetan, <hi rend="italic">mα-bα;</hi>
                    Magar, <hi rend="italic">na-kep;</hi> Newar, <hi rend="italic">nai-pong</hi>;
                    Dhimal, <hi rend="italic">nd-hdthong</hi>; Kiranti dialects, <hi rend="italic"
                    >nd-pro,</hi><hi rend="italic">nd-rék,</hi><hi rend="italic">nd-gduik</hi>; Naga
                    languages, <hi rend="italic">te-na-ro, te-na∙ rang·,</hi> Manipuri, <hi
                    rend="italic">na-kong</hi>; Kupui, <hi rend="italic">ka-nd∙,</hi> Sak, <hi
                    rend="italic">aka-nd</hi>; Karen, <hi rend="italic">na-klιu</hi>; and so on. It
                    can hardly be doubted that such additions as these to monosyllabic roots are
                    principally determinative syllables for the purpose of distinguishing between
                    what would otherwise have been monosyllabic words having the same sound. These
                    determinatives are generally affixed in the languages of Nepal and in the Dhimal
                    language; prefixed in the Lepcha language, and in the languages of Assam, of
                    Manipur, and of the Chittagong and Arakan hills. ° Words are also distinguished
                    by difference of tone. The tones are generally of two kinds, described as the
                    abrupt or short, and the pausing or heavy; and it has been remarked that those’
                    languages which are most given to adding other syllables to the root make the
                    least use of the tones, and <hi rend="italic">vice versa·,</hi> where the tones
                    most prevail the least recourse is had to determinative syllables.”</p>
                <p>The Kolarians, the second of the three non-Aryan stocks, seem also to have
                    entered Bengal by the north-eastern <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit12newyrich/page/n801/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0912-0801-0778"/> passes. They dwell chiefly in the north, and
                    along the north-eastern edge of the three-sided table-land which covers the
                    southern half of India. Some of the Dravidians, or third stock, appear, on the
                    other hand, to have found their way into the Punjab by the north-western passes.
                    They now inhabit the southern part of the three-sided table-land, as far down as
                    Cape Comorin, the southernmost part of India. It appears as if the two streams
                    of the Kolarian tribes from the north-east and the Dravidians from the
                    north-west had converged and crossed each other in Central India. The Dravidians
                    proved the stronger, broke up the Kolarians, thrust aside their fragments to
                    east and west, and then rushed forward in a mighty body to the south.</p>
                <p>It thus happened that, while the Dravidians formed a vast mass in southern India,
                    the Kolarians survived only as isolated tribes, scattered so far apart as soon
                    to forget their common origin. One of the largest of the Kolarian races, the
                    Santâls, dwells on the extreme eastern edge of the three-sided table-land of
                    Central India, where it slopes down into the Gangetic valley of Lower Bengal.
                    The Kurkus, a broken Kolarian tribe, inhabit a patch of country about 400 miles
                    to the west, and have for perhaps thousands of years been cut off from the
                    Santâls by mountains and pathless forests, and by intervening races of the
                    Dravidian and Aryan stocks. The Kurkus and Santâls have no tradition of a common
                    origin; yet at this day the Kurkus speak a language which is little else than a
                    dialect of Santâli. The Savars, once a great Kolarian tribe, mentioned by Pliny
                    and Ptolemy, are now a poor wandering race of woodcutters of northern Madras and
                    Orissa. Yet fragments of them have lately been found deep in Central India, and
                    as far west as Râjputâna on the other Bide.</p>
                <p>The nine principal languages of the Kolarian group are—(1) Santâli, (2) Mundâri,
                    (3) Ho, (4) Bhumij, (5) Korwa, (6) Kharria, (7) Juang, (8) Kurku, and perhaps
                    (9) Savar. Some of them are separated only by dialectical differences.</p>
                <p>“The Kolarian group of languages,” writes Mr Brandreth, “has both the cerebral
                    and dental row of letters, and also aspirated forms, which last, according to
                    Caldwell, did not belong to early Dravidian. There is also a set of four sounds,
                    which are perhaps peculiar to Santâli, called by Skrefsrad semi-consonants, and
                    which, when followed by a vowel, are changed respectively into <hi rend="italic"
                    >g, j, cl,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">b.</hi> Gender of nouns is animate and
                    inanimate, and is distinguished by difference of pronouns, by difference of
                    suffix of a qualifying noun in the genitive relation, and by the gender being
                    denoted by the verb. As instances of the genitive suffix, we have in Santâli <hi
                    rend="italic">in-ren hopon, ‘</hi> my son,’ but <hi rend="italic">in-ak
                    orak,</hi> ‘my house.’ There is no distinction of sex in the pronouns, but of
                    the animate and inanimate gender. The dialects generally agree in using a short
                    form of the third personal pronoun suffixed to denote the number, dual and
                    plural, of the noun, and short forms of all the personal pronouns are added to
                    the verb in certain positions to express both number and person, both as regards
                    the subject and object, if of the animate gender,—the inanimate gender being
                    indicated by the omission of these suffixes. No other group of languages,
                    apparently, has such a logical classification of its nouns as that shown by the
                    genders of both the South-Indian groups. The genitive in the Kolarian group of
                    the full personal pronouns is used for the possessive pronoun, which again takes
                    all the post-positions, the genitive relation being thus indicated by the
                    genitive suffix twice repeated. The Kolarian languages generally express
                    grammatical relations by suffixes, and adi the post-positions directly to the
                    root, without the intervention of an oblique form or genitive or other suffix.
                    They agree with the Dravidian in having inclusive and exclusive forms for the
                    plural of the first personal pronoun, in using a relative participle instead of
                    a relative pronoun, in the position of the governing word, and in the possession
                    of a true causal form of the verb. They have a dual, which the Dravidians have
                    not, but they have no negative voice. Counting is by twenties instead of by
                    tens, as in the Dravidian. The Santâli verb, according to Skrefsrud, has
                    twenty-three tenses, and for every tense two forms of the participle and a
                    gerund.”</p>
                <p>The compact Dravidians in the south, although in afterdays subdued by the higher
                    civilization of the Aryan race which pressed in among them, were never thus
                    broken into fragments. Their pure descendants consist, indeed, of small and
                    scattered tribes; but they have given their languages to 46 millions of people
                    in southern India. That some of the islands in the distant Pacific Ocean were
                    peopled either from the Dravidian settlements in India, or from an earlier
                    common source, remains a conjectural induction of philologers, rather than an
                    established ethnological fact. <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi> The aboriginal
                    tribes in southern and western Australia use almost the same words for 7, <hi
                    rend="italic">thou, he, we, you,</hi> &amp;c., as the fishermen on the Madras
                    coast, and resemble in many other ways the Madras hill tribes, as in the use of
                    their national weapon the boomerang.</p>
                <p>Bishop Caldwell recognizes twelve distinct Dravidian languages :—(1) Tamil, (2)
                    Malayâlim, (3) Telugu, (4) Kanarese, (5) Tulu, (6) Kudugu, (7) Toda, (8) Kota,
                    (9) Gond, (10) Khond, (11) Urâon, (12) Râjmahâl.</p>
                <p>“In the Dravidian group,” writes Mr Brandreth, “there is a rational and an
                    irrational gender of the nouns, which is distinguished in the plural of the
                    nouns, and sometimes in the singular also, by affixes which appear to be
                    fragmentary pronouns, by corresponding pronouns, and by the agreement of the
                    verb with the noun, the gender of the verb being expressed by the pronominal
                    suffixes. To give an instance of verbal gender, we have in Tamil, from the root
                    <hi rend="italic">sey,</hi> ‘ to do,’ <hi rend="italic">seyd</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">-άη,</hi> ‘he (rational) did <hi rend="italic">seyd</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">-άΐ,</hi> ‘ she (rational) did; ’ <hi rend="italic">seyd-adu,</hi>
                    ‘ it (irrational) did; ’ <hi rend="italic">scyd-Λr,</hi> ‘ they (the rationale)
                    did; ’ <hi rend="italic">seyd-a, ‘</hi> they (the irrationals) did; ’—the full
                    pronouns being <hi rend="italic">avan,</hi> ‘ he; ’ <hi rend="italic">aval,</hi>
                    ‘ she; ’ <hi rend="italic">adu,</hi> ‘ it; ’ <hi rend="italic">avar,</hi> ‘ they
                    ∕ <hi rend="italic">avei, ‘</hi> they. ’ This distinction of gender, though it
                    exists in most of the Dravidian languages, is not always carried out to the
                    extent that it is in Tamil. In Telugu, Gond, and Khond it is preserved in the
                    plural, but in the singular the feminine rational is merged in the irrational
                    gender. In Gond the gender is furtiter marked by the noun in the genitive
                    relation taking a different suffix, according to the number and gender of the
                    noun on which it depends. In Urâon the feminine rational is entirely merged in
                    the irrational gender, with the exception of the pronoun, which preserves the
                    distinction between rationale and irrationals in the plural; as <hi
                    rend="italic">as,</hi> ‘ he,’ referring to a god or a man; <hi rend="italic"
                    >àd,</hi> ‘ she,’ or ‘ it,’ referring to a woman or an irrational object; but
                    <hi rend="italic">dr,</hi> ‘ they,’ applies to both men and women; <hi
                    rend="italic">abrà,</hi> ‘they,’to irrationals only. The rational gender,
                    besides human beings, includes the celestial and infernal deities; and it is
                    further subdivided in some of the languages, but in the singular only, into
                    masculine and feminine. An instance of this subdivision in the Tamil verb was
                    given above.</p>
                <p>“The grammatical relations in the Dravidian are generally expressed l&gt;y
                    suffixes. Many nouns have an oblique form, which is a remarkable characteristic
                    of the Dravidian group; still, with the majority of nouns, the post-positions
                    are added directly to the nominative form. Other features of this group are—the
                    frequent use of formatives to specialize the meaning of the root; the absence of
                    relative pronouns, and the use instead of a relative participle, which is
                    usually formed from the ordinary participle by the same suffix as that which Dr
                    Caldwell considers as the oldest sign of the genitive relation; the adjective
                    succeeding the substantive; of two substantives, the determining preceding the
                    determined; and the verb being the last member of the sentence. There is no true
                    dual in the Dravidian languages. In the Dravidian languages there are two forms
                    of the plural of the pronoun of the first person, one including, the other
                    excluding, the person addressed. As regards the verbs, there is a negative
                    voice, but no passive voice, and there is a causal form.”</p>
                <p>We discern, therefore, long before the dawn of history, masses of men moving
                    uneasily over India, and violently pushing in among still earlier tribes. They
                    crossed the snows of the Himâlayas, and plunged into the tropical forests in
                    search of new homes. Of these ancient races fragments now exist in almost
                    exactly the same stage of human progress as they were when described by Vedic
                    poets over three thousand years ago. Some are dying out, such as the Andaman
                    islanders, among whom only one family in 1869 had so many as three children.
                    Others are increasing, like the Santâls, who have doubled themselves under
                    British rule. Taken as a whole, and including certain half-Hinduized branches,
                    they number 17,716,825, or say 18 millions, equal to three-quarters of the

                    greater portion submitted in ancient times to the Aryan invaders, and now make
                    up the mass of the Hindus.</p>
                <p>In Bengal and Assam the aborigines are divided into nearly sixty distinct races.
                    In the North-Western Provinces sixteen tribes of aborigines are enumerated in
                    the census of 1872. In the Central Provinces they number If millions,—the
                    ancient race of Gonds, who ruled the central table-land before the rise of the
                    Marhattâs, alone amounting to 1∣ millions. In British Burmah the Karens, whose
                    traditions have a singularly Jewish tinge, number 330,000. In Oudh the
                    nationality of the aboriginal tribes has been stamped out beneath successive
                    waves of Râjput and Mahometan invaders. In centres of the ancient Hindu
                    civilization, the aboriginal races have become the low-castes and out-castes on
                    which the social fabric of India rests. A few of them, however, still preserve
                    their ethnical identity as wandering tribes or jugglers, basket-weavers, and
                    fortune-tellers.· Thus the Nâts, Bediyas, and other gipsy clans are recognized
                    to this day as distinct from the surrounding Hindu population.</p>
                <p>The aboriginal races on the plains have supplied the hereditary criminal classes,
                    alike under the Hindus, the Mahometans, and the British. Formerly organized
                    robber communities, they have, under the stricter police administration of our
                    days, sunk into petty pilferers. But their existence is still recognized by the
                    Criminal Tribes Act, passed in 1871, and occasionally enforced within certain
                    localities of northern India.</p>
                <p>The non-Aryan hill races, who figured from Vedic times downwards as marauders and
                    invaders, have ceased to be a disturbing element. Many of them appear as
                    predatory clans in Mahometan and early British India. They sallied forth from
                    their mountains at the end of the autumn harvest, pillaged and burned the
                    lowland villages, and retired to their fastnesses laden with the booty of the
                    plains. The measures by which many of these wild races have been reclaimed mark
                    some of the most honourable episodes of Anglo Indian rule. Cleveland’s
                    Hill-Rangers in the last century, and the Bhils and Mhairs in more recent times,
                    are well-known examples of marauding races being turned into peaceful
                    cultivators and loyal soldiers. An equally salutary transformation has taken
                    place in many a remote forest and hill tract of India. The firm order of British
                    rule has rendered their old plundering life no longer possible, and at the same
                    time has opened up to them new outlets for their energies. Their character
                    differs in many respects from that of the tamer population of the plains. Their
                    truthfulness, sturdy loyalty, and a certain joyous bravery, almost amounting to
                    playfulness, appeal in a special manner to the English mind. There is scarcely a
                    single administrator who has ruled over them for any length of time without
                    finding his heart drawn to them, and leaving on record his belief in their
                    capabilities for good.</p>

                    have seen that India may be divided into three regions. Two of these, the
                    Himâlayas in the north and the three-sided table-land in the south, still form
                    the retreats of the non-Aryan tribes. The third, or the great river plains,
                    became in very ancient times the theatre on which a nobler race worked out its
                    civilization.</p>
                <p>That race belonged to the splendid Aryan or IndoGermanic stock, from which the
                    Brâhman, the Râjput, and the Englishman alike descend. Its earliest home seems
                    to have been in Central Asia. From this common campingground certain branches of
                    the race started for the east, others for the west. One of the western offshoots
                    founded the Persian kingdom; another built Athens and Lacedaemon, and became the
                    Greek nation; a third went on to Italy, and reared the city on the seven hills
                    which grew into imperial Rome. A distant colony of the same race excavated the
                    silver-ores of prehistoric Spain; and, when we first catch a sight of ancient
                    England, we see an Aryan settlement fishing in willow canoes, and working the
                    tinmines of Cornwall. Meanwhile other branches of the Aryan stock had gone forth
                    from the primitive home in Central Asia to the east. Powerful bands found their
                    way through the passes of the Himalayas into the Punjab, and spread themselves,
                    chiefly as Brâhmans and Râjputs, over India.</p>
                <p>The Aryan offshoots to the east and to the west alike asserted their superiority
                    over the earlier peoples whom they found in possession of the soil. The history
                    of ancient Europe is the story of the Aryan settlements around the shores of the
                    Mediterranean; and that wide term, modern civilization, merely means the
                    civilization of the western branches of the same race. The history and
                    development of India consist of the history and development çf the eastern
                    offshoots of the Aryan stock who settled in that land. In the west, the Aryan
                    speech has supplied the modern languages of Europe, America, and England’s
                    island empires in the southern Pacific. In the east, Hinduism and Buddhism, the
                    religions of the Indian branch of the Aryans, have become the faiths of more
                    than one-half of the whole human race, and spread Aryan thought and culture
                    throughout Asia to the utmost limits of China and Japan.</p>
                <p>We know little regarding these noble Aryan tribes in their early camping-ground
                    in Central Asia. From words preserved in the languages of their long-separated
                    descendants in Europe and India, scholars infer that they roamed over the grassy
                    steppes with their cattle, making long halts to rear crops of grain. They had
                    tamed most of the domestic animals, were acquainted with some metals, understood
                    the arts of weaving and sewing, wore clothes, and ate cooked food. They lived
                    the hardy life of the temperate zone, and the feeling of cold seems to be one of
                    the earliest common remembrances of the eastern and the western branches of the
                    race. Ages afterwards, when the Vedic singers in hot India prayed for long life,
                    they asked for “a hundred, <hi rend="italic">winters T</hi> The forefathers of
                    the Greek and the Roman, of the Englishman and the Hindu, dwelt together in
                    Asia, spoke the same tongue, worshipped the same gods. The languages of Europe
                    and India, although at first sight they seem wide apart, are merely different
                    forms of the original Aryan speech. This is especially true of the common words
                    of family life. The names for <hi rend="italic">father, mother, brother,
                    sister,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">widow</hi> are the same in most of the Aryan
                    languages, whether spoken on the banks of the Ganges, of the Tiber, or of the
                    Thames. Thus the word <hi rend="italic">daughter,</hi> which occurs in nearly
                    all of them, has been derived from two Sanskrit roots meaning “to draw milk,”
                    and preserves the memory of the time when the daughter was the little milk-maid
                    in the primitive Aryan household.</p>
                <p>The ancient religions of Europe and India had a similar origin. They were to some
                    extent made up of the sacred stories or myths which our common ancestors had
                    learned while dwelling together in Central Asia. Some of the Vedic gods were
                    also the gods of Greece and Rome; and to this day the Deity is adored by names
                    derived from the same old Aryan root by Brâhmans in Calcutta, by Protestant
                    clergymen at Westminster, and by Catholic priests in Peru.</p>
                <p>The Vedic hymns exhibit the Indian branch of the Aryans on its march to the
                    south-east and in its new homes. The earliest songs disclose the race still to
                    the <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit12newyrich/page/n803/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0912-0803-0780"/> north of the Khyber Pass, in Cabul; the later
                    ones bring it as far as the Ganges. Their victorious advance eastwards through
                    the intermediate tract can be traced in the Vedic writings almost step by step.
                    One of their famous settlements lay between the two sacred rivers, the Saraswati
                    and the Drishadvati,—supposed to be the modern Sarsuti near Thânesar, in the
                    Punjab, and the Ghaggar, a day’s march from it. That fertile strip of land, not
                    more than 60 miles long by 20 broad, was fondly remembered by them as their Holy
                    Land, “fashioned of God, and chosen by the Creator.” As their numbers increased,
                    they pushed eastwards along the base of the Himalayas, into what they afterwards
                    called the Land of the Sacred Singers <hi rend="italic">{Brdh-marshidesha).</hi>
                    Their settlements practically included the five rivers of the Punjab, together
                    with the other great river-system formed by the upper courses of the Jumna and
                    the Ganges. In them the Vedic hymns were composed; and the steady supply of
                    water led the Aryans to settle down from their old state of wandering pastoral
                    tribes into communities of husbandmen. The Vedic poets praised the rivers which
                    enabled them to make this great change—perhaps the most important step in the
                    progress of a race. “May the Indus,” they sang, “the far-famed giver of wealth,
                    hear us,—(fertilizing our) broad fields with water.” The Himâlayas, through
                    whose passes they had reached India, and at whose southern base they long dwelt,
                    made a lasting impression on their memory. The Vedic singer praised “Him whose
                    greatness the snowy ranges, and the sea, and the aerial river declare.” In all
                    its long wanderings through India the Aryan race never forgot its northern home.
                    There dwelt its gods and holy singers, and their eloquence descended from heaven
                    among men.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Pig-Veda</hi> forms the great literary memorial of the
                    early Aryan settlements in the Punjab. The age of this venerable hymnal is
                    unknown. The Hindus believe, without evidence, that it existed “from before all
                    time,” or at least 3001 years B.C.,—nearly 5000 years ago. European scholars
                    have inferred from astronomical dates that its composition was going on about
                    1400 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> But these dates are themselves given in
                    writings of later origin, and might have been calculated backwards. We only know
                    that the Vedic religion had been at work long before the rise of Buddhism in the
                    6th century <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> Nevertheless, the antiquity of the
                    <hi rend="italic">Rig-Veda,</hi> although not to be expressed in figures, is
                    abundantly established. The earlier hymns exhibit the Aryans on the
                    north-western frontiers of India just starting on their long journey. Before the
                    embassy of the Greek Megasthenes, at the end of the 4th century <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">b.c.,</hi> they had spread their influence as far as the delta
                    of Lower Bengal, 1500 miles distant. At the time of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Periplus</hi> the southernmost point of India had become a seat of their
                    worship. “What a series of centuries must have elapsed,” writes Weber, “before
                    this boundless tract of country, inhabited by wild and vigorous tribes, could
                    have been brought over to Brâhmanism !”</p>
                <p>The Brâhmans declare that the Vedic hymns were directly inspired by God. Indeed,
                    in our own times, the great theistic church of Bengal, which rejects Brâhmanical
                    teaching, was rent into two sects on the question of the divine authority of the
                    <hi rend="italic">Veda.</hi> As a matter of fact, the hymns were composed by
                    certain families of Rishis or psalmists, some of whose names are preserved. The
                    <hi rend="italic">RigVeda</hi> is a very old collection of 1017 of these short
                    lyrical poems, chiefly addressed to the gods, and containing 10,580 verses. They
                    show us the Aryans on the banks of the Indus, divided into various tribes,
                    sometimes at war with each other, sometimes united against the “black-skinned”
                    aborigines. Caste, in its later sense, is unknown. Each father of a family is
                    the priest of his own household. The chieftain acts as father and priest to the
                    tribe; but at the greater festivals he chooses some one specially learned in
                    holy offerings to conduct the sacrifice in the name of the people. The chief
                    himself seems to have been elected; and his title of Vis-pati, literally “Lord
                    of the Settlers,” survives in the old Persian Vis-paiti, and as the Lithuanian
                    Wiéz-patis in central Europe at this day. Women enjoyed a high position, and
                    some of the most beautiful hymns were composed by ladies and queens. Marriage
                    was held sacred. Husband and wife were both “rulers of the house” <hi
                    rend="italic">(dampatι)</hi><hi rend="italic subscript"> i</hi> and drew near to
                    the gods together in prayer, The burning of widows on their husbands’
                    funeral-pile was unknown, and the verses in the <hi rend="italic">Veda</hi>
                    which the Brâhmans afterwards distorted into a sanction for the practice have
                    the very opposite meaning. “Rise, woman,” says the sacred text to the mourner;
                    “come to the world of life. Come to us. Thou hast fulfilled thy duties as a wife
                    to thy husband.”</p>
                <p>The Aryan tribes in the <hi rend="italic">Veda</hi> are acquainted with most of
                    the metals. They have blacksmiths, coppersmiths, and goldsmiths among them,
                    besides carpenters, barbers, and other artisans. They fight from chariots, and
                    freely use the horse, although not yet the elephant, in war. They have settled
                    down as husbandmen, till their fields with the plough, and live in villages or
                    towns. But they also cling to their old wandering life, with their herds and
                    “cattle-pens.” Cattle, indeed, still form their chief wealth, the coin ( Latin,
                    <hi rend="italic">pecunia)</hi> in which payments of fines are made; and one of
                    their words for war literally means “a desire for cows.” They have learned to
                    build “ships,” perhaps large river-boats, and seem to have heard something of
                    the sea. Unlike the modem Hindus, the Aryans of the <hi rend="italic">Veda</hi>
                    ate beef, used a fermented liquor or beer made from the <hi rend="italic"
                    >soma</hi> plant, and offered the same strong meat and drink to their gods. Thus
                    the stout Aryans spread eastwards through northern India, pushed on from behind
                    by later arrivals of their own stock, and driving before them, or reducing to
                    bondage, the earlier “black-skinned” races. They marched in whole communities
                    from one river-valley to another, each house-father a warrior, husbandman, and
                    priest, with his wife, and his little ones, and cattle.</p>
                <p>These free-hearted tribes had a great trust in themselves and their gods. Like
                    other conquering races, they believed that both themselves and their deities
                    were altogether superior to the people of the land and their poor rude objects
                    of worship. Indeed, this noble self-confidence is a great aid to the success of
                    a nation. Their divinities—in Sanskrit, <hi rend="italic">Devαtα,</hi> literally
                    “the Shining Ones”— were the great powers of nature. They adored the
                    Father-heaven, <hi rend="italic">{Dyaush-pitar,</hi> the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Dies-pitcr</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Jupiter</hi> of Rome, the <hi
                    rend="italic">Zeus</hi> of Greece, the Low German <hi rend="italic">Duus,</hi>
                    and, through the old French god-demon <hi rend="italic">Dus-ius,</hi> the <hi
                    rend="italic">Deuce</hi> of English slang), together with Mother-earth, and the
                    Encompassing Sky (Pαrunα in Sanskrit, <hi rend="italic">Uranus</hi> in Latin,
                    <hi rend="italic">Ouranοs</hi> in Greek). Indra, or the aqueous vapour that
                    brings each autumn the precious rain on which plenty or famine still depends,
                    received the largest number of hymns. By degrees, as the settlers realized more
                    and more keenly the importance of the periodical rains in their new life as
                    husbandmen, he became the chief of the Vedic gods. “The gods do not reach unto
                    thee, O Indra, nor men; thou overcomest all creatures in strength.” Agni, the
                    God of fire (Latin <hi rend="italic">ignis),</hi> ranks perhaps next to Indra in
                    the number of hymns addressed to him as “the youngest of the gods,” “the lord
                    and giver of wealth.” The Maruts are the Storm Gods, “who make the rocks to
                    tremble, who tear in pieces the forest.” Ushas, “the High-born Dawn” (Greek, <hi
                    rend="italic">Bos),</hi> “shines upon us like a young wife, rousing every living
                    being to go forth to his work.” The Asvins, or “Fleet Outriders” of the Dawn,
                    are the first rays of sunrise, ‘ ‘ Lords of Lustre.” The Sun himself (Sürjya),
                    the Wind (Vâyu), the Friendly Day (Mitra), the animating fermented juice of the
                    Sacrificial Plant (Soma) and many others, are invoked in the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Veda,—</hi> in all about thirty-three gods, “who are eleven in heaven, eleven
                    on earth, and eleven dwelling in glory in mid-air.”</p>
                <p>The terrible blood-drinking deities of modern Hinduism are scarcely known in the
                    <hi rend="italic">Veda.</hi> Buffaloes are indeed offered; and one hymn points
                    to a symbolism based on human sacrifices, an early practice apparently extinct
                    before the time of the Vedic singers. The great horse sacrifice was substituted
                    for the flesh and blood of a man. But, asa whole, the hymns are addressed to
                    bright, <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit12newyrich/page/n804/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0912-0804-0781"/> friendly gods. Ru&lt;lra, who was destined to
                    become the Siva of the Hindus, and the third person, or Destroyer, in their
                    Triad, is only the god of Roaring Tempests in the <hi rend="italic">Veda</hi>;
                    Vishnu, the second person, or Preserver, in the Hindu Triad, is but slightly
                    known as the deity of the Shining Firmament; while Brahma, the first person, or
                    Creator, has no separate existence in these simple hymns. The naines of the
                    dreadful Mahâdeva, Dιirga, Kali, and of the gentler Krishna and Rama, are
                    equally unknown in the <hi rend="italic">RigVeda.</hi></p>
                <p>While the aboriginal races buried their dead under rude stone monuments, the
                    Aryan—alike in India, in Greece, and in Italy— made use of the funeral-pile as
                    the most solemn method of severing the mortal from the immortal part of man. As
                    he derived his natural birth from his parents, and a partial regeneration, or
                    second birth, from the performance of his religious duties, so the fire, by
                    setting free the soul from the body, completed the third or heavenly birth. His
                    friends stood round the pyre as round a natal bed, and commanded his eye to go
                    to the sun, his breath to the wind, his limbs to the earth,—the water and plants
                    whence they had been derived. But “as for his unborn part, do thou, Lord (Agni),
                    quicken it with thy heat; let thy flame and thy brightness quicken it; convey it
                    to the world of the righteous.” The doctrine of transmigration was unknown. The
                    circle round the funeral-pile sang with an assurance that their friend went
                    direct to a state of blessedness and reunion with the loved ones who had gone
                    before.</p>
                <p>The hymns of the <hi rend="italic">Rig-Veda</hi> were composed, as we have seen,
                    by the Aryans in their colonies along the Indus, and on their march eastwards
                    towards the Jumna and upper Ganges. The growing numbers of the settlers, and the
                    arrival of fresh Aryan tribes from behind, still compelled them to advance. From
                    the Land of the Sacred Singers Manu describes them as spreading through “The
                    Middle Land” <hi rend="italic">{Madhyadesha),</hi> comprising the whole river
                    systems of Upper India as far east as Oudh and Allahâbâd, with the Himalayas as
                    its northern and the Vindhyâ ranges as its southern boundary. The conquest of
                    the vast new tracts thus included seems not to have commenced till the close of
                    the Rig-Vedic era, and it must have been the work of many generations. During
                    this advance the simple faith of the Rig-Vedic singers was first adorned with
                    stately rites, and then extinguished beneath them. The race progressed from a
                    loose confederacy of tribes into several well-knit nations, each bound together
                    by the strong central force of kingly power, directed by a powerful priesthood
                    and organized on a firm basis of caste.</p>
                <p>Whence arose this new constitution of the Aryan tribes into nations, with castes,
                    priests, and kings <hi rend="italic">1 We</hi> have seen that, although in their
                    earlier colonies on the Indus each father was priest in his family, yet the
                    chieftain, or lord of the settlers, called in some man specially learned in holy
                    offerings to conduct the great tribal sacrifices. Such men were highly honoured,
                    and the famous quarrel which runs throughout the whole <hi rend="italic"
                    >Veda</hi> sprang from the claims of two rival sages, Vashishtha and Visvâmitra,
                    to perform one of these ceremonies. The art of writing was unknown, and the
                    hymns and sacrificial words had to be handed down by word of mouth from father
                    to son. It thus happened that the families who learned them by heart became, as
                    it were, the hereditary owners of the liturgies required at the most solemn
                    offerings to the gods. Members of these households were chosen again and again
                    to conduct the tribal sacrifices, to chant the battle-hymn, to implore the
                    divine aid, or to pray away the divine wrath. Even the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Rig-Veda</hi> recognizes the importance of these sacrifices. “That king,” says
                    a verse, “before whom marches the priest, he alone dwells well-established in
                    his own house, to him the people bow down. The king who gives wealth to the
                    priest, he will conquer, him the gods will protect.” The tribesmen first hoped,
                    then believed, that a hymn or prayer which had once acted successfully, and been
                    followed by victory, would again produce the same results. The hymns became a
                    valuable family property for those who had composed or learned them. The <hi
                    rend="italic">Rig-Veda</hi> tells how the prayer of Vashishtha prevailed “in the
                    battle of the ten kings,” and how that of Visvâmitra “preserves the tribe of the
                    Bhârats.” The potent prayer was termed <hi rend="italic">brdhma</hi><hi
                    rend="italic subscript"> t</hi> and he who offered it <hi rend="italic"
                    >brdhman.</hi> Woe to all who despised either! “Whosoever,” says the <hi
                    rend="italic">Rig-Veda,</hi> “scoffs at the prayer <hi rend="italic"
                    >{frdhma)</hi> which we have made, may hot plagues come upon him, may the sky
                    burn up that hater of Brâhmans” <hi rend="italic">(frdhma-dvish</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">∖</hi> Certain families thus came to have, not only an hereditary
                    claim to conduct the great sacrifices, but also the exclusive knowledge of the
                    ancient hymns, or at any rate of the traditions which explained their symbolical
                    meaning. They naturally tried to render the ceremonies solemn and imposing. By
                    degrees a vast array of ministrants grew up around each of the greater
                    sacrifices. There were first the officiating priests and their assistants, who
                    prepared the sacrificial ground, dressed the altar, slew the victims, and poured
                    out the libations; second, the chanters of the Vedic hymns; third, the reciters
                    of other parts of the service; fourth, the superior priests, who watched over
                    the whole, and corrected any mistakes.</p>
                <p>Meanwhile other castes had been gradually formed. As the Aryans moved eastwards
                    from the Indus, some of the warriors were more fortunate than others, or
                    received larger shares of the conquered lands. Such families had not to till
                    their fields with their own hands, but could leave that work to be done by the
                    aboriginal races whom they subdued. In this way there grew up a class of
                    warriors, freed from the labour of husbandry, who surrounded the chief or king,
                    and were always ready for Rattle. It seems likely that these kinsmen and
                    “companions of the king” formed an important class among the early Aryan tribes
                    in India, as they certainly did among the ancient branches of the race in
                    Europe, and still do at the petty courts of India. Their old Sanskrit names, <hi
                    rend="italic">Kshattriya, Rdjanya,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Rajbansi,</hi>
                    mean “connected with the royal power,” or “of the royal line”; their usual
                    modern name <hi rend="italic">Rdjput</hi> means “of royal descent.” In process
                    of time, when the Aryans settled down, not as mere fighting clans, but as
                    powerful nations, in the middle land along the Jumna and Ganges, this warrior
                    class grew in numbers and in power. The black races had been reduced to serfdom,
                    or driven back into the Himalayas and the Vindhyâs, on the north and the south
                    of that fertile tract. The incessant fighting, which had formed the common lot
                    of the tribes on their actual migration eastwards from the Indus, ceased. A
                    section of the people laid· aside their arms, and devoted themselves to
                    agriculture or other peaceful pursuits. The sultry heats of the Middle Land must
                    also have abated their old northern energy, and led them to love repose. Those
                    who, from family ties or from personal inclination, preferred a soldier’s life
                    had to go beyond the frontier to find an enemy. Distant expeditions of this sort
                    could be undertaken much less conveniently by the husbandman than in the ancient
                    time, when his fields lay on the very border of the enemy’s country, and had
                    just been wrested from it. Such expeditions required and developed a class of
                    regular soldiers whose presence was not constantly needed at home for tilling
                    the land. The old warrior companions and kinsmen of the king formed a nucleus
                    round which gathered all the more daring spirits, and laid the foundation of a
                    military caste. The Aryans on the Ganges, in the “Middle Land,” thus found
                    themselves divided into three classes-first, the priests, or Brâhmans; second,
                    the warriors and king’s companions, called in ancient times Kshattriyas, at the
                    present day Râjputs; third, the husbandmen, or agricultural settlers, who
                    retained the old name of Vaisyas, from the root <hi rend="italic">vis,</hi>
                    which in the Vedic period had included the whole “people.” These three classes
                    gradually became distinct castes; intermarriage between them ceased, and each
                    kept more and more strictly to its hereditary employment. But they were all
                    recognized as belonging to the “twice-born” or Aryan race, were all present at
                    the great national <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit12newyrich/page/n805/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0912-0805-0782"/> sacrifices, and all worshipped the same bright
                    gods. Beneath them was a fourth or servile class, called Sùdras, the remnants of
                    the vanquished aboriginal tribes whose lives had been spared. These were “the
                    slave-bands of black descent,” the Dâsas of the <hi rend="italic">Veda.</hi>
                    They were distinguished from their “twice-born” Aryan conquerors as being only
                    “once-born,” and by many contemptuous epithets. They were not allowed to be
                    present at the great national sacrifices, nor at the feasts which followed them.
                    They could never rise from their servile condition, and to them was assigned the
                    severest toil in the fields, and all the hard and dirty work of the village
                    community. Of the four Indian castes, three had a tendency to increase. As the
                    Aryan conquests spread, more aboriginal tribes were reduced to serfdom as
                    Sιidras. The warriors, or Kshattriyas, would constantly receive additions from
                    the more wealthy or enterprising members of the cultivating class. When an
                    expedition or migration went forth to subdue new territory, all the colonists
                    would for a time lead a military life, and their sons would probably all regard
                    themselves as Kshattriyas. In ancient times entire tribes, and at the present
                    day the mass of the population throughout large tracts, thus claim to be of the
                    warrior or Râjput caste. Moreover, the kings and chief fighting-men of
                    aboriginal races who, without being conquered by the Aryans, entered into
                    alliance with them, would likely assume names of the warrior or Kshattriya rank.
                    We see this process going on before our eyes among many of the aboriginal
                    peoples. The Brâhmans, in their turn, seem at first to have received into their
                    body distinguished families of Kshattriyan descent. In later times, too, we find
                    that sections of aboriginal races were “manufactured” into Brâhmans. The Vaisya
                    or cultivating caste did not tend in this manner to increase. No one felt
                    ambitious to win his way into it, except perhaps the poor Sùdras, to whom any
                    change of condition was forbidden. The Vaisyas themselves tended in early times
                    to rise into the more honourable warrior class, and at a later period to be
                    mingled with the labouring multitude of Sùdras and mixed descent. In many
                    provinces they have almost disappeared as a distinct caste from the modern
                    population. In ancient India, as at the present day, the three conspicuous
                    castes were (1) the priests and (2) warriors, of Aryan birth, and (3) the serfs
                    or Sudras, the remnants of earlier races. The Kshattriyas or Râjputs, at any
                    rate in some parts of India, seem to represent a quite separate ethnical
                    movement from that of the Brahmans—that is to say, either a different Aryan
                    migration into India, or an altogether distinct race of perhaps Scythic origin.
                    The Sùdras had no rights, and, once conquered, ceased to struggle against their
                    fate. But a long contest raged between the priests and warriors for the chief
                    place in the Aryan commonwealth.</p>
                <p>In order to understand that contest, we must go back to the time when the priests
                    and warriors were simply fellow-tribesmen. The priestly or Brâhman caste grew
                    slowly out of the families of Rishis who composed the Vedic hymns, or were
                    chosen to conduct the great tribal sacrifices. In after times the whole Brâhman
                    population of India pretended to trace their descent from seven Rishis. But the
                    composers of the Vedic hymns were sometimes kings or distinguished warriors
                    rather than priests; the <hi rend="italic">Veda</hi> itself speaks of these
                    royal Rishis <hi rend="italic">{Pajarshis).</hi> When the Brâhmans put forward
                    their claim to the highest rank, the warriors or Kshattriyas were slow to admit
                    it; and, when the Brâhmans went a step farther, and declared that only members
                    of their families could be priests, or gain admission into the priestly caste,
                    the warriors disputed their pretensions. In later ages the Brâhmans, having the
                    exclusive keeping of the sacred writings, effaced from them, as far as possible,
                    all traces of the struggle. They taught that their caste had come forth from the
                    mouth of God, divinely appointed to the priesthood from the beginning of time.
                    Nevertheless, a large body of Vedic verses and Sanskrit texts has now been
                    brought to bear upon the struggle between the Brâhmans and Kshattriyas for the
                    highest rank. <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi></p>
                <p>In many of the Aryan tribes, however, the priests failed to establish themselves
                    as an exclusive order. Indeed, the four castes, and especially the Brâhman
                    caste, seem only to have obtained their full development amid the plenty of the
                    Middle Land <hi rend="italic">(Madhyadeshd),</hi> watered by the Jumna and the
                    Ganges. The earlier Aryan settlements to the west of the Indus remained outside
                    the caste system; the later Aryan offshoots to the south and east of the middle
                    land only partially carried that system with them. But in the Middle Land
                    itself, with Delhi as its western capital and the great cities of Ajodhya and
                    Benares on its eastern frontier, the Brâhmans grew by degrees into a compact,
                    learned, and supremely influential body, the makers of Sanskrit literature.
                    Their language, their religion, and their laws became in after times the
                    standards aimed at throughout all India. They naturally denounced all who did
                    not submit to their pretensions, and stigmatized the other Aryan settlements who
                    had not accepted their caste system as lapsed tribes or outcastes (<hi
                    rend="italic">Vrishalas).</hi> Among the lists of such fallen races we read the
                    name afterwards applied to the Ionians or Greeks <hi rend="italic"
                    >Havanas).</hi> The Brâhmans of the middle land had not only to enforce their
                    supremacy over the powerful warriors of their own kingdoms, but to extend it
                    among the Aryan tribes who had never fully accepted the caste system. That must
                    have been the slow work of ages, and it seems to have led to bitter feuds. See

                <p>While the Brahmans claimed religion, theology, and philosophy as their special
                    domain, and the chief sciences and arts as supplementary sections of their
                    divinely-inspired knowledge, they secured their social supremacy by codes of
                    law. Their earliest <hi rend="italic">Dhαrmα-sdstras,</hi> or legal writings,
                    belong to the Sûtra period, or scholastic development, of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Veda.</hi> But their two great digests, upon which the fabric of Hindu
                    jurisprudence has been built up, are of later date. The first of these, the code
                    of Manu, is separated from the Vedic era by a series of Brahmanical
                    developments, of which we possess only a few of the intermediate links. It is a
                    compilation of the customary law current probably about the 5th century <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">b.c.,</hi> and exhibits the social organization which the
                    Brahmans, after their <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi> The quarrel between the two
                    sages Visvämitra and Vashishtha, which runs through the whole <hi rend="italic"
                    >Veda,</hi> is typical of this struggle. Visvämitra stands as a representative
                    of the royal-warrior rank, who claims to perform a great public sacrifice. The
                    white-robed Vashishtha represents the Brahmans or hereditary priesthood, and
                    opposes the warrior’s claim. In the end Visvämitra established his title to
                    conduct the sacrifice; but the Brahmans explain this by saying that his virtues
                    and austerities won admission for him into the priestly family of Bhrigus. He
                    thus became a Brâhman, and could lawfully fill the priestly office. Visvämitra
                    serves as a typical link, not only between the priestly and the worldly castes,
                    but also between the sacred and the profane sciences. He was the legendary
                    founder of the art of war, and his son Susrα-fa is quoted as the earliest
                    authority on Indian medicine. These two sciences of war and medicine form <hi
                    rend="italic">upa-Vedas,</hi> or supplementary sections of the divinely inspired
                    knowledge of the Brâhmans. Another royal Rishi, Vitahavya, “attained the
                    condition of Brâhmanhood, venerated by mankind,” by a word of the saintly
                    Bhrigu. Parasu-Râma, the divine champion of the Brâhmans, was of warrior descent
                    by his mother’s side. Manu, their legislator, sprang from the warrior caste; and
                    his father is expressly called “the seed of all the Kshattriyas.” But when the
                    Brâhmans had firmly established their supremacy they became reluctant to allow
                    the possibility of even princes finding an entrance into their sacred order.
                    King Ganaka was more learned than all the Brâhmans at his court, and performed
                    terrible penances to attain to Brâhmanhood. Yet the legends leave it doubtful
                    whether he gained his desire. The still more holy but probably later Matanga
                    wore his body to skin and bone by a thousand years of austerities, and was held
                    from falling by the hand of Indra himself. Nevertheless, he could not attain to
                    Brâhmanhood. The reformer, Gautama Buddha, who in the 6th century before Christ
                    overthrew the Brâhman supremacy, and founded a new religion, was a prince of
                    warrior descent, perhaps born in too late an age to be adopted into and utilized
                    by the Brâhman caste.</p>

                <p>successful struggle for the supremacy, had established in the Middle Land of
                    Bengal. The Brahmans, indeed, claimed for their laws a divine origin, and
                    ascribed them to the first Manu, or Aryan man, 30 millions of years ago. But, as
                    a matter of fact, the laws of Manu are the result of a series of attempts to
                    codify the usages of some not very extensive centre of Brahmanism in northern
                    India,—a metrical digest of local customs condensed by degrees from a legendary
                    mass of 100,000 couplets <hi rend="italic">(slokas)</hi> into 2684. They may
                    possibly have been reduced to their final form of a written code with a view to
                    securing the system of caste against the popular movement of Buddhism, and thus
                    giving a rigid fixity to the privileges of the Brahmans.</p>
                <p>The second great code of the Hindus, that of Yâjnavalkya, belongs to a period
                    when Buddhism had established itself, and probably to a territory where it was
                    beginning to succumb to the Brâhmanical reaction. It represents the Brâhmanical
                    side of the great contro-versv (although a section of it deals with the
                    organization of monasteries), refers to the execution of deeds on metal plates,
                    and altogether marks an advance in legal precision. Its compilation belongs to a
                    period apparently not earlier than the 2d century A.D., and certainly not later
                    than the 6th or 7th.</p>
                <p>These codes deal with Hindu law in three branches, namely—(1) domestic and civil
                    rights and duties, (2) the administration of justice, (3) purification and
                    penance. They stereotyped the unwritten usages which regulated the family life
                    and social organization of the old Aryan communities in the middle land. They
                    did not pretend to supply a body of law for all the numerous races of India, but
                    only for Hindu communities of the Brâhmanical type. It is do ιbtful whether they
                    quite accurately represent the actual customary law even in such communities,
                    for they were apparently drawn up with a view to asserting and maintaining the
                    special privileges of the Brâhmans. This they effect by a rigid demarcation of
                    the employments of the people, each caste or division of a caste having its own
                    hereditary occupation assigned to it; by stringent rules against intermingling
                    the castes by marriage; by forbidding the higher castes, under severe penalties,
                    to eat or drink or hold social intercourse with the lower; and by punishing the
                    lower castes with still.more cnιel penances for defiling by their touch the
                    higher castes, or in any way infringing on their privileges. They exhibit the
                    Hindu community in the four ancient divisions of priests, warriors, cultivators,
                    and serfs (sιidrαs). But they disclose that this old Aryan classification failed
                    to represent the actual facts even of the Aryan communities in northern India.
                    They admit that the mass of the people did not belong to anyone of the four
                    castes, and ascribe its origin to mixed concubinage or illicit connexions. The
                    ancient Brâhmanical communities in northern India, as revealed by the codes
                    themselves, consisted—first, of an Aryan element divided into priests, warriors,
                    and cultivators, all of whom bore the proud title of the twice-born, and wore
                    the sacred thread; second, of the subjugated races, “the once-born” Siidras; and
                    third, of the vast residue of the Varna-sankara, literally the “mingled
                    colours,” a great but uncertain number of castes to whom was assigned a mixed
                    descent from the four recognized classes. The same division exists to this day.
                    According to the census of 1871, the separate tribes an I castes in Lower Bengal
                    do not fall short of a thousand; in the North-Western Provinces the Hindu
                    population was arranged under two hundred and ninety-one specified castes
                    besides numerous subdivisions. The distinctly recognized “mixed castes”
                    throughout British India cannot be estimated at less than three hundred, and
                    probably amount to many more.</p>
                <p>As the Brâhmans spread their influence eastwards and southwards from the Middle
                    Land, they carried their codes with them. The number of their sacred law books
                    <hi rend="italic">(Dharma-s&lt;istras)</hi> amounted to at least fifty-six, and
                    separate schools of Hindu law sprang up. Thus the Dàyabhaga version of the law
                    of inheritance prevails in Bengal while the Mitâksharâ commentary on Yâjnavalkya
                    is current in Madras and throughout southern and western India. But all modern
                    recensions of Hindu law rest upon the ancient codes; and these codes, as we have
                    seen, only recorded the usages of certain B <hi rend="subscript"> t</hi>
                    αhmanical centres in the north, and perhaps did not fairly record <hi
                    rend="superscript"> e</hi> J <hi rend="superscript"> e</hi> l <hi

                    rend="superscript"> 1</hi> ' ^A∙ <hi rend="superscript"> s</hi>. Brahmans
                    gradually moulded the population of India into Hinduism, such codes proved too
                    narrow a basis for dealing with the rights, duties, and social organization of
                    the people. The later Hindu legislators, accordingly, inculcated the recognition
                    of the local usages or land-law of each part of the country, and of each class
                    or tribe. While binding together and preserving the historical unity of the
                    Aryan twice-born castes by systems of law founded on their ancient codes, they
                    made provision for the customs and diverse stages of civilization of the ruder
                    peoples of India, over whom they established their ascendency. By such
                    provisions, alike in religion and law, the Brâhmans incorporated the Indian
                    races into that loosely coherent mass known as the Hindu population.</p>
                <p>. It is to this plastic element that Hinduism owes its success; and it is an
                    element which English administrators have sometimes overlooked. The races of
                    British India exhibit many stages of domestic institutions from the polyandry of
                    the Nairs to the polygamy of the Kulin Brâhmans. The structure of their
                    industrial organization varies, from the nomadic husbandry of the Burmese to the
                    long chain of tenures which in Bengal stretches from the proprietor through a
                    series of middle-men to the actual tiller of the soil. Every stage in human
                    progress is represented, from the hunting tribes of the central plateau to the
                    rigid trade-guilds of Guzerat. The Hindu legislators recognized tnat each of
                    these diverse stages of social development had its own usages and common law.
                    Vriha-spati says: “The laws <hi rend="italic">(dha,rma)</hi> practised by the
                    various countries, castes, and tribes, they are to be preserved; otherwise the
                    people are agitated.” Dévala says: “Whit gods there are in any country, . . .
                    and whatsoever be the custom and law anywhere, they are not to be despised
                    there; the law there is such.” Varâhamihira sajs: “The custom of the country is
                    first to be considered; what is the rule in each country, that is to be done.”
                    The most learned English scholar in southern India has thus summed up the
                    matter: “By custom only can the Dharma-sâstra [Hindu law] be the rule of others
                    than Brâhmans [only one-thirtieth of the population of Madras], and even in the
                    case of Brahmans it is very often superseded by custom.”<note anchored="true"

                <p>The English, on assuming the government of India, wisely declared that they would
                    administer justice according to the customs of the people. But the high courts
                    enforce the Brâhmanical codes with a comprehensiveness and precision unknown in
                    ancient India. Thus in Bengal the custom of <hi rend="italic">sagai,</hi> by
                    which deserted or divorced wives among the lower castes marry again, was lately
                    tried according to “the spirit of Hindu law ”; while in Madras learned judges
                    have pointed out a divergence between the Hindu law as now administered and the
                    actual usages of the people. Those usages are unwritten and uncertain. The Hindu
                    law is printed in many accessible forms, and Hindu barristers are ever pressing
                    its principles upon the courts. Efforts at comprehensive codification in British
                    India are thus surrounded by special difficulties, for it would be improper to
                    give the fixity of a code to all the unwritten half-fluid usages current among
                    the three-hundred unhomogeneous castes of Hindus, while it might be fraught with
                    future injustice to exclude any of them. Each age has the gift of adjusting its
                    institutions to its actual wants, especially among tribes whose customs have not
                    been reduced to written law. Many of those customs will, if left to themselves,
                    die out; others of them, that prove suited to the new social developments under
                    British rule, will live. But the process of natural selection must be, to some
                    extent, the work of time, and not a single act of conscious legislation. This
                    has been recognized by the ablest of Anglo-Indian codifiers. They apply the word
                    code to the systematic arrangement of the rales relating to some well-marked
                    section of juristic rights, or to some executive department of the
                    administration of justice. “In its larger sense,” write the Indian Law
                    Commissioners, 1879, “of a general assemblage of ail the laws of a community, no
                    attempt has yet been made in this country to satisfy the conception of a code.
                    The time for its realization has manifestly not arrived.”</p>
                <p>The Brahmans were not merely the depositaries of the sacred books, the
                    philosophy, the science, and the laws of the ancient Hindu commonwealth; they
                    were also the creators and custodians of its secular literature. They had a
                    practical monopoly of Vedic learning, and their policy was to trace back every
                    branch of knowledge and intellectual effort to the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Veda.</hi></p>
                <p>In order to understand the long domination of the Brâhmans and the influence
                    which they still wield, it is necessary to keep in mind their position as the
                    great literary caste. Their priestly supremacy has been repeatedly assailed, and
                    was during a space of several hundred years overthrown. But throughout
                    twenty-two centuries they have been the counsellors of Hindu princes and the
                    teachers of the Hindu people. They represent the early Aryan civilization of
                    India; and the essential history of the Hindus is a narrative of the attacks
                    upon the continuity of that civilization,—that is to say, of attacks upon the
                    Brâhmanical system of the Middle Land, and <hi rend="superscript"> -</hi> of the
                    modifications and compromises to which that system has had to submit. Those
                    attacks range themselves under six epochs :—first, the religious uprising of the
                    half-Brâhmanized Aryan tribes on the east of the Middle Land, initiated by the
                    preaching of Buddha in the 6th century <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.,</hi>

                    into modern Hinduism about the 8th ceutury A.D.; second, warlike inroads of
                    non-Brâhmanical Aryans or other races from the west, commencing with the Greek
                    invasions in the 4th century <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.,</hi> and continuing

                    tribes of India and of the non-Aryan low-castes incorporated from them, —an
                    influence ever at work, indeed by far the most powerful agent in dissolving
                    Brâhmanism into Hinduism, but represented in a special manner by the non-Aryan

                    which resulted from this compromise between Brâhmanism and aboriginal worship, a
                    reaction which received an impetus from the preaching of Sankar-Achârjya, who
                    founded a philosophical Sivaite sect in the 8th or 9th century, and received its
                    full development under a line of great Vishnuvite reformers from the 12th to the

                    English supremacy, and the great popular upheaval which it has produced in the

                <p>The first great solvent of Brâhmanism was the teaching of Buddha. The life of
                    this celebrated man has three sides,—its personal aspects, its legendary
                    developments, and its religious consequences upon mankind. In his own person
                    Buddha appears as a prince and preacher of ancient India. In the legendary
                    developments of history Buddha ranks as a divine teacher among his followers, as
                    an incarnation of Vishnu among the Hindus, and apparently as a saint of the
                    Christian church, with a day assigned to him in both the Greek and Roman
                    calendars. As a religious founder he left behind him a system of beliefs which
                    has gained more disciples than any other creed in the world, and which, after a
                    lapse of twenty-four centuries, is now professed by 500 millions of people, or
                    more than one-third of the human race.</p>

                    vol. iv. p. 424. In this place it is unnecessary to give more than a brief
                    sketch of the history of Buddhism in India.</p>
                <p>On the death of Buddha, five hundred of his disciples met in a cave near
                    Râjâgriha, to gather together his sayings. This was. the first council. They
                    chanted the lessons of their master in three great divisions—the words of Buddha
                    to his disciples, his code of discipline, and his system of doctrine. These
                    became the three collections of Buddha’s teaching, and the word for a Buddhist
                    council means literally “a singing together.” A century afterwards, a second
                    council of seven hundred was held at Vaisali, to settle disputes between the
                    more and the less strict followers of Buddhism. It condemned a system of ten
                    “indulgences” which had grown up, but it led to the separation of the Buddhists
                    into two hostile parties, who afterwards split into eighteen or more sects.</p>
                <p>During the next two hundred years Buddhism spread over northern India, perhaps
                    receiving a new impulse from the Greek kingdoms in the Punjab. About 244 B.c.
                    Asoka, the king of Magadha or Behar, became a zealous convert to Buddhism. He is
                    said to have supported 64,000 Buddhist priests; he founded many religious
                    houses, and his kingdom is called the Land of the Monasteries (Vihâra or Behar)
                    to this day. He did for Buddhism what Constantine afterwards effected for
                    Christianity; he organized it on the basis of a state religion. This he
                    accomplished by five means—by a council to settle the faith, by edicts
                    promulgating its principles, by a state department to watch over its purity, by
                    missionaries to spread its doctrines, and by an authoritative collection of its
                    sacred books. In 244 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> Asoka convened at Patnâ the
                    third Buddhist council of one thousand elders. Evil men, taking on them the
                    yellow robe of the order, had given forth their own opinions as the teaching of
                    Buddha. Such heresies were now corrected; and the Buddhism of southern Asia
                    practically dates from Asoka’s council. In a number of edicts, both before and
                    after the synod, he published throughout India the grand principles of the
                    faith. Such edicts are still found graven deep upon pillars, in caves, and on
                    rocks, from the Yusafzai valley beyond Peshâwar on the north-western frontier,
                    through the heart of Hindustân, to Kâthiâwâr and the Central Provinces on the
                    south and Orissa in the east. Tradition states that Asoka set up 64,000 memorial
                    columns or topes; and the thirty inscriptions extant in our own day show how
                    widely these royal sermons were spread over India. In the year of the council,
                    the king also founded a state department to watch over the purity and to direct
                    the spread of the faith. A minister of justice and religion (Dharma Mahâmâtra)
                    directed its operations∣ and, one of .its first duties being to proselytize, he
                    was specially charged with the welfare of the aborigines among whom its
                    missionaries were sent. Asoka did not think it enough to convert the inferior
                    races without looking after their material interests. Wells were to be dug and
                    trees planted along the roads; a system of medical aid was established
                    throughout his kingdom and the conquered provinces, as far as Ceylon, for both
                    man and beast. Officers were appointed to watch over domestic life and public
                    morality, and to promote instruction among the women as well as the youth.</p>
                <p>Asoka recognized proselytism by peaceful means as a state duty. The rock
                    inscriptions record how he sent forth missionaries “to the utmost limits of the
                    barbarian countries,” to “intermingle among all unbelievers” for the spread of
                    religion. They shall mix equally with Brâhmans and beggars, with the dreaded and
                    the despised, both within the kingdom “and in foreign countries, teaching better
                    things.” Conversion is to be effected by persuasion, not by the sword. Buddhism
                    was at once the most intensely missionary religion in the world and the most
                    tolerant. This character of a proselytizing faith which wins its victories by
                    peaceful means, so strongly impressed upon it by Asoka, has remained a prominent
                    feature of Buddhism to the present day. Asoka, however, not only took measures
                    to spread the religion; he also endeavoured to secure its orthodoxy. He
                    collected the body of doctrine into an authoritative version, in the Magadhi
                    language or dialect of his central kingdom in Behar,—a version which for two
                    thousand years has formed the canon <hi rend="italic">(pitakas)</hi> of the
                    southern Buddhists.</p>
                <p>The fourth and last of the great councils was held under King Kanishka, according
                    to one tradition, four hundred years after Buddha’s death. The date of Kanishka
                    is still uncertain; but, from the evidence of coins and inscriptions, his reign
                    has been fixed in the 1st century after Christ, or, say, 40 <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >a.d.</hi> Kanishka, the most famous of the Saka conquerors, ruled over
                    north-western India and the adjoining countries. His authority had its nucleus
                    in Kashmir, but it extended to both sides of the Himâlayas, from Yarkand and
                    Khokan to Agra and Sind. His council of five hundred compiled three commentaries
                    on the Buddhist faith. These commentaries supplied in part materials for the
                    Tibetan or northern canon, drawn up at a subsequent period. The northern canon,
                    or, as the Chinese proudly call it, the “greater vehicle of the law,” includes
                    many later corruptions or developments of the Indian faith as originally
                    embodied by Asoka (244 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi>) in the “lesser vehicle,”
                    or canon of the southern Buddhists.</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit12newyrich/page/n808/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0912-0808-0785"/>
                <p>The Kanishka commentaries were written in the Sanskrit language, perhaps because
                    the Kashmir and northern priests who formed his council belonged to isolated
                    Aryan colonies, which had been little influenced by the growth of the Indian
                    vernacular dialects. In this way Kanishka and his Kashmir council (Î 40 <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">a.d.)</hi> became in some degree to the northern or Tibetan
                    Buddhists what Asoka and his Patnâ council (244 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.)</hi>
                    had been to the Buddhists of Ceylon and the south.</p>
                <p>The missionary impulse given by Asoka quickly bore fruit In the year after his
                    great council at Patnâ. his son Mahindo carried Asoka’s version of the Buddhist
                    scriptures in the Magadhi language to Ceylon. He took with him a band of fellow
                    missionaries; and soon afterwards his sister, the princess Sanghamitta, who had
                    entered the order, followed with a company of nuns. It was not, however, till
                    six hundred years later (410-432 A.D.) that the holy books were rendered into
                    Pâli, the sacred language of the southern Buddhists. About the same time
                    missionaries from Ceylon finally established the faith in Burmah (450 A.D.). The
                    Burmese themselves assert that two Buddhist preachers landed in Pegu as early as
                    207 RC. Some indeed place their arrival just after the Patnâ council (244 B.C.),
                    and point out the ruined city of Tha-ton, between the Tsi-tang and Salwin
                    estuaries, as the scene of their pious labours. Siam was converted to Buddhism
                    in 638 <hi rend="smallcaps">a.d.;</hi> Java received its missionaries direct
                    from India between the 5th and the 7th centuries, and spread the faith to Bali
                    and Sumatra. While southern Buddhism was thus wafted across the ocean, another
                    stream of missionaries had found its way by Central Asia into China. Their first
                    arrival in that empire is said to date from the 2d century B.C., although it was
                    not till 65 <hi rend="smallcaps">a.d.</hi> that Buddhism there became an
                    established religion. The Graeco-Bactrian kingdoms in the Punjab and beyond it
                    afforded a favourable soil for the faith. The Scythian dynasties that succeeded
                    them accepted it, and the earliest remains which recent discovery has unearthed
                    in Afghânistân are Buddhist. Kanishka’s council, soon after the commencement of
                    the Christian era, gave a fresh impetus to the faith. Tibet, south Central Asia,
                    and China lay along the great missionary routes of northern Buddhism; the
                    Kirghis are said to have carried Buddhist settlements as far west as the
                    Caspian; on the east, the religion was introduced into the Korea in 372 <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">a.d.,</hi> and thence into Japan in 552.</p>
                <p>Buddhism never ousted Brâhmanism from any large part of India. The two systems
                    co-existed as popular religions during more than a thousand years (244 <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> to about 800 <hi rend="smallcaps">λ.d.),</hi> and
                    modern Hinduism is the joint product of both. Certain kings and certain eras
                    were intensely Buddhistic; but the continuous existence of Brâhmanism is
                    abundantly proved from the time of Alexander (327 <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >b,c.)</hi> downwards. The historians who chronicled his march, and the Greek
                    ambassador Megasthenes, who succeeded them (300 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.)</hi>
                    in their literary labours, bear witness to the predominance of the old faith in
                    the period immediately preceding Asoka. Inscriptions, local legends, Sanskrit
                    literature, and the drama disclose the survival of Brâhman influence during the
                    next six centuries (244 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> to 400 <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">a.d.),</hi> From 400 <hi rend="smallcaps">a.</hi> I), we have
                    the evidence of the Chinese pilgrims, who toiled through Central Asia into India
                    as the birthplace of their faith. Fa-Hian entered India from Afghânistân, and
                    journeyed down the whole Gangetic valley to the Bay of Bengal in 399-413 <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">a.d.</hi> He found Brâhman priests equally honoured with
                    Buddhist monks, and temples to the Indian gods side by side with the religious
                    houses of his own faith. Hwen Tsang also travelled to India from China by the
                    Central Asia route, and has left a fuller record of the state of the two
                    religions in the 7th century. His journey extended from 629 to 645 <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">a.d.,</hi> and everywhere throughout India he found the two
                    faiths eagerly competing for the suffrages of the people. By that time, indeed,
                    Brâhmanism was beginning to assert itself at the expense of the other religion.
                    The monuments of the great Buddhist monarchs, Asoka and Kanishka, confronted him
                    from the time he neared the Punjab frontier; but so also did the temples of Siva
                    and his “dread” queen Bhimâ. Throughout north-western India he found Buddhist
                    convents and monks surrounded by “swarms of heretics.” The political power was
                    also divided, although the Buddhist sovereigns predominated. A Buddhist monarch
                    ruled over ten kingdoms in Afghânistân. At Peshâwar the great monastery built by
                    Kanishka was deserted, but the populace remained faithful. In Kashmir king and
                    people were devout Buddhists, under the teaching of five hundred monasteries and
                    five thousand monks. In the country identified with Jâipur, on the other hand,
                    the inhabitants were devoted to heresy and war.</p>
                <p>Buddhist influence in northern India seems, during the 7th century <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">a.d.,</hi> to have centred in the fertile doâb or plain between
                    the Jumna and the Ganges. At Kanauj (Kanyâkubja), on the latter river, Hwen
                    Tsang found a powerful Buddhist monarch, Silâditya, whose influence reached from
                    the Punjab to north-eastern Bengal, and from the Himâlayas to the Narbadâ river.
                    There flourished one hundred Buddhist convents and ten thousand monks. But the
                    king’s eldest brother had been lately slain by a sovereign of eastern India, a
                    hater of Buddhism; and two hundred temples to the Brâhman gods reared their
                    heads under the protection of the devout Silâditya himself. This monarch seems
                    to have been an Asoka of the 7th century <hi rend="smallcaps">a.d.,</hi> and he
                    practised with primitive vigour the two great Buddhist virtues of spreading of
                    the faith and charity. The former he attempted by means of a general council in
                    634 A.D. Twenty-one tributary sovereigns attended, together with the most
                    learned Brâhman and Buddhist monks of their kingdoms. But the sole object of the
                    convocation was no longer the undisputed assertion of the Buddhist religion. It
                    dealt with the two distinct phases of the religious life of India. First there
                    was a discussion between the Buddhists and Brâhmans, especially of the Sânkhya
                    and Vaiseshika schools, and then followed a dispute between the two Buddhist
                    sects who followed respectively the northern and the southern canons, known as
                    “the greater and the lesser vehicle of the law.” The rites of the populace were
                    of as composite a character as the doctrines of their teachers. On the first day
                    of the council a statue of Buddha was installed with great pomp; on the second,
                    an image of the sun-god; on the third, a figure of Siva.</p>
                <p>Silâditya held a solemn distribution of his royal treasures every five years.
                    Hwen Tsang describes how on the plain near Allahâbâd, where the Ganges and the
                    Jumna unite their waters, all the kings of the empire, and a vast multitude of
                    people, were feasted for seventy-five days. Silâditya brought forth the stores
                    of his palace, and gave them away to Brâhmans and Buddhists, monks and heretics,
                    without distinction. At the end of the festival he stripped off his jewels and
                    royal raiment, gave them to the bystanders, and, like Buddha of old, put on the
                    rags of a beggar. By this ceremony the monarch commemorated the Great
                    Renunciation of the founder of the Buddhist faith, and at the same time
                    practised the highest duty inculcated alike by the Buddhist and Brâhmanical
                    religions, namely, almsgiving. Hwen Tsang describes a distribution on a smaller
                    scale in the western kingdom of Valabhi <hi rend="italic">(circa</hi> 636 <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">a.d.).</hi> “For seven days every year the king holds a great
                    assembly at which he distributes to the multitude of recluses choice dishes, the
                    three garments, medicine, the seven precious things, and rare objects of <pb

                    buys them back at double price.” The intellect of this king, we are told, was
                    weak and narrow.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi

                    charity” seem to have been held by many Buddhist princes in memory of the Great
                    Renunciation. The vast monastery of Nalanda in Behar formed a seat of learning
                    which recalls the universities of mediaeval Europe. Ten thousand monks and
                    novices of the eighteen schools there studied theology, philosophy, law,
                    science, especially medicine, and practised their devotions. They were supported
                    from the royal funds.</p>
                <p>Hwen Tsang travelled from the Punjab to the mouth of the Ganges, and made
                    journeys into southern India. But everywhere he found the two religions mingled.
                    Gayâ, which holds so high a sanctity in the legends of Buddha, had already
                    become a great Brâhman centre. On the east of Bengal, Assam had never been
                    converted to Buddhism. In the south-west, Orissa was a stronghold of the faith;
                    at the seaport of Tamluk at the mouth of the Hügli (Hooghly ), the temples to
                    the Brâhman gods were five times more numerous than the convents of the
                    faithful. On the Madras coast Buddhism flourished; and indeed throughout
                    southern India the faith seems still to have been in the ascendant, although
                    struggling against Brâhman heretics and their gods.</p>
                <p>During the next two centuries Brâhmanism gradually became the ruling religion.
                    There are legends of persecutions instigated by Brâhman reformers, such as
                    Kumarila Bhatta and Sankar-Achârjya. But the downfall of Buddhism seems to have
                    resulted from natural decay, and from new movements of religious thought, rather
                    than from any general suppression by the sword. Its extinction is
                    contemporaneous with the rise of Hinduism, and belongs to a subsequent part of
                    this sketch. In the 11th century, only outlying states, such as Kashmir and
                    Orissa, remained faithful; and before the Mahometans fairly came upon the scene
                    Buddhism as a popular faith had disappeared from India. During the last ten
                    centuries Buddhism has been a banished religion from its native home. But it has
                    won greater triumphs in its exile than it could ever have achieved in the land
                    of its birth. It has created a literature and a religion for more than a third
                    of the human race, and has profoundly affected the beliefs of the rest. Five
                    hundred millions of men, or 35 per cent, of the inhabitants of the world, still
                    follow the teaching of Buddha. Afghânistân, Nepâl, Eastern Turkistân, Tibet,
                    Mongolia, Manchuria, China, Japan, the Eastern Archipelago, Siam, Burmah,
                    Ceylon, and India at one time marked the magnificent circumference of its
                    conquests. Its shrines and monasteries stretched in a continuous line from the
                    Caspian to the Pacific, and still extend from the confines of the Russian empire
                    to the equatorial archipelago. During twenty-four centuries Buddhism has
                    encountered and outlived a series of powerful rivals. At this day it forms one
                    of the three great religions of the world, and is more numerously followed than
                    either Christiauity or Islâm. In India its influence has survived its separate
                    existence. It not only left behind it a distinct sect, but it supplied a basis
                    upon which Brâhmanism finally developed from the creed of a caste into the
                    religion of the people. This Buddhistic influence ou Hinduism will be afterwards
                    noticed. The distinct sect is known as the <hi rend="smallcaps">Jains</hi><hi

                    The noblest survivals of Buddhism in India are to be found, not among any
                    peculiar body, but in the religion of the people; in that principle of the
                    brotherhood of man, with the reassertion of which each new revival of Hinduism
                    starts; in the asylum which the great Hindu sects afford to women wlιo have
                    fallen victims to caste rules, to the widow and the out-caste; in that
                    gentleness and charity to all men, which take the place of a poor-law in India,
                    and give a high significance to the half-satirical epithet of the “mild”

                    the passage of the Jhelum, with a force which, substituting guns for chariots,
                    exactly equalled the army of Ranjit Sinh, the ruler of the Punjab in the present

                    said to have had 200 elephants, 300 chariots, 400 horse, and 30,000 efficient
                    infantry; which, as observed by Sir A. Burnes, is (substituting guns for

                    chariots hurried out by Porus stuck in the muddy bank of the river, and in the
                    general engagement which followed his elephants refused to face the Greeks, and,
                    wheeling round, trampled his own army under foot. His son fell early in the
                    onset; Purus himself fled wounded, but, on tendering his submission, was

                <p>Alexander advanced south-east through the kingdom of the younger Porus to
                    Amritsar, and, after a sharp bend backward to the west, to fight the Cathaei at
                    Sangala, he reached the Beas (Hyphasis). There, at a spot not far from the
                    modern battlefield of Sobrâon, he halted his victorious standards.<note

                    to march to the Ganges; but his troops were worn out by the heats of the Punjab
                    summer, and their spirits broken by the hurricanes of the south-west monsoon.
                    The native tribes had already risen in his rear, and the conqueror of the world
                    was forced to turn back before he had crossed even the frontier province of
                    India. The Sutlej, the eastern districts of the Punjab, and the mighty Jumna
                    still lay between him and the Ganges. A single defeat might be fatal to his
                    army; if the battle on the Jhelum had not gone in his favour, not a Greek would
                    have reached the Afghân side of the passes. Yielding at length to the clamour of
                    his troops, lie led them back to the Jhelum. He there embarked 8000 of them in
                    boats previously prepared, and floated dυwu the river; the remainder of his army
                    marched in two divisions along the banks.</p>
                <p>The country was hostile, and the Greeks held only the land on which they
                    encamped. At Mùltân (Mooltan), then as now the capital of the southern Punjab,
                    he had to fight a pitched battle with the Malli, and was severely wounded in
                    taking the city. His enraged troops put every soul within it to the sword.
                    Farther down, near the confluence of the five rivers of the Punjab, he made a
                    long halt, built a town,—Alexandria, the modern Uchch,—and received the
                    submission of the neighbouring states. A Greek garrison and satrap, left there
                    by Alexander, laid the foundation of a lasting influence. Having constructed a
                    new fleet suitable for the greater rivers on which he was now to embark, he
                    proceeded southwards through Sind, and followed the course of the Indus until he
                    reached the ocean. In the apex of the delta he founded a city—Patala—which
                    remains to this day under the name of Hyderabad, the capital of Sind.<note

                    Alexander beheld for the first time the majestic phenomenon of the tides. One
                    part of his army he shipped off under the command of Nearchus to coast along the
                    Persian Gulf; the other he himself led through southern Baluchistân and Persia
                    to Susa, where, after terrible losses from want of water and famine on the
                    march, he arrived in 325 B.c.</p>
                <p>During his two years’ campaign in the Punjab and Sind, Alexander captured no
                    province, but he made alliances, founded cities, and planted garrisons. He had
                    trans ferred much territory to chiefs and confederacies devoted to his cause;
                    every petty court had its Greek faction; and the detachments which he left
                    behind at various positions, from the Afghân frontier to the Beas, and from near
                    the base of the Himâlayas to the Sind delta, were visible pledges of his return.
                    At Taxila (Deri-Shahan) and Nicaea (Mong) in the northern Punjab, at Alexandria
                    (Uchch) in the southern Punjab, at Patala (Hyderabad) in Sind, and at other
                    points along his route, he established military settlements of Greeks or allies.
                    A large body of his troops remained in Bactria; and, in the partition of the
                    empire which followed Alexander’s death in 323 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.,</hi>
                    Bactria and India eventually fell to Seleucus Nicator, the founder of the Syrian

                <p>Meanwhile a new power had arisen in India. Among the Indian adventurers who
                    thronged Alexander’s camp in the Punjab, each with his plot for winning a
                    kingdom or crushing a rival, Chandra Gupta, an exile from the Gangetic valley,
                    seems to have played a somewhat ignominious part. He tried to tempt the wearied
                    Greeks on the banks of the Beas with schemes of conquest in the rich
                    south-eastern provinces; but, having personally offended their leader, he had to
                    fly the camp (326 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.).</hi> In the confused years which
                    followed, he managed, with the aid of plundering hordes, to form a kingdom on

                    years which followed Alexander’s death, Chandra Gupta was building up an empire
                    in northern India. Seleucus reigned in Syria from 312 to 280 B,c., Chandra Gupta

                <p>In that year Seleucus, having recovered Babylon, proceeded to re-establish his
                    authority in Bactria and the Punjab. In the latter province he found the Greek
                    influence decayed. Alexander had left behind a mixed force of Greeks and Indians
                    at Taxila. No sooner was he gone than the Indians rose and slew the Greek
                    governor; the Macedonians massacred the Indians; a new governor, sent by
                    Alexander, murdered the friendly Punjab prince, Porus, and was himself driven
                    out of the country by the advance of Chandra Gupta from the Gangetic valley.
                    Seleucus, after a war with Chandra Gupta, determined to ally himself with the
                    new power in India rather than to oppose it. In return for five hundred
                    elephants, he ceded the Greek settlements in the Punjab and the Cabul valley,
                    gave his daughter to Chandra Gupta in marriage, and stationed an ambassador,

                    Megasthenes the Greek idea of India was a very vague one. Their historians spoke
                    of two classes of Indians,—certain mountainous tribes who dwelt in northern
                    Afghanistan under the Caucasus or Hindu Kush, and a maritime race living on the
                    coast of Baluchistan. Of the India of modera geography lying beyond the Indus
                    they practically knew nothing. It was this India to the east of the Indus that
                    Megasthenes opened up to the Western world. He describes the classification of
                    the people, dividing them, however, into seven castes instead of four,<note

                <p>The Greek ambassador observed with admiration the absence of slavery in India,
                    the chastity of the women, and the courage of the men. In valour they excelled
                    all other Asiatics; they required no locks to their doors; above all, no Indian
                    was ever known to tell a lie. Sober and industrious, good farmers, and skilful
                    artisans, they scarcely ever had recourse to a lawsuit, and lived peaceably
                    under their native chiefs. The kingly government is portrayed almost as
                    described in Manu, with its hereditary castes of councillors and soldiers.
                    Megasthenes mentions that India was divided into one hundred and eighteen
                    kingdoms; some of which, such as that of the Prasii under Chandra Gupta,
                    exercised suzerain powers. The village system is well described, each little
                    rural unit seeming to be an independent republic. Megasthenes remarked the
                    exemption of the husbandmen (Vaisyas) from war and public services, and
                    enumerates the dyes, fibres, fabrics, and products (animal, vegetable, and
                    mineral) of India. Husbandry depended on the periodical rains; and forecasts of
                    the weather, with a view to “make adequate provision against a coming
                    deficiency,” formed a special duty of the Brahmans. “The philosopher who errs in
                    his predictions observes silence for the rest of his life.”</p>
                <p>Before the year 300 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> two powerful monarchies had
                    thus begun to act upon the Brâhmanism of northern India, from the east and from
                    the west. On the east, in the Gangetic valley, Chandra Gupta (316-292 <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi>) firmly consolidated the dynasty which during the
                    next century produced Asoka (264-223 B.C.), established Buddhism throughout
                    India, and spread its doctrines from Afghânistân to China, and from Central Asia
                    to Ceylon. On the west, the heritage of Seleucus (312-280 <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >b.c.</hi>) diffused Greek influences, and sent forth Graeco-Bactrian
                    expeditions to the Punjab. Antiochus Theos (grandson of Seleucus Nicator) and
                    Asoka (grandson of Chandra Gupta), who ruled these two monarchies in the 3d
                    century <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.,</hi> made a treaty with each other (256). In
                    the next century Eucratides, king of Bactria, conquered as far as Alexander’s
                    royal city of Patala, and possibly sent expeditions into Cutch and Guzerat,
                    181—161 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> Of the Graeco-Bactrian monarchs, Menander
                    advanced farthest into North-Western India, and his coins are found from Cabul,
                    near which he probably had his capital, as far as Muttra on the Jumna. The
                    Buddhist dynasty of Chandra Gupta profoundly modified the religion of northern
                    India from the east; the empire of Seleucus, with its Bactrian and later
                    offshoots deeply influenced the science and art of Hindustan from the west.</p>
                <p>Brâhman astronomy owed much to the Greeks, and what the Buddhists were to the
                    architecture of northern India, that the Greeks were to its sculpture. Greek
                    faces and profiles constantly occur in ancient Buddhist statuary, and enrich
                    almost all the larger museums in</p>
                <p>India. The purest specimens have been found in the Punjab, where the Ionians
                    settled in greatest force. As we proceed eastward from the Punjab, the Greek
                    type begins to fade. Purity of outline gives place to lusciousness of form. In
                    the female figures, the artists trust more and more to swelling breasts and
                    towering chignons, and load the neck with constantly accumulating jewels. N
                    evertheless, the Grecian type of countenance long survived in Indian art. It is
                    perfectly unlike the present coarse conventional ideal of sculptured beauty, and
                    may even be traced in the delicate profiles on the so-called sun temple at
                    Kanârak, built in the 12th century <hi rend="smallcaps">a,d.</hi> on the remote

                <p>It must suffice to indicate the ethnical and dynastic influences thus brought to
                    bear upon India, without attempting to assign dates to the individual monarchs.
                    The chronology of the twelve centuries intervening between the Graeco-Bactrian
                    period and the Mahometan conquest still depends on a mass of conflicting
                    evidence derived from inscriptions, legendary literature, unwritten traditions,
                    and coins.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>The evidence

                    moving southwards from Central Asia into India. The Graeco-Bactrian kings are
                    traced by coins as far as Muttra on the Jumna; and Sanskrit texts have recently
                    revealed their advance through the Middle Land of the Brâhmans (Madhyadesha) to

                <p>An effort has been made to trace Buddha himself to a Scythic origin. He belonged
                    to a royal stock of Sâkyas; and the Chinese records supply an intermediate link
                    between his birthplace in Bengal and the supposed home of his race in Central
                    Asia. It is inferred from them that a branch of the Scythian hordes who overran
                    western Asia about 625 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> made its way to Patala on
                    the Indus, the site selected by Alexander in 325 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi>
                    for his headquarters in that delta, and still the capital of Sind under the name
                    of Hyderabad. One portion of these Patala Scythians went westwards by the
                    Persian Gulf to Assyria; another section eventually moved north-east into the
                    Gangetic valley, and became the Sâkyas of Kapilavastu, among whom Buddha was

                <p>Whatever may be the value of this conjecture, the influence of the Scythian
                    dynasties in northern India is an historical fact. The northern or Tibetan form

                    six centuries competed with the earlier Buddhism of Asoka. The Chinese pilgrim
                    in 629-645 <hi rend="smallcaps">a.d.</hi> found both the northern or Scythic and
                    the southern forms of Buddhism in full vigour in India. He spent fourteen months
                    at China-pati, the town where Kanishka had kept his Chinese hostages in the
                    Punjab; and he records the debates between the northern and southern sects of
                    Buddhists in Oudh, Behar, Kâthiâwâr, and at other places. The Scythic influence
                    in India was a dynastic as well as a religious one. Theevidenceof coins and the

                <p>Many scholars believe that the Scythians poured down upon India in such masses as
                    to supplant the previous population. The Jits or Jâts,<note anchored="true"

                    on the shores of the Caspian. This view has received the support of most eminent
                    investigators, from Professor H. H. Wilson to General Cunningham, the
                    director-general of the archaeological survey.<note anchored="true"

                    the great Scythian movement towards India on the decline of the Bactrian empire.
                    Without pressing such identifications too closely in the service of particular
                    theories, the weight of authority is in favour of a Scythian origin for this

                    aboriginal races of India.</p>
                <p>The Scythic settlement was not effected without a struggle. As Chandra Gupta

                    conquest <hi rend="italic">(circa</hi> 312-306 B.C.), so the Indian heroes of
                    the first century before and after Christ are native princes who stemmed the
                    torrent of Scythian invasion. Vikramâditya, king of Ujjain won his paramount

                    attempt to assign dates to its chief episodes has not yet produced results which
                    can be accepted as final. Two Vikramâditya Sakâris, or vanquishers of the
                    Scythians, are required for the purposes of chronology; and the great battle of
                    Korùr, near Mùltân, at which the Scythian hosts perished, has been shifted

                <p>While Greek and Scythic influences had thus been at work in northern India during
                    nine centuries (327 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> to 544 <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >a.d.),</hi> another element was profoundly affecting the future of the Indian
                    people. In a previous section we have traced the fortunes, and sketched the
                    present condition, of the non-Aryan “aborigines.” The Brâhmanical Aryans never
                    effected anything like a complete subjugation of these earlier races. The tribes
                    and castes of non-Aryan origin still number about 18 millions in British
                    territory; the castes who claim a pure Aryan descent are under 17 millions. The
                    non-Aryans have influenced the popular dialects of almost every province, and in
                    southern India have given their speech to 46 millions of people. The Vedic
                    settlements along the five rivers of the Punjab were merely colonies or
                    confederacies of Aryan tribes, who had pushed in among a non-Aryan population.
                    When an Aryan family advanced to a new territory, it had often, as in the case
                    of the Pândava brethren, to clear the forest and drive out the aboriginal
                    people. This double process constantly repeated itself, and so late as 1657 <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">a.D.,</hi> when the Hindu râjâ founded the present city of
                    Bareilly, his first work was to cut down the jungle and expel the Katheriyas.
                    The ancient Brâhmanical kingdoms of the Middle Land, or Madhyadesha, in the
                    North-Western Provinces and Oudh, were surrounded by non-Aryan peoples. All the
                    legendary advances beyond the centre of Aryan civilization, narrated in the epic
                    poets, were made into the territory of nonAryan races. When we begin to catch
                    historic glimpses of India, we find the most powerful kingdoms ruled by nonAryan
                    princes. Thus the Nandas, whom Chandra Gupta succeeded in Behar, were a Sùdra or
                    non-Aryan dynasty; and, according to one account, Chandra Gupta and his grandson
                    Asoka came of the same stock.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    (327 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> to 544 <hi rend="smallcaps">a.d.),</hi> the
                    Indian aboriginal races must have had an ever-increasing importance, whether as
                    enemies or allies. At the end of that struggle we discover them in some of the
                    fairest tracts of northern India. In almost every district throughout Oudh and
                    the North-Western Provinces ruined towns and forts are ascribed to aboriginal
                    races who ruled at different periods, according to the local legends, between
                    the 5th and 11th centuries <hi rend="smallcaps">a.d.</hi> When the Mahometan

                    propose, with the utmost brevity, to indicate a few of the results. Starting
                    from the west, Alexander the Great found Râwal Pindi district in the hands of
                    the Takkas or Takshaks, from whom its Greek name of Taxila was derived. This
                    people has been traced to a Scythian migration about the 6th century <hi

                    retained by the Nâgâ tribes of our own day. The words Nâgâ and Takshak in
                    Sanskrit both mean “a snake,” or mythological tailed monster. The Takshaks are
                    identified with the Scythian Takkas, and the Nâ"âs have been connected with the

                    The Chinese records give a full account of the Nâgâ geography of ancient India.
                    They enumerate numerous and powerful Nâgâ, kingdoms, from which Buddhism derived
                    many of its converts. The Chinese chroniclers, indeed, classify the Nâgâ princes
                    of India into two great divisions, as Buddhists and non-Buddhists. The serpent
                    worship which formed so typical a characteristic.of the Indo-Scythic races led
                    the Chinese to confound them with the objects of their adoration; and the Indian
                    Nâgâs and their rites se m to have supplied the Dragon races of Chinese Buddhism
                    and of religious and secular art in China.</p>
                <p>As the Greek invaders found Râwal Pindi district in possession of a Scythic race
                    of Takkas in 327 <hi rend="smallcaps">b,c.,</hi> so the Musalmân conqueror found
                    it inhabited by a fierce nonAryan race of Ghakkars thirteen hundred years later.
                    The Ghakkars for a time imperilled the safety of Mahmùd of Ghazni in 1008 A.D.
                    Ferishta describes them as savages addicted to polyandry and infanticide. The
                    tide of Mahometan conquest rolled on, but the Ghakkars remained in possession of
                    their submontane tract. In 1205 they slew the second Mahometan conquerer of
                    India, Muhammad Ghori, in his tent, and ravaged the Punjab to the gates of
                    Lahore; and, in spite of conversion to Islâm by the sword, it was not till 1525
                    that they made their submission to Bâbar in return for a grant of country.
                    During the next two centuries they rendered great services to the Mughal dynasty
                    against the Afghâu usurpers, and rose to high influence in the Punjab. Driven
                    from the plains by the Sikhs in 1765, the Ghakkar chiefs maintained their
                    independence in the Murree (Marri) Hills till 1830, when they were crushed after
                    a bloody struggle. In 1849 Râwal Pindi passed, with the rest of the Sikh
                    territories, under British rule. But the Ghakkars revolted four years
                    afterwards, and threatened Murree, the summer capital of the Punjab, so late as
                    1857. They now number only 10,153 persons, described by the British officers as
                    “a fine spirited race, gentlemen in ancestry and bearing, and clinging under all
                    reverses to the traditions of noble blood.”</p>
                <p>We have selected the inhabitants of Râwal Pindi district to illustrate the
                    long-continued presence and vitality of the non-Aryan races in India. We shall
                    deal more briefly with other parts of the country. Proceeding inwards to the
                    North-Western Provinces, we find traces of an early Buddhist civilization having
                    been overturned by rude nonAryan races. In Bareilly district, for example, the
                    wild Ahirs from the north, the Bhils from the south, and the Bhars from the west
                    seem to have expelled highly developed Aryan communities not long before 1000
                    <hi rend="smallcaps">a.d.</hi> Still farther to the east, all remains of
                    prehistoric masonry in Oudh and the North-Western Provinces are assigned either
                    to the ancient Buddhists or to a mediaeval race of Bhars. The Bhars appear to
                    have possessed the north Gangetic plains in the centuries coeval with the fall
                    of Buddhism. Their kingdoms extended over most of Oudh, and lofty mounds covered
                    with ancient groves still mark the sites of their forgotten cities. They are the
                    mysterious “fort-builders” to whom the peasantry ascribe any ruin of unusual
                    size. In the western districts their power is said to have been crushed by the
                    Sharki dynasty of Jaunpur in the end of the 14th century. In the eastern
                    districts of the north Gangetic plain, the Bhars figure still more prominently
                    in local traditions, and an attempt has been made to trace their continuous
                    history. In Gorakhpur district a movement of aboriginal Tharus and Bhars seems
                    to have overwhelmed the early outposts of Aryan civilization several centuries
                    before Christ. They afterwards became vassals of the Buddhist kingdom of Behar
                    on the south-east, and on the fall of that power, about 550, the Bhars regained
                    their independence. The Chinese pilgrim in the 7th century comments on the large
                    number of monasteries and towers in this region—the latter probably monuments of
                    the struggle with the aboriginal Bhars, who were there finally crushed between
                    the 7th and 10th centuries.</p>
                <p>As we advance still farther eastwards into Bengal, we find that the non-Aryan
                    races have within historical time supplied a large part of the Hindu population.
                    In the north the Koch established their dominion upon the ruins of the Aryan
                    kingdom of Kâmrùp, which the Afghân king of Bengal had overthrown in 1489. The
                    Koch gave their name to the native state of Kuch (Cooch) Behar, and their
                    descendants, together with those of other non-Aryan tribes, form the mass of the
                    people in the neighbouring British districts. Some eluded the effects of their
                    low origin by becoming Musalmâns, and thus obtained that social equality which
                    Islâm grants to all mankind. The rest have merged more or less into the Hindu
                    population; but masses of them claim, in virtue of their position as an old
                    dominant race, to belong to the Kshattriya caste. They call themselves
                    Râjbansis, a term exactly correspond ing to the Râjputs of western India. The
                    râjâs of Kuch Behar lay claim to a divine origin, in order to conceal their
                    aboriginal descent; and all remembrance of the Koch tribe is carefully avoided
                    at court.</p>
                <p>Proceeding still eastwards, we enter the adjacent valley of Assam, until last
                    century the seat of another non-Aryan ruling race. The Ahams entered Assam from
                    the southeast about 1350 (?), had firmly established their power by 1663,
                    gradually yielded to Hinduism, and were overpowered by fresh invasions from
                    Burmah between 1750 and 1820, when the valley was annexed to British India.</p>

                    xml:id="kp-eb0912-0815-0792"/>
                <p>By the Burmese the Ahams have been completely crushed as a dominant race, and
                    the&gt;r national priests, to the number of 179,000, have been forced to till
                    the soil togain their living. But the people of Assam are still so essentially
                    made up of aboriginal races and their Hinduized descendants that not 65,000
                    persons of even alleged pure Aryan descent can be found in a population
                    exceeding 4 millions.</p>
                <p>We have hitherto confined our survey to the country on the north of the Ganges.
                    If we pass to the southern Gangetic plain, we find that almost every tract has
                    traditions of a non-Aryan tribe, either as a once dominant race or as lying at
                    the root of the local population. The great division of Bundelkhand contains
                    several crushed peoples of this class, and takes its name from the Bundelas, a
                    tribe of at least semi-aboriginal descent. As we rise from the Gangetic plain
                    into the highlands of the Central Provinces, we reach the abiding home of the
                    non-Aryan tribes. One such race after another—Gaulis, Nâgâs, Gonds, Ahirs— ruled
                    from the Sâtpura plateau. If we turn to the lower provinces of Bengal we find
                    the delta peopled by masses of non-Aryan origin. One section of them has merged
                    into low-caste Hindus; another section has sought a more equal social
                    organization by accepting the creed of Mahomet. But such changes of faith do not
                    alter their ethnical type; and the Musalmân of the delta differs as widely in
                    race from the Afghân as the low-caste Hindu of the delta differs from the
                    Brâhman. Throughout southern India the non-Aryan elements make up almost the
                    entire population, and have supplied the great Dravidian family of languages,
                    spoken by 46 millions of people.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Hahometan Period.</hi></p>
                <p>At the very time that Buddhism was being crusned out of India by the Brâhmanic
                    reaction, a new faith was being born in Arabia, destined to supply a youthful
                    fanaticism which should sweep the country from the Himalayas to Cape Comorin,
                    and from the western to the eastern sea. Muhammad, commonly known as Mahomet,
                    the founder of Islam, died at Medina in 632 A.D., while the Chinese • pilgrim
                    Hwen Tsang was still on his travels. The first Mahometan invasion of India is
                    placed in 664, only thirty-two years after the death of the prophet. The Punjab
                    is said to have been ravaged on this occasion with no permanent results. The
                    first Mahometan conquest was the outlying province of Sind, which from the point
                    of view of geology may be regarded as a continuation of the desert of
                    Baluchistan. In 711, or seventy-nine years after the death of Mahomet, an Arab
                    army under Muhammad Kâsim invaded and conquered the Hindus of Sind in the name
                    of Walid I., caliph of Damascus, of the Bene-Umyyeh line. In the same year
                    Roderic, the last of the Goths, fell before the victorious Saracens in Spain.
                    But in India the bravery of the Rajputs and the devotion of the Brâhmans seem to
                    have afforded a stronger national bulwark than existed in western Europe. In 750
                    the Hindus rose in rebellion and drove out the Musalmân tyrant, and the land had
                    rest for one hundred and fifty years.</p>
                <p>The next Mahometan invasion of India is associated with the name of Sultân Mahmùd
                    of Ghazni. Mahmùd was the eldest son of Sabuktagin, surnamed Nasr-ud-din, in
                    origin a Turkish slave, who had established his rule over the greater part of
                    modern Afghanistan and Khorasân with Ghazni as his capital. In 977 Sabuktagin is
                    said to have defeated Jâipal, the Hindu râjâ of Lahore, and to have rendered the
                    Punjab tributary. But his son Mahmùd was the first of the great Musalmân
                    conquerors whose names still ring through Asia. Mahmιid succeeded to the throne
                    in 997. During his reign of thirty-three years he extended the limits of his
                    father’s kingdom from Persia on the east to the Ganges on the west; and it is
                    related that he led his armies into the plains of India no less than seventeen
                    times. In 1001 he defeated Râjâ Jâipal a second time, and took him prisoner. But
                    Anandpal, the son of Jâipal’ raised again the standard of national independence,
                    and gathered an army of Râjput allies from the furthest comers of Hindustân. The
                    decisive battle was fought in the valley of Peshâwar. Mahmùd won the day by the
                    aid of his Turkish horsemen, and thenceforth the Punjab has been a Mahometan
                    province, except during the brief period of Sikh supremacy. The most famous of
                    Mahmùd’s invasions of India was that undertaken in 1024 against Guzerat. The
                    goal of this expedition was the temple dedicated to Siva at Somnâth, around
                    which so many legends have gathered. It is reported that Mahmùd marched through
                    Ajmir, to avoid the desert of Sind; that he found the Hindus gathered on the
                    neck of the peninsula of Somnâth in defence of their holy city; that the battle
                    lasted for two days; that in the end the Râjput warriors fled to their boats,
                    while the Brâhman priests retired into the inmost shrine; that Mahmιid,
                    introduced into this shrine, rejected all entreaties by the Brâhmans to spare
                    their idol, and all offers of ransom; that he smote the image with his club, and
                    forthwith a fountain of precious stones gushed out. Until the British invasion
                    of Afghânistân in 1839, the club of Mahmùd and the sandal-wood gates of Somnâth
                    were preserved at the tomb of the great conqueror near Ghazni. The club has now
                    disappeared, and the gates carried back to India by General Nott are recognized
                    to be a clumsy forgery. To Mahometans Mahmùd is known, not only as a champion of
                    the faith, but as a munificent patron of literature. The dynasty that he founded
                    was not long-lived. Fourteen of his descendants occupied his throne within
                    little more than a century, but none of them achieved greatness. A bloodfeud
                    arose between them and a line of Afghân princes who had established themselves
                    among the mountains of Ghor. In 1152 Bahrâm, the last of the Ghaznivide Turks,
                    was overthrown by Allah-ud-din of Ghor, and the wealthy and populous city of
                    Ghazni was razed to the ground. But even the Ghoride conqueror spared the tomb
                    of Mahmùd.</p>
                <p>Khusru, the son of Bahrâm, fled to Lahore, and there established the first
                    Mahometan dynasty within India. It speedily ended with his son, also called
                    Khusru, whom Muhammad Ghori, the relentless enemy of the Ghaznivide house,
                    carried away into captivity in 1186.</p>
                <p>The Afghâns of Ghor or Ghur thus rose to power on the downfall of the Turks of
                    Ghazni. The founder of the family is said to have been Izzud-din al Husâin,
                    whose son Allah-ud-din destroyed Ghazni, as already mentioned. Allah-ud-din had
                    two nephews, Ghiyâs-ud-din and Muiz-ud-din, the latter of whom, also called
                    Shahab-ud-din by Musalmân chroniclers, and generally known in history as
                    Muhammad Ghori, is the second of the great Mahometan conquerors of India. In
                    1176 he took Mùltân and Uchch; in 1187 Lahore fell into his hands; in 1191 he
                    was repulsed before Delhi, but soon afterwards he redeemed this disaster.
                    Hindustân Proper was at that period divided between the two Râjput kingdoms of
                    Kanauj and Delhi. Muhammad Ghori achieved his object by playing off the rival
                    kings against each other. By 1193 he had extended his conquests as far east as
                    Benares, and the defeated Râjputs migrated in a body to the hills and deserts
                    now known as Râjputâna. In 1199 one of his lieutenants, named Bakhtiyar,
                    advanced into Bengal, and expelled by an audacious stratagem the last Hindu râjâ
                    of Nadiyâ. The entire northern plain, from the Indus to the Brahmaputra, thus
                    lay under the Mahometan yoke. But Muhammad Ghori never settled himself
                    permanently in India. His favourite residence is said to have been the old
                    capital of Ghazni, while he governed his Indian conquests through the agency <pb

                    Ghori died in 1206, being assassinated by some Ghakkar tribesmen while sleeping
                    in his tent by the bank of the Indus; on his death both Ghor and Ghazni drop out
                    of history, and Delhi first appears as the Mahometan capital of India.</p>
                <p>On the death of Muhammad Ghori, Kutab-ud-din at once laid aside the title of
                    viceroy, and proclaimed himself sultân of Delhi. He was the founder of what is
                    known as the slave dynasty, which lasted for nearly a century (1206-1288). The
                    name of Kutab is preserved in the <hi rend="italic">minar,</hi> or pillar of
                    v.’ct &gt;ry, which still stands amid the ruins of ancient Delhi, towering high
                    above all later structures. Kutab himself is said to have been successful as a
                    general and an administrator, but none of his successors has left a mark in
                    history.</p>
                <p>In 1294 Allah-ud-din Khiljf, the third of the great Mahometan conquerors of
                    India, raised himself to the throne of Delhi by the treacherous assassination of
                    his uncle Firoz II., who had himself supplanted the last of the slave dynasty.
                    Allah-ud-din had already won military renown by his expeditions into the yet
                    unsubdued south. He had plundered the temples at Bhilsa in central India, which
                    are admired to the present day as the most interesting examples of Buddhist
                    architecture in the country. At the head of a small band of horsemen, he had
                    ridden as far south as Deogiri in the Deccan, and plundered the Marhattâ
                    capital. When once established as sultân, he planned more extensive schemes of
                    conquest. One army was sent to Guzerat under Alaf Khân, who conquered and
                    expelled the last Râjput king of Anhalwâr or Pâtan. Another army, led by the
                    sultân in person, marched into the heart of Râjputâna, and stormed the
                    rock-fortress of Chitor, where the Râjputs had taken refuge with their women and
                    children. A third army, commanded by Malik Kafιir, a Hindu renegade and
                    favourite of Allah-ud-din, penetrated to the extrem? south of the peninsula,
                    scattering the unwarlike Dravidian races, and stripping every Hindu temple of
                    its accumulations of gold and jewels. To this day the name of Malik Kafùr is
                    remembered in the remote district of Madura, in association with irresistible
                    fate and every form of sacrilege.</p>
                <p>Allah-ud-din died in 1316, having subjected to Islâm the Deccan and Guzerat.
                    Three of his descendants followed him upon the throne, but their united reigns
                    extended over only five years. In 1321 a successful revolt was headed by Ghiyas
                    ud-din Tughlak, governor of the Punjab, who is said to have been of Turkish
                    origin. The Tughlak dynasty lasted for about seventy years, until it was swept
                    away by the invasion of Timûr, the fourth Mahometan conqueror of India, in 1398.
                    Ghiyas-ud-din, the founder of the line, is only known for having removed the
                    capital from Delhi to a spot about 4 miles further to the east, which he called
                    Tughlakâbâd. His son and successor, Muhammad Tughlak, who reigned from 1325 to
                    1351, is described by Elphinstone as “one of the most ’ accomplished princes and
                    one of the most furious tyrants that ever adorned or disgraced human nature.” He
                    wasted the treasure accumulated by Allah-ud-din in purchasing the retirement of
                    the Mughal hordes, who had already made their appearance in the Punjab. When the
                    internal circulation failed, he issued a forced currency of copper, which is
                    said to have deranged the whole commerce of the country At one time he raised an
                    army for the invasion of Persia. At another he actually despatched an expedition
                    against China, which perished miserably in the Himâkyan passes. When Hindustan
                    was thus suffering from his misgovernment, he conceived the project of
                    transferring the seat of empire to the Deccan, and compelled the inhabitants of
                    Delhi to remove a distance of 700 miles to Deogiri or Daulatâbâd. And yet during
                    the reign of this sultân both the Tughlak dynasty and the city of Delhi are said
                    to have attained their utmost growth. Muhammad was succeeded by his cousin
                    Firoz, who likewise was not content without a new capital, which he placed a few
                    miles north of Delhi, and called after his own name. Meanwhile the remote
                    provinces of the empire began to throw off their allegiance to the sultâns of
                    Delhi. The independence of the Afghân kings of Bengal is generally dated from
                    1336, when Muhammad Tughlak was yet on the throne. The commencement of the reign
                    of Allah-ud-din, the founder of the Bâhmani dynasty in the Deccan, is variously
                    assigned to 1347 and 1357. Zafar Khân, the first of the Ahmadâbâd kings, acted
                    as an independent ruler from the time of his first appointment as governor of
                    Guzerat in 1391. These and other revolts prepared the way for the fourth great
                    invasion of India under Timûr (Tamerlane).</p>
                <p>Accordingly, when Timûr invaded India in 1398, he encountered but little
                    organized resistance. Mahmιid, the last of the Tughlak dynasty, being defeated
                    in a battle outside the walls of Delhi, fled into Guzerat. The city was sacked
                    and the inhabitants massacred by the victorious Mughals. But the invasion of
                    Timûr left no permanent impress upon the history of India, except in so far as
                    its memory fired the imagination of Bâbar (Baber), the founder of the Mughal
                    dynasty. The details of the fighting and of the atrocities may be found related
                    in cold blood by Timûr himself in the <hi rend="italic">Malfuzat-i-Timûri,</hi>
                    which has been translated in Elliot’s <hi rend="italic">History of India as told
                    by its own Historians,</hi> vol. iii. Timûr marched back to Samarkand as he had
                    come, by way of Cabul, and Mahmûd Tughlak ventured to return to his desolate
                    capital. He was succeeded by what is known as the Sayyid dynasty, which held
                    Delhi and a few miles of surrounding country for about forty years. The Sayyids
                    were in their turn expelled by Beloli, an Afghan of the Lodi tribe, whose
                    successors removed the seat of government to Agra, which thus for the first time
                    became the imperial city. In 1525 Bâbar (Baber), the fifth in descent from
                    Timûr, and also the fifth Mahometan conqueror, invaded India at the instigation
                    of the governor of the Punjab, won the victory of Pânipat over Ibrâhîm, the last
                    of the Lodi dynasty, and founded the Mughal empire, which lasted, at least in
                    name, until 1857.</p>
                <p>Before entering upon the story of the Mughal empire, it is desirable to give a
                    short sketch of the condition of southern India at this period, which marks a
                    turning point in Indian history. The earliest local traditions agree in dividing
                    the extreme south into four provinces, Kerala, Pandya, Chola, and Chera, which
                    together made up the country of Dravida, occupied by Tamil-speaking races. Of
                    these kingdoms the greatest was that of Pandya, with its capital of Madura, the
                    foundation of which is assigned on high authority to the 4th century <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> Other early southern cities whose sites can be
                    identified are Combaconum and Tanjore, the successive capitals of the Chola
                    kingdom, and Talkad in Mysore, now buried by the sands of the Kâveri (Cauvery),
                    the capital of the Chera kingdom. The local <hi rend="italic">Parana,</hi> or
                    chronicle of Madura, gives a list of two Pandyan dynasties, the first of which
                    has seventy-three kings, the second forty-three. Parakrama, the last king of the
                    second dynasty, was overthrown by the Mahometan invader, Mâlik Kafûr, in 1324;
                    but the Musalmâns never established their power in the extreme south, and a
                    series of Hindu lines ruled at Madura into the 18th century. No other Dravidian
                    kingdom can boast such a continuous succession as that of Madura. The chronicles
                    enumerate fifty Chera kings, and no less than sixty-six Chola kings,, as well as
                    many minor dynasties which ruled at various periods over fractions of the south.
                    Little confidence, however, can be placed in Hindu genealogies, and the early
                    history of the Dravidian races yet <pb break="no"

                    leaves and the more trustworthy inscriptions on copper and stone. Authentic
                    history begins with the Hindu empire of Vijayanagar or Narsingha, which
                    exercised an ill defined sovereignty over the entire south from the 12th to the
                    16th century. The foundation of the city of Vijayanagar is assigned to the year
                    1118, and to an eponymous hero, Râjâ Vijaya, the fifth of his line. Its
                    extensive ruins are still to be traced on the right bank of the Tungabhadra
                    river within the Madras district of Bellary. The city itself has not been
                    inhabited since it was sacked by the Mahometans in 1565, but vast remains still
                    exist of temples, fortifications, tanks, and bridges, haunted by beasts of prey
                    and venomous reptiles. The empire of Vijayanagar represents the last stand made
                    by the national faith in India against conquering Islam. For at least three
                    centuries its sway over the south was undisputed, and its râjâs waged wars and
                    concluded treaties of peace with the sultâns of the Deccan on equal terms.</p>
                <p>The earliest of the Mahometan dynasties in the Deccan was that founded by
                    Allah-ud-din in 1347 or 1357, which has received the name of the Bâhmani dynasty
                    from the supposed Brâhman descent of its founder. The capital was first at
                    Gulbargah, and was afterwards removed to Bidar, both which places still possess
                    magnificent palaces and mosques in ruins. Towards the close of the 14th century
                    the Bâhmani empire fell to pieces, and five independent kingdoms divided the
                    Deccan among them. These were— (1) the Adil Shâhi dynasty, with its capital at
                    Bijapur, founded in 1489 by a son of Amurath II., sultân of the Ottomans; (2)
                    the Kutab Shâhi dynasty, with its capital at Golconda, founded in 1512 by a
                    Turkoman adventurer; (3) the Nizâm Shâhi dynasty, with its capital at
                    Ahmadnagar, founded in 1490 by a Brâhman renegade, from the Vijayanagar court;
                    (4) the ïmad Shâhi dynasty of Berar, with its capital at Ellichpur, founded in
                    1484 also by a Hindu from Vijayanagar; (5) the Barid Shâhi dynasty, with its
                    capital at Bidar, founded about 1492 by one who is variously described as a Turk
                    and a Georgian slave. It is, of course, impossible here to trace in detail the
                    history of these several dynasties. In 1565 they combined against the Hindu râjâ
                    of Vijayanagar, who was defeated and slain in the decisive battle of Talikota.
                    But, though the city was sacked and the supremacy of Vijayanagar for ever
                    destroyed, the Mahometan victors did not themselves advance into the south. The
                    Naiks or feudatories of Vijayanagar everywhere asserted their independence. From
                    them are descended the well-known Pâlegârs of the south, and also the present
                    râjâ of Mysore. One of the bloodroyal of Vijayanagar fled to Chandragiri, and
                    founded a line which exercised a prerogative of its former sovereignty by
                    granting the site of Madras to the English in 1639. Another scion claiming the
                    same high descent lingers to the present day near the ruins of Vijayanagar, and
                    is known as the râjâ of Anagundi, a feudatory of the nizâm of Hyderabad. Despite
                    frequent internal strife, the sultâns of the Deccan retained their independence
                    until conquered by the Mughal emperor Aurangzeb in the latter half of the 17th
                    century. To complete this sketch of India at the time of Bâbar’s invasion it
                    remains to say that an independent Mahometan dynasty reigned at Ahmadâbâd in
                    Guzerat for nearly two centuries (from 1391 to 1573), until conquered by Akbar;
                    and that Bengal was similarly independent, under a line of Afghân kings, with
                    Gaur for their capital, from 1336 to 1573. When, therefore, Bâbar invaded India
                    in 1525, the greater part of the country was Mahometan, but it did not recognize
                    the authority of the Afghân sultan of the Lodi dynasty, who resided at Agra, and
                    also ruled the historical capital of Delhi. After having won the battle of
                    Pânipat, Bâbar was no more acknowledged as emperor of India than his ancestor
                    Timûr had been Bâbar, however, unlike Timûr, had resolved to settle in the
                    plains of Hindustân, and carve out for himself a new empire with the help of his
                    Mughal followers. His first task was to repel an attack by the Râjputs of
                    Chitor, who seem to have attempted to re-establish at this time a Hindu empire.
                    The battle was fought at Sikri near Agra, and is memorable for the vow made by
                    the easy living Bâbar that he would never again touch wine. Bâbar was again
                    victorious, but died shortly afterwards in 1530. He was succeeded by his son
                    Humâyiïn, who is chiefly known as being the father of Akbar. In Humâyùn’s reign
                    the subject Afghâns rose in revolt under Sher Shâh, a native of Bengal, who for
                    a short time established his authority over all Hindustân. Humâyùn was driven as
                    an exile into Persia; and, while he was flying through the desert of Sind, his
                    son Akbar was born to him in the petty fortress of Umarkot. But Sher Shâh was
                    killed at the storming of the rock-fortress of Kâlinjar, and Humâyùn, after many
                    vicissitudes, succeeded in re-establishing his authority at Lahore and
                    Delhi.</p>
                <p>Humâyùn died by an accident in 1556, leaving but a circumscribed kingdom,
                    surrounded on every side by active foes, to his son Akbar, then a boy of only
                    fourteen years. Akbar the Great, the real founder of the Mughal empire as it
                    existed for two centuries, was the contemporary of our own Queen Elizabeth
                    (1558-1603). He was born in 1542, and his reign lasted from 1556 to 1605. When
                    his father died he was absent in the Punjab, fighting the revolted Afghâns,
                    under the guardianship of Bairâm Khân, a native of Badakshân, whose military
                    skill largely contributed to recover the throne for the Mughal line. For the
                    first seven years of his reign Akbar was perpetually engaged in warfare. His
                    first task was to establish his authority in the Punjab, and in the country
                    around Delhi and Agra. In 1568 he stormed the Râjput stronghold of Chitor, and
                    conquered Ajmir. In 1570 he obtained possession of Oudh and Gwalior. In 1572 he
                    marched in person into Guzerat, defeated the last of the independent sultâns of
                    Ahmadâbâd, and formed the province into a Mughal viceroyalty or subah. In the
                    same year his generals drove out the Afghâns from Bengal, and reunited the lower
                    valley of the Ganges to Hindustân. Akbar was then the undisputed ruler of a
                    larger portion of India than had ever before acknowledged the sway of one man.
                    But he continued to extend his conquests throughout his lifetime. In 1578 Orissa
                    was annexed to Bengal by his Hindu general Todar Mall, who forthwith organized a
                    revenue survey of the whole province. Cabul submitted in 1581, Kashmir in 1586,
                    Sind in 1592, and Kandahâr in 1594. At last he turned his arms against the
                    Mahometan kings of the Deccan, and wrested from them Berar; but the permanent
                    conquest of the south was reserved for Aurangzeb.</p>
                <p>If the history of Akbar were confined to this long list of conquests, his name
                    would on their account alone find a high place among those which mankind
                    delights to remember. But it is as a civil administrator that his reputation is
                    cherished in India to the present day. With regard to the land revenue, the
                    essence of his procedure was to fix the amount which the cultivators should pay
                    at one-third of the gross produce, leaving it to their option to pay in money or
                    in kind. The total land revenue received by Akbar amounted to about 16∣ millions
                    sterling. Comparing the area of his empire with the corresponding area now under
                    the British, it has been calculated that Akbar, three hundred years ago,
                    obtained 15j millions where they obtain only 13⅛ millions,—an amount
                    representing not more than one-half the purchasing pcΛ ’ er of Akbar’s 154
                    millions. The distinction between <hi rend="italic">khalsä</hi><pb break="no"

                    for services, also dates from the time of Akbar. As regards his military system,
                    Akbar invented a sort of feudal organization, by which every tributary râjâ took
                    his place by the side of his own Mughal nobles. In theory it was an aristocracy
                    based only upon military command; but practically it accomplished the object at
                    which it aimed by incorporating the hereditary chiefships of Râjputâna among the
                    mushroom „.cations of a Mahometan despotism. Musalmâns and Hindus were alike
                    known only as <hi rend="italic">mansabdars</hi> or commanders of so many horse,
                    the highest title being that of <hi rend="italic">amir</hi> (ameer), corrupted
                    by European travellers into <hi rend="italic">umrah</hi> or <hi rend="italic"
                    >omrah.</hi> The third and last of Akbar’s characteristic measures were those
                    connected with religious innovation, about which it is difficult to speak with
                    precision. The necessity of conciliating the proud warriors of Râjputana had
                    taught him toleration from his earliest dιys. His favourite wife was a Râjput
                    princess, and another wife is said to have been a Christian. O.ut of four
                    hundred and fifteen of his <hi rend="italic">mansabddrs</hi> whose names are
                    recorded, as many as fifty-one were Hindus. Starting from the broad ground of
                    general toleration, Akbar was gradually led on by the stimulus of cosmopolitan
                    discussion to question the truth of his inherited faith. The counsels of his
                    friend Abul Fazl, coinciding with that sense of superhuman omnipotence which is
                    bred of despotic power, led him at last to promulgate a new state religion,
                    based upon natural theology, and comprising the best practices of all known
                    creeds. In this strange faith Akbar himself was the prophet, or rather the head
                    of the church. Every morning he worshipped the sun in public, as being the
                    representative of the divine soul that animates the universe, while he was
                    himself worshipped by the ignorant multitude.</p>
                <p>Akbar died in 1605, in his sixty-third year. He lies buried beneath a plain slab
                    in the magnificent mausoleum which he had reared at Sikandra, near his capital
                    of Agra. As his name is still cherished in India, so his tomb is still honoured,

                <p>The reign of Jahângir, his son, extended from 1605 to 1627. It is chiefly
                    remarkable for the influence exercised over the emperor byhis favourite wife,
                    surnamed Nùr Mahâl, or the Light of the Harem. The currency was struck in her
                    name, and in her hands centred all the intrigues that made up the work of
                    administration. She lies buried by the side of her husband at Lahore, whither
                    the seat of government had been moved by Jahângfr, just as Akbar had previously
                    transferred it from Delhi to Agra. It was in the reign of Jahângfr that the
                    English first established themselves at Surat, and also sent their first embassy
                    to the Mughal court.</p>
                <p>Jahângfr was succeeded by his son Shâh Jahân, who had rebelled against his
                    father, as Jâhangfr had rebelled against Akbar. Shâh Jahân’s reign is generally
                    regarded as the period when the Mughal empire attained its greatest
                    magnificence, though not its greatest extent of territory. He founded the
                    existing city of Delhi, which is still known to its Mahometan inhabitants as
                    Jahânâbâd. At Delhi also he erected the celebrated peacock throne; but his
                    favourite place of residence was Agra, where his name will ever be associated
                    with the marvel of Indian architecture, the Tâj Mahâl. That most chaste and most
                    ornamental of buildings was erected by Shâh Jahân as the mausoleum of his
                    favourite wife Mumtaz Mahâl, and he himself lies by her side. It is said that
                    twenty thousand workmen laboured on the work for twenty years. Besides the Tâj,
                    Shâh Jahân also built at Agra within the old fort the palace and the pearl
                    mosque, both of which, like the Tâj, have been preserved to be objects of
                    admiration to the present day. Shâh Jahân had four sons, whose fratricidal wars
                    for the succession during their father’s lifetime it would be tedious to dwell
                    upon. Suffice it to say that Aurangzeb, by mingled treachery and violence,
                    supplanted or overthrew his brothers and proclaimed himself emperor in 1658,
                    while Shâh Jahân was yet alive.</p>
                <p>Aurangzeb’s long reign, from 1658 to 1707, may be regarded as representing both
                    the culminating point of Mughal power and the beginning of its decay.
                    Unattractive as his character was, it contained at least some elements of
                    greatness. None of his successors on the throne was anything higher than a
                    debauchee or a puppet. He was the first to conquer the independent sùltâns of
                    the Deccan, and to extend his authority to the extreme south. But even during
                    his lifetime two new Hindu nationalities were being formed in the Marhattâs and
                    the Sikhs; while immediately after his death the nawabs of the Deccan, of Oudh,
                    and of Bengal raised themselves to practical independence. Aurangzeb had indeed
                    enlarged the empire, but he had not strengthened its foundations. During the
                    reign of his father Shâh Jahân he had been viceroy of the Deccan or rather of
                    the northern portion only, which had been annexed to the Mughal empire since the
                    reign of Akbar. His early ambition was to conquer the Mahometan kings of Bijapur
                    and Golconda, who, since the downfall of Vijayanagar, had been practically
                    supreme over the south. This object was not accomplished without many tedious
                    campaigns, in which Sivaji, the founder of the Marhattâ confederacy, first comes
                    upon the scene. In name Sivaji was a feudatory of the house of Bijapur, on whose
                    behalf he held the rock-forts of his native Ghâts; but in fact he found his
                    opportunity in playing off the Mahometan powers against one another, and in
                    rivalling Aurangzeb himself in the art of treachery. In 1680 Sivaji died, and
                    his son and successor, Sambhaji, was betrayed to Aurangzeb and put to death. The
                    rising Marhattâ power was thus for a time checked, and the Mughal armies were
                    set free to operate in the eastern Deccan. In 1686 the city of Bijapur was taken
                    by Aurangzeb in person, and in the following year Golconda also fell. No
                    independent power then remained in the south, though the numerous local
                    chieftains, known as <hi rend="italic">pälegärs</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >naiks,</hi> never formally submitted to the Mughal empire. During the early
                    years of his reign Aurangzeb had fixed his capital at Delhi, while he kept his
                    dethroned father, Shâh Jahân, in close confinement at Agra. In 1682 he set out
                    with his army on his victorious march into the Deccan, and from that time until
                    his death in 1707 he never again returned to Delhi. In this camp life Aurangzeb
                    may be taken as representative of one aspect of the Mughal rule, which has been
                    picturesquely described by European travellers of that day. They agree in
                    depicting the emperor as a peripatetic sovereign, and the empire as held
                    together by its military highways no less than by the strength of its armies..
                    The great road running across the north of the peninsula, from Dacca in the east
                    to Lahore in the west, is generally attributed to the Afghân usurper, Sher Shâh.
                    The other roads branching out southward from Agra, to Surat and Burhanpur and
                    Golconda, were undoubtedly the work of Mughal times. Each of these roads was
                    laid out with avenues of trees, with wells of water, and with frequent <hi
                    rend="italic">sardis</hi> or rest-houses. Constant communication between the
                    capital and remote cities was maintained by a system of foot-runners, whose
                    aggregate speed is said to have surpassed that of a horse. Commerce was
                    conducted by means of a caste of bullock-drivers, whose occupation in India is
                    hardly yet extinct.</p>
                <p>On the death of Aurangzeb in 1707, the decline of the Mughal empire set in with
                    extraordinary rapidity. Ten <pb break="no"

                    chronicles, but none of them has left any mark on history. His son and successor
                    was Bahâdur Shâh, who reigned only five years. Then followed in order three sons
                    of Bahâdur Shâh, whose united reigns occupy only five years more. In 1739 Nâdir
                    Shâh of Persia, the sixth and last of the great Mahometan conquerors of India,
                    swept like a whirlwind over Hindustân, and sacked the imperial city of Delhi
                    Thenceforth the Great Mughal (Mogul) became a mere name, though the hereditary
                    succession continued unbroken down to our own day Real power had passed into the
                    hands of Mahometan courtiers and Marhattâ generals, both of whom were then
                    carving for themselves kingdoms out of the dismembered empire, until at last
                    British authority placed itself supreme over all. From the time of Aurangzeb no
                    Musalmân, however powerful, dared to assume the title of sultân or emperor, with
                    the single exception of Tipù’s brief paroxysm of madness. The name of <hi
                    rend="italic">nawab,</hi> corrupted by Europeans into “nabob,” appears to be an
                    invention of the Mughals to express delegated authority, and as such it is the
                    highest title conferred upon Mahometans at the present day, as <hi rend="italic"
                    >mahdrdjd</hi> is the highest title conferred upon Hindus. At first nawâbs were
                    only found in important cities, such as Surat and Dacca, with the special
                    function of administering civil justice; criminal justice was in the hands of
                    the <hi rend="italic">kotwäl.</hi> The corresponding officials at that time in a
                    large tract of country were the <hi rend="italic">subahddr</hi> and the <hi
                    rend="italic">faujdär.</hi> But the title of subahdâr, or viceroy, gradually
                    dropped into desuetude, as the paramount power was shaken off, and nawâb became
                    a territorial title with some distinguishing adjunct. During the troubled period
                    of intrigue and assassination that followed on the death of Aurangzeb, two
                    Mahometan foreigners rose to high position as courtiers and generals, and
                    succeeded in transmitting their power to their sons The one was Chin Kulich
                    Khân, also called Asof Jah, and still more commonly Nizâm-ul-Mulk, who was of
                    Turkoman origin, and belonged to the Sunni sect. His independence at Hyderabad
                    in the Deccan dates from 1712. The other was Saâdat Ali Khân, a Persian, and
                    therefore a Shiâ, who was appointed subahdâr or nawâb of Oudh in 1720.
                    Thenceforth these two important provinces paid no more tribute to Delhi, though
                    their hereditary rulers continued to seek formal recognition from the emperor on
                    their succession. The Marhattâs were in possession of the entire west and great
                    part of the centre of the peninsula; while the rich and unwarlike province of
                    Bengal, though governed by an hereditary line of nawâbs founded by Murshid Kuli
                    Khân in 1704, still continued to pour its wealth into the imperial treasury. The
                    central authority never recovered from the invasion of Nâdir Shâh in 1739, who
                    carried off plunder variously estimated at from 8 to 30 millions .sterling The
                    Marhattâs closed round Delhi from the south, and the Afghâns from the west. The
                    victory of Pânipat, won by Ahmad Shâh Durâni over the united Marhattâ
                    confederacy in 1761, gave the Mahometans one more chance of rule. But Ahmad Shâh
                    had no ambition to found a dynasty of his own, nor were the British in Bengal
                    yet ready for territorial conquest. Shâh Alam, the lineal heir of the Mughal
                    line, was thus permitted to ascend the throne of Delhi, where he lived during
                    the great part of a long life as a puppet in the hands of Mahâdaji Sindhia He
                    was succeeded by Akbar II., who lived similarly under the shadow of British
                    protection. Last of all came Bahâdur Shâh, who atoned for his association with
                    the mutineers in 1857 by banishment to Burmah. Thus ended the Mughal line, after
                    a history which covers three hundred and thirty years. Mahometan rule remodelled
                    the revenue system, and has left behind forty millions of Musalmâns in British
                    India.</p>

                <p>Mahometan invaders have always entered India from the north-west. Her new

                    Alexander to that of Vasco da Gama, Europe had enjoyed little direct intercourse
                    with the East. An occasional traveller brought back stories of powerful kingdoms
                    and of untold wealth; but the passage by sea was unthought of, and by land many
                    wide deserts and warlike tribes lay between. Commerce, indeed, never ceased
                    entirely, being carried on chiefly by the Italian cities on the Mediterranean,
                    which traded to the ports of the Levant. But to the Europeans of the 15th
                    century India was practically an unknown land, which powerfully attracted the
                    imagination of spirits stimulated by the Renaissance, and ardent for discovery.
                    All the learning on this subject has been collected by Dr Bird wood in his
                    admirable <hi rend="italic">lieport on the Old Records of the India Office</hi>
                    (1879), from which the present section is largely borrowed. In 1492 Christopher
                    Columbus set sail under the Spanish flag to seek India beyond the Atlantic,
                    bearing with him a letter to the great khan of Tartary. The expedition under
                    Vasco da Gama started from Lisbon five years later, and, doubling the Cape of
                    Good Hope, cast anchor off the city of Calicut on the 20th May 1498, after a
                    prolonged voyage of nearly eleven months. From the first Da Gama encountered
                    hostility from the “Moors,” or rather Arabs, who monopolized the sea-borne
                    trade; but he seems to have found favour with the <hi rend="italic"
                    >zamorin,</hi> or Hindu râjâ of Malabar. It may be worth while to recall the
                    contemporary condition of India at that epoch. An Afghân of the Lodi dynasty was
                    on the throne of Delhi, and another Afghân king was ruling over Bengal.
                    Ahmadâbâd in Guzerat, Gulbargah, Bijapur, Ahmadnagar, and Ellichpur in the
                    Deccan were each the capital of an independent Mahometan kingdom; while the
                    Hindu râjâ of Vijayanagar was recognized as paramount over the entire south, and
                    was perhaps the most powerful monarch to be found at that time in all India.
                    Neither Mughal nor Marhattâ had yet appeared above the political horizon.</p>
                <p>After staying nearly six months on the Malabar coast, Da Gama returned to Europe
                    by the same route as he had come, bearing with him the following letter from the
                    zamorin to the king of Portugal: “Vasco da Gama, a nobleman of your household,
                    has visited my kingdom and has given me great pleasure. In my kingdom there is
                    abundance of cinnamon, cloves, ginger, pepper, and precious stones. What I seek
                    from thy country is gold, silver, coral, and scarlet.” The arrival of Da Gama at
                    Lisbon was celebrated with national rejoicings scarcely less enthusiastic than
                    had greeted the return of Columbus. If the West Indies belonged to Spain by
                    priority of discovery, Portugal might claim the East Indies by the same right
                    Territorial ambition conspired with the spirit of proselytism and with the greed
                    of commerce to fill all Portuguese minds with the dream of a mighty Oriental
                    empire. The early Portuguese discoverers were not traders or private
                    adventurers, but admirals with a royal commission to conquer territory and
                    promote the spread of Christianity A second expedition, consisting of thirteen
                    ships and twelve hundred soldiers, under the command of Cabral, was despatched
                    in 1500. “The sum of his instructions was to begin with preaching, and, if that
                    failed, to proceed to the sharp determination of the sword.” On his outward
                    voyage Cabral was driven by stress of weather to the coast of Brazil. Ultimately
                    he reached Calicut, and established factories both there and at Cochin, in the
                    face of active hostility from the natives. In 1502 the king of Portugal obtained
                    from Pope Alexander VI. a bull constituting him “lord of the navigation,
                    conquests, and trade of Ethiopia, <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0912-0820-0797"/> Arabia, Persia, and India.” In that year Vasco da
                    Gama sailed again to the East, with a fleet numbering twenty vessels. He formed
                    an alliance with the râjâs of Cochin and Cananore against the zamorin of
                    Calicut, and bombarded the latter in his palace. In 1503 the great Alfonso
                    d’Albuquerque is first heard of, as in command of one of three expeditions from
                    Portugal. In 1505 a large fleet of twenty-two sail and fifteen thousand men was
                    sent under Francisco de Almeida, the first Portuguese governor and viceroy of
                    India. In 1509 Albuquerque succeeded as governor, and widely extended the area
                    of Portuguese influence. Having failed in an attack upon Calicut, he seized Goa,
                    which has ever since remained the capital of Portuguese India. Then, sailing
                    round Ceylon, he captured Malacca, the key of the navigation of the Indian
                    archipelago, and opened a trade with Siam and the Spice Islands. Lastly, he
                    sailed back westwards, and, after penetrating into the Persian Gulf and the Red
                    Sea, returned to Goa only to die in 1515. Tn 1524 Vasco da Gama came out to the
                    East for the third time, and he too died at Cochin. For exactly a century, from
                    1500 to 1600, the Portuguese enjoyed a monopoly of Oriental trade.</p>
                <p>“From Japan and the Spice Islands to the Red Sea and the Cape of Good Hope, they
                    were the sole masters and dispensers of the treasures of the east; while their
                    possessions along the Atlantic coast of Africa and in Brazil complete their
                    maritime empire. But they never commanded the necessary resources either of
                    military strength or personal character for its maintenance and defence. They
                    were also in another way unprepared for the commerce of which they thus obtained
                    the control. Their national character had been f ∣rmed in their secular contest
                    with the Moors, and above all things they were knights errant and crusaders, who
                    looked on every pagan as an enemy at once of Portugal and of Christ. It is
                    impossible for any one who has not read the contemporary narratives of their
                    discoveries and conquests to conceive the grossness of the superstition and the
                    cruelty with which the whole history of their exploration and subjugation of the
                    Indies is stained. Albuquerque alone endeavoured to conciliate the good will of
                    the natives, and to live in friendship with the Hindu princes, who were
                    naturally better pleased to have the Portuguese, as governed by him, for their
                    neighbours and allies than the Mahometans whom he had expelled or subdued. The
                    justice and magnanimity of his rule did as much to extend and confirm the power
                    of the Portuguese in the East as the courage and success of his military
                    achievements; and in such veneration was his memory held by the Hindus, and even
                    by the Mahometans, in Goa that they were accustomed to repair to his tomb, and
                    there utter their complaints, as if in the presence of his shade, and call upon
                    God to deliver them from the tyranny of his successors. The cruelties of Soarez,
                    Sequeyra, Menezes, Da Gama, and succeeding viceroys drove the natives to
                    desperation, and encouraged the princes of western India in 1567 to form a
                    league against the Portuguese, in which they were at once joined by the king of
                    Achin. Their undisciplined armies were not able to stand against the veteran
                    soldiers of Portugal, 200 of whom, at Malacca, utterly routed and put to flight
                    a force of 15,000. of the enemy. When, in 1578, Malacca was again besieged by
                    the king of Achin, the small garrison of Portuguese succeeded in inflicting a
                    loss on him of 10,000 men and all his cannon and junks. Twice again, in 1615 and
                    for the last time in 1628, it was besieged, and on each occasion the Achinese
                    were repulsed with equal bravery and good fortune. But these incessant attacks
                    on the Portuguese evinced the decline of their empire, while the increased
                    military forces sent out to the East proved an insupportable drain on the
                    revenues and population of Portugal.</p>
                <p>‘ ‘ In 1580 the crown of Portugal, consequent on the death of King Sebastian,
                    became united with that of Spain, under Philip II.,—an event which proved the
                    last fatal blow to the maritime and commercial supremacy of Portugal. It proved
                    fatal in many ways, but chiefly because the interests of Portugal in Asia were
                    subordinated to the European interests of Spain. In 1640 Portugal again became a
                    separate kingdom, but in the meanwhile the Dutch and English had appeared in the
                    Eastern Seas, and before their indomitable competition the Portuguese trade and
                    dominion of the Indies withered away as rapidly as it had sprung up. The period
                    of the highest development of Portuguese commerce was probably from 1590 to
                    1610, on the eve of the subversion of their political power by the Dutch, and
                    when their political administration in India was at its lowest depth of
                    degradation. At this period a single fleet of Portuguese merchantmen sailing
                    from Goa to Cambay or Surat would number as many as 150 or 250 ‘carracks.’ Now
                    only one Portuguese ship sails from Lisbon to Goa in the year.”</p>
                <p>The only remaining Portuguese possessions in India are Goa, Daman, and Diu, all
                    on the west coast, with an area of 1086 square miles and a population of 407,712
                    souls. The general census of 1871 also returned 426 Portuguese dwelling in
                    British India, not including those of mixed descent, of whom about 30,000 are
                    found in Bombay and 20,000 in Bengal, chiefly in the neighbourhood of Dacca and
                    Chittagong. The latter are known as Firinghis; and, excepting that they retain
                    the Roman Catholic faith and European surnames, are scarcely to be distinguished
                    either by colour or by habits of life from the natives among whom they live.</p>
                <p>The Dutch were the first European nation to break through the Portuguese
                    monopoly. During the 16th century Bruges, Antwerp, and Amsterdam became
                    successively the great emporia whence Indian produce, imported by the
                    Portuguese, was distributed to Germany and even to England. At first the Dutch,
                    following in the track of the English, attempted to find their way to India by
                    sailing round the north coasts of Europe and Asia. William Barents is honourably
                    known as the leader of three of these arctic expeditions, in the last of which
                    he perished. The first Dutchman to double the Cape of Good Hope was Cornelius
                    Houtman, who reached Sumatra and Bantam in 1596. Forthwith private companies for
                    trade with the East were formed in many parts of the United Provinces, but in
                    1602 they were all amalgamated by the states-general into “The Dutch East India
                    Company.” Within a few years the Dutch had established factories on the
                    continent of India, in Ceylon, in Sumatra, on the Persian Gulf, and on the Red
                    Sea, besides having obtained exclusive possession of the Moluccas. In 1618 they
                    laid the foundation of the city of Batavia in Java, to be the seat of the
                    supreme government of the Dutch possessions in the East Indies, which had
                    previously been at Amboyna. At about the same time they discovered the coast of
                    Australia, and in North America founded the city of New Amsterdam or Manhattan,
                    now New York. During the 17th century the Dutch maritime power was the first in
                    the world. The massacre of Amboyna in 1623 led the English East India Company to
                    retire from the Eastern seas to the continent of India, and thus, though
                    indirectly, contributed to the foundation of the British Indian empire. The long
                    naval wars and bloody battles between the English and the Dutch within the
                    narrow seas were not terminated until William of Orange united the two crowns in
                    1689. In the far East the Dutch ruled without a rival, and gradually expelled
                    the Portuguese from almost all their territorial possessions. In 1635 they
                    occupied Formosa; in 1640 they took Malacca, a blow from which the Portuguese
                    never recovered; in 1651 they founded a colony at the Cape of Good Hope, as a
                    half-way station to the East; in 1658 they captured Jaffnapatam, the last
                    stronghold of the Portuguese in Ceylon; in 1664 they wrested from the Portuguese
                    all their earlier settlements on the pepper-bearing coast of Malabar. The rapid
                    and signal downfall of the Dutch colonial empire is to be explained by its
                    short-sighted commercial policy. It was deliberately based upon a monopoly of
                    the trade in spices, and remained from first to last destitute of the true
                    imperial spirit. Like the Phoenicians of old, the Dutch stopped short of no acts
                    of cruelty towards their rivals in commerce; and, like the Phoenicians, they
                    failed to introduce a respect for their own higher civilization among the
                    natives with whom they came in contact. The knell of Dutch supremacy was sounded
                    by Clive, when in 1758 ho attacked the Dutch at Chinsurah both by land and
                    water, and forced them to an ignominious capitulation. In the great French war
                    from 1781 to 1811 England wrested from Holland every one of her colonies, though
                    Java was restored in 1816 and Sumatra in exchange for Malacca in 1824. At the
                    present time the Dutch flag flies nowhere on the mainland of India, though the
                    quaint houses and regular canals at Chinsurah, at Negapatam, at Jaffnapatam, and
                    at <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit12newyrich/page/n821/mode/1up"

                    coasts, remind the traveller of familiar scenes in the Netherlands. In the
                    census of 1872 only seventy Dutchmen were enumerated throughout the whole of
                    India.</p>
                <p>The earliest English attempts to reach India were made by the North-West Passage.
                    In 1496 Henry VII. granted letters patent to John Cabot and his three sons (of
                    whom one was the better known Sebastian) to fit out two ships f .&gt;r the
                    exploration of that route. They failed, but discovered the island of
                    Newfoundland, and sailed along the coast of America from Labrador to Virginia.
                    In 1553 the ill-fated Sir Hugh Willoughby attempted to force a passage along the
                    north of Europe and Asia, the successful accomplishment of which has been
                    reserved for a Swedish savant of our own generation. Sir Hugh perished
                    miserably, but his second in command, Chancellor, reached a harbour on the White
                    Sea, now Archangel. Thence he penetrated by land to the court of the grand-duke
                    of Moscow, and laid the foundation of “the Russia Company for carrying on the
                    overland trade between India, Persia, Bokhara, and Moscow.” Many subsequent
                    attempts were madeat the North-West Passage from 1576 to 1616, which have left
                    on our modern maps the imperishable names of Frobisher, Davis, Hudson, and
                    Baffin. Meanwhile, in 1577, Sir Francis Drake had circumnavigated the globe, and
                    on his way home had touched at Ternate, one of the Moluccas, the king of which
                    island agreed to supply the English nation with all the cloves it produced. “The
                    first Englishman who actually visited India was Thomas Stephens, in 1579, unless
                    there be any foundation in fact for the statement of William of Malmesbury, that
                    in the year 883 Sighelmus of Sherborne, being sent by King Alfred to Rome with
                    presents to the pope, proceeded from thence to the East Indies to visit the tomb
                    of St Thomas at Mylapore (Mailapur, also called Saint Thomé, a suburb of
                    Madras), and brought back with him a quantity of jewels and spices. Stephens was
                    educated at New College, Oxford, and was rector of the Jesuits’ College in
                    Salsette. His letters to his father are said to have roused great enthusiasm in
                    England to trade directly with India. In 1583 three English merchants, Ralph
                    Fitch, James Newberry, and Leedes, went out to India overland as mercantile
                    adventurers. The jealous Portuguese threw them into prison at Ormuz, and again
                    at Goa. At length Newberry settled down as a shopkeeper at Goa., Leedes entered
                    the service of the Great Mughal, and Fitch, after a lengthened peregrination in
                    Ceylon, Bengal, Pegu, Siam, Malacca, and other parts of the East Indies,
                    returned to England.”</p>
                <p>The defeat of the “Invincible Armada” in 1588, at which time the crowns of Spain
                    and Portugal were united, gave a fresh stimulus to maritime enterprise in
                    England; and the successful voyage of Cornelius Houtman in 1596 showed the way

                    Founders’ Hall, with the lord mayor in the chair, and agreed to form an
                    association for the purpose of trading directly with India. Queen Elizabeth also
                    sent Sir John Mildenhall by Constantinople to the Great Mughal to apply for
                    privileges for the English company, for which she was then preparing a charter,
                    and on the 31st December 1600 the English East India Company was incorporated by
                    royal charter under the title of ‘The Governor and Company of Merchants of
                    London trading to the East Indies.’” The original company had only one hundred
                    and twenty-five shareholders, and a capital of £70,000, which was raised to
                    £400,000 in 1612, when voyages were first undertaken on the joint-stock account.
                    Courten’sassociation, known also as “The AssadaMerchants,” from a factory
                    founded by them in Madagascar, was established in 1635, but, after a period of
                    internecine rivalry, united with the London Company in 1650. In 1655 the
                    “Company of Merchant Adventurers” obtained a charter from Cromwell to trade with
                    India, but united with the original company two years later. A more formidable
                    rival subsequently appeared in the English company, or “General Society trading
                    to the East Indies,” which was incorporated under powerful patronage in 1698,
                    with a capital oi 2 millions sterling. According to Evelyn, in his <hi
                    rend="italic">Diary</hi> for March 5, 1698, “the old East India Company lost
                    their business against the new company by ten votes in parliament, so many of
                    their friends being absent, going to see a tiger baited by dogs.” However, a
                    compromise was speedily effected through the arbitration of Lord Godolphin in
                    1702, and the London and the English companies were finally amalgamated in 1709,
                    under the style of “The United Company of Merchants of England trading to the
                    East Indies.” At the same time the Company advanced a loan to the state of
                    £3,190,000 at 3 per cent, interest, in consideration of the exclusive privilege
                    to trade to all places between the Cape of Good Hope and the Straits of
                    Magellan.</p>
                <p>The early voyages of the Company, from 1600 to 1612, are distinguished as the
                    “separate voyages,” twelve in number. The subscribers individually bore the
                    expenses of each voyage, and reaped the whole pr fits. With the exception of the
                    fourth, all these separate voyages were highly prosperous, the profits hardly
                    ever falling below 100 per cent. After 1612 the voyages were conducted on the
                    joint-stock account.</p>
                <p>The following chronological sketch of the progress of the Company in the East is
                    quoted almost verbatim from Dr Birdwood’s valuable report</p>
                <p>“The English were everywhere opposed from the first, as the Dutch had been, by
                    the Portuguese; but James Lancaster succeeded in the first voyage (1602) in
                    establishing commercial relations with the king of Achin, and at Priaman in the
                    island of Sumatra, and with the Moluccas, and at Bantam, where he settled a
                    factory or ‘House of Trade’ in 1603. In 1604 the Company undertook their second
                    voyage, commanded by Sir Henry Middleton, who extended their trade to Banda and
                    Amboyna. The success of these voyages was so great that it induced a number of
                    private merchants to endeavour to obtain a participation in the trade; and in
                    1606 James I. granted a licence to Sir Edward Michelborne and others to trade
                    ‘to Cathay, China, Japan, Corea, and Cambaya? Michelborne, however, on arriving
                    in the East, instead of exploring new sources of commerce as the East India
                    Company were doing, followed the pernicious example of the Portuguese in
                    plundering the native traders among the islands of the Indian Archipelago. He in
                    this way secured a considerable booty, but brought great disgrace on the British
                    name, and much hindered the Company’s business at Bantam. In 1608 Captain D.
                    Middleton, in command of the fifth voyage, was prevented by the Dutch from
                    trading at Banda, but succeeded in obtaining a cargo at Pulo Way. In that year
                    also Captain Hawkins in the third voyage, commanded by Captain Keeling,
                    proceeded from Surat as envoy from James I. and the East India Com ρany to the
                    court of the Great Mughal. He was graciously received by the emperor (Jahangir),
                    and remained three years at Agra. In 1609 Captain Sharpey, who had conducted the
                    fourth voyage, obtained the grant of free trade at Aden, and a cargo of pepper
                    at Priaman. In that year also the Company constructed the dockyard at
                    Deptford,—which was the beginning, observes Sir William Monson, ‘of the increase
                    of great ships in England." In 1611 Sir Henry Middleton, in command of the sixth
                    voyage, arrived before Cambay, and resolutely fought the Portuguese, who tried
                    to beat him off, and obtained some important concessions from the native powers.
                    In 1610-11 also Captain Hippon, commanding the seventh voyage, succeeded in
                    establishing agencies at Masulipatam and in Siam, and at Patania or Patany on
                    the Malay peninsula, and a factory at Pettipollee.</p>
                <p>“In 1614 the Company’s fleet, of the tenth voyage, under Captain Best, was
                    attacked off Swalley, the port of Surat, at the mouth of the river Tâpti, by an
                    overwhelming force of Portuguese, who were utterly defeated in four successive
                    engagements, to the great astonishment of the natives, who had hitherto
                    considered them to be invincible. The first fruit of that decisive victory was
                    the settlement of a factory at Surat, with subordinate agencies at Gogra,
                    Ahmadâbâd, and Cambay. Trade was also opened with the Persian Gulf. In 1614 an
                    agency was established by Mr Edwards of the Surat factory at Ajmrr. In 1615 Sir
                    Thomas Roe was sent out by James I. as ambassador to the court of Jahangir, and
                    succeeded in placing the Company’s trade in the Mughal dominions on a more
                    favourable footing. The factory at Surat was the chief seat of the Company’s
                    government in western India until the presidency was transferred to Bombay in
                    1685. In 1618 the English established a factory at Mocha, while the Dutch
                    compelled them to resign all pretensions to the Spice Islands. In that year also
                    the Company failed in its attempt to open a trade with Dabul, Baticola, and
                    Calicut, through a want of sincerity on the part of the zamorin. In 1619 it was
                    permitted to settle a factory and build a fort at Jask, in the Persian Gulf.</p>
                <p>“In 1619 also the ‘ Treaty of Defence ’ with the Dutch, to prevent <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0912-0822-0799"/> disputes between the English and Dutch companies,
                    was ratified. When it was proclaimed in the East, hostilities solemnly ceased
                    for the space of an hour, while the Dutch and English fleets, dressed out in all
                    their flags and with yards manned, saluted each other; but the treaty ended in
                    the smoke of that stately salutation, and perpetual and fruitless contentions
                    between the Dutch and English companies went on the same as ever. Up to that
                    time the English company did not possess any portion of territory in sovereign
                    right in the Indies, excepting in the island of Lantore or Great Banda. That
                    island was governed by a commercial agent of the Company, who had under him
                    thirty Europeans as clerks, overseers, and warehousemen; and these, with two
                    hundred and fifty armed Malays, constituted the only force by which it was
                    protected. In the islands of Banda and Pulo Roon and Rosengynthe Company
                    possessed factories, in each of which were ten agents. At Macassar and Aehinalso
                    they possessed factories or agencies, the whole being subordinate to Bantam.
                    Such was the precarious situation of the English Company in the East at the
                    commencement of their long struggle for commercial equality with the Dutch,
                    whose ascendency in the Indian Archipelago was already firmly established on the
                    basis of territorial dominion and authority. In 1620 the Dutch, notwithstanding
                    the Treaty of Defence concluded the previous year, expelled the English from
                    Pulo Roon and Lantore, and in 1621 from Bantam. The fugitive factors attempted
                    to establish themselves first at Pulicat and afterwards at Masulipatam on the
                    Coromandel coast, but were effectually opposed by the Dutch. In 1620 also the
                    Portuguese made an attack upon the English fleet under Captain Shillinge, but
                    were again defeated with great loss, and from that time the estimation in which
                    the Portuguese were held by the natives of India steadily declined, while that
                    of the English was proportionately raised. In that year the Company established
                    agencies at Agra and Patna. In 1622 the English, joining with the Persians,
                    attacked and took Ormuz from the Portuguese, and obtained from Shah Abbas a
                    grant in perpetuity of the customs of Gombroon. This was the first time that the
                    English took the offensive against the Portuguese. In the same year the -Company
                    succeeded in re-establishing their factory at Masulipatam.</p>
                <p>“On the 17th February 1623 occurred the ‘Massacre of Amboyna;’ and from that time
                    the Dutch remained masters of Lantore and the neighbouring islands, and of the
                    whole trade of the Indian Archipelago, until these islands were recaptured by
                    the English in the great naval wars which commenced in 1793. In 1624 the
                    English, unable to oppose the Dutch, withdrew nearly all their factories from
                    the Archipelago, the Malay peninsula, Siam, and Japan. Some of the factors and
                    agents retired to the island of Lagundy in the Strait of Sunda, but were forced,
                    by its unhealthiness, to abandon it.</p>
                <p>“In 1625-26 a factory was established at Armagâon on the Coromandel coast,
                    subordinate to Masulipatam; but in 1628 Masulipatam was, in consequence of the
                    oppressions of the native governor, for a time abandoned in favour of Armagâon,
                    which then mounted twelve guns and had twenty-three factors and agents. In 1629
                    the factory at Bantam was re-established as an agency subordinate to Surat; and
                    in 1630 Armagâon, reinforced by twenty soldiers, was placed under the presidency
                    of Surat. In 1632 the factory was re-established at Masulipatam, by a firman,
                    known as the ‘Golden Firman,’ from the king of Golconda. In 1634, by a firman
                    dated February 2, the Company obtained from the Great Mughal liberty to trade in
                    Bengal, without any other restriction than that their ships were to resort only
                    to Pippli in Orissa. The Portuguese were in the same year expelled from Bengal.
                    In 1634-35 Bantam was again raised to an independent presidency, and an agéncy
                    was established at Tatta, or ‘Scindy.’ In 1637 Courten’s Association (chartered
                    1635) settled agencies at Goa, Baticola, Kârwâr (Carwar), Achin, and Râjâpur.
                    Its ships had in 1636 plundered some native vessels at Surat and Diu, which
                    disgraced the Company with the Mughal authorities (who could not comprehend the
                    distinction between the Company and the Association), and depressed the English
                    trade with Surat, while that of the Dutch proportionately increased. In 1638
                    Armagâon was abandoned as unsuited for commerce; and in 1639-40 Fort St George,
                    Madcraspatam (‘Chinee-patam ’), was founded by Francis Day, and the factors at
                    Armagâon were at once removed to it. It was made subordinate to Bantam, until
                    raised in 1683 to the rank of a presidency. In 1640 the Company established an
                    agency at Bussorah, ami a factory at Kârwâr. Trade having much extended, the
                    Company’s yard at Deptford was found too small for their ships, and they
                    purchased some copyhold ground at Blackwall, which at that time was a waste
                    marsh, without an inhabitant; and there they opened another dockyard, in which
                    was built the ‘Royal George,’ of 1200 tons, the largest ship yet seen in
                    England. In 1642 the factories at Balasore and Hùgli (Hooghly) were established.
                    In 1645, in consequence of services rendered by Dr Gabriel Broughton, surgeon of
                    the ’ Hopewell,’ to the emperor Sbâh Jahân, additional privileges were granted
                    to the Company; and in 1646 the governor of Bengal, who had also been
                    professionally benefited by Broughton, made c &gt;n-cessions which placed the
                    factories at Balasore and Hooghly on a more favourable footing. In 1647
                    Courten’s Association established its colony at Assada, in Madagascar. In 1652
                    Cromwell declared war against the Dutch on account of their accumulated injuries
                    against the Company. In 1653 the Company’s factory at Lucknow was withdrawn. No
                    record has been found of its establishment. In 1658 the Company established a
                    factory at Kâsimbâzâr (Cossimbazar, ‘ Castle Bazaar ’), an&lt;l their
                    establishments in Bengal were made subordinate to Fort St George instead of
                    Bantam.</p>
                <p>“In 1661 Bombay was ceded to the British crown as part of the dower of Catharine
                    of Braganza. It was not delivered up by the Portuguese until 1665, and was
                    transferred to the East India Com- . pany in 1668. The seat of the western
                    presidency was removed to it from Surat in 1685. At that time the Company’s
                    establishments in the East Indies consisted of the presidency of Bantam, with
                    .t∙ dependencies of Jambee, Macassar, and other places in the Indian
                    Archipelago; Fort St George and its dependent factories on the Coromandel coast
                    and Bengal; and Surat, with its affiliated dependency of Bombay, and factories
                    at Broach, Abmadâbâd, and other places in western India, and at Gombroon and
                    Bussorah in the Persian Gulf and Euphrates valley. In that year also (1661) the
                    factory at Biliapatam was founded. In 1663 the factories which had been
                    established at Patnâ, Balasore, and Kâsimbâzâr were ordered to be discontinued,
                    and purchases made only at Hooghly. In 1664 Surat was pillaged by Sivaji, but
                    Sir George Oxenden bravely defended the English factory; and the Mughal emperor,
                    in admiration of his conduct, granted the Company an exemption from customs for
                    one year.</p>
                <p>“In 1681 Bengal was separated from Madras, and Mr Hodges appointed ‘ agent and
                    governor ’ of the Company’s affairs ‘ in the Bay of Bengal, and of the factories
                    subordinate to it at Kâsimbâzâr, Patnâ, Balasore, Maldah, and Dacca. A corporal
                    of approved fidelity, with twenty soldiers, was to be a guard to the agent’s
                    person at the factory of Hooghly, and to act against interlopers.’ In 1683 Fort
                    St George (Madras) was constituted a presidency. In 1684 Sir John Child was made
                    ‘ captain-general and admiral of India,’ and Sir John Wybome ‘ vice-admiral and
                    deputy governor of Bombay; ’ and in 1685 the seat of the presidency was
                    transferred from Surat to Bombay. In 1686 the factory at Hooghly was much
                    oppressed by the governor of Bengal, and the Company’s business in India
                    generally suffered from the wars of the Mughals and Marhattâs. Sir John Child
                    was therefore appointed ‘governor-general,’ with full power in India to make
                    Avar or peace, and ordered to proceed to inspect the Company’s possessions in
                    Madras and Bengal, and arrange for their safety. On the 20th of December the
                    Company’s agent and council quitted the open factory at Hooghly, and retired to
                    Sutanati (Calcutta). Tegnapatam (Fort St David) was first settled in this year
                    (1686), and definitively established in 1691-92. In 1687 the Company retired
                    from all its factories and agencies in Bengal to Madras, but established the
                    settlement of Fort York at Bencoolem In 1689 the Company’s factories at
                    Vizagapatam and Masulipatam were seized by the Mahometans, and the factors
                    massacred. It was in 1689 also that at last the Company determined to
                    consolidate their position in India on the basis of territorial sovereignty, in
                    order to acquire the political status of an independent power in their relations
                    with the Mughals and Marhattâs. To this end they passed the following resolution
                    for the guidance of the local governments in India:—‘The increase of our revenue
                    is the subject of our care, as much as our trade; ’ tis that must maintain our
                    force when twenty accidents may interrupt our trade; ’ tis that must make us a
                    nation in India; without that we are but a great number of interlopers, united
                    by His Majesty’s royal charter, fit only to trade where nobody of power thinks
                    it their interest to prevent us; and upon this account it is that the wise
                    Dutch, in all their general advices that we have seen, write ten paragraphs
                    concerning their government, their civil and military policy, warfare, and the
                    increase of their revenue, for one paragraph they write concerning trade.’”</p>
                <p>It will be convenient to refer in this place to the other European nations who
                    attempted at various times to open trade with the East. The Portuguese at no
                    time attempted to found a company, but always maintained their Eastern trade as
                    a royal monopoly. The first incorporated company was the English, established in
                    1600, which was quickly followed by the Dutch in 1602. The Dutch conquests,
                    however, were made in the name of the state, and rank as national colonies, not
                    as private possessions. Next came tho French, whose first East India Company was
                    formed in 1604, the second in 1611, the third in 1615, the fourth (Richelieu’s)
                    in 1642, the fifth (Colbert’s) in 1644. The sixth was formed by the union of the
                    French East and West India, Senegal, and China companies under the name of “The
                    Company of the Indies,” in 1719. The exclusive privileges of the company were,
                    by the king’s decree, suspended in 1769, and the company was finally abolished
                    by the National Assembly in 1796. The first Danish East India Company was
                    founded in 1612, and the second in 1670. The settlements of Tranqnebar and
                    Serampur were both founded in 1616, and acquired by the English by purchase from
                    Denmark fn 1845. Other Danish settlements on the mainland of India were Porto
                    Novo, and Eddova and Holcheri on the Malabar coast The com.</p>

                <p>paιιy founded by the Scotch in 1695 may be regarded as having been still-born;
                    and the “Royal Company of the Philippine Islands,” incorporated by the king of
                    Spain in 1733, had little to do with India proper; of more importance, though
                    but short-lived, was “The Ostend Company,” incorporated by the emperor of
                    Austria in 1723, its factors being chiefly persons who had served the Dutch and
                    English companies. But the opposition of the maritime powers forced the court of
                    Vienna in 1727 to suspend the company’s charter for seven years. The Ostend
                    company, after passing through, a very trying existence, prolonged through the
                    desire of the Austrian Government to participate in the growing East India
                    trade, became bankrupt in 1784, and was finally extinguished by the regulations
                    which were prescribed on the renewal of the English East India Company’s charter
                    in 1793. The last nation of Europe to engage in maritime trade with India was
                    Sweden. When the Ostend company was suspended, a number of its servants were
                    thrown out of employment, of whose special knowledge of the East Mr Henry
                    Koning, of Stockholm, took advantage, obtaining a charter for the “Swedish
                    Company,” dated June 13, 1731. This company was reorganized in 1806. The extent
                    to which foreign nations now carry on direct dealings with India may be inferred
                    approximately from the following figures, taken from the census report of 1871.
                    There were then in British India about 8000 inhabitants of continental Europe;
                    but of these the nationality of only 2628 was more particularly specified,
                    chiefly in Bengal. Germans numbered 7 55, French, 631; Portuguese, 426;
                    Italians, 282; Greeks, 127; Swedes, 73; Russians, 72; Dutch, 70; Norwegians, 58;
                    Danes, 45; Spaniards, 32; Belgians, 20; Swiss, 19; Turks, 18.</p>

                <p>The political history of the British in India begins in the 18th century with the
                    French wars in the Carnatic. Fort St George, the nucleus of Madras, was their
                    earliest territorial possession, properly so called, in India, having been
                    founded by Thomas Day in 1639. The land on which it stood, with an area round of
                    about 5 miles in length by 1 mile in breadth, was purchased from the râjâ of
                    Chandragiri, who claimed to be the lineal descendant of the Hindu emperors of
                    Vijayanagar. The French settlement of Pondicherri, about 100 miles lower down
                    the Coromandel coast, was established in 1672, and for many years the English
                    and French traded side by side, without either active rivalry or territorial
                    ambition. The English, especially, appear to have been submissive to the native
                    powers at Madras no less than in Bengal. They paid their annual rent of 1200
                    pagodas (say £500) to the deputies of the Mughal empire when Aurangzeb annexed
                    the south, and on two several occasions bought off a besieging army with a heavy
                    bribe.</p>
                <p>On the death of Aurangzeb in 1707, the whole of southern India became practically
                    independent of Delhi. In the Deccan Proper, the Nizâm-ul-Mulk founded an
                    independent dynasty, with Hyderabad for its capital, which exercised a nominal
                    sovereignty over the entire south. The Carnatic, or the lowland tract between
                    the central plateau and the eastern sea, was ruled by a deputy of the nizâm,
                    known as the nawâb of Arcot, who in his turn asserted claims to hereditary
                    sovereignty. Further south, Trichinopoli was the capital of a Hindu râjâ, and
                    Tanjore formed another Hindu kingdom under a degenerate descendant of the line
                    of Sivaji. Inland, Mysore was gradually growing into a third Hindu state, while
                    everywhere local chieftains, called <hi rend="italic">pälegars</hi> or <hi
                    rend="italic">naiks,</hi> were in semi-independent possession of citadels or
                    hill-forts.</p>
                <p>In that condition of affairs the flame of war was kindled between the English and
                    the French in Europe in 1745. Dupleix was at that time governor of Pondicherri,
                    and Clive was a young writer at Madras. An English fleet first appeared on the
                    Coromandel coast, but Dupleix by a judicious present induced the nawâb of Arcot
                    to interpose and prevent hostilities. In 1746 a French squadron arrived, under
                    the command of La Bourdonnais. Madras surrendered almost without a blow, and the
                    only settlement left to the English was Fort St David, a few miles south of
                    Pondicherri, where Clive and a few other fugitives sought shelter. The nawâb,
                    faithful to his policy of impartiality, marched with 10,000 men to drive the
                    French out of Madras, but he was signally defeated by a French force of only
                    four hundred men and two guns. In 1748 an English fleet arrived under Admiral
                    Boscawen and attempted the siege of Pondicherri, while a land force co-operated
                    under Major Lawrence, whose name afterwards became associated with that of
                    Clive. The French successfully repulsed all attacks, and at last peace was
                    restored by the treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle, which gave back Madras to the English
                    (1748).</p>
                <p>The first war with the French was merely an incident in the greater contest in
                    Europe. The second war had its origin in Indian politics, while England and
                    France were at peace. The easy success of the French arms had inspired Dupleix
                    with the ambition of founding a French empire in India, under the shadow of the
                    existing Mahometan powers. Disputed successions at Hyderabad and at Arcot
                    supplied him with the opportunity that he lacked. On both thrones he placed
                    nominees of his own, and for a short time posed as the supreme arbiter of the
                    entire south. In boldness of conception, and in knowledge of Oriental diplomacy,
                    Dupleix has had probably no rival. But he was no soldier, and he was destined in
                    that sphere to encounter the “heaven-born genius” of Clive. For the English of
                    Madras, under the instinct of self-preservation, were compelled to maintain the
                    cause of another candidate to the throne of Arcot in opposition to the nominee
                    of Dupleix. This candidate was Muhammad All, afterwards known in history as
                    Wâla-jah. The war that then ensued between the French and English, each with
                    their native allies, has been exhaustively described in the pages of Orme. The
                    one incident that stands out conspicuously is the capture and subsequent defence
                    of Arcot by Clive in 1751. This heroic feat, even more than the battle of
                    Plassey, established the reputation of the English for valour throughout India.
                    Shortly afterwards Clive returned to England in ill-health, but the war
                    continued fitfully for many years. On the whole, English influence predominated
                    in the Carnatic, and their candidate, Muhammad All, maintained his position at
                    Arcot. But the French were no less supreme in the Deccan, whence they were able
                    to take possession of the coast tract called “the Northern Circars.” The final
                    struggle was postponed until 1760, when Colonel (afterwards Sir Eyre) Coote won
                    the decisive victory of Wandewash over the French general Lally, and proceeded
                    to invest Pondicherri, which was starved into capitulation in January 1761. A
                    few months later the hill-fortress of Gingee (Chenji) also surrendered. In the
                    words of Orme, “That day terminated the long hostilities between the two rival
                    European powers in Coromandel, and left not a single ensign of the French nation
                    avowed by the authority of its Government in any part of India.”</p>
                <p>Meanwhile the interest of history shifts with Clive to Bengal. The first English
                    settlement in that part of India was Pippli in Orissa, to which the East India
                    Company was permitted to trade in 1633, six years before the foundatioι of
                    Madras. The river on which Pippli stood has since silted up, and the very site
                    of the English settlement is now unknown and undiscoverable. In 1642 factories
                    were opened at Balasore and Hügli (Hooghly), and in 1681 Bengal was erected into
                    a presidency, as yet subject to Madras. The name of Calcutta is not heard of
                    till 1686, when Job Charnock, the chief at Hooghly, was expelled by the deputy
                    of Aurangzeb, and settled lower down the river on the opposite bank. There he
                    acquired a grant of the three petty villages of Sutanati, Gobindpur, and
                    Kâlighât (Calcutta), and founded the original Fort William in 1696.</p>
                <p>At the time of Aurangzeb’s death in 1707 the nawâb or governor of Bengal was
                    Murshid Kuli Khân, known also <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit12newyrich/page/n824/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0912-0824-0801"/> in European history as Jafar Khâu. By birth a
                    Brâhman, and brought up as a slave in Persia, he united the administrative
                    ability of a Hindu to the fanaticism of a renegade. Hitherto the capital of
                    Bengal had been at Dacca on the eastern frontier of the empire, whence the
                    piratical attacks of the Portuguese and of the Arakanese or Maghs could be most
                    easily checked. Murshid Kuli Khân transferred his residence to Murshidâbâd
                    (Moorshedabad), in the neighbourhood of Kâsimbâzâr (Cossimbazar), the river port
                    of all the Ganges trade. The English, the French, and the Dutch had each
                    factories at Kâsimbâzâr, as well as at Dâcca, Patnâ, and Maldah. But Calcutta
                    was the headquarters of the English, Chandarnagar of the French, and Chinsurah
                    of the Dutch, all three towns being situated close to each other in the lower
                    reaches of the Hooghly, where the river is navigable for large ships. Murshid
                    Kuli Khân ruled over Bengal prosperously for twenty-one years, and left his
                    power to a son-in-law and a grandson. The hereditary succession was broken in
                    1740 by Ali Vardi Khân, who was the last of the great nawâbs of Bengal. In his
                    days the Marhattâ horsemen began to ravage the country, and the English at
                    Calcutta obtained permission to erect an earth-work, which is known to the
                    present day as the Marhattâ ditch. All Vardi Khân died in 1756, and was
                    succeeded by his grandson, Sirâj-ud-Daulâ (Surajah Dowlah), a youth of only
                    eighteen years, whose ungovernable temper led to a rupture with the English
                    within two months after his accession. In pursuit of one of his own family who
                    had escaped from his vengeance, he marched upon Calcutta with a large army. Many
                    of the English fled down the river in their ships. The remainder surrendered
                    after a feeble resistance, and were thrown as prisoners into the “black hole” or
                    military jail of Fort William, a room about 18 feet square, with only two small
                    windows barred with iron. It was the month of June, in which the tropical heat
                    of Calcutta is most oppressive. When the door of the prison was opened in the
                    morning, only twenty-three persons out of one hundred and forty-six were found
                    alive.</p>
                <p>The news of this disaster fortunately fcund Clive returned to Madras, where also
                    was a squadron of king’s ships under Admiral Watson. Clive and Watson promptly
                    sailed to the mouth of the Ganges with all the troops that could be got
                    together.' Calcutta was recovered with little fighting, and the nawâb consented
                    to a peace which restored to the Company all their privileges, and gave them
                    compensation for their losses of property. It is possible that matters might
                    have ended here if a fresh cause of hostilities had not suddenly arisen. War had
                    just been declared between the English and French in Europe, and Clive,
                    following the traditions of his early warfare in the Carnatic, attacked and
                    captured Chandarnagar. Sirâj-ud-Daulâ, exasperated by that breach of neutrality
                    within his own dominions, took the side of the French. But Clive, again acting
                    upon the policy he had learned from Dupleix, had provided himself with a rival
                    candidate to the throne. Undaunted, he marched out to the battlefield of Plassey
                    (Palâsi), at the head of about 1000 Europeans and 2100 sepoys, with 9 pieces of
                    artillery. The Mahometan army is said to have consisted of 50,000 foot, 18,000
                    horse, and 50 pieces of cannon. But there was a traitor in the Mahometan camp in
                    the person of Mir Jafar, who had married a sister of the late nawâb, Ali Vardi
                    Khân. The battle was short but decisive. After a few rounds of artillery fire,
                    Surâj-ud-Daulâ fled, and the road to Murshidâbâd was left open.</p>
                <p>The battle of Plassey was fought on June 23, 1757, an anniversary afterwards
                    remembered when the mutiny was at its height in 1857. History has agreed to
                    adopt this date as the beginning of the British empire in the East; but the
                    immediate results of the victory were comparatively small, and several more
                    hard-won fights were fought before even the Bengalis would admit the superiority
                    of the British arms. For the moment, however, all opposition was at an end.
                    Clive, again following in the steps of Dupleix, placed his nominee, Mir Jafar,
                    upon the <hi rend="italic">masnad</hi> at Murshidâbâd, being careful to obtain a
                    patent of investiture from the Mughal court. Enormous sums were exacted from Mir
                    Jafar as the price of his elevation. The Company claimed 10,000,000 rupees as
                    compensation for losses; for the English, the Indian, and the Armenian
                    inhabitants of Calcutta there were demanded the sums of 5,000,000, 2,000,000,
                    and 700,000 rupees; for the squadron 2,500,000 rupees, and an equal sum for the
                    army. The members of the council received the following amounts: —Mr Drake,
                    thegovernor, and Colonel Clive 280,000 rupees each; and Mr Becker, Mr Watts, and
                    Major Kilpatrick 240,000 rupees each. The whole amounted to &lt;£2,697,750. The
                    English, deluded by their avarice, still cherished extravagant ideas of Indian
                    wealth; nor would they listen to the ungrateful truth. But it was found that
                    there were no funds in the treasury to satisfy their inordinate demands, and
                    they were obliged to be contented with one-half the stipulated sums, which,
                    after many difficulties, were paid in specie and in jewels, with the exception
                    of 584,905 rupees. The shares of the council were, however, paid in full. At the
                    same time the nawâb made a grant to the Company of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >zaminddri</hi> rights over an extensive tract of country round Calcutta, now
                    known as the district of the Twenty-four Parganâs. The area of this tract was
                    about 882 square miles, and it paid a permanent revenue or quit rent of about
                    &lt;£23,000. The gross rental at first payable to the Company was &lt;£53,000,
                    but within a period of ten years it had risen to £146,000. Originally the
                    Company possessed only the <hi rend="italic">zaminddri</hi> rights, 7,e.,
                    revenue jurisdiction. The superior lordship, or right to receive the quit rent,
                    remained with the nawâb; but in 1759 this also was parted with by the Delhi
                    emperor, the nominal suzerain of the nawâb, in favour of Clive, who thus became
                    the landlord of his own masters, the Company. At that time also Clive was
                    enrolled among the nobility of the Mughal empire, with the rank of commander of
                    6000 foot and 5000 horse. Clive’s <hi rend="italic">jagir,</hi> as it was
                    called, subsequently became a matter of inquiry in England, and on his death' it
                    passed to the Company, thus merging the <hi rend="italic">zaminddri</hi> in the
                    proprietary rights.</p>
                <p>In 1758 Clive was appointed by the court of directors the first governor of all
                    the Company’s settlements in Bengal. From two quarters troubles threatened,
                    which perhaps Clive alone was capable of overcoming. On the west the <hi
                    rend="italic">shdhzdda</hi> or imperial prince, known afterwards as the emperor
                    Shâh Alam, with a mixed army of Afghans and Marhattâs, and supported by the
                    nawâb wazir of Oudh, was advancing his own claims to the province of Bengal. In
                    the south the influence of the French under Lally and Bussy was overshadowing
                    the British at Madras. But the name of Clive exercised a decisive effect in both
                    directions. Mir Jafar was anxious to buy off the shâhzâda, who had already
                    invested Patnâ. But Clive in person marched to the rescue, with an army of only
                    450 Europeans and 2500 sepoys, and the Mughal army dispersed without striking a
                    blow. In the same year Clive despatched a force southwards under Colonel Forde,
                    which recaptured Masulipatam from the French, and permanently established
                    British influence throughout the Northern Circars, and at the court of
                    Hyderabad. Ho next attacked the Dutch, the sole European nation that might yet
                    be a formidable rival to the English. He defeated them both by land and water;
                    and from that time their settlement at Chinsurah existed only on sufferance.</p>

                <p>From 1760 to 1765, while Clive was at home, the history of the English in Bengal
                    contains little that is creditable. Clive had left behind him no system of
                    government, but merely the tradition that unlimited sums of money might be
                    extracted from the natives by the mere terror of the English name. In 1761 it
                    was found expedient and profitable to dethrone Mir Jafar, the English nawâb of
                    Murshidâbâd, and substitute his son-in-law, Mir Kâsim, in his place. On that
                    occasion, besides private donations, the English received a grant of the three
                    districts of Bardwân, Midnapur, and Chittagong, estimated to yield a net revenue
                    of half a million sterling. But Mir Kâsim proved to possess a will of his own,
                    and to cherish dreams of independence. He retired from Murshidâbâd to Monghyr, a
                    strong position on the Ganges, which commanded the only means of communication
                    with the west. There he proceeded to organize an army, drilled and equipped
                    after European models, and to carry on intrigues with the nawâb wazir of Oudh.
                    The actual outbreak of hostilities with the English happened on this wise. The
                    Company’s servants claimed the privilege of carrying on private trade throughout
                    Bengal, free from inland dues and all other imposts. The assertion of this claim
                    caused frequent affrays between the customs’ officers of the nawâb and those
                    traders who, whether falsely or not, represented that they were acting on behalf
                    of the servants of the Company. The nawâb alleged that his civil authority was
                    everywhere being set at nought. The majority of the council at Calcutta would
                    not listen to his statements. The governor, Mr Vansittart, and Warren Hastings,
                    then a junior member of council, attempted to effect some compromise. But the
                    controversy had become too hot. The nawâb’s officers fired upon an English boat,
                    and forthwith all Bengal was in a blaze. A force of 2000 sepoys was cut to
                    pieces at Patnâ, and about 200 Englishmen in various parts of the province fell
                    into the hands of the Mahometans, and were subsequently massacred. But as soon
                    as regular warfare commenced Mir Kâsim met with no more successes. His trained
                    regiments were defeated in two pitched battles by Major Adams, at Gheriah and at
                    Udha-nâlâ, and he himself took refuge with the nawâb wazir of Oudh, who refused
                    to deliver him up. This led to a prolongation of the war. Shâh Alam, who had now
                    succeeded his father as emperor, and Shujâ-ud-Daulâ, the nawâb wa'zir of Oudh,
                    united their forces, and threatened Patnâ, which the English had recovered. A
                    more formidable danger appeared in the English camp, in the form of the first
                    sepoy mutiny. This was quelled by Major (afterwards Sir Hector) Munro, who
                    ordered twenty-four of the ringleaders to be blown from guns, an old Mughal
                    punishment. In 1764 Major Munro won the decisive battle of Baxâr, which laid
                    Oudh at the feet of the conquerors, and brought the Mughal emperor as a
                    suppliant to the English camp.</p>
                <p>Meanwhile the council at Calcutta had twice found the opportunity they desired of
                    selling the government of Bengal to a new nawâb. But in 1765 Clive (now Baron
                    Clive of Plassey, in the peerage of Ireland) arrived at Calcutta, as governor of
                    Bengal for the second time, to settle the entire system of relations with the
                    native powers. Two objects stand out conspicuously in his policy. First, he
                    sought to acquire the substance, though not the name, of territorial power, by
                    using the authority of the Mughal emperor for so much as he wished, and for no
                    more; and, secondly, he desired to purify the Company’s service by prohibiting
                    illicit gains, and at the same time guaranteeing a reasonable remuneration from
                    honest sources. In neither respect were the details of his plans carried out by
                    his successors. But the beginning of our Indian administration dates from this
                    second governor ship of Clive, just as the origin of our Indian empire dates
                    from his victory at Plassey. Clive’s first step was to hurry up from Calcutta to
                    Allahâbâd, and there settle in person the fate of nearly half India. Oudh was
                    given back to the nawâb wazir, on condition of his paying half a million
                    sterling towards the expenses of the war. The provinces of Allahâbâd and Kora,
                    forming the greater part of the Doâb, were handed over to Shâh Alam himself, who
                    in his turn granted to the Company the <hi rend="italic">diwdni</hi> or
                    financial administration of Bengal, Behar, and Orissa, and also the territorial
                    jurisdiction of the Northern Circars. A puppet nawâb was still maintained at
                    Murshidâbâd, who received an annual allowance of about half a million sterling;
                    and half that amount was paid to the emperor as tribute from Bengal. Thus was
                    constituted the dual system of government, by which the English received all the
                    revenues and undertook to maintain an army for the defence of the frontier,
                    while the criminal jurisdiction vested in the nawâb. In Indian phraseology, the
                    Company was diwân and the nawâb was nizâm. As a matter of general
                    administration, the actual collection of the revenues still remained for some
                    years in the hands of native officials. In attempting to reorganize and purify
                    the Company’s service, Clive undertook a task yet more difficult than to
                    partition the valley of the Ganges. The officers, civil and military alike, were
                    all tainted with the common corruption. Their legal salaries were absolutely
                    insignificant, but they had been permitted to augment them ten and a hundredfold
                    by means of private trade and gifts from the native powers. Despite the united
                    resistance of the civil servants, and an actual mutiny of two hundred military
                    officers, Clive carried through his reforms. Both private trade and the receipt
                    of presents were absolutely prohibited for the future, while a substantial
                    increase of pay was provided out of the monopoly of salt.</p>
                <p>Lord Clive quitted India for the third and last time in 1767. Between that date
                    and the arrival of Warren Hastings in 1772 nothing of importance occurred in
                    Bengal beyond the terrible famine of 1770, which is officially reported to have
                    swept away one-third of the inhabitants. The dual system of government, however,
                    established by Clive, had proved a failure. Warren Hastings, a tried servant of
                    the Company, distinguished alike for intelligence, for probity, and for
                    knowledge of Oriental manners, was nominated governor by the court of directors,
                    with express instructions to carry out a predetermined series of reforms. In
                    their own words, the court had resolved to “stand forth as diwân, and to take
                    upon themselves, by the agency of their own servants, the entire care and
                    administration of the revenues.” In the execution of this plan, Hastings removed
                    the exchequer from Murshidâbâd to Calcutta, and for the first time appointed
                    European officers, under the now familiar title of collectors, to superintend
                    the revenue collections and preside in the civil courts. The urgency of foreign
                    affairs, and subsequently internal strife at the council table, hindered
                    Hastings from developing further the system of civil administration, a task
                    finally accomplished by Lord Cornwallis.</p>
                <p>Though Hastings always prided himself specially upon that reform, as well as upon
                    the improvements he introduced into the collection of the revenues from salt and
                    opium, his name will be remembered in history for the boldness and success of
                    his foreign policy. From 1772 to 1774 he was governor of Bengal; from 1774 to
                    1785 he was the first titular governor-general of India, presiding over a
                    council nominated, like himself, not by the Company, but by an Act of
                    Parliament, known as the Regulating Act. In his domestic policy he was greatly
                    hampered by the opposition of Francis; but, so far as regards external·
                    relations with Oudh, with the <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit12newyrich/page/n826/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0912-0826-0803"/> Marhattâs, and with Hyder Ali, he was generally
                    able to compel assent to his own measures. His treatment of Oudh may here be
                    passed over as not being material to the general history of India, while the
                    personal aspects of his rule have been fully discussed in a separate article
                    (vol. xi. p. 512). To explain his Marhattâ policy, it will be necessary to give
                    a short retrospective sketch of the history of that people.</p>
                <p>Sivaji the Great, as already mentioned, died in 1680, while Aurangzeb was still
                    on the throne. The family of Sivaji produced no great names, either among those
                    who continued to be the nominal chiefs of the Marhattâ confederacy, with their
                    capital at Sâtârâ, or among the râjâs of Kolhapur and Tanjore. All real power
                    passed into the hands of the peshwâ, or Brâhman minister, who founded in his
                    turn an hereditary dynasty at Poona, dating from the beginning of the 18th
                    century. Next rose several Marhattâ generals, who, though recognizing the
                    suzerainty of the peshwâ, carved out for themselves independent kingdoms in
                    different parts of India, sometimes far from the original home of the Marhattâ
                    race. Chief among these generals were the gâikwâr in Guzerat, Sindhia, and
                    Holkar in Mâlwa, and the Bhonslâ râjâ of Berar and Nâgpur. At one time it seemed
                    probable that the Marhattâ confederacy would expel the Mahometans even from
                    northern India; but the decisive battle of Pânipat, won by the Afghâns in 1761,
                    gave a respite to the Delhi empire. The Marhattâ chiefs never again united
                    heartily for a common purpose, though they still continued to be the most
                    formidable military power in India. In especial, they dominated over the British
                    settlement of Bombay on the western coast, which was the last of the three
                    presidencies to feel the lust of territorial ambition. For more than a hundred
                    years, from its acquisition in 1661 to the outbreak of the first Marhattâ war in
                    1775, the English on the -west coast possessed no territory outside the island
                    of Bombay and their fortified factory at Surat.</p>
                <p>The Bombay Government was naturally emulous to follow the example of Madras and
                    Bengal, and to establish its influence at the court of Poona by placing its own
                    nominee upon the throne. The attempt took form in 1775 in the treaty of Surat,
                    by which Raghunâth Râô, one of the claimants to the throne of the peshwâ, agreed
                    to cede Salsette and Bassein to the English, in consideration of being himself
                    restored to Poona. The military operations that followed are known as the first
                    Marhattâ war. Warren Hastings, who in his capacity of governor-general claimed a
                    right of control over the decisions of the Bombay Government, strongly
                    disapproved of the treaty of Surat, but, when war once broke out, he threw the
                    whole force of the Bengal army into the scale. One of his favourite officers,
                    General Goddard, marched across the peninsula from sea to sea, and conquered the
                    rich province of Guzerat almost without a blow. Another, Captain Popham, stormed
                    the rock-fortress of Gwalior, which was regarded as the key of Hindustân. Those
                    brilliant successes atoned for the disgrace of the convention of Wargaum in
                    1779, when the Marhattâs dictated terms to a British force, but the war was
                    protracted until 1782. It was then closed by the treaty of Salbye, which
                    practically restored the <hi rend="italic">status quo.</hi> Raghunâth Râo, the
                    English claimant, was set aside; Guzerat was restored, and only Salsette and
                    some other small islands were retained by the English.</p>
                <p>Meanwhile Warren Hastings had to deal with a more formidable enemy than the
                    Marhattâ confederacy. The reckless conduct of the Madras Government had roused
                    the hostility both of Hyder Ali of Mysore and of the nizâm of the Deccan, the
                    two strongest Musalmân powers in India, who attempted to draw the Marhattâs into
                    an alliance against the English. The diplomacy of Hastings won over the nizâm
                    and the Marhattâ râjâ of Nâgpur, but the army of Hyder Ali fell like a
                    thunderbolt upon the British possessions in the Carnatic. A strong detachment
                    under Colonel Baillie was cut to pieces at Pollilore, and the Mysore cavalry
                    ravaged the country unchecked up to the walls of Madras. For the second time the
                    Bengal army, stimulated by the energy of Hastings, saved the honour of the
                    English name. Sir Eyre Coote, the victor of Wandewash, was sent by sea to
                    relieve Madras with all the men and money available, while Colonel Pearse
                    marched south overland to overawe the râjâ of Berar and the nizâm. The war was
                    hotly contested, for Sir Eyre Coote was now an old man, and the Mysore army was
                    well-disciplined and equipped, and also skilfully handled by Hyder and his son
                    Τίρύ (Tippoo). Hyder died in 1782, and peace was finally concluded with Τίρύ in
                    1784, on the basis of a mutual restitution of all conquests.</p>
                <p>It was Warren Hastings’s merit to organize the empire which Clive founded. He was
                    governor or governor-general for thirteen years, a longer period than any of his
                    successors. During that time the English lost the American colonies, but in
                    India their reputation steadily rose to its highest pitch. Within a year
                    Hastings was succeeded by Lord Cornwallis, the first English nobleman of rank
                    who undertook the office of governor-general. His rule lasted from 1786 to 1793,
                    and is celebrated for two events—the introduction of the permanent settlement
                    into Bengal, and the second Mysore war. If the foundations of the system of
                    civil administration were laid by Hastings, the superstructure was erected by
                    Cornwallis. It was he who first entrusted criminal jurisdiction to Europeans,
                    and established the Nizâmat Sadr Adâlat, or supreme court of criminal
                    judicature, at Calcutta; and it was he who separated the functions of collector
                    and judge. The system thus organized in Bengal was afterwards transferred to
                    Madrasand Bombay, when those presidencies also acquired territorial sovereignty.
                    But the achievement most familiarly associated with the name of Cornwallis is
                    the permanent settlement of the land revenue of Bengal. Up to his time the
                    revenue had been collected pretty much according to the old Mughal system. <hi
                    rend="italic">Zaminddrs,</hi> or Government farmers, whose office always tended
                    to become hereditary, were recognized as having a right of some sort to collect
                    the revenue from the actual cultivators. But no principle of assessment existed,
                    and the amount actually realized varied greatly from year to year. Hastings had
                    the reputation of bearing hard upon the <hi rend="italic">zamimddrs,</hi> and
                    was absorbed in other critical affairs of state or of war. On the whole he seems
                    to have looked to experience, as acquired from a succession of quinquennial
                    settlements, to furnish the standard rate of the future. Francis, on the other
                    hand, Hastings’s great rival, deserves the credit of being among the first to
                    advocate a limitation of the state demand in perpetuity. The same view
                    recommended itself to the authorities at home, partly because it would place
                    their finances on a more stable basis, partly because it seemed to identify the
                    <hi rend="italic">zαrninddr</hi> with the more familiar landlord. Accordingly,
                    Cornwallis took out with him in 1787 instructions to introduce a permanent
                    settlement. The process of assessment began in 1789 and terminated in 1791. No
                    attempt was made to measure the fields or calculate the out-turn as had been
                    done by Akbar, and is now done when occasion requires in the British provinces;
                    but the amount payable was fixed by reference to what had been paid in the past.
                    At first the settlement was called decennial, but in 1793 it was declared
                    permanent for ever. The total assessment amounted to <hi rend="italic"
                    >sihlca</hi> Rs.26,800,989, or about 2∣ millions sterling. Though Lord
                    Cornwallis carried the scheme into execution, all praise or blame, so far as
                    details are concerned, must <pb break="no"

                    Cornwallis’s preconceived idea of a proprietary body and the court of directors’
                    haste after fixity permitted»</p>
                <p>The second Mysore war of 1790-92 is noteworthy on two accounts: Lord Cornwallis,
                    the governor-general, led the British army in person, with a pomp and lavishness
                    of supplies that recalled the campaigns of Aurangzeb; and the two great native
                    powers, the nizâm of the Deccan and the Marhattâ confederacy, co-operated as
                    allies of the British. In the result, Tipù Sultân submitted when Lord Cornwallis
                    had commenced to beleaguer his capital. He agreed to yield one-half of his
                    dominions to be divided among the allies, and to pay three millions sterling
                    towards the cost of the war. Those conditions he fulfilled, but ever afterwards
                    he burned to be revenged upon his English conquerors.</p>
                <p>The period of Sir John Shore’s rule as governor-general, from 1793 to 1798, was
                    uneventful. In 1798 Lord Mornington, better known as the marquis of Wellesley,
                    arrived in India, already inspired with imperial projects that were destined to
                    change the map of the country. Mornington was the friend and favourite of Pitt,
                    from whom he is thought to have derived the comprehensiveness of his political
                    vision and his antipathy to the French name. From the first he laid down as his
                    guiding principle that the English must be the one paramount power in the
                    peninsula, and that native princes could only retain the insignia of sovereignty
                    by surrendering the substance of independence. The subsequent political history
                    of India has been but the gradual development of this policy, which received its
                    finishing touch when Queen Victoria was proclaimed empress of India in 1877.</p>
                <p>To frustrate the possibility of a French invasion of India, led by Napoleon in
                    person, was the governing idea of Wellesley’s foreign policy; for France at this
                    time, and for many years later, filled the place afterwards occupied by Russia
                    in the imagination of English statesmen. Nor was the possibility so remote as
                    might now be thought. French regiments guarded and overawed the nizâm of
                    Hyderabad. The soldiers of Sindhia, the military head of the Marhattâ
                    confederacy, were disciplined and led by French adventurers. Tipù Sultân carried
                    on a secret correspondence with the French directorate, and allowed a tree of
                    liberty to be planted in his dominions. The islands of Mauritius and Bourbon
                    afforded a convenient half-way house both for French intrigue and for the
                    assembling of a hostile expedition. Above all, Napoleon Buonaparte was then in
                    Egypt, dreaming of the conquests of Alexander; and no man knew in what direction
                    he might turn his hitherto unconquered legions. Wellesley first addressed
                    himself to the nizâm, where his policy prevailed without serious opposition. The
                    French battalions at Hyderabad were disbanded, and the nizâm bound himself by
                    treaty not to take any European into his service without the consent of the
                    English Government,—a clause since inserted in every engagement entered into
                    with native powers. Next, the whole weight of Wellesley’s resources was turned
                    against Tipù, whom Cornwallis had scotched but not killed. His intrigues with
                    the French were laid bare, and he was given an opportunity of adhering to the
                    new subsidiary system. On his refusal war was declared, and Wellesley came down
                    in state to Madras to organize the expedition in person, and watch over the
                    course of events. One English army marched into Mysore from Madras, accompanied
                    by a contingent from the nizâm. Another advanced from the western coast. Tipù,
                    after offering but a feeble resistance in the field, retired into Seringapatam,
                    and, when his capital was stormed, died fighting bravely in the breach. Since
                    the battle of Plassey no event so greatly impressed the native imagination as
                    the capture of Seringapatam, which won for General Harris a peerage and for
                    Wellesley an Irish marquisate. In dealing with the territories of Τίρύ,
                    Wellesley acted with unusual moderation. The central portion, forming the old
                    state of Mysore, was restored to an infant representative of the Hindu râjâs,
                    whom Hyder Ali had dethroned, while the rest was partitioned between the nizâm,
                    the Marhattâs, and the English. At about the same time the province of the
                    Carnatic, or all that large portion of southern India ruled by the nawâb of
                    Arcot, and also the principality of Tanjore, were placed under direct British
                    administration, thus constituting the Madras presidency almost as it has existed
                    to the present day.</p>
                <p>The Marhattâs had been the nominal allies of the English in both their wars with
                    Tipιi, but they had never given active assistance, nor were they secured to the
                    English side as the nizâm now was. The Marhattâ powers at this time were five in
                    number. The recognized head of the confederacy was the peshwâ of Poona, who
                    ruled the hill country of the Western Ghâts, the cradle of the Marhattâ race.
                    The fertile province of Guzerat was annually harried by the horsemen of the
                    gâikwâr of Baroda. In Central India two military leaders, Sindhia of Gwalior and
                    Holkar of India, alternately held the pre-eminency. Towards the east the Bhonslâ
                    râjâ of Nâgpur, sprung from the same stock as Sivaji, reigned from Berar to the
                    coast of Orissa. Wellesley tried assiduously to bring these several Marhattâ
                    powers within the net of his subsidiary system. At last, in 1802, the
                    necessities of the peshwâ, who had been defeated by Holkar, and driven as a
                    fugitive into British territory, induced him to sign the treaty of Bassein, by
                    which he pledged himself to hold communications with no other power, European or
                    native, and ceded territory for the maintenance of a subsidiary force. This
                    greatly extended the English territorial influence in the Bombay presidency, but
                    led directly to the second Marhattâ war, for neither Sindhia nor the râjâ of
                    Nâgpur would tolerate this abandonment of Marhattâ independence. The campaigns
                    that followed are perhaps the most glorious in the history of the British arms
                    in India. The general plan and the adequate provision of resources were due to
                    the marquis of Wellesley, as also the indomitable spirit that could not
                    anticipate defeat. The armies were led by Sir Arthur Wellesley (afterwards duke
                    of Wellington) and General (afterwards Lord) Lake. Wellesley operated in the
                    Deccan, where, in a few short months, he won the decisive victories of Assaye
                    and Argaum, and captured Ahmadnagar. Lake’s campaign in Hindustân was no less
                    brilliant, though it has received less notice from historians. He won pitched
                    battles at Aligarh and Lâswâri, and captured the cities of Delhi and Agra, thus
                    scattering the French troops of Sindhia, and at the same time coming forward as
                    the champion of the Mughal emperor in his hereditary capitals. Before the year
                    1803 was out, both Sindhia and the Bhonslâ râjâ were glad to sue for peace.
                    Sindhia ceded all claims to the territory north of the Jumna, and left the blind
                    old emperor Shâh Alam once more under British protection. The Bhonslâ forfeited
                    Orissa to the English, who had already occupied it with a flying column, and
                    Berar to the nizâm, who gained a fresh addition by every act of complaisance to
                    the British Government. The freebooter, Jaswant Râo Holkar, alone remained in
                    the field, supporting his troops by ravages through Mâlwâ and Râjputâna. The
                    concluding years of Wellesley’s rule were occupied with a series of operations
                    against Holkar, which brought no credit on the British name. The disastrous
                    retreat of Colonel Monson through Central India recalled memories of the
                    convention of Wargaum, and of the destruction of Colonel <pb break="no"

                    in person at the siege of Bhartpur (Bhurtpore) is memorable as an instance of a
                    British army in India having to turn back with its object unaccomplished.</p>
                <p>The ambitious policy and the continuous wars of Lord Wellesley exhausted the
                    patience of the court of directors at home. In 1804 Lord Cornwallis was sent out
                    as governorgeneral a second time, with instructions to bring about peace at any
                    price, while Holkar was still unsubdued, and Sindhia was threatening a fresh
                    war. But Cornwallis •was now an old man and broken down in health. Travelling up
                    to the north-west during the rainy season, he sank and died at Ghâzipur, before
                    he had been ten weeks in the country. His immediate successor was Sir George
                    Barlow, a civil servant of the Company, who, as a <hi rend="italic"
                    >locum</hi><hi rend="italic">tenens,</hi> had no alternative but to carry out
                    faithfully the orders of his employers. He is charged with being, under these
                    orders, the only governor-general who diminished the area of British territory,
                    and with violating engagements by abandoning the Râjput chiefs to the tender
                    mercies of Holkar and Sindhia. During his administration also occurred the
                    mutiny of the Madras sepoys at Vellore, which, though promptly suppressed, sent
                    a shock of insecurity throughout the empire.</p>
                <p>Lord Minto, governor-general from 1807 to 1813, consolidated the conquests which
                    Wellesley had acquired. His only military exploits were the occupation of the
                    island of Mauritius, and the conquest of Java by an expedition which he
                    accompanied in person. The condition of Central. India continued to be
                    disturbed, but Minto succeeded in preventing any violent outbreaks without
                    himself having recourse to the sword. The Company had ordered him to follow a
                    policy of non-intervention, and he managed to obey his orders without injuring
                    the prestige of the British name. In his time the Indian Government first opened
                    relations with a new set of foreign powers, by sending embassies to the Punjab,
                    to Afghânistân, and to Persia. The ambassadors were all trained in the school of
                    Wellesley, and formed perhaps the most illustrious trio of “politicals” that the
                    Indian service has produced. Metcal fe was the envoy to the court of Ranjit Sinh
                    at Lahore; Elphinstone met the shâh of Afghanistan at Peshâwar; and Malcolm was
                    despatched to Persia. If it cannot be said that any of these missions were
                    fruitful in permanent results, at least they introduced the English to a new set
                    of diplomatic relations, and widened the sphere of their influence.</p>
                <p>The successor of Lord Minto was Lord Moira, better known as the marquis of
                    Hastings, who governed India for the long period of nine years, from 1814 to
                    1823. This period was marked by two wars of the first magnitude, the campaigns
                    against the Gürkhas (Goorkhas) of Nepâl, and the third and last Marhattâ war.
                    The Gürkhas, the present ruling race in Nepâl, are Hindu immigrants who claim a
                    Râjput origin. The indigenous inhabitants, called Newars, belong to the
                    Indo-Tibetan stock, and profess Buddhism. The sovereignty of the Gürkhas dates
                    only from 1767, in which year they overran the valley of Khatmandu, and
                    gradually extended their power over all the hills and valleys of Nepâh Organized
                    upon a sort of military and feudal basis, they soon became a terror to all their
                    neighbours, marching east into Sikkim, west into Kumâun, and south into the
                    Gangetic plains. In the last quarter their victims were British subjects, and at
                    last it became imperatively necessary to check their advance. Sir George Barlow
                    and Lord Minto had remonstrated in vain, and nothing was left to Lord Moira but
                    to take up arms. The campaign of 1814 was little short of disastrous. After
                    overcoming the natural difficulties of a malarious climate and precipitous
                    hills, the sepoys were on several occasions fairly worsted by the unexpected
                    bravery of the little Gürkhas, whose heavy knives or <hi rend="italic"
                    >kukris</hi> dealt terrible execution. But in 1815 General Ochterlony, who
                    commanded the army operating by way of the Sutlej, stormed one by one the hill
                    forts which still stud the Himâlayan states, now under the Punjab government,
                    and compelled the Nepâl <hi rend="italic">darbär</hi> to sue for peace. In the
                    following year the same general advanced from Patnâ into the valley of
                    Khatmandu, and finally dictated the terms which had before been rejected, within
                    a few miles of the capital. By the treaty of Segauli, which defines the English
                    relations with Nepâl to the present day, the Gürkhas withdrew on the one hand
                    from Sikkim, and on the other from those lower ranges of the western Himâlayas
                    which have supplied the health-giving stations of Naini Täl, Massuri, and Simla.
                    Meanwhile the condition of Central India was every year becoming more
                    unsatisfactory. Though the great Marhattâ chiefs were learning to live rather as
                    peaceful princes than as leaders of predatory bands, the example of lawlessness
                    they had set was being followed, and bettered in the following, by a new set of
                    freebooters, known as the Pindhâris. As opposed to the Marhattâs, who were at
                    least a nationality bound by some traditions of a united government, the
                    Pindhâris were merely irregular soldiers, corresponding most nearly to the free
                    companies of mediaeval Europe. Of no common race and of no common religion, they
                    welcomed to their ranks the outlaws and broken tribes of all India,—Afghâns,
                    Marhattâs, or Jâts. Their headquarters were in Mâlwâ, but their depredations
                    were not confined to Central India. In bands, sometimes numbering a few
                    hundreds, sometimes many thousands, they rode out on their forays as far as
                    Malabar and the Coromandel coast. The most powerful of the Pindhâri captains,
                    Amir Khân, had an organized army of many regiments, and several batteries of
                    cannon. Two other leaders, known as Chitu and Karim, at one time paid a ransom
                    to Sindhia of £100,000. To suppress the Pindhâri hordes, who were supported by
                    the sympathy, more or less open, of all theMarhattâ chiefs, Lord Hastings (1817)
                    collected the strongest British army that had been seen iw India, numbering
                    nearly 120,000 men, half to operate from, the north, half from the south.
                    Sindhia was overawed, and remained quiet. Amir Khân consented to disband his
                    army, on condition of being guaranteed the possession of what is now the
                    principality of Tank. The remaining bodies of Pindhâris were attacked in their
                    homes, surrounded, and cut to pieces. Karim threw himself upon the mercy of the
                    conquerors. Chitu fled to the jungles, and was killed by a tiger. In the same
                    year (1817) as that in which the Pindhâris were crushed, and almost in the same
                    month (November), the three great Marhattâ powers at Poona, Nâgpur, and Indore
                    rose against the English. The peshwâ, Bâji Râo, had long been chafing under the
                    terms imposed by the treaty of Bassein (1802), and the subsequent treaty of
                    Poona (1817), which riveted yet closer the chains of dependence upon the
                    paramount power. Elphinstone, then resident at his court, foresaw what was
                    coming and withdrew to Kirkee, whither he bad ordered up a European regiment.
                    The next day the residency was burned down, and Kirkee was attacked by the whole
                    army of the peshwâ. The attack was bravely repulsed, and the peshwâ immediately
                    fled from his capital. Almost the same plot was enacted at Nâgpur, where the
                    honour of the British name was saved by the sepoys, who defended the hill of
                    Sitâbaldi against enormous odds. The army of Holkar was defeated in the
                    following month at the pitched battle of Mehidpur. All open resistance was now
                    at an end. Nothing remained but to follow up the fugitives, and determine the
                    conditions of the general pacification. In both these duties Sir John Malcolm
                    played a prominent part. The dominions of the peshwâ were annexed to the Bombay
                    <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit12newyrich/page/n829/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0912-0829-0806"/> presidency, and the nucleus of the present
                    Central Provinces was formed out of the territory saved from the Pindhàris. The
                    peshwâ himself surrendered, and was permitted to reside at Bithùr, near Cawnpur,
                    on a pension of &lt;£80,000 a year. His adopted son was the infamous Nânâ Sâhib.
                    To fill the peshwâ’s place to some extent at the head of the MarhattA
                    confederacy, the lineal descendant of Sivaji was brought forth from obscurity,
                    and placed upon the throne of Sàtârâ. An infant was recognized as the heir of
                    Holkar, and a second infant was proclaimed râjâ of Nàgpur under British
                    guardianship. At the same time the several states of Râjputâna accepted the
                    position of feudatories of the paramount power. The map of India, as thus drawn
                    by Lord Hastings, remained substantially unchanged until the time of Lord
                    Dalhouβie. But the proudest boast of Lord Hastings and Sir John Malcolm was, not
                    that they had advanced the <hi rend="italic">pomoerium,</hi> but that they had
                    conferred the blessings of peace and good government upon millions who had
                    suffered unutterable things from Marhattâ and Pindhâri tyranny.</p>
                <p>The marquis of Hastings was succeeded by Lord Amherst, after the interval of a
                    few months, during which Mr Adam, a civil servant, acted as governor-general.
                    Lord Amherst’s administration lasted for five years, from 1823 to 1828. It is
                    known in history by two prominent events, the first Burmese war and the capture
                    of Bhartpur. For some years past the north-east frontier had been disturbed by
                    the restlessness of the Burmese. The country that fringes the western shore of
                    the Bay of Bengal and runs up the valley of the Irawadi, with a people of
                    Tibeto-Chinese origin, has a history of its own, parallel to, but not altogether
                    independent of, that of India. Tradition asserts that its early civilization was
                    introduced from the opposite coast of Coromandel, by a people who still preserve
                    a trace of their origin in their name of Talaing <hi rend="italic">(cf.</hi>
                    Telinga and Telugu). However this may be, the Buddhist religion, professed by
                    the Burmese at the present day, certainly came direct from India at a very early
                    date. Many waves of invasion from Siam in the south and from the wild mountains
                    in the north have passed over the land. These conquests were marked by that
                    wanton and wholesale barbarity which seems to characterize the Tibeto-Chinese
                    race, but the civilization of Buddhism survived every shock, and flourished
                    around the ancient pagodas. European travellers in the 15th century visited Pegu
                    and Tenasserim, which they describe as flourishing marts of maritime trade.
                    During the period of Portuguese predominance in the East, Arakan became the
                    resort of loose European adventurers. With their help the Arakanese extended
                    their power inland, occupied Chittagong, and (under the name of the Maghs)
                    became the terror of the entire delta of the Ganges. About 1750 a new dynasty
                    arose, founded by Alaungphaya or Alυmpra, with its capital at A va, which still
                    rules over Independent Burmah. The successors of Alompra, after having
                    subjugated all Burmah, and overrun Assam, which was then an independent kingdom,
                    began a series of encroachments upon British territory in India. As all peaceful
                    proposals were contumeliously rejected,Lord Amherst was compelled to declare war
                    in 1824. Little military glory could be gained by beating the Burmese, who were
                    formidable only from the pestilential character of their country. One expedition
                    with gunboats proceeded up the Brahmaputra into Assam; another marched by land
                    through Chittagong into Arakan, for the Bengal sepoys refused to go by sea; a
                    third, and the strongest, sailed from Madras direct to the mouth of the Irawadi.
                    The war was protracted over two years. At last, after the loss of about 20,000
                    lives and an expenditure of &lt;£14,000,000, the king of Ava consented to sign
                    the treaty of Yandabu, by which he abandoned all claim to Assam, and ceded the
                    provinces of Arakan and Tenasserim, which were already in the military
                    occupation of the British. He retained all the valley of the Irawadi, down to
                    the sea at Rangoon. The capture of Bhartpur in Central India by Lord Combermere
                    in 1827 wiped out the repulse which Lake had received before that city in
                    January 1805. A disputed succession necessitated British intervention. Artillery
                    could make little impression upon the massive walls of mud, but at last a breach
                    was effected by mining, and the city was taken by storm, thus losing its general
                    reputation throughout India for impregnability, which had threatened to become a
                    political danger.</p>
                <p>The next governor-general was Lord William Bentinck, who had been governor of
                    Madras twenty years earlier at the time of the mutiny of Vellore. His seven
                    years’ rule (from 1828 to 1835) is not signalized by any of those victories or
                    extensions of territory by which chroniclers delight to measure the growth of
                    empire. But it forms an epoch in administrative reform, and in the slow process
                    by which the hearts of a subject population are won over to venerate as well as
                    dread their alien rulers. The modern history of the British in India, as
                    benevolent administrators ruling the country with a single eye to the good of
                    the natives, may be said to begin with Lord William Bentinck. According to the
                    inscription upon his statue at Calcutta, from the pen of Macaulay, “He abolished
                    cruel rites; he effaced humiliating distinctions; he gave liberty to the
                    expression of public opinion; his constant study it was to elevate the
                    intellectual and moral character of the nations committed to his charge.” His
                    first care on arrival in India was to restore equilibrium to the finances, which
                    were tottering under the burden imposed upon them by the Burmese war. This he
                    effected by reductions in permanent expenditure, amounting in the aggregate to
                    1∣ millions sterling, as well as by augmenting the revenue from land that had
                    escaped assessment and from the opium of Mâlwâ. He also widened the gates by
                    which educated natives could enter the service of the Company. Some of these
                    reforms were distasteful to the covenanted service and to the officers of the
                    army, but Lord William was always staunchly supported by the court of directors
                    and by the Whig ministry at home.</p>
                <p>His two most memorable acts are the abolition of <hi rend="italic">sati</hi>
                    (suttee) and the suppression of the <hi rend="italic">Thags</hi> (Thugs). At
                    this distance of time it is difficult to realize the degree to which these two
                    barbarous practices had corrupted the social system of the Hindus. European
                    research has clearly proved that the text in the <hi rend="italic">Vedas</hi>
                    adduced to authorize the immolation of widows was a wilful mistranslation. But
                    the practice had been engrained in Hindu opinion by the authority of centuries,
                    and had acquired the sanctity of a religious rite. The emperor Akbar is said to
                    have prohibited it by law, but the early English rulers did not dare so far to
                    violate the traditions of religious toleration. In the year 1817 no less than
                    seven hundred widows are said to have been burned alive in the Bengal presidency
                    alone. To this day the most holy spots of Hindu pilgrimage are thickly dotted
                    with little white pillars, each commemorating a <hi rend="italic">sati.</hi> In
                    the teeth of strenuous opposition, both from Europeans and natives, Lord William
                    carried the regulation in council on December 4, 1829, by which all who abetted
                    <hi rend="italic">sati</hi> were declared guilty of “culpable homicide.” The
                    honour of suppressing <hi rend="italic">Thagi</hi> must be shared between Lord
                    William and Captain Sleeman. <hi rend="italic">Thagi</hi> was an abnormal
                    excrescence upon Hinduism, in so far as the bands of secret assassins were sworn
                    together by an oath based on the rites of the bloody goddess Kâli. Between 1826
                    and 1835 as many as 1562 Thags were apprehended in different parts of British
                    India, and by the evidence of approvers the moral plague spot was gradually
                    stamped out.</p>
                <p>Two other historical events are connected with the <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit12newyrich/page/n830/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0912-0830-0807"/> administration of Lord William Bentinck. In 1833
                    the charter of the East India Company was renewed for twenty years, but only
                    upon the terms that it should abandon its trade and permit Europeans to settle
                    freely in the country. At the same time a legal or fourth member was added to
                    the governor-general’s council, who might not be a servant of the Company, and a
                    commission was appointed to revise and codify the law. Macaulay was the first
                    legal member of council, and the first president of the law commission. In 1830
                    it was found necessary to take the state of Mysore under British administration,
                    where it has continued to the present year (1881), and in 1834 the frantic
                    misrule of the râjâ of Coorg brought on a short and sharp war. The râjâ was
                    permitted to retire to Benares, and the brave and proud inhabitants of that
                    mountainous little territory decided to place themselves under the rule of the
                    Company; so that the only annexation effected by Lord William Bentinck was “in
                    consideration of the unanimous wish of the people.”</p>
                <p>Sir Charles (afterwards Lord) Metcalfe succeeded Lord William as senior member of
                    council. His short term of office is memorable for the measure which his
                    predecessor had initiated, but which he willingly carried into execution, for
                    giving entire liberty to the press. Public opinion in India, as well as the
                    express wish of the court of directors at home, pointed to Metcalfe as the most
                    fit person to carry out the policy of Bentinck, not provisionally, but as
                    governor-general for a full term. Party exigencies, however, led to the
                    appointment of Lord Auckland. From that date commences a new era of war and
                    conquest, which may be said to have lasted for twenty years. All looked peaceful
                    until Lord Auckland, prompted by his evil genius, attempted to place Shâh Shujâ
                    upon the throne of Cabul, an attempt which ended in the gross mismanagement and
                    annihilation of the garrison placed in that city. The disaster in Afghânistân
                    was quickly followed by the conquest of Sind, the two wars in the Punjab, the
                    second Burmese war, and last of all the Mutiny. Names like Gough and Napier and
                    Colin Campbell take the places of Malcolm and Metcalfe and Elphinstone.</p>
                <p>For the first time since the days of the sultâns of Ghazni and Ghor, Afghânistân
                    had obtained a national king in 1747 in the person of the Ahmad Shâh Durâni, who
                    found his opportunity in the confusion that followed on the death of the Persian
                    conqueror, Nâdir Shâh. Before his death in 1773 Ahmad Shâh had conquered a wide
                    empire, from Herat to Peshâwar and from Kashmir to Sind. His intervention on the
                    field of Pânipat (176T) turned back the tide of Marhattâ conquest, and replaced
                    a Mughal emperor on the throne of Delhi. But Ahmad Shâh never cared to settle
                    down in India, and kept alternate state at his two national capitals of Cabul
                    and Kandahâr. The Durâni kings were prolific in children, who fought with one
                    another for the succession to the death. At last, in 1826, Dost Muhammad, head
                    of the powerful Barakzâi family, succeeded in establishing himself as ruler of
                    Cabul, with the subordinate title of amir (ameer), while two fugitive brothers
                    of the Durâni line were living under British protection at Ludhiâna, on the
                    frontier of the Punjab.</p>
                <p>The attention of the English Government had been directed to Afghân affairs ever
                    since the time of Lord Wellesley, who feared that Zamân Shâh, then holding his
                    court at Lahore, might follow in the path of Nâdir Shâh, and overrun Hindustân.
                    The growth of the powerful Sikh kingdom of Ranjit Sinh effectually dispelled any
                    such alarms for the future. Subsequently, in 1809, while a French invasion of
                    India was still a possibility to be guarded against, Elphinstone was sent by
                    Lord Minto on a mission to Shâh Shujâ to form a defensive alliance. Before the
                    year was out, Shâh Shujâ had been driven into exile, and a third brother, Mahmùd
                    Shâh, was on the throne. In 1837, when the curtain rises upon the drama of
                    English interference in Afghânistân, the usurper Dost Muhammad Barakzâi was
                    firmly established at CabuL His great ambition was to recover Peshâwar from the
                    Sikhs; and when Captain Alexander Burnes arrived on a mission from Lord
                    Auckland, with the ostensible object of opening trade, the Dost was willing to
                    promise everything, if only he could get Peshâwar. But Lord Auckland had another
                    and more important object in view. At this time the Russians were advancing
                    rapidly in Central Asia, and a Persian army, not without Russian support, was
                    besieging Herat, the traditional bulwark of Afghânistân on the east. A Russian
                    envoy was at Cabul at the same time as Burnes. The latter was unable to satisfy
                    the demands of Dost Muhammad in the matter of Peshâwar, and returned to India
                    unsuccessful. Lord Auckland forthwith resolved upon the hazardous plan of
                    placing a more subservient ruler upon the throne of Cabul. Shâh Shujâ, one of
                    the two exiles at Ludhiâna, was selected for the purpose. At this time both the
                    Punjab and Sind were independent kingdoms. Sind was the less powerful of the
                    two, and therefore a British army escorting Shâh Shujâ made its way by that
                    route to enter Afghânistân through the Bolâu Pass. Kandahâr surrendered, Ghazni
                    was taken by storm, Dost Muhammad fled across the Hindu Kush, and Shâh Shujâ was
                    triumphantly led into the Bala Hissâr at Cabul in August 1839. During the two
                    years that followed Afghânistân remained in the military occupation of the
                    British. The catastrophe occurred in November 1841, when Sir Alexander Burnes
                    was assassinated in the city of Cabul. The troops in the cantonments were then
                    under the command of General Elphinstone (not to be confounded with the civilian
                    Mountstuart Elphinstone), with Sir William Macnaghten as chief political
                    adviser. Elphinstone was an old man, unequal to the responsibilities of the
                    position. Macnaghten was treacherously murdered at an interview with the Afghân
                    chief, Akbar Khân, eldest son of Dost Muhammad. After lingering in their
                    cantonments for two months, the British army set off in the depth of winter to
                    find its way back to India through the passes. When they started they numbered
                    4000 fighting men, with 12,000 camp followers. A single survivor, Dr Brydon,
                    reached the friendly walls of Jalâlâbâd, where Sale was gallantly holding out.
                    The rest perished in the defiles of Khurd, Cabul, and Jagdalak, either from the
                    knives and matchlocks of the Afghâns or from the effects of cold. A few
                    prisoners, mostly women, children, and officers, were considerately treated by
                    the orders of Akbar Khân.</p>
                <p>Within a month after the news reached Calcutta, Lord Auckland had been superseded
                    by Lord Ellenborough, whose first impulse was to be satisfied with drawing off
                    in safety the garrisons from Kandahâr and Jalâlâbâd. But bolder counsels
                    prevailed. Pollock, who was marching straight through the Punjab to relieve
                    Sale, was ordered to penetrate to Cabul, while Nott was only too glad not to be
                    forbidden to retire from Kandahâr through Cabul. After a good deal of fighting,
                    the two English forces met at their common destination in September 1842. The
                    great <hi rend="italic">bäzar</hi> at Cabul was blown up with gunpowder, to fix
                    a stigma upon the city; the prisoners were recovered; and all marched back to
                    India, leaving Dost Muhammad to take undisputed possession of his throne. The
                    drama closed with a bombastic proclamation from Lord Ellenborough, who had
                    caused the gates from the tomb of Mahmüd of Ghazni to be carried back as a
                    memorial of “Somnâth revenged.”</p>
                <p>Lord Ellenborough, who loved military display, had his tastes gratified by two
                    more wars. In 1843 the Mahometan rulers of Sind, known as the “meers” or amirs,
                    whose only <pb break="no"

                    independence, were crushed by Sir Charles Napier. The victory of Miâni, in which
                    3000 British troops defeated 20,000 Baluchis, is perhaps the most brilliant feat
                    of arms in Indian history; but an honest excuse can scarcely be found for the
                    annexation of the country. In the same year a disputed succession at Gwalior,
                    fomented by feminine intrigue, resulted in an outbreak of the overgrown army
                    which the Sindhia family had been allowed to maintain. Peace was restored by the
                    battles of Maharâjpur and Punneah, at the former of which Lord Ellenborough was
                    present in person.</p>
                <p>In 1844 Lord Ellenborough was recalled by the court of directors, who differed
                    from him on many points of administration, and distrusted his erratic genius. He
                    was succeeded by Sir Henry (afterwards Lord) Hardinge, who had served through
                    the Peninsular War and had lost a hand at Ligny. It was felt on all sides that a
                    trial of strength between the British and the Sikhs was at hand.</p>
                <p>The Sikhs were not a nationality like the Marhatt⅛s, but a religious sect bound
                    together by the additional tie of military discipline. They trace their origin
                    to one Nanak, an excellent and successful preacher, who was born in the
                    neighbourhood of Lahore in the latter half of the 15th century, before the
                    arrival of either Mughals or Portuguese in India. Nânak was a religious
                    reformer, like others that arose in the country about that time, who preached
                    the abolition of caste, the unity of the Godhead, and the obligation of leading
                    a pure life. From Nanak ten <hi rend="italic">gurus</hi> or apostles are traced
                    down to Govind Sinh in 1708, with whom the succession stopped. Suffering
                    continual persecution from the ruling Mahometans, which culminated in the reign
                    of Aurangzeb, the Sikh religion maintained itself with extraordinary tenacity.
                    At last the downfall of the Mughal empire transformed it into a territorial
                    power, which possessed the only organization remaining in the Punjab. Even
                    before the rise of Ranjit Sinh, offshoots from the Sikh <hi rend="italic"
                    >misls</hi> or confederacies, each led by its elected <hi rend="italic"
                    >sarddr,</hi> had carved out for themselves feudal principalities along the
                    banks of the Sutlej, some of which have endured to the present day. Ranjit Sinh,
                    the founder of the Sikh kingdom, was born in 1780. In his twentieth year he
                    obtained the appointment of governor of Lahore from the Afghan emperor, and from
                    that time he set himself to the task of basing a personal despotism upon the
                    religious fanaticism of the Sikhs. The⅛Λα⅛4 or “the liberated” were organized
                    into an army under European officers, which for steadiness and religious fervour
                    has had no parallel since the “ironsides” of Cromwell. From Lahore as his
                    capital he extended his conquests south to Mùltân, west to Peshawar, and north
                    to Kashmir. On the east side alone he was hemmed in by the Sutlej, up to which
                    river the authority of the British Government was advanced in 1804. Till his
                    death in 1839 Ranjit Sinh was ever loyal to the engagements which he had entered
                    into with Metcalfe in 1809. But he left no son capable of wielding his sceptre.
                    Lahore was torn by dissensions between rival generals, ministers, and queens.
                    The only strong power was the army of the <hi rend="italic">khdlsd,</hi> which
                    since the disaster in Afghanistan burned to measure its strength with the
                    British sepoys. The French generals, Avitable and Court, were foolishly ousted,
                    and the supreme military command was vested in a series of <hi rend="italic"
                    >panchdyats</hi> or elective committees of five.</p>
                <p>In 1845 the Sikh army, numbering 60,000 men with 150 guns, crossed the Sutlej and
                    invaded British territory. Sir Hugh Gough, the commander-in-chief, together with
                    the governor-general, hurried up to the frontier. Within three weeks four
                    pitched battles were fought, at Moodkee, Ferozshah, Aliwâl, and Sobrâon. The
                    British loss on each occasion was heavy; but by the last victory the Sikhs were
                    fairly driven into and across the Sutlej, and Lahore surrendered to the British.
                    By the terms of peace then dictated the infant son of Ranjit, Dhulip Sinh, was
                    recognized as râjâ; the Jalandhar Doâb, or tract between the Sutlej and the
                    Ravi, was annexed; the Sikh army was limited to a specified number; Major Henry
                    Lawrence was appointed to be resident at Lahore; and a British force was
                    detailed to garrison the Punjab for a period of eight years. Sir H. Hardinge
                    received a peerage, and returned to England in 1848.</p>
                <p>Lord Dalhousie succeeded, whose eight years’ administration (from 1848 to 1856)
                    was more pregnant of results than that of any governor-general since Clive.
                    Though professedly a man of peace, he was compelled to fight two wars, in the
                    Punjab and in Burmah. These both ended in large acquisitions of territory, while
                    Nagpur, Oudh, and several minor states also came under British rule. But
                    Dalhousie’s own special interest lay in the advancement of the moral and
                    material condition of the country. The system of administration carried out in
                    the conquered Punjab by the two Lawrences and their assistants is probably the
                    most successful piece of difficult work ever accomplished by Englishmen. British
                    Burmah has prospered under their rule scarcely less than the Punjab. In both
                    cases Lord Dalhousie deserves a large share of the credit. No branch of the
                    administration escaped his reforming hand. He founded the public works
                    department, to pay special attention to roads and canals. He opened the Ganges
                    Canal, still the largest work of the kind in the country, and he turned the sod
                    of the first Indian railway. He promoted steam communication with England <hi
                    rend="italic">via</hi> the Red Sea, and introduced cheap postage and the
                    electric telegraph. It is Lord Dalhousie’s misfortune that these benefits are
                    too often forgotten in the vivid recollections of the Mutiny, which avenged his
                    policy of annexation.</p>
                <p>Lord Dalhousie had not been six months in India before the second Sikh war broke
                    out. Two British officers were treacherously assassinated at Mùltân.
                    Unfortunately Henry Lawrence was at home on sick leave. The British army was not
                    ready to act in the hot weather, and, despite the single-handed exertions of
                    Lieutenant (afterwards Sir Herbert) Edwardes, this outbreak of fanaticism led to
                    a general rising. The <hi rend="italic">khalsa</hi> army again came together,
                    and once more fought on even terms with the British. On the fatal field of
                    Chilianwâla, which patriotism prefers to call a drawn battle, the British lost
                    2400 officers and men, besides four guns and the colours of three regiments.
                    Before reinforcements could come out from England, with Sir Charles Napier as
                    commander-in-chief, Lord Gough had restored his own reputation by the crowning
                    victory of Guzerat, which absolutely destroyed the Sikh army. Mùltân had
                    previously fallen; and the Afghân horse under Dost Muhammad, who had forgotten
                    their hereditary antipathy to the Sikhs in their greater hatred of the British
                    name, were chased back with ignominy to their native hills. The Punjab
                    henceforth became a British province, supplying a virgin field for the
                    administrative talents of Dalhousie and the two Lawrences. Râjâ Dhulip Sinh
                    received an allowance of £50,000 a year, on which he retired as a country
                    gentleman to Norfolk in England. The first step in the pacification of the
                    Punjab was a general disarmament, which resulted in the delivery of no less than
                    120,000 weapons of various kinds. Then followed a settlement of the land tax,
                    village by village, at an assessment much below that to which it had been raised
                    by Sikh exactions, and the introduction of a loose but equitable code of civil
                    and criminal procedure. Roads and canals were laid out by Colonel Robert Napier
                    (afterwards Lord Napier of Magdala); and the security of British peace and the
                    personal influence of British officers were felt to the furthest corners of the
                    province. Thus it happened that, when the Mutiny broke out in 1857, the Punjab
                    remained not only quiet but loyal, after only eight years’ experience of English
                    rule; while the North Western Provinces, which had been British territory for
                    more than half a century, rose in rebellion. The second Burmese war of 1852 was
                    caused by the ill-treatment of European merchants at Rangoon, and the insolence
                    offered to the captain of a frigate who had been sent to remonstrate. The whole
                    valley of the Irawadi, from Rangoon to Prome, was occupied in a few months, and,
                    as the king of Ava refused to treat, it was annexed, under the name of Pegu, to
                    the provinces of Arakan and Tenasserim, which had been acquired in 1826. Since
                    annexation the inhabitants of <pb break="no"

                    that port now ranks third in British India, being surpassed only by Calcutta and
                    Madras. Lord Dalhousie’s dealings with the feudatory states of India can only be
                    rightly appreciated as part of his general policy. That rulers only exist for
                    the good of the ruled was his supreme axiom of government, of which he gave the
                    most conspicuous example by the practice of his own daily life. That British
                    administration was better for the people than native rule followed from this
                    axiom as a necessary corollary. He was thus led to regard.native chiefs from
                    somewhat the same point of view as the Scotch regarded the hereditary
                    jurisdictions after 1745, as mischievous anomalies, to be abolished by every
                    means practicable. Good faith must be kept with rulers on the throne and with ·
                    their legitimate heirs, but no false sentiment should preserve dynasties that
                    had forfeited all consideration by years of accumulated misrule, or prolong
                    those that had no natural successor. The “doctrine of lapse” was merely a
                    special application of these principles, though complicated by the theory of
                    adoption. It has never been doubted that, according to Hindu private law, an
                    adopted son entirely fills the place of a natural son, whether to perform the
                    religious obsequies of his father or to inherit his property. In all respects he
                    continues the <hi rend="italic">persona</hi> of the deceased. But it was argued
                    that the succession to a throne stood upon a different footing. The paramount
                    power could not recognize such a right, which might be used as a fraud to hand
                    over the happiness of millions to a base-born impostor. Here came in the maxim
                    of “the good of the governed.” The material benefits to be conferred through
                    British administration surely weighed heavier in the scale than a superstitious
                    and frequently fraudulent fiction of inheritance. The first state to escheat to
                    the British Government in accordance with these principles was Sâtârâ, which had
                    been reconstituted by Lord Hastings on the downfall of the peshwâ in 1818. The
                    last direct representative of Sivaji died without a male heir in 1848, and his
                    deathbed adoption was set aside. In the same year the Râjput state of Karauli
                    was saved by the interposition of the court of directors, who drew a fine
                    distinction between a dependent principality and a protected ally. In 1833
                    Jhânsi suffered the same fate as Sâtârâ. But the most conspicuous application of
                    the doctrine of lapse was the case of Nâgpur The last of the Bhonslâs, a dynasty
                    older than the British Government itself, died without a son, natural or
                    adopted, in 1853. That year also saw British administration extended to the
                    Berars, or the assigned districts which the nizâm of Hyderabad was induced to
                    cede as a territorial guarantee for the subsidies which he perpetually kept in
                    arrear Three more distinguished names likewise passed away in 1853, though
                    without any attendant accretion to British territory. In the extreme south the
                    titular nawâb of the Carnatic and the titular râjâ of Tanjore both died without
                    heirs. Their rank and their pensions died with them, though compassionate
                    allowances were continued to their families. In the north of India, Bâji Râo,
                    the ex-peshwâ who had been dethroned in 1818, lived on till 1853 in the
                    enjoyment of his annual pension of £80,000. His adopted son, Nâna Sâhib,
                    inherited his accumulated savings, but could obtain no further recognition.</p>
                <p>The annexation of the province of Oudh is to be defended on very different
                    grounds. Ever since the nawâb wazir, Shujâ-ud-Daulâ, received back his forfeited
                    territories from the hands of Lord Clive in 1765, the very existence of Oudh as
                    an independent state had depended only upon the protection of British bayonets.
                    Thus, preserved alike from foreign invasion and from domestic rebellion, the
                    long line of subsequent nawâbs had given way to that neglect of public affairs
                    and those private vices which naturally flow from irresponsible power. Their
                    only redeeming virtue was steady loyalty to the British Government. Oudh has
                    been called “the Garden of India” by an author<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi rend="italic">The Garden of India, or
                    Chapters on Oudh History and Affairs,</hi> bv H. C. Irwin, London,

                    so black as they have been painted. But at any rate that fair corner of the
                    Gangetic basin, which now supports a denser population than any equal area on
                    the surface of the globe, had been groaning for generations under anarchy for
                    which each successive governor-general ⅛dmitted that he was partly responsible.
                    Warning after warning had been given to the nawâbs (who had assumed the title of
                    shâh or king since 1819) that they must put their house in order. What the
                    benevolent Bentinck and the soldierly Hardinge had only threatened was reserved
                    for Lord Dalhousie, who united honesty of purpose with decision of character. In
                    this determination he had the full support of the court of directors at home. In
                    1856, the last year of his rule, he issued orders to General (afterwards Sir
                    James) Outram, then resident at the court of Lucknow, to assume the direct
                    administration of Oudh, on the ground that “the British Government would be
                    guilty in the sight of God and man, if it were any longer to aid in sustaining
                    by its countenance an administration fraught with suffering to millions.” The
                    king, Wâjid Ali, bowed to irresistible force, though he ever refused to
                    recognize the justice of his deposition. After a mission to England, by way of
                    protest and appeal, he settled down in the pleasant suburb of Garden Reach near
                    Calcutta, where he lived in the enjoyment of a pension of £120,000 a year. Oudh
                    was thus annexed without a blow; but it may be doubted whether the one measure
                    of Lord Dalhousie upon which he looked back himself with the clearest conscience
                    was not the very one that most-alarmed native public opinion.</p>
                <p>The marquis of Dalhousie resigned office in March 1856, being then only
                    forty-four years of age; but he carried home with him the seeds of a lingering
                    illness which resulted in his death in 1860. Excepting Cornwallis, he was the
                    first, though by no means the last, of English statesmen who have fallen victims
                    to their devotion to India’s needs. He was succeeded by his friend, Lord
                    Canning, who, at the farewell banquet in England given to him by the court of
                    directors, uttered these prophetic words: “I wish for a peaceful term of office.
                    But I cannot forget that in the sky of India, serene as it is, a small cloud may
                    arise, no larger than a man’s hand, but which, growing larger and larger, may at
                    last threaten to burst and overwhelm us with ruin.” In the following year the
                    sepoys of the Bengal army mutinied, and all the valley of the Ganges from Patnâ
                    to Delhi rose in open rebellion.</p>
                <p>The various motives assigned for the Mutiny appear inadequate to the European
                    mind. The truth seems to be that native opinion throughout India was in a
                    ferment, predisposing men to believe the wildest stories, and to act
                    precipitately upon their fears. The influence of panic in an Oriental population
                    is greater than might be readily believed. In the first place, the policy of
                    Lord Dalhousie, exactly in proportion as it had been dictated by the most
                    honourable considerations, was utterly distasteful to the native mind. Repeated
                    annexations, the spread of education, the appearance of the steam engine and the
                    telegraph wire, all alike revealed a consistent determination to substitute an
                    English for an Indian civilization. The Bengal sepoys, especially, thought that
                    they could see into the future farther than the rest of their countrymen. Nearly
                    all men of high caste, and many of them recruited from Oudh, they dreaded
                    tendencies which they deemed to be denationalizing, and they knew at first hand
                    what annexation <pb break="no"

                    the Punjab had been conquered, and all India was held quiet. The numerous
                    dethroned princes, their heirs and their widows, were the first to learn and
                    take advantage of the spirit of disaffection that was abroad. They had heard of
                    the Crimean war, and were told that Russia was the perpetual enemy of England.
                    They had money in abundance with which they could buy the assistance of skilful
                    intriguers. They had everything to gain, and nothing to lose, by a
                    revolution.</p>
                <p>In this critical state of affairs, of which the Government had no official
                    knowledge, a rumour ran through the cantonments of the Bengal army that
                    cartridges had been served out greased with the fat of animals unclean alike to
                    Hindu and Mahometan. After this, nothing could quiet the minds of the sepoys.
                    Fires occurred nightly in the native lines; officers were insulted by their men;
                    all confidence was gone, and only the form of discipline remained. On the
                    afternoon of Sunday, May 10, 1857, the sepoys at Meerut (Mirath) broke into open
                    mutiny. Their first mad frenzy marked by its excess the change from their
                    usually quiet manners and orderly habits. They broke into the jail, and then ran
                    through the cantonments, cutting down every European they met. At last they
                    streamed off to the neighbouring city of Delhi, to stir up the native garrison
                    and the criminal population of that great city, and to place themselves under
                    the authority of the discrowned Mughal emperor. Meerut was the largest military
                    station in India, with a strong European garrison of foot, horse, and guns,
                    sufficient to overwhelm the mutineers before ever they reached Delhi. But just
                    as the sepoys acted in irrational panic, so did British officers in but too many
                    cases act with equally irrational indecision. The news of the outbreak was
                    telegraphed to Delhi, and nothing more was done that night. The next morning the
                    Mahometans of Delhi rose, and all that the Europeans there could do was to blow
                    up the magazine. A rallying centre and a traditional name was thus given to the
                    revolt, which forthwith spread like wildfire through all the North-Western
                    Provinces and Oudh down into Lower Bengal. The same narrative must suffice for
                    all, though each episode has its own peculiar story of sadness and devotion. The
                    sepoys rose on their officers, without warning, and sometimes after
                    protestations of fidelity. The Europeans, or persons of Christian faith, were
                    massacred, sometimes also women and children. The jail was broken open, the
                    treasure plundered, and then all marched off to some centre of revolt, to join
                    in what had now become a national war. Only in the Punjab were the sepoys
                    anticipated by the stern measures of repression and disarmament adopted by Sir
                    John Lawrence and his lieutenants, among whom Edwardes and Nicholson were
                    conspicuous. The Sikh population never wavered. Crowds of willing recruits came
                    down from the Afghân hills. And thus the Punjab, instead of being itself a
                    source of danger, was able to furnish a portion of its own garrison for the
                    siege of Delhi. In Lower Bengal most of the sepoys mutinied, and then dispersed
                    in different directions. The native armies of Madras and Bombay remained true to
                    their colours. In Central India the contingents of many of the great chiefs
                    sooner or later joined the rebels, but the Mahometan state of Hyderabad was kept
                    loyal by the authority of its able minister Sir Sâlar Jang.</p>
                <p>The main interest of the sepoy war gathers round the three cities of Cawnpur,
                    Lucknow, and Delhi. The cantonments at Cawnpur contained the largest native
                    garrison in India; and in the immediate neighbourhood, at Bithùr, was the palace
                    of Dandhu Panth, the disinherited heir of the last peshwâ, whose more familiar
                    appellation of Nâna Sâhib will ever be handed down to the infamy of history. At
                    first the Nâna was profuse in his professions of loyalty, but as soon as the
                    sepoys mutinied he put himself at their head, and was proclaimed peshwâ of the
                    Marhattâs. The Europeans at Cawnpur, who numbered more women and children than
                    fighting men, shut themselves up in improvised entrenchments, where they
                    sustained a siege for nineteen days under the sun of a tropical June. At last,
                    trusting to a safe conduct from the Nâna as far as Allahâbâd, they surrendered
                    their position, and to the number of four hundred and fifty individuals embarked
                    in boats on the Ganges. Forthwith a murderous fire was opened upon them from the
                    river bank. Only a single boat escaped, and but four men, who swam across to the
                    protection of a friendly râjâ, ultimately survived to tell the tale. The rest of
                    the men were massacred on the spot; the women and children, numbering one
                    hundred and twenty-five, were reserved for the same fate a few days later, when
                    the avenging army of Havelock was at hand. Sir Henry Lawrence, the chief
                    commissioner of Oudh, had foreseen the coming storm with a prophetic eye. He had
                    fortified and provisioned the residency at Lucknow in good time, and thither he
                    retired with all the European inhabitants and a weak British regiment on July 2.
                    Two days later he was mortally wounded by a shell. But his example inspired the
                    little garrison to hold out under unparalleled hardships and against enormous
                    odds, until relieved by Havelock and Outram on September 25. But the relieving
                    force was itself invested by fresh swarms of rebels, and it was not till
                    November that Sir Colin Campbell, afterwards Lord Clyde, cut his way into
                    Lucknow, and effected the final deliverance of the garrison. The siege of Delhi
                    began on June 8, just one month after the original outbreak at Meerut. Siege in
                    the proper sense of the word it was not, for the British army, encamped on the
                    historic ridge, never exceeded 8000 men, while the rebels within the walls were
                    more than 30,000 strong. In the middle of August Nicholson arrived with a
                    reinforcement from the Punjab, but his own encouraging presence was more
                    valuable than the reinforcement he brought. On September 14 the assault was
                    delivered, and after six days’ desperate fighting in the streets Delhi was again
                    won. Nicholson fell at the head of the storming party. Hodson, the intrepid
                    leader of a corps of irregular horse, hunted down and brought in as prisoner the
                    old Mughal emperor, Bahâdur Shâh, and then in cold blood shot down the emperor’s
                    sons with his own hand. After the fall of Delhi and the final relief of Lucknow
                    the war loses its dramatic interest, though fighting went on in various parts of
                    the country for eighteen months longer. The population of Oudh and Rohilkhand,
                    stimulated by the presence of the begum of Oudh, the nawâb of Bareilly, and Nâna
                    Sâhib himself, had joined the mutinous sepoys <hi rend="italic">en</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">masse.</hi> In this quarter of India alone, it was the revolt of a
                    people rather than the mutiny of an army that had to be quelled. Sir Colin
                    Campbell in person conducted the campaign in Oudh, which lasted through two cold
                    seasons. Valuable assistance was lent by Sir Jang Bahâdur of Nepâl, at the head
                    of a numerous army of Gùrkhas. Town after town was occupied, fort ι after fort
                    was stormed, until at length the last gun had been <hi rend="superscript">
                    1</hi> recaptured and the last fugitive had flea across the <hi
                    rend="superscript"> 1</hi> frontier by January 1859 In the meanwhile Sir Hugh
                    Rose (afterwards Lord Strathnairn),with another army from Bombay, was conducting
                    an equally brilliant campaign in Central India. His most formidable antagonists
                    were the disinherited râni of Jhânsi, and Tântia Topi, whose military talent had
                    previously inspired Nâna Sâhib with all the capacity for resistance that he ever
                    displayed. The râni died fighting bravely at the head of her troops in June
                    1858; Tantiâ Topi, after doubling backwards and forwards through Central India,
                    was at last betrayed and run down in April 1859.</p>

                <p>The Mutiny sealed the fate of the East India Company, after a life of more than
                    two and a half centuries.</p>
                <p>The Company received its original charter of incorporation from Elizabeth in
                    1600. Its political powers, and the constitution of the Indian Government, were
                    derived from the Regulating Act of 1773, passed by the ministry of Lord North.
                    By that statute the governor of Bengal was raised to the rank of
                    governor-general; and, in conjunction with his council of four other members, he
                    was entrusted with the duty of superintending and controlling the governments of
                    Madras and Bombay so far as regarded questions of peace and war; a supreme court
                    of judicature was appointed at Calcutta, to which the judges were appointed by
                    the crown; and a power of making rules, ordinances, and regulations was
                    conferred upon the governor-general and his council. Next came the India Bill of
                    Pitt (1784), which founded the board of control, strengthened the supremacy of
                    Bengal over the other presidencies, and first authorized the historic phrase
                    “governor-general-in-council.” The Act which abolished the Company’s monopoly of
                    trade (1833) also introduced several reforms into the constitution of the Indian
                    Government, and added to the council an additional member, who might not be
                    chosen from among the Company’s servants, and was entitled to be present only at
                    meetings for making laws and regulations; it gave the authority of Acts of
                    Parliament to the laws and regulations so made, subject to the disallowance of
                    the court of directors; it appointed a law commission; and it gave the
                    governorgeneral-in-council a control over the other presidencies in all points
                    relating to the civil or military administration. The charter of the Company was
                    renewed for the last time in 1853, not for a definite period of years, but only
                    for so long as parliament should ordain. On this occasion the number of
                    directors was reduced, and their patronage as regards appointments to the civil
                    service was taken away, to make room for the principle of open competition.</p>
                <p>The Act for the better government of India (1858), which finally transferred the
                    entire administration from the Company to the crown, was not passed without an
                    eloquent protest from the directors, nor without acrimonious party discussion in
                    parliament It enacts that India shall be governed by, and in the name of, the
                    sovereign of England through one of the principal secretaries of state, assisted
                    by a council of fifteen members. The governor-general received the new title of
                    viceroy. The European troops of the Company, numbering about 24,000 officers and
                    men, were amalgamated with the royal service, and the Indian navy was abolished.
                    By the Indian Councils Act (1861) the governor-general’s council and also the
                    councils at Madras and Bombay were augmented by the addition ofnon-official
                    members, either natives or Europeans, for legislative purposes only; and by
                    another Act passed in the same year nigh courts of judicature were constituted
                    out of the existing supreme courts at the presidency towns.</p>
                <p>It fell to the lot of Lord Canning both to suppress the Mutiny and to introduce
                    the peaceful revolution that followed. As regards his execution of the former
                    part of his duties, it is sufficient to say that he preserved his equanimity
                    undisturbed in the darkest hours of peril, and that the strict impartiality of
                    his conduct incurred alternate praise and blame from the fanatics on either side
                    The epithet then scornfully applied to him of “Clemency” Canning is now
                    remembered only to his honour. On November 1, 1858, at a grand <hi rend="italic"
                    >darbdr</hi> held ai Allahâbâd the royal proclamation was published which
                    announced that the queen had assumed the government of India. This document,
                    which has been called the Magna Charta of the Indian people, went on to explain
                    the policy of political justice and religious toleration which it was her royal
                    pleasure to pursue, and granted an amnesty to all except those who had directly
                    taken part in the murder of British subjects. Peace was proclaimed throughout
                    India on July 8, 1859; and in the following cold weather Lord Canning made a
                    viceregal progress through the upper provinces, to receive the homage of loyal
                    princes and chiefs, and to guarantee to them the right of adoption. The
                    suppression of the Mutiny increased the debt of India by about 40 millions
                    sterling, and the military changes that ensued augmented the annual expenditure
                    by about 10 millions. To grapple with this deficit, Mr James Wilson was sent out
                    from the treasury as financial member of council. He reorganized the customs
                    system, imposed an income tax and licence duty, and created a state paper
                    currency. The penal code, originally drawn up by Macaulay in 1837, passed into
                    law in 1860, together with a code of civil and criminal procedure.</p>
                <p>Lord'Canning left India in March 1862, and died before he had been a month in
                    England. His successor, Lord Elgin, only lived till November 1863, when he too
                    fell a victim to the excessive work of the governor-generalship, dying at the
                    Himâlayari station of Dharmsâlâ, where he lies buried. He was succeeded by Sir
                    John Lawrence, the saviour of the Punjab. The chief incidents of his
                    administration were the Bhutân war and the terrible Orissa famine. Lord Mayo,
                    who succeeded him in 1869, carried on the permanent British policy of moral and
                    material progress with a special degree of personal energy. The Ambâlâ(Umballa)
                    darbâr,at which Shere Ali was recognized as amir of Afghànistân, though in one
                    sense merely the completion of what Lord Lawrence had begun, owed much of its
                    success to the personal influence of Lord Mayo himself. The same quality,
                    combined with sympathy and firmness, stood him in good stead in all his dealings
                    both with native chiefs and European officials. His example of hard work
                    stimulated all to their best. While engaged in exploring with his own eyes the
                    furthest corners of the empire, he fell by the hand of an assassin in the
                    convict settlement of the Andaman Islands in 1872. His successor was Lord
                    Northbrook, whose ability showed itself chiefly in the department of finance.
                    During the time of his administration a famine in Lower Bengal in 1874 was
                    successfully obviated by Government relief and public works, though at an
                    enormous cost; the gâikwâr of Baroda was dethroned in 1875 for misgovernment and
                    disloyalty, while his dominions were continued to a nominated child of the
                    family; and the Prince of Wales made a tour through the country in the cold
                    weather of 1875-76. Lord Lytton followed Lord Northbrook in 1876. On January 1,
                    1877, Queen Victoria was proclaimed Empress of India at a <hi rend="italic"
                    >darldr</hi> of unequalled magnificence, held on the historic “ridge”
                    overlooking the Mughal capital of Delhi. But, while the princes and high
                    officials of the country were flocking to this gorgeous scene, the shadow of
                    famine was already darkening over the south of India. Both the monsoons of 1876
                    had failed to bring their due supply of rain, and the season of 1877 was little
                    better. The consequences of this prolonged drought, which extended from the
                    Deccan to Cape Comorin, and subsequently invaded northern India, were more
                    disastrous than any similar calamity since the introduction of British rule.
                    Despite unparalleled importations of grain by sea and rail, despite the most
                    strenuous exertions of the Government, which incurred a total expenditure on
                    this account of 11 millions sterling, the loss of life from actual starvation
                    and its attendant train of diseases was lamentable. The total number of deaths
                    from disease and want in the distressed tracts in excess of the normal mortality
                    for the two years 1876-78 is estimated to have raised the death-rate by 40 per
                    cent., or 5{ millions. Tn the autumn of 1878 the affairs of Afghànistân again
                    forced themselves into notice. Shere Ali, the amir, who <pb break="no"

                    found to be favouring Russian intrigues. A British embassy was refused
                    admittance to the country, while a Russian mission was received with honour.
                    This led to a declaration of war. British armies advanced by three routes,—the
                    Khaibar (Khyber), the Kuram, and the Bolân, and without much opposition occupied
                    the inner entrances of the passes. Shere Ali fled to Afghân Turkestân, and there
                    died. A treaty was entered into with his son, Yâkub Khân, at Gandamak, by which
                    the British frontier was advanced to the crests or further sides of the passes,
                    and a British officer was admitted to reside at Cabul. Within a few months the
                    British resident, Sir Louis Cavagnari, was treacherously attacked and massacred,
                    together with his escort, and a second war became necessary. Yâkub Khân
                    abdicated, and was deported to India; Cabul was occupied in force, and an Afghân
                    chief of the Durâni line was placed in the government of Kandahâr with the title
                    of wâli. At that crisis of affairs a general election in England resulted in a
                    defeat of the ministry. Lord Lytton resigned with the Conservative ’ministry,
                    and the marquis of Ripon was nominated as his successor in 1880. Since then, a
                    British brigade received a defeat between Kandahâr and the Helmand river from
                    the Herâti army of Ayùb Khân, a defeat promptly and completely retrieved by the
                    brilliant march of General Sir Frederick Roberts from Cabul to Kandahâr, and by
                    the total rout of Ayiïb Khân’s army on September 1, 1880. Abdurrahman Khân, the
                    eldest male representative of the stock of Dost Muhammad, has now been
                    recognized as amir of Cabul.</p>
