                    The species of the families <hi rend="italic">Ichneumonidoe,</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Braconidoe,</hi><hi rend="italic">Evaniidae, Proctotrypidoe,</hi>
                    and <hi rend="italic">Chalcididoe</hi> are often indiscriminately called
                    “Ichneumons,” but the term is perhaps properly applicable only to the first and
                    second of these, which are respectively equivalent to the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Ichneumones</hi><hi rend="italic">genuini</hi> and <hi rend="italic">I.
                    adsciti</hi> of older naturalists, chiefly differing in the former having two
                    recurrent nerves to the anterior wing, whilst the latter has only one such
                    nerve. The <hi rend="italic">Ichneumonidoe</hi> proper are one of the most
                    extensive groups of insects, and have been much studied by entomologists since
                    the time of Linnaeus and Gravenhorst. Their sexual differences of colour,
                    &amp;c., are, however, often so great that fresh discoveries are constantly
                    being made with regard to their true specific relations, as well as new species
                    detected by biological observers. Gravenhorst described some 1650 European
                    species, to which considerable subsequent additions have been made; and at the
                    latest computation of the English <hi rend="italic">Ichneumonidoe</hi> (in 1872,
                    by the Rev. T. A. Marshall), 1186 species, contained in 136 genera, were
                    recognized,—439 <hi rend="italic">Braconidoe</hi> being also enumerated. There
                    are 6 subfamilies of the <hi rend="italic">Ichneumonidoe,</hi> viz., the <hi
                    rend="italic">Ichneu-moηides, Cryptides, Agriotypides,</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Ophionides,</hi><hi rend="italic">Trgphonides,</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >Pimplides,</hi> differing considerably in size and facies, but united in the
                    common attribute of being in their earlier stage parasitic upon other insects.
                    They have all long narrow bodies; a small free head with long filiform or
                    setaceous antennae, which are never elbowed, and have always more than sixteen
                    joints; the abdomen attached to the thorax at its hinder extremity between the
                    base of the posterior coxae, and provided in the female with a straight
                    ovipositor often exserted and very long; and the wings veined, with perfect
                    cells on the disk of the front pair.</p>
                <p>The parasitic habits above alluded to render these flies of very great importance
                    in the economy of nature, as they effectually serve to check any inordinate
                    increase in the numbers of injurious insects. Without their aid, indeed, it
                    would in many cases be impossible for the agriculturist to hold his own against
                    the ravages of his minute hexapod foes, whose habits are not sufficiently known
                    to render artificial checks or destroying agents available. The females of all
                    the species are constantly on the alert to discover the proper living food for
                    their own larvae, which are hatched from the eggs they deposit in or on the
                    eggs, larvae, or pupae of other insects of all orders, chiefly <hi rend="italic"
                    >Lepidoptera,</hi> the caterpillars of butterflies and moths being specially
                    attacked (as also are spiders). Any one who has watched insect life, even in a
                    suburban garden, during summer, can hardly have failed to notice the busy way in
                    which the parent ichneumon, a small four-winged fly, with constantly vibrating
                    antennae, searches for her prey; and the clusters of minute cocoons round the
                    remains of some unfortunate cabbage-butterfly caterpillar, which has had just
                    enough vitality left in it to crawl instinctively to a proper <pb break="no"

                    will never make, must also have been observed by many. This is the work of <hi
                    rend="italic">Apanteles</hi> (or <hi rend="italic">Microgaster)</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">glomeratus,</hi> one of the <hi rend="italic">Braconidoe,</hi>
                    which in days past was a source of disquietude to naturalists, who believed that
                    the life of the one defunct larva had <hi rend="italic">transmigrated</hi> into
                    the numerous smaller flies reared from it. Ichneumon-flies which attack external
                    feeders have a short ovipositor; but those attached to wood-feeding insects have
                    that organ of great length, for the purpose of reaching their concealed prey.
                    Thus a species from Japan <hi rend="italic">{Bracon</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >penetrator)</hi> has its ovipositor nine times the length of the body; and the
                    large species of <hi rend="italic">Rhyssa</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >Ephialtes,</hi> parasitic on <hi rend="italic">Sirex</hi> and large woodboring
                    beetles in temperate Europe, have very long instruments (with which when handled
                    they will endeavour to sting, sometimes penetrating the skin), in order to get
                    at their secreted victims. This length of ovipositor is, in the female of a
                    species of <hi rend="italic">Peleeinus,</hi> common in the borealparts of North
                    America in pine forests, replaced by an excessively attenuated development of
                    abdomen, causing the insect to resemble a small dragon-fly, and fulfilling the
                    same mechanical purpose. A common reddish-coloured species of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Ophion</hi><hi rend="italic">(0.</hi><hi rend="italic">obscurum),</hi> with a
                    sabre-shaped abdomen, is noteworthy from the fact of its eggs being attached by
                    stalks outside the body of the caterpillar of the puss-moth <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Diranura vinula).</hi> Lepidopterists wishing to breed the latter cut off the
                    eggs of the parasite with scissors.</p>
                <p>The larvae of the ichneumon-flies are white fleshy cylindrical footless grubs;
                    the majority of them spin silk cocoons before pupating, often in a mass
                    (sometimes almost geometrically), and sometimes in layers of different colours
                    and texture.</p>
                <p>The reader desirous of investigating more fully the structure and habits of this
                    interesting family will, in addition to the older works of Gravenhorst,
                    Esenbeck, Wesmael, and Haliday, find much matter in the recent writings of
                    Brischke, Cresson, Provancher, Holmgren, Woldstedt, Tischbein, Vollenhoven,
                    Forster, Kriechbaumer, Taschenberg, F. Smith, C. G. Thomson, and Rondani. The
                    last-mentioned author has published (in the Bulletin of the Italian
                    Entomological Society, 1871-78) a valuable list of parasitic insects and the
                    species to which they are attached. (E. C. R.)</p>
