                    illustrious family, that he studied under Anatolius and afterwards under
                    Porphyry, the pupil of Plotinus, that he himself gathered together a large
                    number of disciples of different nations with whom he lived on terms of genial
                    friendship, that he wrote “various philosophical books,” and that he died during
                    the reign of Constantine,—according to Fabricius, before 333 <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">a.d.</hi> His residence (probably) at his native town of
                    Chalcis was varied by a yearly visit with his pupils to the baths of Gadara. Of
                    the books referred to by Suidas only a fraction has been preserved. His
                    commentaries on Plato and Aristotle, and works on the Chaldaean theology and on
                    the soul, are lost. For our knowledge of his system we are indebted partly to
                    the fragments of these writings preserved by Stobaeus and others, and to the
                    notices of his successors, especially Proclus, partly to his five extant books,
                    the sections of a great work on the Pythagorean philosophy. Besides these,

                    mentioned make it improbable that the work was by Iamblichus himself, it
                    certainly emanated from his school, and in its systematic attempt to give a
                    speculative justification of the polytheistic cultus of the day, marks the
                    turning-point in the history of thought at which Iamblichus stood.</p>
                <p>As a speculative theory Neo-Platonism had received its highest development from
                    Plotinus. The modifications introduced by Iamblichus were the elaboration in
                    greater detail of its formal divisions, the more systematic application of the
                    Pythagorean number-symbolism, and chiefly, under the influence of Oriental
                    systems, the thorough-going mythic interpretation of what the previous
                    philosophy had still regarded as notional. It is on the last account, probably,
                    that Iamblichus was looked upon with such extravagant veneration. As a
                    philosopher he had learning indeed, but little originality. But by using what he
                    had to throw a haze of philosophy over the popular superstition, he acquired his
                    fame. By his contemporaries he was accredited with miraculous powers (which he,
                    however, disclaimed), and by his followers in the decline of Greek philosophy,
                    and his admirers on its revival in the 15th and 16th centuries, his name was
                    scarcely mentioned without the epithet “divine” or “most divine,” while, not
                    content with the more modest eulogy of Eunapius that he was inferior to Porphyry
                    only in style, the emperor Julian regarded him as not even <pb break="no"

                    the gold of Lydia for one epistle of Iamblichus.</p>
                <p>Theoretically, the philosophy of Plotinus was an attempt to harmonize the
                    principles of the various Greek schools. At the head of his system he placed the
                    transcendent incommunicable one («/ <hi rend="italic">άμεθεκτον),</hi> whose
                    first-begotten is intellect <hi rend="italic">(νους),</hi> from which proceeds
                    soul (≠υχτ)), which in turn gives birth to <hi rend="italic">φυσις,</hi> the
                    realm of nature. Immediately after the absolute one, Iamblichus introduced a
                    second superexistent unity to stand between it and the many as the producer of
                    intellect, and made the three succeeding moments of the development (intellect,
                    soul, and nature) undergo various modifications. He speaks of them as
                    intellectual <hi rend="italic">(θεοί νοεροί),</hi> supramundane <hi
                    rend="italic">(υπερκόσμιοι),</hi> and mundane gods <hi rend="italic"
                    >(εγκόσμιοι).</hi> The first of these—which Plotinus represented under the three
                    stages of (objective) being <hi rend="italic">(οv),</hi> (subjective) life <hi
                    rend="italic">(ζωή),</hi> and (realized) intellect <hi rend="italic"
                    >(νους)</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi> is distinguished by him into spheres of
                    intelligible gods <hi rend="italic">(θεοί νοητοί)</hi> and of intellectual gods
                    <hi rend="italic">(θεοί νοεροί),</hi> each subdivided into triads, the latter
                    sphere being the place of ideas, the former of the archetypes of these ideas.
                    Between these two worlds, at once separating and uniting them, some scholars
                    think there was inserted by Iamblichus, as afterwards by Proclus, a third sphere
                    partaking of the nature of both <hi rend="italic">(θεοί νοητοί καί νοεροί).</hi>
                    But this supposition depends on a merely conjectural emendation of the text. We
                    read, however, that “in the intellectual hebdomad he assigned the third rank
                    among the fathers to the Demiurge.” The Demiurge, Zeus, or world-creating
                    potency, is thus identified with the perfected νους, the intellectual triad
                    being increased to a hebdomad, probably (as Zeller supposes) through the
                    subdivision of its first two members. As in Plotinus νους produced nature by
                    mediation of <hi rend="italic">ψυχή,</hi> so here the intelligible gods are
                    followed by a triad of psychic gods. The first of these is incommunicable and
                    supramundane, while the other two seem to be mundane though rational. In the
                    third class, or mundane gods <hi rend="italic">(θεοί</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >iγκοσμiοi),</hi> there is a still greater wealth of divinities, of various
                    local position, function, and rank. We read of gods, angels, demons, and heroes,
                    of twelve heavenly gods whose number is increased to thirty-six or three hundred
                    and sixty, and of seventy-two other gods proceeding from them, of twenty-one
                    chiefs <hi rend="italic">(ηγεμόνες)</hi> and forty-two naturegods <hi
                    rend="italic">(θεοί γενεσιουργοί),</hi> besides guardian divinities, of
                    particular individuals and nations. The world is thus peopled by a crowd of
                    superhuman beings influencing natural events, possessing and communicating
                    knowledge of the future, and not inaccessible to prayers and offerings.</p>
                <p>The whole of this complex theory is ruled by a mathematical formulism of triad,
                    hebdomad, &amp;c., while the first principle is identified with the monad, νους
                    with the dyad, and <hi rend="italic">ψυχή</hi> with the triad, symbolic meanings
                    being also assigned to the other numbers. “The theorems of mathematics,” he
                    says, “apply absolutely to all things,” from things divine to original matter
                    <hi rend="italic">(υλη).</hi> But though he thus subjects all things to number,
                    he holds elsewhere that numbers are independent existences, and occupy a middle
                    place between the limited and unlimited.</p>
                <p>Another difficulty of the system is the account given of nature. It is said to be
                    “bound by the indissoluble chains of necessity which men call fate,” as
                    distinguished from divine things which are not subject to fate. Yet, being
                    itself the result of higher powers becoming corporeal, a continual stream of
                    elevating influence flows from them to it, interfering with its necessary laws
                    and turning to good ends the imperfect and evil. Of evil no satisfactory account
                    is given: it is said to have been generated accidentally.</p>
                <p>In his doctrine of man Iamblichus retains for the soul the middle place between
                    intellect and nature it occupies in the universal order. He rejects the
                    passionless and purely intellectual character ascribed to the human soul by
                    Plotinus, distinguishing it sharply both from those above and those below it. He
                    maintains that it moves between the higher and lower spheres, that it descends
                    by a necessary law (not solely for trial or punishment) into the body, and,
                    passing perhaps from one human body to another, returns again to the
                    supersensible. This return is effected by the virtuous activities which the soul
                    performs through its own power of free will, and by the assistance of the gods.
                    These virtues were classified by Porphyry as political, purifying <hi
                    rend="italic">(καθαρτικοί),</hi> theoretical, and paradigmatic; and to these
                    Iamblichus adds a fifth class of priestly virtues <hi rend="italic">(ίερατικαί
                    άρεταί),</hi> in which the divinest part of the soul raises itself above
                    intellect to absolute being.</p>
                <p>Iamblichus does not seem ever to have attained to that ecstatic communion with
                    and absorption in deity which was the aim of earlier Neo-Platonism, and which
                    Plotinus enjoyed four times in his life, Porphyry once. Indeed his tendency was
                    not so much to raise man to God as to bring the gods down to men—a tendency
                    shown still more plainly in the “Answer of Abamon the master to Porphyry’s
                    letter to Anebo and solutions of the doubts therein expressed,” afterwards
                    entitled the <hi rend="italic">Liber de</hi><hi rend="italic">Mysteriis,</hi>
                    and ascribed to Iamblichus.</p>
                <p>In answer to questions raised and doubts expressed by Porphyry, the writer of
                    this treatise appeals to the innate idea all men have of the gods as testifying
                    to the existence of divinities countless in number and various in rank (to the
                    correct arrangement of which he, like Iamblichus, attaches the greatest
                    importance). He holds with the latter that above all principles of being and
                    intelligence stands the absolute one from whom the first god and king
                    spontaneously proceeds; while after these follow the etherial, empyrean, and
                    heavenly gods, and the various orders of archangels, angels, demons, and heroes
                    distinguished in nature, power, and activity, and in greater profusion than even
                    the imagination of Iamblichus had conceived. He says that all the gods are good
                    (though he in another place admits the existence of evil demons who must be
                    propitiated), and traces the source of evil to matter; rebuts the objection that
                    their answering prayer implies passivity on the part of gods or demons; defends
                    divination, soothsaying, and theurgic practices as manifestations of the divine
                    activity; describes the appearances of the different sorts of divinities;
                    discusses the various kinds of sacrifice, which he says must be suitable to the
                    different natures of the gods, material and immaterial, and to the double
                    condition of the sacrificer as bound to the body or free from it (differing thus
                    in his psychology from Iamblichus); and, in conclusion, states that the only way
                    to happiness is through knowledge of and union with the gods, and that theurgic
                    practices alone prepare the mind for this union —again going beyond his master,
                    who held assiduous contemplation of divine things to be sufficient. It is the
                    passionless nature of the soul which permits it to be thus united to divine
                    beings,—knowledge of this mystic union and of the worship associated with it
                    having been derived from the Egyptian priests, who learnt it from Hermes.</p>
                <p>On one point only does the author of the <hi rend="italic">De MysterUs</hi> seem
                    not to go so far as Iamblichus in thus making philosophy subservient to
                    priestcraft. He condemns as folly and impiety the worship of images of the gods,
                    though his master held that these “simulacra” were filled with divine power,
                    whether made by the hand of man or (as he believed) fallen from heaven. But
                    images could easily be dispensed with from the point of view of the writer, who
                    not only held that all things were full of gods <hi rend="italic">(πάντα πλήρη
                    θεών,</hi> as Thales said), but thought that each man had a special divinity of
                    his own—an ίδιος δαi∕ιωv—as his guard and companion.</p>
