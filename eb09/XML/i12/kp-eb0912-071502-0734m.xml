                    of her immaculate conception, however, so far as has hitherto been discovered,
                    may be said to begin, in the year 1140,<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    wrote to the canons of the cathedral at Lyons <hi rend="italic">(Ep.</hi> 174),
                    who, without consulting the Roman see, had recently introduced into their church
                    a festival in celebration of that doctrine. Bernard argued vigorously against
                    this on the ground of its novelty, its unscripturalness (Ps. li. 5), and its
                    absurdity :—“On the same principle,” said he, “you would be obliged to hold that
                    the conception of her ancestors, in an ascending line, was also a holy one,
                    since otherwise she could not have descended from them worthily, and there would
                    then be festivals without number.” How the recipients, who, it is stated,
                    claimed to have learned their peculiar rite from a document communicated by the
                    Virgin herself, were affected by this letter, is not recorded. Among
                    controversial treatises which appeared shortly afterwards are mentioned those of
                    Potho of Prüm and the Abbot de la Celle against the doctrine, and that of the
                    English monk Nicolas in its favour. In the 13th century all the leading
                    theologians, such as Alexander Halensis (p. iii., qu. 10, membr. 2), Albertus
                    Magnus <hi rend="italic">(Ccmm. in Sent.,</hi> iii. 3), Bonaventura <hi
                    rend="italic">(Comm. in Sent.,</hi> iii. 3. 1, 2), and Thomas Aquinas <hi
                    rend="italic">(Summa,</hi> p. iii., qu. 27, art. 1-3), took the view of St
                    Bernard, their contribution to the theology of the subject consisting in an
                    accurate definition of the moment at which the Virgin’s sanctification in the
                    womb must be held to have taken place. During the same century the feast of the
                    Conception became very popular, and in 1263 it was accepted by a general chapter
                    of the Franciscans at Pisa, without reference, however, to the question of
                    immaculacy. Of great importance to the subsequent history of the dogmu was the
                    appearance in the theological world, towards the beginning of the 14th century,
                    of Duns Scotus, the “subtle doctor” of the Franciscans, who, as in so many other
                    points, so also in this, came into conflict with the still more illustrious
                    “Doctor Angelicus,” the Dominican Aquinas. In one part of his <hi rend="italic"
                    >Commentary</hi> on the <hi rend="italic">Sentences</hi> of Peter of Lombardy
                    (lib. iii., dist. 3, qu. 1, sec. 9) he declares for the thinkableness and even
                    probability of Mary’s having been preserved intact from original sin; in a later
                    passage (dist. 18, qu. 1, sec. 13) the doctrine is categorically stated. It was
                    upon this disputed point that the long and bitter controversy between the two
                    great mendicant orders chiefly turned. In 1389, the Spanish Dominican Joannes de
                    Montesono having maintained in a disputation at Paris that the view of the
                    Scotists was unscriptural and heretical, the university, without committing
                    itself on the main point, condemned his violent theses, and this condemnation
                    was concurred in by the Avignon pope, Clement VII. The members of the entire <pb
                    break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit12newyrich/page/n735/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0912-0735-0716"/> Dominican order, for their refusal to acquiesce,
                    were for several years excluded from the privileges of the university. In the
                    beginning of the 15 th century the famous chancellor, John Gerson, accepted the
                    new dogma, and applied in its favour the well-known doctrine of development. At
                    the council of Basel (in the 36th session, held September 17, 1439) it was
                    defined and declared that the doctrine was consistent with faith, reason, and
                    Scripture, and therefore to be approved and embraced; the contrary doctrine was
                    not condemned, but it was forbidden to preach or to teach it. The university of
                    Paris now made subscription to the doctrine of the Immaculate Conception a
                    condition for its degrees, and various other universities entered into a solemn
                    compact to use every exertion for its spread, but the controversy was far from
                    having been brought to a close even by the action of Pope Sixtus IV., who in
                    1483 published a bull threatening with excommunication any one who should accuse
                    of heresy either the advocates or the impugners of the doctrine, the point
                    having not yet been decided by the apostolical see. In its fifth session (1546)
                    the council of Trent, after formulating its decree on the subject of original
                    sin, sought to effect a compromise between Dominicans and Franciscans by
                    appending a declaration that it did not intend that this doctrine should be
                    applied to the blessed and immaculate Virgin Mary, but that the constitutions of
                    Sixtus IV. were still to be observed. In the beginning of the 17th century the
                    field of battle was transferred to Spain, where, under the predominant influence
                    of the Franciscans and Jesuits, medals were struck, pictures painted, statues
                    erected, and persecutions set on foot in honour of the Virgin “sin pe-cado
                    concebida”; and embassies were sent to Rome, both by Philip III. and by Philip
                    IV., to obtain more explicit recognition of the popular doctrine. The popes
                    continued for a long time, however, to maintain their attitude of reserve. Paul
                    V. (1617) forbade all public dispute on the subject, and Gregory XV. (1622)
                    extended the prohibition even to private discussions, except in the case of
                    Dominicans <hi rend="italic">“inter sef</hi> But gradually the papal sympathies
                    became in &gt;re pronounced under Jesuit influences; Clement IX. gave the feast
                    of the Conception an octave; Clement XI., in 1708, made it a festival “de
                    praecepto” for all Christendom; while Benedict XIV. endeavoured to reconcile St
                    Bernard with the more modern tendencies of Roman Catholic theology, by insisting
                    upon subtle distinctions between the “conceptio activa” and the “conceptio
                    passiva” of Mary. In the pontificate of Gregory XVI. several prelates received
                    papal permission to describe her conception as immaculate; and in 1849 Pius IX.
                    was induced to address to his bishops from Gaeta an encyclical, inviting them to
                    state how far the dogmatic definition of the dogma would meet their wishes and
                    the wishes of those under their charge. A large majority declared themselves
                    strongly in favour of the proposal, and the ultimate result was that in December
                    8, 1854, the pope, in presence of a numerous concourse of cardinals, patriarchs,
                    archbishops, and bishops assembled in St Peter’s, Rome, solemnly promulgated the
                    bull “Ineffabilis Deus,” by which the doctrine of the Immaculate Conception
                    finally became for the Roman communion an article of faith, the denial of which
                    is accounted to be heresy.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"

                    of sterility is what is celebrated; there is no reference to anything analogous
                    to the Roman doctrine. It may be remarked that strong expressions as to the
                    absolute purity of Mary are found in the Koran (iii. 37), and still more in
                    later Mahometan writings; but the Christian doctrine of sin is so utterly
                    foreign to Islam that no precise theological construction of these expressions
                    is possible.</p>
