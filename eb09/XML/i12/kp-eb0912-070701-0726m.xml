                <p><label type="entry">ILLUMINATION</label> is a term which has long been used to
                    signify the embellishment of written or printed text or design with colours, and
                    especially with gold, more rarely also with silver. The lustre of the former
                    metal may probably have led to the adoption of the word in this sense. The Latin
                    verb <hi rend="italic">illuminare,</hi> with the meaning of “to decorate,”
                    occurs as early as the 8th century; and in the first.portion of the <hi
                    rend="italic">Romande</hi><hi rend="italic">la Rose,</hi> composed before 1260,
                    <hi rend="italic">enluminer</hi> is found with a similar meaning, while Dante
                    <hi rend="italic">(Purgat.,</hi> xi. 79) alludes to this kind of painting and
                    its French designation as “quell’ arte, ehe alluminar èchiamatain Parisi.” In
                    Early English we find the forms <hi rend="italic">enlomyηe, luminen,
                    limnen,</hi> whence <hi rend="italic">limn.</hi> Of synonymous use with these
                    terms we find in the Middle Ages the words <hi rend="italic">miniare</hi> and
                    <hi rend="italic">miniatura,</hi> from <hi rend="italic">minium,</hi> a red
                    pigment, in early use for decorating MSS. Miniature employed in connexion with
                    the art of illumination now, however, generally signifies a picture or portrait
                    as distinguished from mere ornament or ornate letters.</p>
                <p>The research into the past which has characterized the present century has
                    extended to the art of illumination, and, following the lead of D’Agincourt,
                    Mabillon, and others, has by the examination of mediaeval decorated manuscripts
                    thrown a vast amount of light upon the arts of the past. In spite of iconoclasm
                    in the East, the burning of Arabic MSS. in Spain, and the destruction and
                    dissipation of libraries which unhappily accompanied the Reformation, a
                    considerable number of beautiful and elaborate volumes have come down to us
                    where larger and more exposed works of art have perished. They therefore supply
                    many a lacuna in art history. Conformably to the unity which pervaded all art
                    work in the Middle Ages, a close correspondence in style has been recognized
                    between the ornamentation of MSS. of different periods and contemporaneous
                    architecture and other arts. The architect, the decorator, the. glass-stainer,
                    and other artists have consequently learned, and with great profit, to search
                    their pages for ornamental motives, details, and colouring, in thorough harmony
                    with ancient styles, which no other source supplies so copiously. Invaluable
                    materials too for the history of costume are found in the miniatures with which
                    they abound.</p>
                <p>The earliest writing of which monuments exist, the Egyptian, was often enhanced
                    by the use of colour. In the ritual papyri, directions, &amp;c., are written in
                    red to distinguish them from the main text, just as was subsequently done in
                    mediaeval liturgical MSS.—a practice from which the term <hi rend="italic"
                    >rubric</hi> is derived. A few scattered passages in Latin classic authors
                    (notably Ovid, Seneca, Varro, Martial, Pliny the Elder, J. Capitolinus) prove
                    the occasional use of rubrication and of pictorial embellishment of MSS. among
                    the Romans. The earliest decorated MSS., at least of European execution, which
                    have reached us date from the 4th and 5th centuries of our era, and are of
                    extreme rarity. Of these one of the most celebrated is the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Virgil</hi> written in elegant capitals preserved in the Vatican, in which the
                    adornment is limited to rectangular pictures (miniatures) painted in the antique
                    manner seen in the Pompeian frescos, the body colour laid on with a free brush
                    and without black outlines. It may be taken as the type of a class of MSS. of
                    which very few specimens are extant. A different type of early calligraphy,
                    which was much esteemed, is found in the <hi rend="italic">Codex</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Argenteus,</hi> now at Upsala, written about 360, containing
                    Ulfila’s MoesoGothic version of part of the Scriptures. It is written in gold
                    and silver letters on vellum stained a red purple. The art of thus staining
                    vellum, perhaps with the murex, was afterwards lost, and in the 8th and 9th
                    centuries was imitated by painting the vellum.</p>
                <p>After the 2d century art rapidly declined in the West, owing to the corruption
                    and anarchy of the empire. It found a home, however, at Constantinople, where
                    intercourse with Persia resulted in a style which blends Oriental magnificence
                    with Western vigour and variety, and is destined, as we are about to see, to
                    exercise a dominant influence upon the art of Europe for many centuries. This
                    style, known as the Byzantine, is distinguished by very characteristic details,
                    and by its lavish use of gold, especially in backgrounds. Meanwhile Christianity
                    had been planted in remote Ireland, which proved such favourable soil that the
                    isle was already at the beginning of the 6th century renowned for its learning
                    and sanctity, and was the seat of numerous monasteries and seminaries, where a
                    native style of art was developed, wholly distinct from anything else which the
                    world has seen. Its principal features are spirals, extremely ingenious plaits,
                    and interlacements of attenuated lacertine animals and birds of conventional
                    form. The human figure is sometimes introduced, but becomes objectionable,
                    through the ignorance of drawing and of anatomy usually characteristic of
                    semi-civilized attempts to portray the higher organisms. The work is further
                    distinguished by a degree of minuteness, intricacy, and precision baffling to
                    the modern draughtsman. It is seen in its highest perfection in the <hi
                    rend="italic">Book of Kells,</hi> preserved in the library of Trinity College,
                    Dublin, and in the Lindisfarne Gospels in the British Museum. This style, known
                    as the Celtic or Anglo-Celtic, was transplanted by Irish missionaries to
                    Lindisfarne, Bobbio, St Gall, Würzburg, Luxeuil, and other places, where volumes
                    displaying this peculiar ornamentation are still treasured. The influence of
                    Anglo-Celtic art is very apparent in the subsequent “Carlovipgian style” which
                    arose in France and Germany under the fostering care of Charlemagne, and of
                    Alcuin, whom he had invited to France to direct the progress of learning and the
                    arts. The gospels found upon the knees of the great emperor when his tomb at
                    Aix-la-Chapelle was opened, the gospels of St Servin de Toulouse, those of St
                    Medard de Soissons, the Bible of San Calisto monastery at Rome, and the Harleian
                    <hi rend="italic">Codex aureus of</hi> the British Museum are justly renowned
                    examples of this majestic and magnificent style, in which the pages glow with
                    gold and purple, and the Roman acanthus, Celtic interlacements, and Byzantine
                    details combine in harmonious variety. A text written wholly or partially in
                    gold ink is another characteristic of the epoch. About this period too are found
                    those gigantic initials which from containing figures relating to the text have
                    been called in France <hi rend="italic">Historiées.</hi> A new style had also
                    arisen in England, in which the debased Roman acanthus was largely developed.
                    This conventional foliage is here seen skilfully combined with gold bars, which
                    surround the page, and form a border at the commencement of books, &lt;fcc. This
                    style has been called the <hi rend="italic">Opus Anglicum.</hi> It often
                    displays a masterly freedom and spirit, and a peculiar “fluttering outline,”
                    which also characterizes the spirited pen-drawings frequently found in MSS. of
                    the period. The finest specimens of this style, among which are the
                    benedictional of St Ethelwold, belonging to the duke of Devonshire, and a couple
                    of volumes<pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit12newyrich/page/n727/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0912-0727-0708"/> in the public library, Rouen, were probably
                    executed at Hyde Abbey, Winchester.</p>
                <p>The apprehensions of the year 1000 as the end of the world tended greatly to
                    paralyse art. As these fears died away, however, the Romanesque style of
                    architecture was being developed, especially in the Rhine-lands. This was
                    favoured by numerous Greek artists who, deprived of their livelihood by Eastern
                    iconoclasm, had migrated westwards, and deeply impressed the Byzantine character
                    upon the architecture of central and western Europe. Simultaneously there arose
                    a bold sweeping style of ornament, characterized by fine rounded curves and
                    Byzantine details, but also by a tendency to naturalism, and, in books, by large
                    initials. The Byzantine gold backgrounds were still a glowing feature, which
                    indeed continued through the whole subsequent progress of illumination. From the
                    11th century gold leaf was applied to the vellum upon a substratum of fine
                    plaster, and could be so highly burnished as to exhibit the rich lustre of a
                    polished lamina of the solid metal. As skill in drawing increased, nature was
                    more copied, and towards the 14th century natural foliage, conventionally
                    treated, constitutes the main portion of the ornament. The oak, the vine, and
                    especially the ivy, are frequent, springing in free spirited curves from
                    decorated initials, or extending into a border round the whole or part of the
                    page. The initials decrease in size whilst they gain in excellence of execution,
                    and illumination, considered as decorative design, is generally considered to
                    have reached its highest perfection, about this period. The pictures of sacred
                    subjects gradually lose Byzantine rigidity and assume dramatic expression, pose,
                    and grouping. And towards the 15th century the blue or gold background begins to
                    be abandoned for natural scenery and accessories. Towards the commencement of
                    the 15th century illumination was liberally fostered by John, duke of Berri,
                    brother of Charles V. His magnificence in this branch of art awoke the emulation
                    of Philip the Bold, duke of Burgundy, and of the duke of Bedford, the regent of
                    France, in the same direction. For the last-named was painted the celebrated <hi
                    rend="italic">Bedford Hours,</hi> now in the British Museum, part of the
                    workmanship of which has been ascribed to Jan, Hubert, and Margaretta van Eyck.
                    As perfect mastery of drawing and facility of realistic execution were gained,
                    illumination as a decorative art became debased in design. Borders of gold or
                    richly coloured grounds, over which are scattered exquisitely painted flowers,
                    fruit, and insects, surround pages of text or miniatures wrought with supreme
                    manual dexterity, but not unfrequently of meretricious composition. In
                    juxtaposition with this rich and copious ornamentation (the primary end of the
                    book), the text, already less black and massive than in preceding centuries, too
                    often dwindles into insignificance. The <hi rend="italic">Hours of Anne of
                    Brittany,</hi> preserved at the Louvre, is one of the most celebrated specimens
                    of 16th century illumination of this style.</p>
                <p>The character of Italian illumination differs considerably from that which marked
                    the art in central or northern Europe. It had arisen by slow degrees from the
                    devastation which Italy had suffered in the early centuries of the Christian
                    era. The scriptoria of Ravenna, Siena, Florence, Bologna, Perugia, Ferrara, in
                    the 13th and 14th centuries, produced illuminated volumes worthy of their
                    growing schools of pιinting, and were especially celebrated for the elaboration
                    of large choral books.</p>
                <p>The Renaissance, with its revival and enrichment of classical forms, was fully
                    reflected in the illuminator’s art, which was largely employed in smaller
                    volumes for secular subjects, and was patronized by the Italian princely
                    families, and finally reached its culmination in the hands of such artists as
                    Girolamo dei Libri, whose drawing is very accurate, and attains a microscopic
                    delicacy of stippling, and his pupil Giulio Clovio, who in his composition makes
                    large use of the human figure, and with an imitation of Michelangelo’s manner
                    combines unrivalled minuteness of execution. Long after the invention of
                    printing the popes and doges retained official illuminators in their service;
                    and some of the most elaborate and costly volumes were executed subsequently to
                    the introduction of the press. The typographical multiplication of books,
                    however, proved fatal to the art. The early productions of the press, indeed,
                    had blank spaces left for initials and miniatures, which were painted in by
                    hand, often very roughly. These were soon replaced by printed designs intended
                    to be gilt and coloured, which reflected the character of contemporaneous art,
                    as far as the technical difficulties of the yet imperfect press allowed. The
                    custom of adorning sumptuous volumes with engraved initials and other ornament
                    has continued to the present time, with an increasing tendency to
                    naturalism.</p>
                <p>The visitor to the public libraries and museums of Moscow and St Petersburg will
                    have there admired the rich display of Slavonic illuminated MSS. of peculiar
                    style, intricate design, careful execution, and frequently fine colour. The
                    leading features of Russian art were derived from Byzantium, but, as Russian
                    archaeologists maintain, were blended with a native element, and a true national
                    style arose in the 12th and continued to the 16th century, when the influence of
                    the Renaissance began to be felt.</p>
                <p>The fecund art of Constantinople was also the parent of another style—the Arabian
                    or Mahometan—which, however, contains a previously existing Oriental element.
                    The style began to develop in the 7th century. It is geometrical or constructive
                    in character, the use of symbolism or representations of animals or plants being
                    forbidden in the sect of Omar. Inscriptions in cufic characters are often
                    happily used as a decorative feature; rich colouring of red blue and gold
                    prevails. The Turkish and Moresque styles are modifications of the Arabian.
                    Illumination was carried in this style to the highest degree of splendour.
                    Casiri’s <hi rend="italic">Bibliotheca Arabico-Hispana Escumalensis</hi> conveys
                    some idea of the former magnificence of the Moorish libraries in Spain.</p>
                <p>In India illumination, though of great antiquity, does not present those
                    transitions of style which mark the development of western art. Like Indian art
                    generally, its special characteristics are profusion, richness, harmony, repose,
                    and perhaps monotony, with very extensive employment of flowers. Persian art was
                    derived from India. It reflects the Persian love of flowers and symbolism, and
                    the treatment is more free and natural than in India. It seems to have reached
                    its highest perfection about the 15th and 16th centuries of our era, but is
                    still continued. The execution of a magnificent MS. of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Thousand and One Nights</hi> was undertaken under the auspices of the present
                    shah. The absence of any attempt to shade or give relief to the design is, it
                    should here be mentioned, a characteristic of all Oriental design.</p>
                <p>During the earlier part of the Middle Ages the art of illumination was in Europe
                    mostly practised in the scriptorium or apartment devoted to the elaboration of
                    MSS. which was attached to each monastery. In later times the art was practised
                    by lay artists. Illuminators as well as patrons of illumination were
                    occasionally found among the highest ranks; Saint Dunstan and King René may be
                    instanced. And some distinguished painters were also illuminators. All Western
                    MSS. of fine quality were executed upon vellum. Materials were mostly prepared
                    with great care by the artists themselves, or under their direction, and as a
                    rule are found to have well stood the test of time.</p>

                <p>The price given in recent years for MS. volumes valuable for their beauty or
                    antiquity often reaches many hundreds of pounds sterling. A folio Vulgate of the
                    9th century was purchased by the British Museum in 1836 for £750. The <hi

                    establishment, has been valued at over £2000. At the Didot sale in Paris a MS.
                    executed in the highest style of French art fetched above £3000.</p>
