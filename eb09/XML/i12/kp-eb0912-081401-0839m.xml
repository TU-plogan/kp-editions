                    almost the exact geographical centre of the State, in 39° 47' N. lat., 86° 6' W.
                    long., 824 miles W. of New York by rail, and 194 miles S.E. of Chicago. It

                <p>On the admission of Indiana as a State into the Federal Union in 1816, Congress
                    presented 4 square miles of public lands for its seat of government, to be

                    Creek and White River. The site chosen was in the midst of the unbroken forest,
                    60 miles distant from the borders of civilization, and only reached by Indian
                    trails. The name Indianapolis was given by an act of the Legislature on January
                    6, 1821; and Alexander Ralston was appointed to lay out the city. Selecting a
                    slight mound near the <pb break="no"

                    proposed capital, Ralston laid out the town after the manner of Washington city,
                    which he had helped to survey.</p>
                <p>Four avenues radiate from the centre to the four corners of the city. The streets
                    and avenues are 90 feet wide, except Washington, the main street, which is 120.
                    The city has now outgrown its original limits, and extends 4 miles in length and
                    3 in width. It is built upon a level plain and surrounded by a fertile country.
                    It was incorporated in 1836, and received a city charter in 1847. Its growth is
                    shown by the following table :—</p>

                <p>In 1847 the first railway entered the city. Within a few years thereafter other
                    lines were constructed, until now twelve main lines converge in the Union Dépôt.
                    About one hundred passenger trains, connected with every part of the country,
                    enter and depart daily. The numerous tracks being on a level with the surface of
                    the streets, the obstruction and danger at the numerous crossings became very
                    great on account of the increase of railway traffic, so that in 1877 a loop
                    line, called the “Belt,” had to be made passing round the city, to connect the
                    various railroads. By means of it the “through freight cars” are conveyed past
                    the city without blocking the traffic.</p>
                <p>Indianapolis is in the centre of the swine-producing region, and pork packing is
                    one of the chief industries of the city. The number packed in 1877 was 420,000
                    head; in 1878, 766,000; in 1879, 677,809. It is also largely engaged in the
                    grain trade. The railways have been of greatest service to Indianapolis,
                    compensating for its want of water transit. The manufacturing and mercantile
                    interests, which are large and increasing, are the natural result of the city’s
                    extensive railroad connexions.</p>
                <p>A system of graded free schools is maintained all the year. The city school
                    property is valued at $1,041,000.</p>
                <p>In 1871 a public library was established, and is supported by taxation, which now
                    contains 36,461 volumes, and is rapidly increasing. The masonic temple,
                    oddfellows’ hall, post-office, U. S. arsenal, and chamber of commerce are
                    handsome buildings. The Marion county court-house, standing on a public square
                    in the heart of the city, was completed in 1877 at a cost of $1,411,524. The
                    exterior is of Indiana limestone, the interior of iron and marble, with frescoed
                    walls and ceilings. Its dimensions are 150 by 286 feet, and 240 feet to the top
                    of the dome. The principal benevolent institutions of the State, viz., the
                    institution for the education of the blind, that for the deaf and dumb, and the
                    hospital for the insane, are located here; they are handsome and commodious
                    buildings, the last having accommodation for 1313 patients. The State
                    reformatory for women and girls, where all female offenders are imprisoned,
                    adjoins the city. The institution is under the management of a board of control,
                    composed of women chosen by the governor of the State. In 1877 the State began
                    the erection of a new State house, to be completed in 1888, at a cost of
                    $2,000,000. This will be one of the most imposing capital buildings in the
                    United States.</p>
                <p>By law the power to incur permanent debt is limited to a sum not exceeding 2 per
                    cent, upon the assessed value of the property within the city; and the rate of
                    taxation is limited to 90 cents per $100 for municipal purposes, 20 cents for
                    public schools, and 2 cents for free libraries. <hi rend="smallcaps">(a. c.
