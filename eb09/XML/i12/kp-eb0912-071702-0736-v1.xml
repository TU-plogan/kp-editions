                <p><label type="entry">IMPEACHMENT</label>, an exceptional, and now rare, form of
                    procedure against criminals in England, in which the House of Commons are the
                    prosecutors and the House of Lords the judges. It differs from procedure by bill
                    of attainder, which follows the ordinary forms of legislation in both Houses,
                    and takes effect in an Act of Parliament. In impeachment the form of procedure
                    is strictly judicial. When the House of Commons has accepted a motion for
                    impeachment, the mover is ordered to proceed to the bar of the House of Lords,
                    and there impeach the accused “in the name of the House of Commons, and of all
                    the Commons of the United Kingdom.” The charges are formulated in articles, to
                    each of which the accused may deliver a written answer. The prosecution must
                    confine itself to the charges contained in the articles, though further articles
                    may be adhibited from time to time. The Commons appoint managers to conduct the
                    prosecution, but the whole House in committee attends the trial. The defendant
                    may appear by counsel. The president of the House of Lords is the lord high
                    steward, in the case of peers impeached for high treason; in other cases the
                    lord chancellor. The hearing takes place as in an ordinary trial, the defence
                    being allowed to call witnesses if necessary, and the prosecution having a right
                    of reply. At the end of the case the president “puts to each peer, beginning
                    with the junior baron, the questions upon the first article, whether the accused
                    be guilty of the crimes charged therein. Each peer in succession rises in his
                    place when the question is put, and standing uncovered, and laying his right
                    hand upon his breast, answers, ‘Guilty’ or ‘Not guilty,’ as the case may be, ‘
                    upon my honour.’ Each article is proceeded with separately in the same manner,
                    the lord high steward giving his own opinion the last” (May’s <hi rend="italic"
                        >Parliamentary Practice,</hi> c. xxiii.). Should the accused be found
                    guilty, judgment follows if the Commons move for it, but not otherwise. The
                    Commons thus retain the power of pardon in their own hands, and this right they
                    have in several cases expressly claimed by resolution, declaring that it is not
                    parliamentary for their lordships to give judgment “until the same be first
                    demanded by this House.” An impeachment, unlike other parliamentary proceedings,
                    is not interrupted by prorogation, nor even by dissolution. Proceedings in the
                    House of Commons preliminary to an impeachment are subject to the ordinary
                    rules, and in the Warren Hastings case an Act was passed to prevent the
                    preliminary proceedings from discontinuance by prorogation and dissolution. A
                    royal pardon cannot be pleaded in bar of an impeachment. The point was raised in
                    the case of the earl of Danby in 1679, and the rule was finally settled by the
                    Act of Settlement. Persons found guilty on impeachment may be reprieved or
                    pardoned like other convicts. Impeachment will lie against all kinds of crimes
                    and misdemeanours, and against offenders of all ranks. In the case of Simon de
                    Beresford, tried before the House of Lords 4 Edward III., the House declared
                    “that the judgment be not drawn into example or consequence in time to come,
                    whereby the said peers may be charged hereafter to judge others than their
                    peers,” from which Blackstone and others have inferred that “a commoner cannot
                    be impeached before the Lords for any capital offence, but only for high
                    misdemeanours.” In the case of Fitzharris in 1681, the House of Commons in
                    answer to a resolution of the Lords suspending the impeachment, declared it to
                    be their undoubted right “to impeach any peer or commoner for treason or any
                    other crime or misdemeanour.” And the House of Lords has in practice recognized
                    the right of the Commons to impeach whomsoever they will. The procedure has,
                    however, been reserved for great political offenders whom the ordinary powers of
                    the law might fail to reach. It has now fallen into desuetude. The last
                    impeachments were those of Warren Hastings (1788-95) and Lord Melville (1805),
                    but an unsuccessful attempt was made by Mr Anstey to impeach Lord Palmerston in
                    1848. The earliest recorded instances of impeachment are those of Lord Latimer
                    in 1376, and of Pole, earl of Suffolk, in 1386. From the time of Edward IV. to
                    Elizabeth it fell into disuse, “partly,” <pb break="no"

                        xml:id="kp-eb0912-0737-0718"/> says Hallam, “from the loss of that control
                    which the Commons had obtained under Richard II. and the Lancastrian kings, and
                    partly from the preference the Tudor princes had given to bills of attainder or
                    pains and penalties when they wished to turn the arm of parliament against an
                    obnoxious subject.” Revived in the reign of James I., it became an instrument of
                    parliamentary resistance to the crown, and it was not unfrequently resorted to
                    in the first three reigns after the Revolution.</p>
                <p>In the constitution of the United States the procedure of impeachment is an
                    almost exact copy of that described above. The House of Representatives are the
                    accusers, and appoint managers to conduct the prosecution at the bar of the
                    senate. The vote of the senate is taken by putting the question separately to
                    each member, and a majority of two-thirds is required for a conviction. In the
                    separate States it partakes of the same quasi-political character — neither the
                    prosecutors nor the judges being the same as in ordinary criminal offences. The
                    most noted instances of impeachment in the United States are those of Associate
                    Justice Chase in 1804, of President Andrew Johnson in 1868, and of Judge
                    Barnard, New York, in 1872. The object of impeachment is the removal of public
                    officers for mdversation in office, which is followed sometimes by
                    disqualification for any future appointment.</p>
