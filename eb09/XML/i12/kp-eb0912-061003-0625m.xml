                    Nubia, before he entered his twenty-fifth year. In an expedition which he led in
                    1816 against the Wahhâbees of Arabia, the young general was seriously hampered
                    by the want of organized discipline among his troops, and on his triumphant
                    return to Cairo in 1819 he eagerly availed himself of the services of some
                    French officers in his efforts to convert the Oriental turbulence of his forces
                    into the disciplined steadiness of the West. Ibrahim’s next campaign was in
                    Greece, whither he was ordered in August 1824 to support the Turkish sultan’s
                    attempts to restrain the risings of Hellenic nationality. The defeat of the
                    Turkish and Egyptian fleet at Navarino (October 20, 1827) by the united English,
                    French, and Russian squadrons was the signal for Ibrahim’s recall from the
                    Morea, which had suffered keenly at the hands of the cruel Oriental. In Egypt he
                    at once set himself afresh to the work of reorganization in army and navy, and
                    in 1831, when Mehemet Ali ordered an almost unprovoked invasion of Syria,
                    Ibrahim was again at the head of the Egyptian army. Unchecked by the loss of
                    5000 men from cholera before leaving Egypt, he appeared suddenly on the Syrian
                    coast, took Gaza, Jaffa, and Kaiffa by surprise, and by the 29th of November had
                    invested Acre. There he met with a stubborn resistance; twice in vain he
                    attempted to carry the seaport by storm, and in the midst of the siege he was
                    called away, to meet an army of relief, commanded by ’Osmân Pasha, governor of
                    Aleppo. Near Tripoli he surprised ’Osmân, who decamped without fighting, and
                    returning hastily to Acre, he threw his whole force on the place, carrying it
                    (27th May 1832) with a loss of 1400 men. Without a pause he marched on Damascus,
                    which offered no resistance. At Hirns (July 28) he encountered and defeated a
                    Turkish army of 30,000 men, with a force of 16,000, and passing swiftly through
                    the defiles of Beylân, overtook and completely routed the retreating enemy at
                    Adaneh. Another victory followed at Oulou-Kislâk, and then, near Konieh, Ibrahim
                    was met by the vizier Resheed Pasha at the head of 60,000 men. Favoured by a
                    murky day—an advantage which helped to counterbalance the great disparity of his
                    forces—he contrived to throw the Turkish army into confusion, and, by the
                    capture of the vizier, converted an impending disaster into the most brilliant
                    of his victories. Meantime his fleet, equally successful, had chased that of the
                    sultan back to the Bosphorus, and the victor, without an army to oppose him, was
                    within six marches of Constantinople. At the critical moment the order came from
                    Mehemet Ali to await reinforcements. But before these arrived the golden
                    opportunity was lost. The Russian army and fleet advanced to the protection of
                    the Ottoman capital; the other Western powers combined in the effort to effect
                    peace; and by treaty in February 1833 Syria and Adana were handed over to
                    Mehemet on the condition of his paying tribute for them. As governor, Ibrahim
                    reduced the new territory to order, and gave a strong impulse to industrial
                    enterprise. But war again broke out in 1839, and at Nezeeb (24th June) Ibrahim
                    dealt a second deadly blow to the Turkish power. Again the commands of Mehemet
                    forbade him to follow up his success, and the campaign, cut short by the
                    interference of the British, ended in the restoration of Syria to the Porte in
                    1841. After his retreat from Damascus, achieved with martial skill, although
                    accompanied with serious losses, Ibrahim laid down his sword. Retiring to his
                    estates in the plain of Heliopolis, he occupied himself in establishing cotton
                    and olive plantations, till in 1844 he was called to succeed his father as
                    viceroy. He died at Cairo, 9th November 1848, only a few months after the formal
                    confirmation of his rank of viceroy. The finest qualities of a great commander
                    were his, who out of semi-barbarous hordes fashioned a formidable army, and
                    twice by his individual prowess threatened the overthrow of the Ottoman empire.
                    His cruelty, the one blot on his valour, may be regarded as an accident of his
                    life rather than as a fixed trait in his character. In times of peace, at least,
                    he displayed the sagacity as well as the firmness of an enlightened
                    administrator. See <hi rend="smallcaps">Egypt,</hi> vol. vii. p. 764.</p>
