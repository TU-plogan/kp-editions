                    is Illyricum. The term Illyria is occasionally used in both languages, and has
                    become the recognized name in English. The boundaries of the country thus known
                    varied very much at different periods, and can be described only along with its
                    history. For a short time, in the 4th and 3d centuries <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >b.c.,</hi> there was some slight government under monarchs whose power was
                    acknowledged by the whole country; but in general the land was either a province
                    of some conquering race or the abode of isolated tribes with little or no common
                    feelings or aims.</p>
                <p>The origin and character of its oldest inhabitants are involved in the obscurity
                    that still shrouds the ethnology and early history of all south-eastern Europe.
                    The Greeks acknowledged some affinity of race between themselves and the
                    Illyrians in the legend that Cadmus retired from Thebes with his wife Harmonia
                    and settled in Illyria, where he became the father of Illyrius, the eponymous
                    ancestor of the whole race. In harmony with this myth, the general consensus of
                    modern investigation tends to the view that at an early period the whole of
                    Europe south of the Danube, together with the centre and west of Asia Minor,
                    were peopled by kindred races, some of whose names are preserved to us as
                    Leleges, Thracians, Pelasgi, Illyrians, <hi rend="subscript"> t</hi> fcc. If we
                    divide the Indo-European tribes that peopled Europe into two great families, the
                    northern and the southern, we shall find that the Thraco-Illyrian tribes must be
                    distinguished from the Slavonic tribes who dwelt immediately north of them, and
                    who are closely akin to the Lithuanian and other tribes of the northern family.
                    On the other hand, it would not be easy to draw any line of demarcation at this
                    early time between the Illyrians and their neighbours on the west, south, and
                    east. Separation of nationalities was produced afterwards by growing
                    civilization, which developed distinct national characters and well-defined
                    countries.</p>
                <p>At this early period then we may say that the Danube, as the boundary between the
                    northern and the southern family, was the limit of the Illyrian tribes towards
                    the north. In other directions they shaded off into kindred tribes of similar
                    manners and language. Various causes led to a very unequal development of
                    civilization among these tribes. Intercourse with stranger races like the
                    Phoenicians, and amalgamation with kindred immigrant races, such as the Ionians
                    and Dorians, raised some of these tribes rapidly to the highest stage of
                    civilization. But these new races were attracted by the more favourable
                    conditions of the Greek peninsula, and few of them found their way to the
                    northern countries. Some traces of early Ionian settlers in Illyria are found
                    (see Curtius, <hi rend="italic">Die</hi><hi rend="italic">Ionier vor der
                    ionischen Wanderung,</hi> p. 46); but they do not seem to have permanently
                    affected the character of the natives. As Greece became civilized, it sent forth
                    its own colonists to occupy most of the favourable sites along the Mediterranean
                    coasts. But, whereas Thrace with its rich mines had a line of Hellenic colonies
                    along its southern shore, very few were planted in Illyria. According to Strabo,
                    the shore was full of fine harbours, and the coast land was very fertile; but he
                    adds that the people were barbarous and warlike. Ou this account it was that
                    Greek colonization never spread on the Illyrian coast. Dyrrachium or Epidamnus
                    was almost the only Greek colony, and its history for centuries showed one
                    continuous conflict with the barbarous natives, which prevented its growth.
                    Macedonia again found a family of Greek refugees who established themselves as
                    petty chiefs, and gradually spread their power, with civilization and settled
                    rule, over the whole country. Nothing of the kind happened to Illyria; the
                    chiefs who rose at times to power were always apparently as barbarous as their
                    followers. In these unpropitious circumstances, the Illyrian tribes remained in
                    their primitive barbarous condition later than almost any of their neighbours,
                    and when many of the surrounding states had become civilized, Illyria was
                    divided from them by the line separating barbarism from civilization. Naturally
                    their characteristics resembled closely those of the ruder Thracian tribes, and
                    both are described by the Greek historians as tattooing their bodies and
                    offering human victims to their gods. Their women seem to have had a high
                    position socially, and to have even exercised political power. Queens are
                    mentioned more than once as their rulers. This reminds us of the German tribes,
                    whose women also were much respected; and we know that among the Greeks women
                    were much freer and more respected in the older time before Oriental influence
                    had affected native customs. It is said that chastity was not held in much
                    account by the women of Illyria; but it must be remembered that people whose
                    women are kept more secluded are very apt to ascribe such a character to the
                    freer life of other races.</p>
                <p>The Illyrians are said by Herodotus (ix. 43) to have attacked the temple of
                    Delphi. Brasidas with his small army of Spartans was assaulted by them on his
                    adventurous march (424 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi>) across Thessaly and
                    Macedonia to attack the Athenian colonies in Thrace. The earlier history of the
                    Macedonian kings is one constant struggle against the Illyrian tribes. The
                    migrations of the Gauls at the beginning of the 4th century disturbed the
                    country between the Danube and the Adriatic. The Scordisci and other Gallic
                    tribes settled there, and forced the Illyrians towards the south. The
                    necessities of defence seem to have united the Illyrians under a chief Bardylis
                    (about 383 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.)</hi> and his son Clitus. Bardylis nearly
                    succeeded in destroying the rising kingdom of Macedonia; King Amyntas was
                    defeated, and a few years later Perdiccas was defeated and slain. But the great
                    Philip crushed them completely, and annexed part of their country. During the
                    next century we hear of them as pirates. Issuing from the secluded harbours of
                    the coast, they ravaged the shores of Italy and Greece, and preyed on the
                    commerce of the Adriatic. The Greeks applied to Rome for help. Hellenism had
                    proved too weak to civilize the northern races; it was left to the stronger
                    organization of Rome to absorb them. Teuta, the Illyrian queen, at first scorned
                    the Roman demands for redress, and even murdered the <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit12newyrich/page/n729/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0912-0729-0710"/> ambassadors; but the two Illyrian wars (229 and
                    219 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi>) ended in the submission of the Illyrians, a
                    considerable part of their frontier being annexed by the conquerors. In 168 B.C.
                    Gentius, the Illyrian king, provoked the third Illyrian war, the result of which
                    was the annexation of the whole country by the Romans. Frequent rebellions
                    occurred, but at last the natives accepted the Roman civilization. During the
                    empire, the country was one of the best recruiting grounds for the Roman
                    legions; and in troubled times many Illyrian soldiers fought their way up from
                    the ranks to the imperial purple. Claudius, Aurelian, Probus, Diocletian, and
                    Maximian were all sons of Illyrian peasants.</p>
                <p>In the time of the republic Illyricum comprised the country between the
                    Liburnians, a kindred race, on the north and Epirus on the south. Under the
                    empire the importance of the country made its name spread over all the
                    surrounding districts. In the 2d century after Christ, the Illyricus Limes
                    included Noricum, Pannonia, Moesia, Dacia, and Thrace. Constantine added Greece,
                    Epirus, and Macedonia, taking from it Thrace and part of Moesia, and made it one
                    of the four divisions of the Roman empire governed by a “praefectus praetorio.”
                    When the empire was divided, Illyricum was halved. Illyris Barbara or Romana,
                    including Noricum, Pannonia, &amp;c., was annexed to the Western empire; while
                    Illyris Graeca, including Macedonia, Epirus, and Greece, formed part of the
                    Eastern empire. The Via Egnatia, the great line of road which connected Rome
                    with Constantinople and the East, led across Illyricum from Dyrrachium to
                    Thessalonica.</p>
                <p>In the wreck of the Roman empire Illyria suffered severely. In the 4th century
                    the Goths ravaged it repeatedly, but these, the most civilized of the barbarian
                    invaders of Rome, with their warlike aristocracy, passed on, and were succeeded
                    by wilder tribes. Slavs, as also Huns and other nomadic races from the East, in
                    succession devastated the country. An agricultural population could no longer
                    maintain itself, and all the elements of civilization disappeared. Justinian
                    (527-565) tried in vain to defend the country by a series of forts; his armies
                    were defeated time after time, and at last he allowed the Huns to make
                    settlements south of the Danube. Rome gave up the defence of civilization
                    against the inroads of barbarism, and bribed the barbarians to be quiet. Still
                    the Via Egnatia was defended, as the artery of communication and the highway of
                    commerce between Constantinople and the west. The open country, however, even
                    south of the great road, was abandoned to the Slavs and Huns. The older
                    Illyrians partly united with these races, partly went farther south, encroaching
                    on the Greek people, and the name of one of their tribes, Albani, is preserved
                    in the modern name of their descendants, the Albanians.</p>
                <p>Heraclius (610-641 <hi rend="smallcaps">a.d.)</hi> settled Slavonic peoples all
                    along the coast of Illyria as far south as Dyrrachium. The states which were
                    thus created were of great importance in the Dark Ages. The republic of Narenta
                    vied for a time with that of Venice; and the commerce of Ragusa was so rich that
                    it has given its name to all wealthy merchant vessels or “argosies.” The name of
                    Illyria had by this time disappeared from history; and the country was now
                    divided between these powerful merchant cities and the states of Bosnia,
                    Croatia, Servia, Rascia, and Dalmatia. In literature the name was preserved, and
                    the scene of Shakespeare’s comedy <hi rend="italic">Twelfth Night</hi> is laid
                    in Illyria. Politically the name was revived in the beginning of this century,
                    when the small kingdom of Illyria to the north of the Adriatic was constituted
                    at the peace of Vienna, 1809. In 1849 the territorial distribution of the
                    Austrian empire was remodelled, and Illyria again disappeared. (w. Μ. RA.)</p>
