                    from the south of Dorsetshire through Somerset and Leicester to the Yorkshire
                    coast. They are found in rocks of similar age in France and Germany; and Sir
                    Edward Belcher obtained remains of a Liassic ichthyosaur from an island in 77°
                    16' N. lat.,—one of many proofs that in Mesozoic times a comparatively warm
                    climate must have prevailed within the Arctic Circle. Remains of true
                    ichthyosaurs have not yet been found on the American continent, although
                    Professor Marsh lately (1877) described portions of the skeleton of a saurian
                    obtained from strata of Jurassic age in the Rocky Mountains which seems to have
                    differed from Old World ichthyosaurs chiefly in the absence of teeth, the jaws
                    being “entirely edentulous and destitute even of a dentary groove.” For the
                    reception of this form Professor Marsh proposes to institute a new order— <hi
                    rend="italic">Sauranodonta;</hi> but it has been suggested, on the other hand,
                    that <hi rend="italic">Saurαηοdoη</hi> should rather be regarded as the type of
                    a new family of the old order <hi rend="italic">Ichthyopterygia.</hi></p>
                <p>Owing to the comparative abundance and excellent preservation of
                    ichthy.&gt;saurian remains, the hard parts of those creatures have been studied
                    under exceptionally favourable circumstances, and much has thus been learnt of
                    their structure and, by inference therefrom, of their life history. They were
                    large marine reptiles, measuring in some instances 30 feet in length, and
                    somewhat resembling in appearance the dolphins of the present day. Like these
                    they were air-breathers, and must therefore have come to the surface to breathe,
                    although being coldblooded they were no doubt able, like the aquatic saurians of
                    our own period, to remain much longer under water than the warm-blooded <hi
                    rend="italic">Cetacea.</hi> The ichthyosaurian head was large, and was prolonged
                    into a more or less elongated snout, certain species rivalling in this re pect
                    the gavial of the Ganges. The brain cavity, on the other hand, was remarkably
                    small. The eyes were enormously large, the orbit in <hi rend="italic"
                    >Ichthyosaurusplatyodon—</hi> the largest known species —having been found to
                    measure 14 inches in long diameter. This huge eyeball was protected by a ring of
                    bony sclerotic plates similar to those found in rapacious birds and in turtles
                    and lizards of the present day. The jaws, which in <hi rend="italic"
                    >Ichthyosaurus platyodon</hi> have been known to measure 6 feet in length, were
                    rendered still more formidable by their array of strong, conical, pointed teeth,
                    numbering in some instances over one hundred and eighty, and placed not in
                    distinct sockets, as in the crocodile, but in a common alveolar groove. These,
                    as they became worn, were replaced by a succession of young teeth, which budded
                    up at the base of the old. The neck in the ichthyosaurus was extremely short,
                    and not marked by any constriction. The vertebrae resembled those of fishes in
                    being deeply biconcave. The tail was long and tapering; in many specimens this
                    organ has been found to be fractured at about a fourth of its length from the
                    extremity, and, as the vertebrae of the same region seem to have been flattened
                    vertically, Professor Owen regards it as probable that these reptiles were
                    provided with a tegumentary caudal fin like that of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Cetacea,</hi> only vertical instead of horizontal; the sole evidence of the
                    presence of such a horizontal fin in extinct whales would be the horizontally
                    flattened condition of the last caudal vertebrae, should any of these chance to
                    be preserved. Ichthyosaurians were provided with two pairs of limbs in the form
                    of paddles, which externally must have borne considerable resemblance to the
                    anterior limbs of dolphins and other <hi rend="italic">Cetacea.</hi> They
                    differed, however, very markedly from these in the possession of a bony
                    apparatus, stretching, in the case of the front pair, from one shoulder joint to
                    the other, on which the anterior paddles were supported. This “scapular arch,”
                    according to Professor Owen, resembled, “in the number, shape, and disposition
                    of its bones,” the same parts in the Australian <hi rend="italic"
                    >Orwithorhynchus,</hi> a mammal which leads, as <hi rend="italic"
                    >Ichthyosaurus</hi> did, an aquatic life, obtaining its food at the bottom of
                    lakes and rivers, but having to rise frequently to the surface to breathe. The
                    hind limbs were in almost all the species much smaller than the pair in front.
                    The skeleton of each of the paddles consisted mainly of a large number —in some
                    species exceeding a hundred—of small polygonal bones arranged in more than five
                    closely packed longitudinal rows, the whole covered with skin, and forming a
                    highly elastic organ of locomotion. The ichthyosaur was provided with slender
                    ribs along the vertebral column from the anterior part of the neck to the tail;
                    a sternum, however, was wanting, the abdominal walls being strengthened by the
                    development of transverse arcuated bones. As no trace of horny scales or bony
                    scutes has ever been detected in connexion with those reptilian remains, it may
                    be assumed that these sea-saurians, as they have been called, were, like the <hi
                    rend="italic">Cetacea</hi> of the present day, covered with a smooth or wrinkled
                    skin unprovided with any of those dermal appendages.</p>
                <p>From a study of their bony structure it may be inferred that these huge aquatic
                    reptiles inhabited the open sea, occasionally visiting the shores, where their
                    powerful paddles enabled them to crawl on land, and where, like seals, they
                    probably loved to bask in the sunshine. That they were predatory in their
                    habits—the tyrants indeed of Mesozoic seas—might be inftr.ed from our knowledge
                    of their jaws and teeth; and this is amply confirmed by an examination of the
                    half-digested contents of their stomachs.</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit12newyrich/page/n713/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0912-0713-0696"/>
                <p>Their food seems to have consisted chiefly of ganoid fishes and the smaller
                    reptiles, and as the vertebrae and other remains of young ichthyosaurs have
                    occasionally been found mixed with these, there is reason to believe that they,
                    like many other marine animals, did not hesitate to devour the weaker members of
                    their own species. In several instances tolerably complete skeletons of small
                    ichthyosaurs have thus been found enclosed within the ribs of larger individuals
                    of the same species, and their occurrence gave rise to the evidently erroneous
                    conjecture that those reptiles might have been viviparous. The fact that the
                    entombed specimens have in almost every case been found with the head turned
                    towards the tail of the enclosing animal was supposed to favour this view; the
                    discovery, however, of additional specimens may at any time deprive this
                    argument of the little value it has, and recently Professor Merian described a
                    specimen from the Upper Lias of Würtemberg in which the included ichthyosaur lay
                    with its head towards that of the enveloping specimen. The nature of their food
                    is indicated, not only by the occurrence, in what from its position must have
                    been the stomach, of the half-digested remains of fishes and reptiles, but also
                    by the presence of similar relics, and especially of the scales of fishes, in
                    their faeces. The coprolites of the ichthyosaurians are oval bodies measuring
                    usually from 2 to 4 inches in length, and exhibiting on their surface the
                    impression of the spirally convoluted internal surface of the intestine. These
                    coprolites consist chiefly of phosphate of lime, and occur in great abundance in
                    certain Liassic beds, where, says Buckland, they look “like potatoes scattered
                    on the ground.”</p>
                <p>The species of the genus <hi rend="italic">Ichthyosaurus</hi> differ from each
                    other chiefly in the proportion of certain parts of the body and of the teeth.
                    Professor Huxley has divided them into two groups :—(1) those which have
                    relatively short snouts and short paddles, with four carpalia, including therein
                    such forms as <hi rend="italic">I.</hi><hi rend="italic">intermedius</hi> and
                    <hi rend="italic">I. communis,</hi> the latter remarkable as having its anterior
                    paddles three times the length of the pair behind; and (2) those with longer
                    snouts, long paddles, and three carpalia, including such forms as <hi
                    rend="italic">I. longirostris</hi> and <hi rend="italic">I, tenuirostris,</hi>
                    which in the length of their snouts rival the gavial of the Ganges, and <hi
                    rend="italic">I. platyodon,</hi> in which the fore and hind limbs are of equal
                    length.</p>
