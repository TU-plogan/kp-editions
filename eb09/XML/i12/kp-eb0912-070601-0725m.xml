                    which they claimed. Among these may be mentioned that of the Spanish
                    “Alombrados” or “Alumbrados,” which arose about the year 1520, and which before
                    its final disappearance about a century later afforded numerous victims to the
                    Inquisition, especially at Cordova. Ignatius Loyola, while a student at
                    Salamanca (1527), was tried by an ecclesiastical com mission for alleged
                    sympathy with its views, but was acquitted with an admonition. Under the name of
                    Illuminés a similar sect appeared in Picardy in 1623, and afterwards entered
                    into close relations with the Guérinets or followers of Pierre Guérin; but by
                    its antinomianism it soon provoked repressive measures, to which it finally
                    succumbed in 1635. The history of another sect of Illuminés, which appeared in
                    the south of France about 1722, is very obscure, but it is said to have
                    subsisted until 1794. The title of Illuminati has often been popularly bestowed
                    also on Rosicrucians, Martinists, and Swedenborgians; but one of the most recent
                    as well as most important applications of this elastic word has been to denote a
                    secret society, or semi-political semi-religious order, which made some stir in
                    Germany, especially in the southern and Catholic portions of it, from 1776 to
                    1784. It was founded on May 1, 1776, by Adam Weishaupt, professor of canon law
                    at Ingolstadt, and an ex-Jesuit, and set before it as its general purpose the
                    discouragement of tyranny, superstition, and ignorance, and the furtherance of
                    the cause of reason, freedom, and virtue. The name originally assumed for the
                    order was the Society of the Perfectibilists (Gesellschaft der
                    Perfectibilisten). Politically its tendencies were republican, and in religion
                    it was free-thinking, having a distinct aversion to Christian ritual and
                    Christian dogmas alike. The entire subserviency of its members (who on admission
                    were pledged to blind obedience to the orders of their superiors) was secured by
                    a strict system of secret confessions and monthly reports, checked by mutual
                    espionage. Beginning with a narrow circle of disciples carefully chosen from
                    among his own students, Weishaupt gradually extended his propaganda from
                    Ingolstadt to Eichstädt, Freising, Munich, and elsewhere, special attention
                    being given to the enlistment of young men of wealth, rank, and social
                    importance. As the order increased in numbers its organization naturally became
                    more complicated, and was ultimately considerably influenced by the intimate
                    relations which were established with masonic lodges at Munich and Freising in
                    1780. About the same time an important impulse was given to its prosperity in
                    middle and northern Germany by the ambition and energy of a newly acquired
                    member, Baron Adolf von Knigge, who had his headquarters at
                    Frankfort-on-the-Main. It was to him that the society was indebted for the
                    extremely elaborate constitution (never, however, actually realized) according
                    to which the entire membership was divided into three great classes, in the
                    first of which were to be included the “novices,” the “minervals,” and the
                    “lesser illuminati,” while the second consisted of “freemasons” (“ordinary,”
                    “Scotch,” and “Scotch knights”), and the third or “mystery class” was subdivided
                    into the two grades of priests and regents and of magus and king. Each member of
                    the order had given him a special name, generally classical, by which alone he
                    was referred to in official communications; all correspondence was conducted in
                    cipher; to increase the mystification, towns and provinces were invested with
                    new and altogether arbitrary designations. At its period of greatest development
                    the order included in its operations a very wide area, extending from Italy to
                    Denmark, and from Warsaw to Paris; at no time, however, do its numbers appear to
                    have exceeded two thousand. Its aims and method, which, as plainly appears in
                    portions of Goethe’s <hi rend="italic">Wilhelm Heister,</hi> were somewhat in
                    accordance with the taste of the period, met with more or less sympathy and

                    greatly accelerated the public expression of a counter feeling of suspicion and
                    dislike which had been slowly gathering strength, and in 1785 the Bavarian
                    Government issued an edict which proved fatal to the order. Many of its members
                    were imprisoned or compelled to leave their homes; Weishaupt himself was
                    deprived of his chair and banished the kingdom.</p>
