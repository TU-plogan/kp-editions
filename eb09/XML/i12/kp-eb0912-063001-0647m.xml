                    <hi rend="italic">λογοs,</hi> doctrine or treatise.</p></note> is that branch of
                    zoology which treats of the internal and external structure of fishes, their
                    mode of life, and their distribution in space and time. According to the views
                    generally adopted at present, all those Vertebrate animals are referred to the
                    class of Fishes which combine the following characteristics:—they live in water,
                    and by means of gills or branchiae breathe air dissolved in water; the heart
                    consists of a single ventricle and single atrium; the limbs, if present, are
                    modified into fins, supplemented by unpaired median fins; and the skin is either
                    naked, or covered with scales or with osseous plates or bucklers. With few
                    exceptions fishes are oviparous. There are, however, as we shall see hereafter,
                    not .a few members of this class which show a modification of one or more of
                    these characteristics, and which, nevertheless, cannot be separated from it. The
                    distinction between the class of Fishes and that of Batrachians is very slight
                    indeed.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">History and Literature.</hi></p>
                <p>The commencement of the history of ichthyology coincides with that of zoology
                    generally. Aristotle (384-322 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi>) had a perfect
                    knowledge of the general structure of fishes, which he clearly discriminates
                    both from the aquatic animals with lungs and mammae, <hi rend="italic"
                    >i.e.,</hi> Cetaceans, and from the various groups of aquatic invertebrates.
                    According to him, “the special characteristics of the true fishes consist in the
                    branchiae and fins, the majority having four fins, but those of an elongate
                    form, as the eels, having two only. Some, as the <hi rend="italic">Huraena,</hi>
                    lack the fins altogether. The rays swim with their whole body, which is spread
                    out. The branchiae are sometimes furnished with an operculum, sometimes they are
                    without one, as in the cartilaginous fishes. . . . No fish has hairs or
                    feathers; most are covered with scales, but some have only a rough or a smooth
                    skin. The tongue is hard, often toothed, and sometimes so much adherent that it
                    seems to be wanting. The eyes have no lids, nor are any ears or nostrils
                    visible, for what takes the place of nostrils is a blind cavity; nevertheless
                    they have the senses of tasting, smelling, and hearing. All have blood. All
                    scaly fishes are oviparous, but the cartilaginous fishes (with the exception of
                    the sea-devil, which Aristotle places along with themj are viviparous. All have
                    a heart, liver, and gall-bladder; but kidneys and urinary bladder are absent.
                    They vary much in the structure of their intestines: for, whilst the mullet has
                    a fleshy stomach like a bird, others have no stomachic dilatation. Pyloric caeca
                    are close to the stomach, and vary in number; there are even some, like the
                    majority of the cartilaginous fishes, which have none whatever. Two bodies are
                    situated along the spine, which have the function of testicles; they open
                    towards the vent, and are much enlarged in the spawning season. The scales
                    become harder with age. Not being provided with lungs, fishes have no voice, but
                    several can emit grunting sounds. They sleep like other animals. In most cases
                    the females exceed the males in size; and in the rays and sharks the male is
                    distinguished by an appendage on each side of the vent.”</p>
                <p>Aristotle’s information on the habits of fishes, their migrations, mode and time
                    of propagation, and economic uses, is, so far as it has been tested,
                    surprisingly correct. Unfortunately, we too often lack the means of recognizing
                    the species of which he gives a description. His ideas of specific distinction
                    were as vague as those of the fishermen whose nomenclature he adopted; it never
                    occurred to him that vernacular names are subject to change, or may be entirely
                    lost in course of time, and the difficulty of identifying his species is further
                    increased by the circumstance that sometimes several popular names are applied
                    by him to the same fish, or different stages of growth are designated by
                    distinct names. The number of fishes known to Aristotle seems to have been about
                    one hundred and fifteen, all of which are inhabitants of the Aegean Sea.</p>
                <p>That one man should have discovered so many truths, and laid so sure a basis for
                    future progress in zoology, is less surprising than the fact that for about
                    eighteen centuries a science which seemed to offer particular attractions to men
                    gifted with power of observation was no farther advanced. Yet such is the case.
                    Aristotle’s disciples, as well as his successors, remained satisfied to be his
                    copiers or commentators, and to collect fabulous stories or vague notions. With
                    very few exceptions (such as Ausonius, who wrote a small poem, in which he
                    describes from his own observations the fishes of the Moselle) authors entirely
                    abstained from original research; and it was not until about the middle of the
                    16 th century that ichthyology made a new step in advance by the appearance of
                    Belon, Rondelet, and Salviani, who almost simultaneously published their great
                    works, by which the idea of species was established definitely and for all
                    time.</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit12newyrich/page/n648/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0912-0648-0631"/>
                <p>P. Belou travelled in the countries bordering on the eastern part of the
                    Mediterranean, in the years 1547-50; he collected rich stores of positive
                    knowledge, which he embodied in several works. The one most important for the
                    progress of ichthyology is that entitled <hi rend="italic">De</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">aquatilibus libri</hi><hi rend="italic">duo,</hi> Paris, 1553.
                    Belon knows about one hundred and ten fishes, of which he gives rude but
                    generally recognizable figures. In his descriptions he pays regard to the
                    classical as well as to the vernacular nomenclature, and states the outward
                    characteristics, sometimes even to the number of fin rays; frequently also he
                    gives the most conspicuous anatomical peculiarities. Although Belon but rarely
                    gives definitions of the terms used by him, it is not generally very difficult
                    to ascertain the limits which he intended to assign to each division of aquatic
                    animals. He very properly divides them into such as are provided with blood and
                    those without it,—two divisions corresponding in modern language to vertebrate
                    and invertebrate aquatic animals. The former are classified by him according to
                    size, the further subdivisions being based on the structure of the skeleton,
                    mode of propagation, number of limbs, form of the body, and physical character
                    of the habitat.</p>
                <p>The work of the Roman ichthyologist, H. Salviani (1514-72), bears evidence of the
                    high social position which the author held as physician to three popes. Its
                    title is <hi rend="italic">Aquatilium animalium</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >histoma,</hi> Rome, 1554-57, fol. It treats exclusively of the fishes of Italy.
                    Ninety-two species are figured on seventy-six plates, which, as regards artistic
                    execution, are masterpieces of that period, although those specific
                    characteristics which nowadays constitute the value of a zoological drawing were
                    entirely overlooked by the author or artist. No attempt is made at a natural
                    classification, but the allied forms are generally placed in close proximity.
                    The descriptions are quite equal to those given by Belon, entering much into the
                    details of the economy and uses of the several species, and were evidently
                    composed with the view of collecting in a readable form all that might prove of
                    interest to the class of society in which the author moved. Salviani’s work is
                    of a high order, very .remarkable considering the age in which he lived. It
                    could not fail to convey valuable instruction, and to render ichthyology popular
                    in the country to the fauna of which it was devoted, but it was not fitted to
                    advance ichthyology as a science generally; in this respect Salviani is not to
                    be compared with Rondelet or Belon.</p>
                <p>G. Rondelet (1507-57) had the great advantage over Belon of having received a
                    medical education at Paris, and especially of having gone through a complete
                    course of instruction in anatomy as a pupil of Guentherus of Andernach. This is
                    conspicuous throughout his works— <hi rend="italic">Libri</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >de</hi><hi rend="italic">piscibus marinis,</hi> Lyons, 1554; and <hi
                    rend="italic">Universes</hi><hi rend="italic">aquatilium historice</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">pars altera,</hi> Lyons, 1555. Nevertheless they cannot be
                    regarded as more than considerably enlarged editions of Belon’s work. For,
                    although he worked independently of the latter, and differs from him in numerous
                    details, of which he had a much more extensive knowledge, the system adopted by
                    him is characterized by the same absence of the true principles of
                    classification. His work is almost entirely limited to European and chiefly to
                    Mediterranean forms, and comprises no less than one hundred and ninety-seven
                    marine and forty-seven freshwater fishes. His descriptions are more complete and
                    his figures much more accurate than those of Belon; and the specific account is
                    preceded by introductory chapters, in which he treats in a general manner of the
                    distinctions, the external and internal parts, and the economy of fishes. Like
                    Belon, he had no conception of the various categories of
                    classification—confounding, for instance, throughout his work the terms
                    “genus’’and “species”; but he had an intuitive notion of what his successors
                    called a “species,” and his principal object was to collect and give as much
                    information as possible regarding such species.</p>
                <p>For nearly a century the works of Belon and Rondelet continued to be the standard
                    works on ichthyology; but the science did not remain stationary during that
                    period. The attention of naturalists was now directed to the fauna of-foreign
                    countries, especially of the Spanish and Dutch possessions in the New World; and
                    in Europe the establishment of anatomical schools and academies led to careful
                    investigation of the internal anatomy of the most remarkable European forms.
                    Limited as these efforts were as to their scope, being restricted either to the
                    fauna of some particular district or to the dissection of a single species, they
                    were sufficiently numerous to enlarge the views of naturalists, and to destroy
                    that fatal dependence on preceding authorities which had continued to keep in
                    bonds the minds of such men even as Rondelet and Belon. The most noteworthy of
                    those engaged in these inquiries in tropical countries were W. Piso and G.
                    Margrav, who accompanied as physicians the Dutch governor, Prince Maurice of
                    Nassau, to Brazil (1637-44).</p>
                <p>Of the men who left records of their anatomical researches, we may mention
                    Borelli (1608-79), who wrote a work <hi rend="italic">De</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >motu animalium,</hi> Rome, 1680, 4to, in which he explained the mechanism of
                    swimming and the function of the air-bladder; Μ. Malpighi (1628-94), who
                    examined the optic nerve of the sword-fish; the celebrated J. Swammerdam
                    (1637-80), who described the intestines of numerous fishes; and J. Duverney
                    (1648-1730), who investigated in detail the organs of respiration.</p>
                <p>A new era in the history of ichthyology commences with Ray, Willughby, and
                    Artedi, who were the first to recognize the true principles by which the natural
                    affinities of animals should be determined. Their labours stand in so intimate a
                    connexion with each other that they represent but one great step in the progress
                    of this science.</p>
                <p>J. Ray (1628-1705) was the friend and guide of F. Willughby (1635-72). They found
                    that a thorough reform in the method of treating the vegetable and animal
                    kingdoms had become necessary; that the only way of bringing order into the
                    existing chaos was by arranging the various forms according to their structure;
                    that they must cease to be burdened with inapplicable passages and quotations
                    from ancient writers, and to perpetuate the vague and erroneous notions of their
                    predecessors. They therefore substituted facts for speculation, and one of the
                    first results of this change, perhaps the most important, was that, having
                    recognized “species” as such, they defined the term, and fixed it as the
                    starting point of all sound zoological knowledge.</p>
                <p>Although they had divided their work so that Ray attended to the plants
                    principally, and Willughby to the animals, the <hi rend="italic">Historia
                    piscium,</hi> Oxf., 1686, which bears Willughby’s name on the title page, and
                    was edited by Ray, is clearly their joint production. A great part of the
                    observations contained in it were collected during the journeys they made
                    together in Great Britain and in the various countries of Europe; and it is no
                    exaggeration to say that at that time these two Englishmen knew the fishes of
                    the Continent, and especially those of Germany, better than any native
                    zoologist.</p>
                <p>By the definition of fishes as animals with blood, breathing by gills, provided
                    with a single ventricle of the heart, and either covered with scales or naked,
                    the Cetaceans are excluded. The fishes proper are arranged primarily according
                    to the cartilaginous or the osseous nature of the skeleton, and then subdivided
                    according to the general form of the body, the presence or the absence of
                    ventral fins, the soft or the spinous structure of the dorsal rays, the number
                    of dorsal fins, &amp;c. No fewer than four <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit12newyrich/page/n649/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0912-0649-0632"/> hundred and twenty species are thus arranged and
                    described, of which about one hundred and eighty were known to the authors from
                    personal examination,—a comparatively small proportion, but descriptions and
                    figures still formed in great measure the substitute for our modern collections
                    and museums. With the increasing accumulation of forms, the want of a fixed
                    nomenclature had become more and more felt.</p>
                <p>Peter Artedi would have been a great ichthyologist if Ray or Willughby had not
                    preceded him. But he was fully conscious of the fact that both had prepared the
                    way for him, and therefore he did not fail to reap every possible advantage from
                    their labours. Born in 1705 in Sweden, he studied with Linnaeus at Upsala; from
                    an early period he devoted himself entirely to the study of fishes, and was
                    engaged in the arrangement and description of the collection of Seba, a wealthy
                    Dutchman who had formed what was perhaps the richest museum at that time, when
                    he was accidentally drowned in one of the canals of Amsterdam in the year 1734,
                    at the age of twenty-nine. His manuscripts were fortunately secured by an
                    Englishman, Count Clifford, and edited by his early friend Linnaeus. The work is
                    divided into the following parts</p>
                <p>(1) In the <hi rend="italic">Bibliotheca</hi><hi rend="italic">Ichthyologien</hi>
                    Artedi gives a very complete list of all preceding authors who had written on
                    fishes, with a critical analysis of theiι <hi rend="superscript"> ,</hi> works.
                    (2) The <hi rend="italic">Philosophia</hi><hi rend="italic">Ichthyologien</hi>
                    is devoted to a description of the external and internal parts of fishes; Artedi
                    fixes a precise terminology for all the various modifications of the organs,
                    distinguishing between those characters which determine a genus and such as
                    indicate a species or merely a variety; in fact he establishes the method and
                    principles which subsequently have guided every systematic ichthyologist. (3)
                    The <hi rend="italic">Genera</hi><hi rend="italic">Piscium</hi> contains
                    well-defined diagnoses of forty-five genera, for which he has fixed an
                    unchangeable nomenclature. (4) In the <hi rend="italic">Species</hi><hi

                <p>Artedi has been justly called the Father of Ichthyology. So admirable was his
                    treatment of the subject, that even Linnaeiis could only modify and add to it.
                    Indeed, so far as. ichthyology is concerned, Linnaeus has scarcely done anything
                    beyond applying binominal terms to the species properly described and classified
                    by Artedi. His classification of the genera appears in the 12th edition of the

                <p>Two contemporaries of Linnaeus, L. T. Gronow and J. T. Klein, attempted a
                    systematic arrangement of fishes; both had considerable advantages for the
                    study, especially in possessing extensive collections; but neither exercised any
                    influence on the progress of ichthyology.</p>
                <p>The works of Artedi and Linnaeus led to an activity of research, especially in
                    Scandinavia, Holland, Germany, and England, such as has never been equalled in
                    the history of biological science. Whilst some of the pupils and followers of
                    Linnaeus devoted themselves to the examination and study of the fauna of their
                    native countries, others proceeded on voyages of discovery to foreign and
                    distant lands. Of these latter the following may be especially mentioned :—O.
                    Fabricius worked out the fauna of Greenland; Kalm collected in North America,
                    Hasselquist in Egypt and Palestine, Brünn ich in the Mediterranean, Osbeck in
                    Java and China, Thunberg in Japan; Forskâl examined and described the fishes of
                    the Red Sea; Steller, Pallas, S. T. Gmelin, and Güldenstedt traversed nearly the
                    whole of the Russian empire in Europe and Asia. Others attached themselves as
                    naturalists to the celebrated circumnavigators of the last century, such as the
                    two Forsters (father and son) and Solander, who accompanied Cook; Commerson, who
                    travelled with Bougainville; and Sonnerat. Numbers of new and remarkable forms
                    were discovered by those men, and the foundation was laid for a knowledge of the
                    geographical distribution of animals.</p>
                <p>Of those who studied the fishes of their native countries, the most celebrated
                    were Pennant (Great Britain), O. F. Müller (Denmark), Duhamel (France),
                    Meidinger (Austria), Cornide (Spain), and Parra (Cuba).</p>
                <p>The mass of materials brought together by those and other zoologists was so great
                    that, not long after the death of Linnaeus, the necessity made itself felt for
                    collecting them in a compendious form. Several compilers undertook this task;
                    they embodied the recent discoveries in new editions of the classical works of
                    Artedi and Linnaeus, but, not possessing either a knowledge of the subject or
                    any critical discernment, they only succeeded in burying those noble monuments
                    under a chaotic mass of rubbish. For ichthyology it was fortunate that two men
                    at least, Bloch and Lacépède, made it a subject of prolonged original
                    research.</p>
                <p>Mark Eliezer Bloch (1723-1799), a physician of Berlin, had reached the age of
                    fifty-six when he commenced to write on ichthyological subjects. To begin at his
                    time of life a work in which he intended not only to give full descriptions of
                    the species known to him from specimens or drawings, but also to illustrate each
                    species in a style truly magnificent for his time, was an undertaking the
                    execution of which most men would have despaired of. Yet he accomplished not
                    only this task, but even more than he at first contemplated.</p>
                <p>His work consists of two divisions :—(1) <hi rend="italic">Oeconomische</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Naturgeschichte der Fische Deutschlands,</hi> Berl., 1782-84; (2)
                    <hi rend="italic">Naturgeschichte der ausländischen Fische,</hi> Bert, 1785- 95.
                    The first division, which is devoted to a description of the fishes of Germany,
                    is entirely original, and based upon the author’s own observations. His
                    descriptions as well as figures were made from nature, and are, with but few
                    exceptions, still serviceable; indeed many continue to be the best existing in
                    literature. Bloch was less fortunate, and is much less reliable, in his natural
                    history of foreign fishes. For many of the species he had to trust to more or
                    less incorrect drawings and descriptions by travellers; frequently, also, he was
                    deceived as to the origin of specimens which he acquired by purchase. Hence his
                    accounts contain numerous confusing errors, which it would have been difficult
                    to correct had not nearly the whole of the materials on which his work is based
                    been preserved in the collections at Berlin.</p>
                <p>After the completion of his great work Bloch occupied himself with systematizing.
                    He prepared a general system of fishes, in which he arranged not only those
                    described in his great work, but also those with which he had afterwards become
                    acquainted from the descriptions of others. The work was ably edited and
                    published after Bloch’s death by a philologist, J. G. Schneider, under the title
                    <hi rend="italic">Μ. E. Βlochii</hi><hi rend="italic">Systema</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">ichthyologioe</hi><hi rend="italic">iconibus</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >CX.</hi><hi rend="italic">illustratum,</hi> Berl., 1801. The number of species
                    enumerated in it amounts to 1519. The system is based upon the number of the
                    fins, the various orders being termed <hi rend="italic">Hende-</hi><pb

                    &amp;c. We need not add that an artificial method like this led to the most
                    unnatural combinations and distinctions.</p>
                <p>Bloch’s <hi rend="italic">Naturgeschichte</hi> remained for many years the
                    standard work, and, with its great number of excellent illustrations, proved a
                    most useful guide to the student. But as regards originality of thought Bloch
                    was far surpassed by his contemporary, B. G. E. de Lacépède, born at Agen, in
                    France, in 1756, a man of great and general erudition, who became professor at
                    the museum of natural history in Paris, where he died in 1826.</p>
                <p>Lacépède had to contend with great difficulties in the preparation of his <hi
                    rend="italic">Histoire</hi><hi rend="italic">des Poissons,</hi> Paris,
                    1798-1803, 5 vols., which was written during the most disturbed period of the
                    French Revolution. A great part of it was composed whilst the author was
                    separated from collections and books, and had to rely on his notes and
                    manuscripts only. Even the works of Bloch and other contemporaneous authors
                    remained unknown, or at least inaccessible, to him for a long time. We need not
                    therefore be surprised that his work abounds in the kind of errors into which a
                    compiler is liable to fall. Not only does the same species appear under two or
                    more distinct specific names, but it sometimes happens that the author so little
                    understands the source from which he derives his information that the
                    description is referred to one genus and the accompanying figure to another. The
                    names of genera are unduly multiplied; and the figures with which the work is
                    illustrated are far inferior to those of Bloch. Thus the influence of Lacépède
                    on the progress of ichthyology was vastly less than that of his fellow-labourer;
                    and the labour laid on his successors in correcting the numerous errors into
                    which he had fallen probably outweighed the assistance which they derived from
                    his work.</p>
                <p>The work of the principal cultivators of ichthyology in the period between Ray
                    and Lacépède was chiefly systematizing and describing; but the internal
                    organization of fishes also received attention from more than one great anat
                    &gt;mist. Haller, Camper, and Hunter examined the nervous system and the organs
                    of sense; and above all Alexander Monro, <hi rend="italic">secundus,</hi>
                    published a classical work, <hi rend="italic">The Structure and Physiology of
                    Fishes explained and compared with those of Man and other Animals,</hi> Edin.,
                    1785. The electric organs of fishes <hi rend="italic">{Torpedo</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">Gymnotus)</hi> were examined by Réaumur, Allamand, Bancroft,
                    Walsh, and still more exactly by J. Hunter. The mystery of the propagation of
                    the eel called forth a large number of essays, and even the artificial
                    propagation of <hi rend="italic">Salmonid</hi><hi rend="italic">oe</hi> was
                    known and practised by Gleditsch (1764).</p>
                <p>Bloch and Lacépède’s works were almost immediately succeeded by the labours of
                    Cuvier, but his early publications were of necessity tentative, preliminary, and
                    fragmentary, so that some little time elapsed before the spirit infused into
                    ichthyology by this great anatomist could exercise its influence on all the
                    workers in this field. Several of such ante-Cuvierian works must be mentioned on
                    account of their importance to our knowledge of certain faunas. The <hi
                    rend="italic">Descriptions and Figures of Two Hundred Fishes collected at
                    Vizagapatam on the Coast of Coromandel,</hi> Lond., 1803, 2 vυls., by Patrick
                    Russel, and <hi rend="italic">An Account of the Fishes found in the Fiver Ganges
                    and its Branches,</hi> Edin., 1822, 2 vols., by F. Hamilton (formerly Buchanan),
                    were works distinguished by greater accuracy of the drawings (especially the
                    latter) than was ever attained before. A <hi rend="italic">Natural History of
                    British Fishes</hi> was published by E. Donovan, Lυnd., 1802-8; and the
                    Mediterranean fauna formed the study of the lifetime of A. Risso <hi
                    rend="italic">{Ichthyologie</hi><hi rend="italic">de Nice,</hi> Paris, 1810; and

                    rend="italic">Europe</hi><hi rend="italic">Méridionale,</hi> Paris, 1827). A
                    slight beginning in the description of the fishes of the United States was made
                    by S. L. Mitchell, who published, besides various papers, a <hi rend="italic"
                    >Memoir on the Ichthyology of New York,</hi> in 1815.</p>
                <p>G. Cuvier (1769-1832) did not occupy himself with the ( study of fishes merely
                    because the class formed part of the <hi rend="italic">Fegne Animal,</hi> but
                    devoted himself to it with particular predilection. The investigation ot their
                    anatomy, and especially of their skeleton, was taken up by him at an early
                    period, and continued until he had succeeded in completing so perfect a
                    framework of the system of the whole class that his immediate successors
                    required only to fill up those details for which their master had had no
                    leisure. Indefatigable in examining all the external and internal characters of
                    the fishes in a rich collection, he ascertained the natural affinities of the
                    infinite variety of forms, and accurately defined the divisions, orders,
                    families, and genera of the class, as they appear in the various editions of the
                    <hi rend="italic">Fègne</hi><hi rend="italic">Animal.</hi> His industry equalled
                    his genius: he formed connexions with almost every’accessible part of the globe;
                    not only French travellers and naturalists, but also Germans, Englishmen,
                    Americans, rivalled one another in assisting him with collections; and for many
                    years the museum of the Jardin des Plantes was the centre where all
                    ichthyological treasures were deposited. Thus Cuvier brought together a
                    collection the like of which had never been seen before, and which, as it
                    contains all the materials on which his labours were based, must still be
                    considered as the most important. Soon after the year 1820, Cuvier, assisted by
                    one of his pupils, A. Valenciennes, commenced his great work on fishes, <hi
                    rend="italic">Histoire naturelle des</hi><hi rend="italic">Poissons,</hi> of
                    which the first volume appeared in 1828. The earlier volumes, in which Cuvieτ
                    himself took his share, bear evidence of the enthusiasm with which both authors
                    devoted themselves to their task. After Cuvier’s death in 1832, the work was
                    left entirely in the hands of Valenciennes, whose energy and interest gradually
                    slackened, rising to their former pitch in some parts only, as, for instance, in
                    the treatise on the herring. He left the work unfinished with the twenty-second
                    volume (1848), which treats of the Salmonoids. Yet, incomplete as it is, it is
                    indispensable to the student.</p>
                <p>The system finally adopted by Cuvier is the following :—</p>

                <p>We have only to compare this system with that of Linnaeus if we wish to measure
                    the gigantic stride made by ichthyology during the intervening period of seventy
                    years. The various characters employed for classification have been examined
                    throughout the whole class, and their relative importance has been duly weighed
                    and understood. Though Linnaeus had formed a category of “Amphibia Nantes” for
                    fishes with a cartilaginous skeleton, which should coincide with Cuvier’s
                    “Poissons Cartilagineux,” <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit12newyrich/page/n651/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0912-0651-0634"/> he had failed to understand the very nature of
                    cartilage, apparently comprising under this term any skeletal framework of less
                    firmness than ordinary bone. Hence he considered <hi rend="italic">Lophius,
                    Cyclopterus, Syngnathus</hi> to be cartilaginous fishes. Adopting the position
                    and development of the ventral fins as a highly important character, he had been
                    obliged to associate fishes having rudimentary and inconspicuous ventral fins,
                    like <hi rend="italic">Trichiurus,</hi><hi rend="italic">Xiphias,</hi> &amp;c.,
                    with the true eels. The important category of “family” appears now in Cuvier’s
                    system fully established as intermediate between genus and order. Important
                    changes in Cuvier’s system have been made and proposed by his successors, but in
                    the main it is still that of the present day.</p>
                <p>Cuvier had extended his researches beyond the living forms, into the field of
                    palaeontology; he was the first to observe the close resemblance of the scales
                    of the fossil <hi rend="italic">Palaeoniscus</hi> to those of the living <hi
                    rend="italic">Polypterus</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Lepidosteus,</hi> the
                    prolongation and identity of structure of the upper caudal lobe in <hi
                    rend="italic">Palaeoniscus</hi> and the sturgeons, the presence of peculiar
                    “fulcra” on the anterior margin of the dorsal fin in <hi rend="italic"
                    >Palaeoniscus</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Lepidosteus,</hi> and inferred from
                    these facts that the fossil genus was allied either to the sturgeons or to <hi
                    rend="italic">Lepidosteus.</hi> But it did not occur to him that there was a
                    close relationship between those recent fishes. <hi rend="italic"
                    >Lepidosteus</hi> and, with it, the fossil genus remained in his system a member
                    of the order of <hi rend="italic">Halacopterygii</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >abdominales.</hi></p>
                <p>It was left to L. Agassiz (1807-73) to point out the importance of the structure
                    of the scales as a characteristic, and to open a path towards the knowledge of a
                    whole new subclass of fishes, the <hi rend="italic">Ganoidei.</hi></p>
                <p>Impressed with the fact that the peculiar scales of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Polypterus</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Lepidosteus</hi> are common to all fossil
                    osseous fishes down to the Chalk, he takes the structure of the scales generally
                    as the base for an ichthyological system, and distinguishes four orders :—</p>
                <p>1. <hi rend="italic">Ρlαcοids.—</hi> Without scales proper, but with scales of
                    enamel, sometimes large, sometimes small, ami reduced to mere points (Rays,
                    Sharks, and Cyclostomi, with the· fossil Hybodontes). <hi rend="italic">2.
                    Ganoids.</hi> —With angular bony scales, covered with a thick stratum of enamel:
                    to this order belong the fossil Lepidoides, Sauroides, Pycnodontes, and
                    Coelacanthi; the recent Polypterus, Lepidosteus, Sclerodermi, Gymnodontes,
                    Lophobranches, and Siluroιdes; also the Sturgeons. 3. <hi rend="italic"
                    >Glenoids.—</hi> With rough scales, which have their free margins denticulated:
                    Chaetodontidae, Pleuronectidae, Percidae, Polyacantlιi, Sciaenidae, Sparidae,
                    Scorpaenidae, Aulostomi. 4. <hi rend="italic">Cycloids.</hi> —With smooth
                    scales, the hind margin of which lacks denticulation: Labridae, Mugilidae,
                    Seombridae, Gadoidei, Gobiidae, Muraenidae, Lucioidei, Salmonidae, Clupeidae,
                    Cyprinidae.</p>
                <p>We have no hesitation in affirming that if Agassiz had had an opportunity of
                    acquiring a more extensive and intimate knowledge of existing fishes before his
                    energies were absorbed in the study of fossil remains, he would himself have
                    recognized the artificial character of his classification. The distinctions
                    between cycloid and ctenoid scales, between placoid and ganoid fishes, are
                    vague, and can hardly be maintained. So far as the living and post-Cretacean
                    forms are concerned, he abandoned the vantageground gained by Cuvier; and
                    therefore his system could never supersede that of his predecessor, and finally
                    shared the fate of every classification based on the modifications of one organ
                    only. But Agassiz has the merit of having opened an immense new field of
                    research by his study of the infinite variety of fossil forms. In his principal
                    work, <hi rend="italic">Recherches sur les Poissons fossiles,</hi> Neuchâtel,
                    1833- 43, 4to, atlas in fol., he placed them before the world arranged in a
                    methodical manner, with excellent descriptions and illustrations. His power of
                    discernment and penetration in determining even the most fragmentary remains is
                    truly astonishing; and, if his order of Ganoids is an assemblage of forms very
                    different from what is now understood by that term, he was at any rate the first
                    who recognized that such an order of fishes exists.</p>
                <p>The discoverer of the <hi rend="italic">Ganoidei</hi> was succeeded by their
                    explorer, Johannes Müller (1801-58). In his classical memoir <hi rend="italic"
                    >Geber den Bau und</hi><hi rend="italic">die</hi><hi rend="italic">Grenzen
                    der</hi><hi rend="italic">Gaηoideη,</hi> Berl., 1846, he showed that the Ganoids
                    differ from all the other osseous fishes, and agree with the Plagiostomes, in
                    the structure of the heart. By this primary character, all heterogeneous
                    elements as Siluroids, <hi rend="italic">Osteoglossidae,</hi> Ac., were
                    eliminated from the order as understood by Agassiz. On the other hand, he did
                    not recognize the affinity of <hi rend="italic">Lepidosiren</hi> to the Ganoids,
                    but established for it a distinct subclass, <hi rend="italic">Dipnoi,</hi> which
                    he placed at the opposite end of the system. By his researches into the anatomy
                    of the lampreys and <hi rend="italic">Amphioxus,</hi> their typical distinctness
                    from other cartilaginous fishes was proved; they became the types of two other
                    subclasses, <hi rend="italic">Cyclostomi</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >Leplocardii.</hi></p>
                <p>Müller proposed several other not unimportant modifications of the Cuvierian
                    system; and, although all cannot be maintained as the most natural arrangements,
                    yet his researches have given us a much more complete knowledge of the
                    organization of the Teleosteous fishes, and later inquiries have shown that, on
                    the whole, the combinations proposed by him require only some further
                    modification and another definition to render them perfectly natural</p>
                <p>The discovery (in the year 1871) of a living representative of a genus hitherto
                    believed to be long extinct, <hi rend="italic">Ceratodus,</hi> threw a new light
                    on the affinities of fishes. The writer of the present article, who had the good
                    fortune to examine this fish, was enabled to show that, on the one hand, it was
                    a form most closely allied to <hi rend="italic">Lepidosiren,</hi> and, on the
                    other, that it could not be separated from the Ganoid fishes, and therefore that
                    <hi rend="italic">Lepidosiren</hi> also was a Ganoid,—a relation already
                    indicated by Huxley in a previous paper on “Devonian Fishes.” This discovery led
                    to further consideration<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"

                    system which is followed in the present article.</p>
                <p>Having followed the development of the ichthyological system down to the most
                    recent date, v&gt;c have to retrace our steps to enumerate the most important
                    contributions to ichthyology which appeared contemporaneously with or
                    subsequently to the publication of the great work of Cuvier and Valenciennes. As
                    in other branches of zoology, almost every year was marked by increased
                    activity. F or the sake of convenience we may arrange these works under three

                    described them in extremely numerous papers, published chiefly in the journals
                    of the Batavian Society. Soon after his return to Europe (1860) Bleeker

                <p>The number of authors who have investigated the anatomy of fisħes is almost as
                    great as that of faunists; and we should go beyond the limits of the present
                    article if we mentioned more than the most prominent ami successful. Μ. H.
                    Rathke, J. Müller, J. Hyrtl, and H. Stannius left scarcely any organ unexamined,
                    and their researches had a direct bearing either on the relation of the class of
                    fishes to the other vertebrates, or on the systematic arrangement of the fishes
                    themselves. E. E. von Baer, F. de Filippi, C. Vogt, W. His, W. K. Parker, and F.
                    Μ. Balfour investigated their embryology; A. Kolliker and G. Pouchet their
                    histology. The osteology was specially treated by G. Bakker, F. C. Rosenthal, L.
                    Agassiz, and C. Gegenbaur; the nervous system by Gottsche, Philipeaux, Stannius,
                    L. de Sanctis, L. Stieda, Baudelot, and Miclucho-Maclay; the organ of hearing by
                    E. H. Weber, C. Hasse, and G. Retzius. The electric fishes were examined by E.
                    Geoffroy, C Matteuci, P. Pacini, T. Bilharz, and Max Schultze. The development
                    and metamorphosis of the lamperns was made the subject of research by H.
                    Millier, Μ. Schultze, and P. Owsjannikow; Müller’s examination of <hi

                    Stieda, W. Müller, C, Hasse, T. H. Huxley, and F. Μ. Balfour. The most
                    comprehensive accounts of the anatomy of fishes are contained in the subjoined
                    works, which have been chiefly followed in the following anatomical description

                <p>It has been mentioned above that the great work of Cuvier and Valenciennes had
                    been left incomplete. Several authors, therefore, have supplied detailed
                    Recounts of the orders omitted in that work. Müller and Henle published an
                    account of the Plagiostomes, and Kaup of the <hi rend="italic">Muraenidoe</hi>
                    and <hi rend="italic">Lophobranchii;</hi> while A. Duméril commenced an <hi

                    >Ichthyologie</hi><hi rend="italic">générale,</hi> of which, however, only two
                    volumes appeared, containing a complete account of the Plagiostomes (Paris,
                    1865) and of the Ganoids and Lophobranchs (Paris, 1870).</p>
                <p>The activity which had prevailed in ichthyology since the publication of the <hi
                    rend="italic">Histoire naturelle</hi> by Cuvier and Valenciennes had been so
                    great, and the results of the numerous investigations were scattered over such a
                    multitude of publications, that it ultimately became imperative to collect all
                    these materials in one comprehensive work. This was done in the <hi
                    rend="italic">Catalogue of Fishes,</hi> published by the trustees of the British
                    Museum, in eight volumes (Lond., 1859.-70). Besides the species previously
                    described, many new forms were added, the total number of species referred to in
                    those volumes amounting to 8525. As regards the systematic arrangement,
                    Müller’s. system was adopted in the main, but the definition of the families was
                    much modified. This, however, need not be further entered on now, as it will
                    become sufficiently apparent in the systematic portion of this article.</p>
                <p>For fuller details than can be given here regarding the structure,
                    classification, and life-history of fishes, the reader is referred to the <hi
                    rend="italic">Introduction to the Study of Fishes,</hi> by A. Günther, Edin.,
                    1880.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">External Parts.</hi></p>
                <p>In the body of a fish tour parts are distinguished,—the head, trunk, tail, and
                    fins; the boundary between the first and second is generally indicated by the
                    gill-opening, and that between the second and third by the vent. The form of the
                    body and the relative proportions of these principal parts are subject to
                    greater variation than is to be found in any other class of vertebrates. In
                    fishes which are endowed with the power of steady and more or less rapid
                    locomotion, a deviation from that form of body which we observe in a perch,
                    carp, or mackerel is never excessive. The body is a simple, equally-formed
                    wedge, compressed or slightly rounded, well fitted for cleaving the water. In
                    fishes which are in the habit of moving on the bottom, the whole body, or at
                    least the head, is vertically depressed and flattened; and the latter may be so
                    enormously enlarged that the trunk and tail appear merely as an appendage. In
                    one family of fishes, the <hi rend="italic">Pleuronectιdce</hi> or flat-fishes,
                    the body is compressed into a thin disk; they swim and move on one side only,
                    which remains constantly directed towards the bottom, a peculiarity by which the
                    symmetry of all parts of the body has been affected. In fishes moving
                    comparatively slowly through the water, and able to remain (as it were)
                    suspended in it, a lateral compression of the body, in conjunction with a
                    lengthening of the vertical and a shortening of the longitudinal <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit12newyrich/page/n653/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0912-0653-0636"/> axis, is found. This deviation from the typical
                    form may proceed so far that the vertical axis greatly exceeds the longitudinal
                    in length; generally all the parts of the body participate in this form, but in
                    one kind of fish (the <hi rend="italic">Crtha-goriscus</hi> or sun-fish) it is
                    chiefly the tail that has been shortened, that being reduced so much as to
                    present the appearance of being cut off. An excessive lengthening of the
                    longitudinal axis, with a shortening of the vertical, occurs in eels and
                    eel-like fishes, and in the so-called band-fishes. They are bottom-fish, capable
                    of insinuating themselves into narrow crevices and holes. The form of the body
                    in these long fishes is either cylindrical (snake-like), as in the eels and many
                    codfishes, or strongly compressed, as in the band-fishes <hi rend="italic"
                    >{Trichiurus, Regalecus,</hi> &amp;c.). It is chiefly the tail that is
                    lengthened, but frequently the head and trunk participate more or less in this
                    form. Every possible variation occurs between these and other principal types of
                    form. The old ichthyologists, even down to Linnaeus, depended in great measure
                    on them for classification; but, although the same form of body often obtains in
                    the same groups of fishes, similarity of form by no means indicates natural
                    affinity; it only indicates similarity of habits and mode of life.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">The External Parts of the Head.—</hi> The eye divides the head
                    into the ante-orbital and post-orbital portions. In most fishes, especially in
                    those with a compressed head, it is situated on the side and in the anterior
                    half of the length of the head; in many others, chiefly those with a depressed
                    head, it is directed upwards, and sometimes situated quite at the upper side; in
                    a very few, the eyes look obliquely downwards. In the flat-fishes both eyes are
                    on the same side of the head, either the right or the left, always on that which
                    is directed towards the light, and coloured.</p>
                <p>Fishes in general, as compared with other Vertebrata, have large eyes. Sometimes
                    these organs are enormously enlarged, indicating either that the fish is
                    nocturnal in its habits, or lives at a depth to which only a part of the sun’s
                    rays penetrate. On the other hand, small eyes occur in fishes inhabiting muddy
                    places, or great depths, to which scarcely any light descends, or in fishes in
                    which the want of an organ of sight is compensated by the development of other
                    organs of sense. In a few fishes, more particularly those inhabiting caves or
                    the greatest depths of the ocean, the eyes have become quite rudimentary and
                    hidden under the skin.</p>
                <p>In the ante-orbit ιl portion of the .head, or the Snout, are situated the mouth
                    and nostrils.</p>
                <p>The mouth is formed by the intermaxillary and maxillary bones or the
                    intermaxillary only in the upper jaw, and by the mandibular bane in the lower.
                    These bones are either bare or covered by integument, to which frequently labial
                    folds or lips are added. As regards form, the mouth offers as many variations as
                    the body itself, according to the nature of the food, and the mode of feeding.
                    It may be narrow, or extremely wide and cleft nearly to the hind margin of the
                    head; it may be semi-elliptical, semicircular, or straight in a transverse line;
                    it may be quite in front of the snout (anterior), on its upper surface
                    (superior), on its lower (inferior), or extending along each side (lateral);
                    sometimes it is subcircular, organized for sucking. The jaws of some fishes are
                    modified into a special weapon of attack (sword-fish, saw-fish); in fact,
                    throughout the whole class of fishes the jaws are the only organ ever
                    specialized for this purpose, weapons on other parts of the body being purely
                    defensive.</p>
                <p>Both jaws may be provided with skinny appendages, barbels, which, if developed
                    and movable, are sensitive organs of touch.</p>
                <p>In the majority of fishes the nostrils exhibit a double opening on each side of
                    the upper surface of the snout, the openings of each side being more or less
                    close together. They lead into a shallow groove, and only in one family (the
                    Myxinoids) perforate the palate. In this family, as well as in the lampreys, the
                    nasal aperture is single. In many eels the openings are lateral, the lower
                    perforating; the upper lip. In the sharks and rays (figs. 2, 3, 4) they are at
                    the lower surface of the snout, and more or less confluent. And, finally, in the
                    Dipnoi (fig. 35) and other Ganoids, one at least is within the labial boundary
                    of the mouth.</p>
                <p>The space across the forehead, between the orbits, is called the interorbital
                    space; that below the orbits, the infraorbital or suborbital region.</p>
                <p>In the postorbital part of the head there are distinguished, at least in most
                    Teleosteous fishes and many Ganoids, the praeoperculum, a sub-semicircular bone,
                    generally with a free and often serrated or variously-armed margin; the
                    operculum, forming the posterior margin of the gill-opening; and the
                    suboperculum and interoperculum along its inferior margin. All these bones,
                    collectively called opercula, form the gill-cover, a thin bony lamella covering
                    the cavity containing the gills.</p>
                <p>The gill-opening is a foramen, or slit, behind or below the head, by which the
                    water that has been taken up through the mouth for the purpose of breathing is
                    again expelled. This slit may extend from the upper end of the operculum all
                    round the side of the head to the symphysis of the lower jaw; or it maybe
                    shortened and finally reduced to a small opening on any part of the margin of
                    the gill-cover. Sometimes <hi rend="italic">(Symδrαnchus)</hi> the two openings,
                    thus reduced, coalesce, and form what externally appears as a single opening
                    only. The margin of the gillcover is provided with a cutaneous fringe, in order
                    more effectually to close the gill-opening; and this fringe is supported by one
                    or several or many bony rays, the branchiostegals. The space on the chest
                    between the two rami of the lower jaw and between the gill-openings is called
                    the isthmus.</p>
                <p>The sharks and rays differ from the Teleosteous and Ganoid fishes in having five
                    branchial slits (six or seven in <hi rend="italic">Hexanchus</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">Heptanchus),</hi> which are lateral in the sharks, and at the·

                    each side {fig. 1), as in the lampreys.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">The Trunk and Tail.—</hi> In the trunk are distinguished the
                    back, sides, and abdomen. It gradually passes in all fishes into the tail, the
                    termination of the abdominal cavity and the commencement of the tail being
                    generally indicated by the position of the vent. The exceptions are numerous:
                    not only may certain abdominal organs, such as the sexual, extend to between the
                    muscles of the tail, but the intestinal tract itself may pass far backwards, or
                    it may even be reflected forwards, so that the position of the vent may be
                    either close to the extremity of the tail or to the foremost part of the
                    trunk.</p>
                <p>In many fishes the greater part of the tail is surrounded by fins, leaving
                    finless only a small portion between the dorsal, caudal, and anal fins; this
                    finless part is called the free portion or the peduncle of the tail.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">The Pins.</hi> —The fins are divided into vertical or unpaired,
                    and horizontal or paired fins. Any of them may be present'or absent; and their
                    position, number, and form are most important guides in determining the
                    affinities of fishes.</p>
                <p>The vertical fins are situated in the median dorsal line, from the head to the
                    extremity of the tail, and in the ventral line of the tail. In fishes in which
                    they are least developed or most embryonic, the vertical fin appears as a simple
                    fold of the skin surrounding the extremity of the tail. In its further progress
                    of developιħent in the series of fishes, it gradually extends further forwards,
                    and it may reach even the head and the vent. In this embryonic condition the fin
                    is generally supported by fine »ays, which are the continuations of, or
                    articulated to, other stronger rays supported by the processes or apophyses of
                    the vertebral column. This form of the vertical fin is very common,—for instance
                    in the eels, and many Gadoid, Blennioid, and Ganoid fishes, in which the rays
                    have ceased, besides, to be simple rods, showing more or less numerous joints
                    (simple articulated rays, fig. 5). Branched rays are dichotomously split, the
                    joints increasing in number towards the extremity.</p>
                <p>The continuity of the vertical fin, however, is interrupted in the majority of
                    fishes, and three fins are then distinguished: one in the dorsal line—the dorsal
                    fin; one in the ventral line behind the anus—the anal fin; and one confined to
                    the extremity of the tail—the caudal fin.</p>
                <p>The caudal fin is rarely symmetrical so that the upper half is equal to the
                    lower; the greatest degree of asymmetry obtains in fishes with a heterocercal
                    termination of the vertebral column. In fishes in which it is nearly symmetrical
                    it is frequently prolonged into an upper and lower lobe, its hind margin being
                    concave or more or less deeply excised; in others the hind margin is rounded,
                    and, when the middle rays greatly exceed in length the outer ones, the fin
                    assumes a pointed form.</p>
                <p>Many and systematically important differences are observed in the dorsal fin,
                    which is either spiny-rayed (spinous) <hi rend="italic">(Acaηthopterygiaη),</hi>
                    or soft-rayed <hi rend="italic">{Mαlαcopterygiαn).</hi> In the former, a smaller
                    or greater number of the rays are simple and without transverse joints; they may
                    be flexible, or so much osseous matter is deposited in them that they appear
                    hard and truly spinous (fig. 7); these spines form-always the anterior portion
                    of the fin, which is either detached from or continuous with the remaining
                    jointed rays. The spines can be erected or depressed at the will of the fish; if
                    in the depressed position the spines cover one another completely, their points
                    lying in the same line, the fish is called homacanth; but if the spines are
                    asymmetrical, alternately broader on one side than on the other, the fish is
                    called heteracanth. The spinous division, as well as the one consisting of
                    jointed rays, may again be subdivided. In the Malacopterygian type all the <pb
                    break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit12newyrich/page/n655/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0912-0655-0638"/> rays remain jointed; indeed, sometimes the
                    foremost ray, with its preceding short supports, is likewise ossified, and is a
                    hard spine, but the articulations can nearly always be distinctly traced.
                    Sometimes the dorsal fin of Malacopterygian fishes is very long, extending from
                    the head to the end of the tail; sometimes it is reduced to a few rays only; and
                    in a few cases it is entirely absent. In addition to the rayed dorsal fin, many
                    Malacopterygian fishes (as the Salmonoids, many Siluroids, Scopeloids, &amp;c.)
                    have another of greater or lesser extent, without any rays; and as fat is always
                    deposited within this fold, it is called a fatty fin <hi rend="italic"
                    >(pinna</hi><hi rend="italic">adiposa)</hi> (figs. 8 and 9).</p>
                <p>The anal fin is built on the same plan as the dorsal; it may be single, or there
                    may be more than one; it may also be long or short, or entirely absent; in
                    Acanthopterygians its foremost rays are frequently simple and spinous.</p>
                <p>The horizontal or paired fins consist of two pairs, the pectorals and
                    ventrals.</p>
                <p>The pectoral fins (with their osseous supports) are the homologues of the
                    anterior limbs of the higher Vertebrata. They are always inserted immediately
                    behind the gill opening,—either symmetrical, with a rounded posterior margin, or
                    asymmetrical, with the upper rays longest and strongest; in Malacopterygians
                    with a dorsal spine the upper pectoral ray is frequently developed into a
                    similar defensive weapon.</p>
                <p>The ventral fins are the homologues of the hind-limbs, and are inserted on the
                    abdominal surface, either behind the pectorals <hi rend="italic">(Pisces</hi> or
                    <hi rend="italic">Pinnoe</hi><hi rend="italic">abdominales')</hi> (fig. 9), or

                    >figulares)</hi> (fig. 11). They are generally narrow, and composed of a small
                    number of rays, the outer of which is frequently osseous.</p>
                <p>For the definition of the smaller systematic groups, and the determination of
                    species, the numbers of the spines and rays are generally of the greatest
                    importance. This holds good especially for the ventral rays, by the number of
                    which the Acanthopterygian affinities of a fish can nearly always be determined.
                    The numbers of the dorsal and anal rays generally correspond to the number of
                    vertebrae in a certain portion of the spinous column, and are therefore constant
                    specific, generic, or even family characters; but when their number is very
                    great, a proportionally wide margin must be allowed for variation, and the
                    taxonomic value of this character becomes uncertain. The numbers of the pectoral
                    and caudal rays are rarely of any account.</p>
                <p>The fins are organs of motion, but it is chiefly the tail and the caudal fin by
                    which the fish impels itself forward. To execute energetic locomotion, the tail
                    and caudal fin are strongly bent with rapidity, alternately towards the right
                    and left; whilst a gentle motion forwards is effected by a simple undulating
                    action of the caudal fin, the lobes of which act like the blades of a screw.
                    Retrograde motions can be made by fishes in an imperfect manner only, by forward
                    strokes of the pectoral fins. When the fish wants to turn towards the left, he
                    gives a stroke of the tail towards the right, the right pectoral acting
                    simultaneously, whilst the left remains pressed close to the body. Thus the
                    pectoral fins assist in the progressive motions of the fish, but rather by
                    directing its course than by acting as powerful propellers. The chief function
                    of the paired fins is to maintain the balance of the fish in the water, which is
                    always most unsteady where there is no weight to sink it: when the pectoral of
                    one side, or the pectoral and ventral of the same side, are removed, the fish
                    loses its balance and falls on the side opposite; when both pectorals are
                    removed, the fish’s head sinks; on removal of the dorsal and anal fins the
                    motion of the fish assumes a zigzag course; deprived of all fins, it floats like
                    a dead fish, with the belly upwards, the back being the heavier part of the
                    body.</p>
                <p>In numerous groups of fishes which live in mud, or are able to pass a longer or
                    shorter time in soil periodically dried and hardened during the hot season,
                    forms occur entirely devoid of, or with only rudimentary, ventral fins <hi
                    rend="italic">(Cyprinodon,</hi><hi rend="italic">Ophiocephalidoe, Galaxiidoe,
                    Siluridoe).</hi> The chief function of these fins being to balance the body of
                    the fish whilst swimming, it is evident that in fishes moving during a great
                    part of their life over swampy ground, or through more or less consistent mud,
                    this function of the ventral fins ceases, and nature can readily dispense with
                    these organs altogether.</p>
                <p>In certain fishes the shape and function of the fins are considerably modified:
                    thus, in the rays, locomotion is almost entirely effected and regulated by the
                    broad and expanded pectoral fins acting with an undulatory motion of their
                    margins, similar to the undulations of the long vertical fins of the flat
                    fishes; in many blennies the ventral fins are adapted for walking on the
                    sea-bottom; in some Gobioids <hi rend="italic">(Periophthal-</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">mus),</hi> Trigloids, Scorpaenioids, and <hi rend="italic"
                    >Pediculati</hi> the pectoral fins are perfect organs of walking; in the gobies,

                    ventral fins are transformed into an adhesive disk (see fig. 13); and finally in
                    the flying-fish the pectorals act as a parachute. In the eels and other
                    snakelike fishes, the swimming as well as the gliding motions are effected by
                    several curvatures of the body alternately towards<pb break="no"

                    degree of lateral curvature, and whose caudal fin is generally small if present
                    at all, locomotion is very limited, and almost wholly dependent on the action of
                    the dorsal fin, which consists of a rapid undulating movement.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">The Skin and Scales.—</hi> The skin of fishes is either covered
                    with scales, or naked, or provided with more or less numerous scutes of various
                    forms and sizes. Some parts, like the head and fins, are more frequently naked
                    than scaly. All fishes provided with electric organs, the majority of eels, and
                    the lampreys are naked. Scales of fishes are very different from those of
                    reptiles,—the latter being merely folds of the cutis, whilst the former are
                    distinct horny elements, developed in grooves or pockets of the skin, like
                    hairs, nails, or feathers.</p>
                <p>Very small or rudimentary scales are extremely thin, homogeneous in structure,
                    and more or less imbedded in the skin, and do not cover each other. When more
                    developed, they are imbricated (arranged in the manner of tiles), with the
                    posterior part extruded and free, the surface of the anterior portion being
                    usually covered by the skin to a greater or less extent. On their surface (fig.
                    14) may be observed a very fine striation concentric with and parallel to the
                    margin, and coarser striae radiating from a central point towards the hind
                    margin.</p>
                <p>Scales without a covering of enamel, with an entire (not denticulated) posterior
                    margin, and with a concentric striation, are called cycloid scales. - Ctenoid
                    scales (figs. 15,16) are generally thicker, and provided with spinous teeth on
                    the posterior edges of the layers of which the scale consists. In some species,
                    only the layer nearest to the margin is provided with denticulations (fig. 15).
                    Scales the free surface of which is spiny, and which have no denticulation on
                    the margin, have been termed sparoid scales; but their distinction from ctenoid
                    scales is by no means sharp, and there are even intermediate forms between the
                    cycloid and ctenoid types. Both kinds of scales may occur, not only in species
                    of the same genus of fishes, but in the same fish.</p>
                <p>Ganoid scales are hard and bony, covered with a layer of enamel; they are
                    generally rhombic or quadrangular, rarely rounded and imbricate, and are
                    arranged in oblique rows, those of one row being linked together by an
                    articulary process. This type of scales, common in fossil Ganoid fishes, occurs
                    among recent fishes in <hi rend="italic">Lepidosteus</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >Polypterus</hi> only.</p>
                <p>Finally, in sharks, the <hi rend="italic">Balistidce</hi><hi rend="italic
                    subscript"> t</hi> and others, true scales are absent, and are replaced by the
                    ossified papillae of the cutis (fig. 18), which give the surface the appearance
                    of finegrained shagreen. These generally small bodies, as well as the large
                    osseous scutes (figs. 6 and 20) of the rays, sturgeons, &lt;fcc., have been
                    comprised under the common name placoid scales, a term which is being deservedly
                    abandoned.</p>
                <p>Along the side of the body of osseous fishes runs a series of perforated scales,
                    which is called the lateral line (fig. 23). The perforating duct is simple at
                    its base, and may be simple also at its outer opening (fig. 21), or (a frequent
                    case) the portion on the free surface of the scale is ramified (fig. 22). The
                    lateral line runs from the head to the tail, sometimes reaching the caudal fin,
                    sometimes stopping short of it, sometimes advancing over its rays. Some species
                    have several lateral lines, an upper one following the dorsal, a lower the
                    abdominal outline, while a third runs along the middle as usual. The scales of
                    the lateral line are sometimes larger than the others, sometimes smaller;
                    sometimes they are modified into scutes; sometimes there are no other scales
                    besides these, the rest of the body being naked. The foramina of the lateral
                    line are the outlets of a muciferous duct which is continued on to the head,
                    running along the infraorbital bones, and sending off a branch into the
                    praeopercular margin and mandible. The muciferous system is abundantly provided
                    with nerves, and has therefore been considered to be the seat of a sense
                    peculiar to fishes, <pb break="no"

                    is the excretion of mucus, although probably mucus is excreted also from the
                    entire surface of the fish.</p>
                <p>The scales, their structure, number, and arrangement, constitute an important
                    character for the determination of fishes. In most scaly fishes they are
                    arranged in oblique transverse series; and, as the number of scales in the
                    lateral line generally corresponds to the number of transverse series, it is
                    usual to count the scales in that line. To ascertain the number of longitudinal
                    series of scales, the scales are counted in one of the transverse series,
                    generally in that running from the commencement of the dorsal fin, or the middle
                    of the back, to the lateral line, and from the lateral line down to the vent or
                    ventral fin, or the middle of the abdomen.</p>

                    >Teleostei,</hi> which is composed of the greatest number of specialized bones,
                    and is most readily accessible. The skeleton of any of the more common kinds of
                    osseous fish may serve for this purpose; that of the perch was chosen by Cuvier,
                    and is employed here .(fig. 24), as it was in the last edition of the present
                    work.</p>
                <p>In the Teleosteous fishes the spinous column consists of completely ossified
                    amphicoelous vertebrae; its termination is homocercal—that is, the caudal fin
                    appears to be more or less symmetrical, the last vertebra occupying a central
                    position in the base of the fin, and being united to a fiat fau-like bone, the
                    hypural (70 in fig. 24), on the hind margin of which the fin-rays are fixed. The
                    hypural is but a union of modified haemapophyses which are directed backwards,
                    and the actual termination of the notochord is bent upwards, and lies along the
                    upper edge of the hypural, hidden below the last rudimentary neural elements. In
                    some Teleosteans, as the <hi rend="italic">Salmonidoe,</hi> the last vertebrae
                    are conspicuously bent upwards: in fact, strictly speaking, this homocercal
                    condition is but one of the various degrees of heterocercy, different from that
                    of many Ganoids in this respect only, that the caudal fin itself has assumed a
                    higher degree of symmetry.</p>
                <p>The neural and haemal arches generally coalesce with the centrum, but there are
                    many exceptions, inasmuch as some portion of the arches of a species, or all of
                    them, may show the original division.</p>
                <p>The vertebrae are generally united with one another by zygapophyses, and
                    frequently similar additional articulations exist at the lower parts of the
                    centra. Parapophyses and ribs are very general, but the latter are inserted on
                    the centra and the base of the processes, and never on their extremities.</p>
                <p>The spinal column consists of abdominal and caudal vertebrae, the coalescence of
                    the parapophyses into a complete haemal ring and the suspension of the anal fin
                    generally forming a sufficiently well-marked boundary between the abdominal and
                    caudal regions (fig. 24). In the perch there are twenty-one abdominal and as
                    many caudal vertebrae. The centrum of the first vertebra or atlas is very short,
                    with the apophyses scarcely indicated; neither the first nor the second vertebra
                    has ribs. All the other abdominal vertebrae, with the exception of the last or
                    the two last, are provided with ribs, many of which are bifid (72). A series of
                    flat spines (74), called interneurals, to which the spines and rays of the
                    dorsal fins are articulated, are supported by the neural spines, the strength of
                    the neurals and ihter-neurals corresponding to that of the dermal spines (75).
                    The caudal vertebrae differ from the abdominal in having the haemapophyseal
                    elements converted into spines similar to the neurals, the anterior being
                    likewise destined to support<pb break="no"

                <p>There is a great amount of variation as regards the degree in which the
                    primordial cartilaginous cranium persists; it is always more or less replaced by
                    bone; frequently it disappears entirely, but in some fishes like the <hi

                    extent than we shall find in the <hi rend="italic">Ganoidei holostei.</hi>
                    Besides the bones preformed in cartilage there are a great number of
                    membrane-bones, that is, bones originating in membranous or tegumentary tissue.
                    The different kinds of these membrane-bones occur with greater or less constancy
                    throughout the subclass <hi rend="italic">Teleostei</hi>; they often coalesce
                    with and are no longer separable from the neighbouring or underlying
                    cartilage-bones.</p>
                <p>1. <hi rend="italic">Cartilage Bones of the Primordial Skull.—</hi> The
                    basioccipital (5 in figs. 25-27) has retained the form of a vertebral centrum;
                    it is generally concave behind, the concavity containing remains of the
                    notochord. The exoccipitals (10) are situated on the side of the basioccipital,
                    and contribute the greater portion of the periphery of the foramen magnum. The
                    supraoccipital (8) is intercalated between the exoccipitals, and forms a most
                    prominent part by its median crest, which sometimes extends far forward on the
                    upper side of the skull, and offers attachment to the dorsal portion of the
                    large lateral muscle of the trunk. A transverse supraoccipital ridge, coming
                    from each side of the base of this crest, runs outward to the external angles of
                    the bone. When the interior portion of this bone remains cartilaginous, some
                    part of the semicircular canals may be lodged in it.</p>
                <p>The region of the skull which succeeds these bones encloses at least the greater
                    portion of the labyrinth, and its component parts have been named with reference
                    to it by some anatomists.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"
                    ><p>As first proposed by Huxley.</p></note> The alisphenoids (11) <hi
                    rend="italic">(prooticum)</hi> form sutures posteriorly with the basi-and
                    ex-occipitals, and meet each other in the median line at the bottom of the
                    cerebral cavity; they contribute to the formation of a hollow in which the
                    hypophysis cerebri and the saccus vasculosus are received; in conjunction with
                    the exoccipital they form another hollow for the reception of the vestibulum;
                    generally they are perforated by the trigeminal and facial nerves. The
                    paroccipitals (9) <hi rend="italic">(epioticum)</hi> lodge a portion of the
                    posterior vertical semicircular canal, and form a projection of the skull on
                    each side of the occipital crest, to which a terminal branch of the scapular
                    arch is attached. The mastoid (12 + 13) <hi rend="italic">(ppisthoticum)</hi>
                    occupies the posteroexternal projection of the head; it encloses a part of the
                    external semicircular canal, is generally united to a membrane-bone, the
                    superficial squamosal, which emits a process for the suspension of the scapular
                    arch, and is frequently, as in the perch, divided into two separate bones.</p>
                <p>The anterior portion of the skull varies greatly as regards form, which is
                    chiefly dependent on the extent of the cere bral cavity; if the latter is
                    advanced far forwards, the lateral walls of the primordial cranium are protected
                    by more developed ossifications than is the case if the cerebral cavity is
                    shortened by the presence of a wide and deep orbit. In the latter case parts
                    which normally form the side of the skull are situated in front of the
                    brain-case, between it and the orbit, and, being generally reduced in extent,
                    are often replaced by membranes; the interorbital septum especially may thus be
                    reduced to a membrane. The most constant ossifications of this part of the skull
                    are the orbitosphenoids (14), which join the upper anterior margin of the
                    alisphenoids; superiorly the olfactory and inferiorly the optic nerves pass
                    between them out of the cranium. They vary much with regard to their
                    development: they are small in Gadoids; larger in the perch, pike, Salmonoids,
                    <hi rend="italic">ΛLacrodon,</hi> and the Clupeoids; and very large in
                    Cyprinoids and Siluroids, in which they contribute to the formation of the side
                    of the braincase. The single Y-shaped <hi rend="italic">sphenoideum</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">anterius</hi> (15) (ethmoid of Owen and basisphenoid of Huxley) is
                    as frequently absent as present; each lateral branch is connected with an
                    orbitosphenoid, whilst the lower branch rests upon the long basal bone; it forms
                    the anterior margin of the fossa for the hypophysis. Finally, to this group of
                    cartilage-bones belongs also the postfrontal (4), a small bone from which the
                    infraorbital ring is suspended.</p>
                <p>The centre of the foremost part of the skull is occupied by the ethmoid (3),
                    which shows great variations as regards its extent and the degree of
                    ossification; it may extend backwards into the interorbital septum, and reach
                    the orbitosphenoids, or it may be confined to the extremity of the skull; it may
                    remain entirely cartilaginous, or it may ossify into a lamina which separates
                    the two orbits and encloses an anterior prolongation of the brain-case, along
                    which the olfactory nerves pass,—modifications occurring again in higher
                    vertebrates. A paired ossification attached to the forepart of the ethmoid is
                    the prefrontals (2), which form the base of the nasal fossa.</p>
                <p>2. <hi rend="italic">Membrane-Bones attached to the Primordial Skull.—</hi> To
                    this group belong the parietals (7) and frontals (1). The latter form the upper
                    margin of the orbits, and extend from the nasal cavities to the occipital. They
                    are enlarged at the expense of the parietals, which are of much smaller extent

                    from each other by the anterior prolongation of the supraoccipital. The
                    squamosal (12) has been mentioned above in connexion with the mastoid. The
                    prefrontal (2) and supraorbital are always small, and the latter is frequently
                    absent. The lower surface of the skull is protected by the basisphenoid
                    (parasphenoid) (6), a very long and narrow bone extending from the basioccipital
                    beyond the brain-capsule to between the orbits, where it forms the support of
                    the interorbital septum. Anteriorly it is connate with another long
                    hammer-shaped bone (16), the vomer. Both these bones, especially the latter, may
                    be armed with teeth.</p>
                <p>3. <hi rend="italic">Cartilage-Bones of the Alimentary Portion of the Visceral
                    Skeleton of the Skull.—</hi> The suspensorium consists of three cartilage-bones,
                    and affords a base for the opercular apparatus as well as a point of attachment
                    to the hyoid, whilst in front it is connected with the pterygo-palatine arch
                    (fig. 27). These are the hyomandibular (23), symplectic (31), and quadrate (26);
                    they are connected by means of the metapterygoid (27) with the pterygoid (24)
                    and entopterygoid (25), the foremost bone of the arch being the palatine (22).
                    Of these bones the uppermost, the epitympanic or hyomandibular (23), is
                    articulated by a double articulary head with the mastoid and posterior frontal.
                    Another articulary head is destined for the opercular joint. The mesotympanic or
                    symplectic (31) appears as a styliform prolongation of the lower part of the
                    hyomandibular; it is cartilaginous in the young, but almost completely ossified
                    in the adult. The position of this bone is noteworthy, because, directly inwards
                    from its cartilaginous junction with the hyomandibular, there is situated the
                    uppermost piece of the hyoid arch, the stylohyal. The next bone of the series is
                    the pretympanic or metapterygoid (27), a flat bone forming a bridge towards the
                    pterygoid, and not rarely absent in the subclass. Finally, the large triangular
                    hypotympanic or quadrate (26) has a large condyle for the mandibular joint. The
                    palatine arch proper is formed by three bones: the entopterygoid (25) is an
                    oblong and thin bone attached to the inner border of the palatine and pterygoid,
                    and increasing the surface of the bony roof of the mouth towards the median
                    line; it constitutes also the floor of the orbit; the pterygoid (or <hi
                    rend="italic">os</hi><hi rend="italic">transversum)</hi> (24) starts from the
                    quadrate, and is joined by suture to the palatine, which is toothed in the perch
                    and many other fishes, and reaches to the vomer and anterior frontal. The piece
                    of the mandible which articulates with the quadrate is the articulary bone (35),
                    distinctly part of Meckel’s cartilage; it sends upwards a coronoid process to
                    which the masticatory muscles, as well as a ligament from the maxillary, are
                    attached; it also sends forwards a long-pointed process to be sheathed in a deep
                    notch of the dentary piece. Frequently another portion of cartilage below the
                    articulary remains persistent, or is replaced by a separate membrane-bone, the
                    angular.</p>
                <p>4. <hi rend="italic">Membrane-Bones of the Alimentary Portion of the Visceral
                    Skeleton of the Skull.—</hi> The suspensorium has one tegumentary bone attached
                    to it, viz., the praeoperculum (30); it is but rarely absent, as for instance in
                    <hi rend="italic">Muroenophis·,</hi> as it is quite a superficial bone, and
                    frequently armed with spines (as in the perch), its form and configuration
                    constitute an important item in the description of many fishes. The premaxillary
                    (17) and maxillary (18) of the <hi rend="italic">Teleostei</hi> appear to be
                    also membrane-bones, although they are clearly analogous to the upper labial
                    cartilages of the sharks. The premaxillaries sometimes coalesce into a single
                    piece (as in <hi rend="italic">Diodon, Mormyrus),</hi> or they are firmly united
                    with the maxillaries (as in all Gymnodonts, <hi rend="italic">Serrasalmo,</hi>
                    &amp;c.). The relative position and connexion of these two bones differ much,
                    and form a valuable character in the discrimination of the various families. In
                    some, the front margin of the jaw is formed by the premaxillary only, the two
                    bones having a parallel position, as in the perch, in which case the maxillary
                    is constantly toothless; in others, the premaxillary is shortened, allowing the
                    maxillary to enter, and to complete, the margin of the upper jaw; and finally,
                    in many, no part of the maxillary is situated behind the premaxillary, but the
                    entire bone is attached to the end of the premaxillary, forming its
                    continuation. In the last case the maxillary may be quite abortive. The mobility
                    of the upper jaw is greatest in those fishes in which the premaxillary alone
                    forms its margin. The form of the premaxillary is subject to great variation:
                    the beak of <hi rend="italic">Belone</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Xiphias</hi> is
                    formed by the prolonged and coalesced premaxillaries. The maxillary consists
                    sometimes of one piece, sometimes of two or three. The principal membrane-bone
                    of the mandible is the dentary (34), to which is added the angular (36) and
                    rarely a smaller one, the splenial or <hi rend="italic">os</hi><hi rend="italic"

                <p>The hyoid arch is suspended by a slender styliform bone, the stylohyal (29), from
                    the hyomandibulars; it consists of three segments, the epihyal (37), the
                    ceratohyal (38), which is the longest and strongest piece, and the basihyal,
                    which is formed by two juxtaposed pieces (39, 40). Between the latter there is a
                    median styliform ossicle (41), extending forwards into the substance of the
                    tongue, called the glossohyal or <hi rend="italic">os linguale.</hi></p>
                <p>The branchial arches (figs. 26 and 28) are enclosed within the hyoid arch, with

                    fifth (56) remains dwarfed, and is beset with teeth; it is called the lower
                    pharyngeal bone. The arches adhere by their lower extremities to a chain of
                    ossicles (53, 54, 55), the basibranchials, and, curving as they ascend, nearly
                    meet at the base of the cranium, to which they <pb break="no"

                    pieces movably connected with one another. The lowest is the hypobranchial (57),
                    the next, a much longer one, the ceratobranchial (58), and, above this, a
                    slender and short irregularly-shaped epibranchial. In the fourth arch the
                    hypobranchial is absent. The uppermost of these segments, especially of the
                    fourth arch, are dilated, and more or less confluent; they are beset with fine
                    teeth, and generally distinguished as the upper pharyngeal bones. Only the
                    ceratobranchial is represented in the fifth arch or lower pharyngeal. On their
                    outer convex side the branchial segments are grooved for the reception of large
                    bloodvessels and nerves; on the inner side they support horny processes, called
                    the gill-rakers, which do not form part of the skeleton.</p>
                <p>6. <hi rend="italic">Membrane-Bones of the Respiratory Portion of the Visceral
                    Skeleton of the Skull.—</hi> These include the opercular pieces, viz., the
                    operculum (28), suboperculum (32), and interoperculum (33). The last of these is
                    the least constant; it may be entirely absent, and represented by a ligament
                    extending from the mandible to the hyoid. The operculum is the principal piece,
                    situated behind, and movably united with, the vertical limb of the
                    praeoperculum. There is an articulary cavity at its upper anterior angle for its
                    junction with the hyomandibular. The interoperculum is connected by ligament
                    with the angular piece of the mandible, and is also attached to the outer face
                    of the hyoid, so that the gill-covers cannot open or shut without the hyoid
                    apparatus executing a corresponding movement. The remaining membrane-bones are
                    the urohyal (42), a single bone, which is connected by ligament with the
                    anterior extremity of the humeral arch, and separates the musculi sternohyoidei,
                    serving as an increased surface for their insertion; and, finally, the
                    branchiostegals (43), which vary greatly in number, but are always fixed to the
                    ceratohyals and epihyals by ligaments; the branchiostegal membrane is extended
                    between them.</p>
                <p>7. <hi rend="italic">Dermal Bones of the Skull.—</hi> To this category are
                    referred some bones which are ossifications of, and belong to, the cutis. They
                    are the turbinals (20), the suborbitals (19), and the supratemporals. They vary
                    much with regard to the degree in which they are developed, and are seldom
                    entirely absent. Nearly always they are wholly or partly transformed into tubes
                    or hollows, in which the muciferous canals with their numerous nerves are
                    lodged. Those in the temporal and scapulary regions are not always developed; on
                    the other hand, the series of those ossicles may be continued on to the trunk,
                    accompanying the lateral line. The foremost suborbital is termed the
                    praeorbital.</p>
                <p>The pectoral arch or shoulder-girdle of the Teleosteous fishes exhibits but a
                    remnant of a primordial cartilage, which is replaced by two ossifications,<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Parker’s nomenclature is
                    adopted here.</p></note> the caracoid (51) and scapula (52); posteriorly they
                    offer attachment to two series of short rods (53), of which the proximal are
                    nearly always ossified, whilst the distal frequently remain small cartilaginous
                    nodules hidden in the base of the pectoral rays; they have been termed carpals
                    and metacarpals. The bones by which this portion is connected with the skull are
                    membrane-bones, viz., the clavicle (48), with the postclavicle (49 + 50), the
                    supraclavicle (47), and the post-temporal (46). By this last bone the
                    shoulder-girdle is suspended from the skull; it is attached, in the perch, by a
                    triple prong to the occipital and mastoid bones. The clavicle completes the arch
                    below by the symphysis or natural connexion of the bones of each side. Many
                    Teleosteous fishes lack pectoral fins, and in them the pectoral arch is
                    frequently more or less reduced or rudimentary, as in many species of <hi
                    rend="italic">Muroenidae.</hi> In others the membranebones are exceedingly
                    strong, contributing to the outer protective armour of the fish, and then the
                    clavicles are generally suturally connected in the median line. The
                    postclavicula and the supraclavicula may be absent. It is only exceptionally
                    that the shoulder-girdle is not suspended from the skull, but from the anterior
                    portion of the spinous column <hi rend="italic">(Symbranchidoe, Muroenidae,
                    Notacanthidoe).</hi> The number of elements in each of the two series of basalia
                    never exceeds five, but may be smaller; and the distal series is absent in
                    Siluroids.</p>
                <p>The pubic bones (80) of the Teleosteous fishes undergc many modifications of form
                    in the various families, but they are essentially of the same simple type as in
                    the perch, viz., a pair of flat or styliform simple bones, to which the ventral
                    fins are articulated.</p>
                <p>The bones of the skull of the fish have received so many different
                    interpretations that no two accounts agree in their nomenclature, so that their
                    study is a matter of considerable difficulty. The table of synonyms given on p.
                    644 will tend to overcome difficulties arising from this cause; it contains the
                    terms used for the different bones of the skeleton by Cuvier, those introduced
                    by Owen, and finally the nomenclature of Stannius, Huxley, and Parker. Those
                    adopted here are printed in italics. The numbers in the table are those used in
                    the preceding pages and in figs. 24-28.</p>

                <p>type. The vertebral column is represented by a simple chorda dorsalis or
                    notochord only, which extends from one extremity of the fish to the other, and,
                    so far from being expanded into a cranial cavity, is pointed at its anterior end
                    as well as at its posterior. It is enveloped in a simple membrane like the
                    spinal cord and the abdominal organs, and there is no trace of vertebral
                    segments or ribs; a series of short cartilaginous rods, however, above the spine
                    evidently represent apophyses. A maxillary or hyoid apparatus, or elements
                    representing limbs, are entirely absent.</p>
                <p>The skeleton of the <hi rend="italic">Cyclostomata</hi> (or <hi rend="italic"
                    >Harsipobranchu)</hi> (lampreys and sea-hags) shows a considerable advance of
                    development. It consists of a notochord, the anterior pointed end of which is
                    wedged into the base of a cranial capsule, partly membranous, partly
                    cartilaginous. This skull, therefore, is not movable upon the spinal column. No
                    vertebral segmentation can be observed in the notochord, but neural arches are
                    represented by a series of cartilages on each side of the spinal chord. In <hi
                    rend="italic">Petromyzon</hi> (fig. 31) the basis cranii emits two prolongations
                    on each side, an inferior, extending for some distance along the lower side of
                    the spinal column, and a lateral, which is ramified into a skeleton supporting
                    the branchial apparatus. A stylohyal process and a subocular arch with a
                    palato-pterygoid portion may be distinguished. The roof of the cranial capsule
                    is membranous in <hi rend="italic">Myxine</hi> and in the larvae of <hi
                    rend="italic">Petromyzon,</hi> but more or less cartilaginous in the adult <hi
                    rend="italic">Petromyzon</hi> and in <hi rend="italic">Bdellostoma.</hi> A
                    cartilaginous capsule on each side of the hinder part of the skull contains the
                    auditory organ, whilst the olfactory capsule occupies the anterior upper part of
                    the roof. A broad cartilaginous lamina, starting from the cranium and overlying
                    part of the snout, has been determined as representing the ethmo-vomerine
                    elements, whilst the oral organs are supported by large, very peculiar
                    cartilages (labials), greatly differing in general configuration and arrangement
                    in the various Cyclostomes. There are three in the sealamprey, of which the
                    middle one is joined to the palate by an intermediate smaller one; the foremost
                    is ring-like, tooth-bearing, emitting on each side a styliform process. The
                    lingual cartilage is large in all Cyclostomes. There is no trace of ribs or
                    limbs.</p>
                <p>The Chondropterygians exhibit a most extraordinary diversity in the development
                    of their vertebral column; almost every degree of ossification, from a notochord
                    without a trace of annular structure to a series of completely ossified
                    vertebrae, being found in this order. The sharks in which the notochord is
                    persistent are the <hi rend="italic">Holocephali</hi> (if they be reckoned as
                    belonging to this order) and the genera <hi rend="italic">Notidanus</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">Echinorhinus.</hi> In the other sharks the segmentation is
                    complete, each vertebra having a deep conical excavation in front and behind,
                    with a central canal through which the notochord is continued; but the degree in
                    which the primitive cartilage is replaced by concentric or radiating lamellae of
                    bone varies greatly in the various genera, and according to the age of the
                    individuals. In the rays all the vertebrae are completely ossified, and the
                    anterior ones confluent into one continuous mass. In the majority of
                    Chondropterygians the extremity of the vertebral column shows a decidedly
                    heterocercal condition, and only a few, like <hi rend="italic">Squxxtina</hi>
                    and some rays, possess a diphycercal tail.</p>
                <p>The advance in the development of the skeleton in Chondropterygians beyond the
                    primitive condition of the previous subclasses manifests itself further by the
                    presence of neural and haemal elements, extending to the foremost part of the
                    axial column; but of these the haemal form a closed arch in the caudal region
                    only, whilst on the trunk they appear simply as a lateral longitudinal ridge.
                    The neural and haemal apophyses are either merely attached to the axis, as in
                    Chondropterygians with persistent notochord (the rays and some sharks); or their
                    basal portions penetrate like wedges into the substance of the centrum, so that,
                    in a transverse section, in consequence of the difference in their texture, they
                    appear in the form of an X (figs. 32-34). The interspaces between the
                    neurapophyses of the vertebrae are not filled by fibrous membrane, as in other
                    fishes, but by separate cartilages (laminae or cartilagines intercrurales), to
                    which frequently a series of terminal pieces is superadded, which must be
                    regarded as the first appearance of the interneural spines of the <hi
                    rend="italic">Tdeostei</hi> and many Ganoids. Similar terminal pieces <pb

                    are either absent or but imperfectly represented <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Carcharias).</hi></p>
                <p>The substance of the skull of the Chondropterygians is cartilage, interrupted
                    especially on its upper surface by more or less extensive fibro-membranous
                    fontanelles. Superficially it is covered by a more or less thick shagreenlike
                    osseous deposit. The articulation with the vertebral column is effected by a
                    pair of lateral condyles. In the sharks, besides, a central conical excavation
                    corresponds to that of the centrum of the foremost vertebral segment, whilst in
                    the rays this central excavation of the skull receives a condyle of the axis of
                    the spinous column. The cranium itself is a continuous undivided cartilage, in
                    which the limits of the orbit are well marked by an anterior and posterior
                    protuberance. The ethmoidal region sends horizontal plates over the nasal sacs,
                    the apertures of which retain their embryonic situation upon the under surface
                    of the skull. In the majority of Chondropterygians these plates are produced
                    conically, forming the base of the soft projecting snout; and in some forms,
                    especially in the long-snouted rays and the saw-fishes <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Pristis),</hi> this prolongation appears in the form of three or more tubiform
                    rods. As separate cartilages there are appended to the skull a suspensorium, a
                    palatine, a mandible, a hyoid, and rudimentary maxillary elements. The
                    suspensorium is movably attached to the side of the skull. It generally consists
                    of one piece only, but in some rays of two. In the rays it is articulated to the
                    mandible only, their hyoid possessing a distinct point of attachment to the
                    skull. In the sharks the hyoid is suspended from the lower end of the
                    suspensorium together with the mandible. What is generally called the upper jaw
                    of a shark is, as Cuvier has already stated, not the maxillary, but the
                    palatine. It consists of two simple lateral halves, each of which articulates
                    with the corresponding half of the lower jaw, which is formed by the simple
                    representative of Meckel’s cartilage. Some cartilages of various sizes are
                    generally developed on each side of the palatine, and one on each side of the
                    mandible. They are called labial cartilages, and seem to represent maxillary
                    elements. The hyoid consists generally of a pair of long and strong lateral
                    pieces, and a single mesial piece. From the former, cartilaginous filaments
                    (representing branchiostegals) pass directly outwards. Branchial arches, varying
                    in number, and similar to the hyoid, succeed it. They are suspended from the
                    side of the foremost part of the spinous column, and, like the hyoid, bear a
                    number of filaments.</p>
                <p>The vertical fins are supported by interneural and inter-haemal cartilages, each
                    of which consists of two or more pieces; to these fins the fin-rays are attached
                    without articulation. The scapular arch of the sharks is formed by a single
                    coracoid cartilage bent-from the dorsal region downwards and forwards. In some
                    genera <hi rend="italic">(Scyllium,</hi><hi rend="italic">Squatina)</hi> a small
                    separate scapular cartilage is attached to the dorsal extremities of the
                    coracoid; but in none of the Elasmobranchs is the scapular arch suspended from
                    the skull or vertebral column; it is merely sunk and fixed in the substance of
                    the muscles. Behind, at the point of its greatest curvature, three carpal
                    cartilages are joined to the coracoid, which Gegenbaur has distinguished as
                    propterygium, mesopterygium, and metapterygium, the first occupying the front,
                    the last the hind margin of the fin. Several more or less regular transverse
                    series of styliform cartilages follow. They represent the phalanges, to which
                    the horny filaments which are imbedded in the skin of the fin are attached. In
                    the rays, with the exception of torpedo, the scapular arch is intimately
                    connected with the confluent anterior portion of the vertebral column. The
                    anterior and posterior carpal cartilages are followed by a series of similar
                    pieces, which extend like an arch forwards to the rostral portion of the skull,
                    and backwards to the pubic region. Extremely numerous phalangeal elements,
                    longest in the middle, are supported by the carpals, and form the skeleton of
                    the lateral expansion of the so-called disk of the ray’s body, which thus, in
                    fact, is nothing but the enormously enlarged pectoral fin.</p>
                <p>The pubic is represented by a single median transverse cartilage, with which a
                    tarsal cartilage articulates. The latter supports the fin-rays. To the end of
                    this cartilage is also attached, in the male Chondropterygians, a peculiar
                    accessory generative organ or clasper.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Holocephali</hi> differ from the other Chondropterygians in
                    several important points of the structure of their skeleton, and unmistakably
                    approach certain Ganoids. That their spinal column is persistently notochordal
                    has been mentioned already. Their palatal apparatus, with the suspensorium,
                    coalesces with the skull, the mandible articulating, with a short apophysis of
                    the cranial cartilage (autostylic skull). The mandible is simple, without
                    anterior symphysis. The spine with which the dorsal fin is armed articulates
                    with a neural apophysis, and is not immovably attached to it, as in the sharks.
                    The pubic consists of two lateral halves, with a short, rounded tarsal
                    cartilage.</p>
                <p>The skeleton of the Ganoid fishes presents extreme variations with regard to the
                    degree in which ossifications replace the primordial cartilage. Whilst some
                    exhibit scarcely any advance beyond the Plagiostomes with persistent cartilage,
                    others, as regards the development and specialization of the several parts of
                    their osseous framework, approach the Teleosteans so closely that their Ganoid
                    nature can be demonstrated by, or inferred from, other considerations only. All
                    Ganoids possess a separate gill-cover.</p>
                <p>The diversity in the development of the Ganoid skeleton is well exemplified by
                    the few representatives of the order in the existing fish fauna. Lowest in the
                    scale in this respect are those with a persistent notochord, and an autostylic
                    skull, that is, a skull without separate suspensorium—the fishes constituting
                    the suborder <hi rend="italic">Dipnoi,</hi> of which the existing
                    representatives are <hi rend="italic">Lepidosiren, Proto· ρterus,</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">Ceratodus,</hi> and the extinct (so far as demonstrated at
                    present) <hi rend="italic">Dipterus, Chirodus</hi> (and <hi rend="italic"
                    >Phaneropleuron ?).</hi> In these fishes the notochord is persistent, passing
                    uninterruptedly into the cartilaginous base of the skull. Some <hi rend="italic"
                    >Dipnoi</hi> are diphy-, others hetero-cercal. Neural and haemal elements and
                    ribs are well developed.</p>
                <p>The primordial cranium of the <hi rend="italic">Dipnoi</hi> is cartilaginous, but
                    with more or less extensive ossifications in its occipital, basal, or lateral
                    portions, and with large tegumentary bones, which, from this suborder upwards in
                    the series, will be found to exist throughout the remaining forms of fishes. A
                    strong process descends from the cranial cartilage, and offers by means of a
                    double condyle (fig. 35, <hi rend="italic">s)</hi> attachment to corresponding
                    articulary surfaces of the lower jaw. Maxil-Iary<pb break="no"

                    but are perhaps represented in <hi rend="italic">Ceratodus</hi> by some
                    inconstant rudimentary labial cartilages situated behind the posterior nasal
                    opening. Facial cartilages and an infraorbital ring are developed, at least in
                    <hi rend="italic">Ceratodus.</hi> The presence of a pair of small teeth in front
                    indicates the vomerine portion (v) which remains cartilage, whilst the posterior
                    pair of teeth are implanted in a pterygopalatine ossification (Z), which
                    sometimes is paired, sometimes continuous. The base of the skull is constantly
                    covered by a large basal ossification (o). The hyoid is well developed,
                    sometimes reduced to a pair of ceratohyals, sometimes with a basihyal and
                    glossohyal. The skeleton of the branchial apparatus approaches the Teleosteous
                    type, less so in <hi rend="italic">Lepidosiren</hi> than in <hi rend="italic"
                    >Ceratodus,</hi> in which five branchial arches are developed, but with the
                    lateral and mesial pieces reduced in number. A large operculum, and a smaller
                    subor inter-operculum are present.</p>
                <p>The scapular arch consists of a single median transverse cartilage, and a pair of
                    lateral cartilages which bear the articular condyle for the pectoral limb. The
                    latter cartilages form the base of a large membrane-bone, and the whole arch is
                    suspended from the skull by means of an osseous supraclavicle. The fore-limb of
                    the <hi rend="italic">Dipnoi</hi> (fig. 36) greatly differs externally from the
                    pectoral fin of other Ganoid fishes. It is covered with small scales along the
                    middle, from the root to its extremity, and surrounded by a rayed fringe similar
                    to the vertical fin (crossopterygian type of fin). A muscle split into numerous
                    fascicles extends all the length of the fin, which is flexible in every part and
                    in every direction. The cartilaginous framework supporting it is joined to the
                    scapular arch by an oblong cartilage, followed by a broad basal cartilage (a),
                    generally single, but sometimes showing traces of a triple division. Along the
                    middle of the fin runs a jointed axis (6), the joints gradually becoming smaller
                    and thinner towards the extremity; each joint bears on each side a three-, two-,
                    or one-jointed branch (c, &lt;7). This axial arrangement of the pectoral
                    skeleton, which evidently represents one of its first and lowest conditions, has
                    been termed the <hi rend="italic">archipterygium</hi> by Gegenbaur. It is found
                    in <hi rend="italic">Ceratodus</hi> and other genera, but in <hi rend="italic"
                    >Lepidosiren</hi> the jointed axis only has been preserved, while rudimentary
                    rays are added in <hi rend="italic">Protopterus.</hi></p>
                <p>The pubic consists of a single flattened subquadrangular cartilage, produced into
                    a long single anterior process. Posteriorly it terminates on each side in a
                    condyle, to which the basal cartilage of the ventral paddle is joined. The
                    endoskeleton of the paddle is almost identical with that of the pectoral.</p>

                <p>The primordial cranium of the sturgeons consists of persistent cartilage without
                    ossifications in its substance, but superficial bones are still more developed
                    and specialized than in the <hi rend="italic">Dipnoi;</hi> so it is, at least,
                    in the true sturgeons, but less so in <hi rend="italic">Polyodon</hi> (fig. 37).
                    The upper and lateral parts of the skull are covered by well-developed
                    membranebones. The lower surface of the skull is covered by an extremely large
                    basal bone, which extends from the vomerine region on to the anterior part of
                    the spinal column. The nasal excavation in the skull is rather lateral than
                    inferior. The ethmoidal region is generally much produced, forming the base of
                    the long projecting snout. The suspensorium is movably attached to the side of
                    the skull, and consists of two pieces, a hyomandibular and a symplectic, which
                    now appears for the first time as a separate piece, and to which the hyoid is.
                    attached. The palato maxillary apparatus is more complex than in the sharks and
                    <hi rend="italic">Dipnoi</hi>; a palato-pterygoid consists of two
                    mesially-connected rami in <hi rend="italic">Polyodon,</hi> and of a complex
                    cartilaginous disk in <hi rend="italic">Acipenser,</hi> being articulated in
                    both to the Meckelian cartilage. In addition, the sturgeons possess one or two
                    pairs of osseous rods, which, in <hi rend="italic">Polyodon</hi> at least,
                    represent the maxillary, and therefore must be the representatives of the labial
                    cartilages of the sharks. The Meckelian cartilage is more or less covered by
                    tegumentary bones. In the gill-cover, besides the operculum, a sub-and
                    inter-operculum may be distinguished in <hi rend="italic">Acipenser.</hi> The
                    hyoid consists of three pieces, of which the posterior bears a broad
                    branchiostegal in <hi rend="italic">Polyodon.</hi></p>
                <p>In the scapulary arch the primordial cartilaginous elements scarcely differ from
                    those of the <hi rend="italic">Dipnoi.</hi> The membrane-bones are much
                    expanded, and show a continuous series suspended from the skull. Their division
                    in the median ventral line is complete. The pectoral is supported by a
                    cartilaginous framework (fig. 38) similar to that of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Ceratodus,</hi> but much more shortened and reduced in its periphery, the
                    branches being absent altogether on one side of the axis. This modification of
                    the fin is analogous to the heterocercal condition of the end of the spinous
                    column. To the inner corner of a basal cartilage (a) a short axis (6) is joined,
                    which on its outer side bears a <pb break="no"

                    remaining branches (c) being fixed to the basal cartilage. The dermal fin-rays
                    are opposed to the extremities of the branches, as in the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Dipnoi.</hi></p>
                <p>The pubic consists of a paired cartilage, to which tarsal pieces supporting the
                    fin-rays are attached.</p>
                <p>The other existing Ganoid fishes have the spinous column entirely or almost
                    entirely ossified; these have been comprised under the common name <hi
                    rend="italic">Holostei.</hi> They form, however, three very distinct types;
                    several attempts have been made to coordinate with them the fossil forms, but
                    this task is beset with extreme difficulties, of which no satisfactory solution
                    has as yet been advanced.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Polypteroidei</hi> have their spinous column formed by
                    distinct osseous amphicoelous vertebrae, that is, vertebrae with concave
                    anterior and posterior surfaces. It is nearly diphycercal. The neural arches,
                    though ossified, do not coalesce with the centrum, and form one canal only for
                    the myelon. There are no intermediate elements between the neural spines.</p>
                <p>Interneurals are developed, but are simple, articulating with the dermoneurals.
                    The abdominal vertebrae have parapophyses developed with epipleural spines. Only
                    the caudal vertebrae have haemal spines, which, like the interhaemals, agree in
                    every essential respect with the opposite neurals. Ribs are inserted, not on the
                    parapophyses, but on the centra, immediately below the parapophyses.</p>
                <p>The skull of <hi rend="italic">Polypterus</hi> (fig. 39) shows a great advance
                    towards the Teleosteous type, the number of separable bones being greatly
                    increased. They are arranged much in the same fashion as in <hi rend="italic"
                    >Teleostei,</hi> but a great portion of the primordial cranium remains
                    cartilaginous. The membrane-bones which cover the upper and lower surfaces of
                    the brain-case are so much developed as to cause the underlying cartilage to
                    disappear, so that a large vacuity or fontanelle exists in the substance of the
                    upper as well as of the lower cartilaginous wall. Of ossifications belonging to
                    the primordial skull must be noticed the single occipital with a mastoid on each
                    side. They are separated by persistent cartilage from the sphenoids and
                    postfrontals; the former, which are the largest ossification of the primordial
                    cranium, enclose the anterior half of the brain cavity. Finally, the nasal
                    portion contains a median ethmoid and a pair of praefrontal bones. Only a very
                    small portion of the bones described are visible externally, nearly the whole of
                    the primordial cranium being covered by the membrane-bones. Of these are seen on
                    the upper surface a pair of pariétale, frontale, “nasals,” and turbinals; on the
                    lower surface a large cross-shaped basal, anteriorly bordered on each side by a
                    pterygoid, parallel to a palatine which forms a suture with the double vomer.
                    The suspensorium has in front a metapterygoid and quadrate bone, and an
                    operculum and suboperculum are attached to it behind. Praemaxillaries and
                    maxillaries are now fully developed, but immovably attached to the skull. The
                    lower jaw is ossified, and consists of an articulary, angular, dentary, and
                    splenial. Of labial cartilages a rudiment at the angle of the mouth has remained
                    persistent. The side of the skull, in front of the operculum, is covered by a
                    large irregularly-shaped bone(7 <hi rend="superscript"> τ</hi>) (corresponding
                    to the “tympanic lamina” of <hi rend="italic">Ceratοdus,</hi> fig. 35, <hi
                    rend="italic">&lt;f),</hi> held by some to be the praeoperculum; along its upper
                    circumference lies a series of small ossicles, of which two may be distinguished
                    as spiraculars, as they form a valve for the protection of the spiracular
                    orifice of these fishes. An infraorbital ring is represented by a praeorbital
                    and postorbital only.</p>
                <p>Each hyoid consists of three pieces, none of which bear branchiostegals, the
                    single median piece being osseous in front and cartilaginous behind. Four
                    branchial arches are developed, the foremost consisting of three, the second and
                    third of two, and the last of a single piece. There is no lower pharyngeal.
                    Between the rami of the lower jaw the throat is protected by a pair of large
                    osseous laminae (gular plates), which have been considered to represent the
                    urohyal of osseous fishes. The scapulary arch is almost entirely formed by the
                    well-developed membrane-bones, which in the ventral line are suturally united.
                    The pectoral fin is supported by three bones, pro-, meso-, and meta-pterygium,
                    of which the dilated middle one alone bears rays, and is excluded from the
                    articulation with the shoulder-girdle.</p>
                <p>The pubic consists of a paired bone, to which tarsal bones supporting the
                    fin-rays are attached.</p>
                <p>In the <hi rend="italic">Lepidosteoidei</hi> the vertebrae are completely
                    ossified and opisthoccelous, having a convexity in front and a concavity behind,
                    as in some amphibians. Though the end of the body externally appears nearly
                    diphycercal, the termination of the vertebral column is, in fact, distinctly <pb
                    break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit12newyrich/page/n666/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0912-0666-0649"/> heterocercal. The caudal fin is suspended from
                    haemapophyses only, and does not extend to the neural side of the vertebral
                    column. The neural arches coalesce with the centrum; the interneurals are
                    simple. The abdominal vertebrae have parapophyses, to which the ribs are
                    attached. Only the caudal vertebrae have haemal spines.</p>
                <p>In the skull of <hi rend="italic">Lepidosteus</hi> the cartilage of the
                    endocranium is still more replaced by ossifications than in <hi rend="italic"
                    >Polypterus,</hi> those ossifications, moreover, being represented by a greater
                    number of discrete bones. The membrane-bones in particular are greatly
                    multiplied: the occipital, for instance, consists of three pieces; the vomer is
                    double, as in <hi rend="italic">Polypterus</hi>; the maxillary consists of a
                    series of pieces firmly united by suture. The symplectic reaches the lower jaw,
                    so that the articulary is provided with a double joint,viz., for the symplectic
                    and quadrate; the component parts of the lower jaw are as numerous as in
                    reptiles, a dentary, splenial, articulary, angular, supra-angular, and coronary
                    being distinct. The sides of the head are covered with numerous bones, and a
                    praeoperculum is developed in front of the gill-cover, which, again, consists of
                    an operculum and suboperculum.</p>
                <p>Each hyoid consists of three pieces, of which the middle is the longest, the
                    upper bearing the largest of the three branchiostegals which <hi rend="italic"
                    >Lepidosteus</hi> possesses; a long and large glossohyal is intercalated between
                    the lower ends of the hyoids. There are five branchial arches, the hindmost of
                    which is modified into a lower pharyngeal; upper pharyngeals are likewise
                    present as in the majority of Teleosteous fishes, but there is no gular
                    plate.</p>
                <p>Of the scapulary arch the two halves are separated by a suture in the median
                    line; the membrane-bones are well developed, only a remnant of the primordial
                    cartilage remaining; the supraclavicle is very similar to that of Teleosteous
                    fishes, and in a less degree the post-temporal. The base to which the limb is
                    attached is a single osseous plate, supporting on its posterior margin
                    semi-ossified rods in small number, which bear the pectoral rays. The pubic
                    consists of a paired bone. The elements representing a tarsus are quite
                    rudimentary, and reduced in number (two or three).</p>
                <p>The vertebral column of the <hi rend="italic">Amioidei</hi> shows unmistakable
                    characters of the Palaeichthyic type. The arrangement of its component parts is
                    extremely simple. The centra of the amphicoelous vertebrae are well ossified,
                    but the neural and haemal arches do not coalesce with the centra, from which
                    they are separated by a thin layer of cartilage. All the vertebrae do not
                    possess apophyses: in the caudal portion of <hi rend="italic">Amia</hi> only
                    every alternate vertebra is provided with them. The heterocercal condition of
                    the spinous column is well marked; as in the other <hi rend="italic"
                    >Holostei,</hi> the hindmost vertebrae are turned upwards, become gradually
                    smaller in size, and lose their neural arches, the haemals remaining developed
                    to the end. Finally, the column terminates in a thin cartilaginous band, which
                    is received between the lateral halves of the fifth or sixth upper caudal ray.
                    The interneurals and interhaemals are simple. Only the abdominal vertebrae have
                    parapophyses, with which the ribs are articulated.</p>
                <p>The configuration of the skull, and the development and arrangement of its
                    component parts, approach so much the Teleostean type, that perhaps there are
                    greater differences in skulls of truly Teleostean fishes than between the skulls
                    of <hi rend="italic">Amia</hi> and of many <hi rend="italic">Physostοmi.</hi>
                    Externally the cranium is entirely ossified; the remains of the cartilaginous
                    primordial cranium can only be seen in a section, and are of much less extent
                    than in many Physo-stomous fishes. The immovable intermaxillary, the double
                    yomer, the double articulary cavity of the mandible for junction with the
                    quadrate and symplectic bones, remind us still of similar conditions in the
                    skull of <hi rend="italic">Lepidosteus</hi>; but the mobility and formation of
                    the maxillary, the arrangement of the gill-covers, the development of a
                    praeoperculum, the suspensorium, the palate, the insertion of a number of
                    branchiostegals on the long middle hyoid piece, the composition of the branchial
                    framework (with upper and lower pharyngeals), are as in the Teleosteous type. A
                    gular plate replaces the urohyal.</p>
                <p>The scapular arch is composed entirely of the membranebones found in the <hi
                    rend="italic">Teleostei,</hi> and the two sides are loosely united by ligament.
                    The base to which the limb is attached is cartilaginous; short semi-ossified
                    rods are arranged along its hinder margin, and bear the pectoral rays.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Myology.</hi></p>
                <p>In the lowest vertebrate, <hi rend="italic">Branchiostoma,</hi> the whole of the
                    muscular mass is arranged in a longitudinal band running along each side of the
                    body; it is vertically divided into a number of flakes or segments (myocommas)
                    by aponeurotic septa, which serve as the surfaces of insertion to the muscular
                    fibres. But this muscular band has no connexion with the notochord except in its
                    foremost portion, where some relation has been formed to the visceral skeleton.
                    A very thin muscular layer covers the abdomen. In the Cyclostomes also the
                    greater portion of the muscular system is without direct relation to the
                    skeleton, and, again, it is only on the skull and visceral skeleton that
                    distinct muscles have been differentiated for special functions.</p>
                <p>To the development of the skeleton in the more highly organized fishes
                    corresponds a similar development of the muscles: the maxillary and branchial
                    apparatus, the pectoral and ventral fins, the vertical fins and especially the
                    caudal, possess a separate system of muscles. But the most noteworthy is the
                    muscle covering the sides of the trunk and tail (already noticed in <hi
                    rend="italic">Branchiostoma)</hi><hi rend="italic subscript"> i</hi> which
                    Cuvier described as the “great lateral muscle,” and which, in the higher fishes,
                    is a compound of many smaller segments (myocommas), corresponding in number with
                    the vertebrae. Each lateral muscle is divided by a median longitudinal groove
                    into a dorsal and ventral half; the depression in its middle is filled by an
                    embryonal muscular substance which contains a large quantity of fat and numerous
                    blood-vessels, and therefore differs from ordinary muscle by its softer
                    consistency, and by its colour, which is reddish or greyish. Superficially the
                    lateral muscle appears crossed by a number of white parallel tendinous zigzag
                    stripes, forming generally three angles, of which the upper and lower point
                    backwards, the middle one forwards. These are the outer edges of the aponeurotic
                    septa between the myocommas. Each septum is attached to the middle and to the
                    apophyses of a vertebra, and, in the abdominal region, to its rib; frequently
                    the septa receive additional support by the existence of epipleural spines.</p>
                <p>In connexion with the muscles reference has to be made to the electric organs
                    with which certain fishes are provided. That these have been developed out of
                    muscular substance is more than probable, not only from the examination of

                <p>In <hi rend="italic">Torpedo</hi> the electric organs are large, flat, uniform
                    bodies, lying one on each side of the head, bounded behind by the scapular arch,
                    and laterally by the anterior crescent-shaped tips of the pectoral fins. They
                    consist of an assemblage of vertical hexagonal prisms, whose ends are in contact
                    with the integuments above and below; and each prism is subdivided by delicate
                    transverse septa, forming cells filled with a clear, trembling, jelly-like
                    fluid, and lined within by an epithelium of nucleated corpuscles. Between this
                    epithelium and the transverse septa and walls of the prism there is a layer of
                    tissue on which the terminations of the nerves and vessels ramify. Hunter
                    counted four hundred and seventy prisms in each battery of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Torpedo</hi><hi rend="italic">marmorata,</hi> and demonstrated the enormous
                    supply of nervous matter which they receive. Each organ receives one branch of
                    the trigeminal nerve and four branches of the vagus, the former, and the three
                    anterior branches of the latter, being each as thick as the spinal chord
                    (electric lobes).</p>
                <p>In <hi rend="italic">Malapterurus</hi> the electric organ extends over the whole
                    body, but is thickest on the abdomen; it lies between two aponeurotic membranes
                    below the skin, and consists of rhomboidal cells which contain a rather firm
                    gelatinous substance. The electric nerve takes its origin from the spinal chord,
                    does not enter into connexion with ganglia, and consists of a single
                    enormously-strong primitive fibre, which distributes its branches in the
                    electric organ.</p>
                <p>The electric eel is the most powerful of electric fishes. Its electric organ
                    consists of two pairs of longitudinal bodies, situated immediately below the
                    skin, above the muscles,—one pair on the back of the tail, and the other pair
                    along the anal fin. Each fasciculus is composed of flat partitions or septa,
                    with transverse divisions between them. The outer edges of the septa appear in
                    nearly parallel lines in the direction of the longitudinal axis of the body, and
                    consist of thin membranes, which are easily torn; they serve the same purpose as
                    the columns in the analogous organ of the torpedo, making the walls or abutments
                    for the perpendicular and transverse dissepiments, which are exceedingly
                    numerous, and so closely aggregated as to seem almost in contact. The minute
                    prismatic cells, intercepted between these two sorts, of plates, contain a
                    gelatinous matter; the septa are about - <hi rend="subscript"> s</hi> ⅛th of an
                    inch from each other, and a length of one inch contains a series of two hundred
                    and forty cells, giving an enormous surface to the electric organs. The whole
                    apparatus is supplied with more than two hundred nerves, which are the
                    continuations of the rami anteriores of the spinal nerves. In their course they
                    give out branches to the muscles of the back, and to the skin of the animal. In
                    the Gymnotes, as in the torpedo, the nerves supplying the electric organs are
                    much larger than those bestowed on any part for the purposes of sensation or
                    movement.</p>
                <p>The. phenomena attending the exercise of this extraordinary faculty closely
                    resemble muscular action. The time and strength of the discharge are entirely
                    under the control of the fish. The power is exhausted after some time, and needs
                    repose and nourishment to restore it. If the electric nerves are cut and divided
                    from the brain, the cerebral action is interrupted, and no irritant to the body
                    has any effect in exciting electric discharge; but if their ends be irritated
                    the discharge takes place, just as a muscle is excited to contraction under
                    similar circumstances. Singularly enough, also, the application of strychnine
                    causes simultaneously a tetanic state of the muscles and a rapid succession of
                    involuntary electric discharges. The strength of the discharges depends entirely
                    on the size, health, and energy of the fish, an observation completely agreeing
                    with that made on the efficacy of snake-poison. Like this latter, the property
                    of the electric force serves two ends in the economy of the animals which are
                    endowed with it: it is necessary to them for overpowering, stunning, or killing
                    the creatures on which they feed, whilst incidentally they use it as the means
                    of defending themselves from their enemies.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Neurology.</hi></p>
                <p>The most simple condition of the nervous central organ known in vertebrates is
                    found in <hi rend="italic">Branchiostoma.</hi> In this fish the spinal cord
                    tapers at both ends, no anterior cerebral swelling, or anything approaching a
                    brain, being present. It is band-like along its middle third, and groups of
                    darker cells mark the origins of the fifty or sixty pairs of nerves which
                    accompany the intermuscular septa, and divide into a dorsal and a ventral
                    branch, as in other fishes. The two anterior pairs pass to the membranous parts
                    above the mouth, and supply with nerve filaments a ciliated depression near the
                    extremity of the fish, which is considered to be an olfactory organ, and two
                    pigment spots, the rudiments of eyes. An auditory organ is absent. The spinal
                    cord, of the Cyclostomes is flattened in its whole extent, bandlike, and
                    elastic; also in <hi rend="italic">Chimaera</hi> it is elastic, but flattened in
                    its posterior portion only. In all other fishes it is cylindrical, non-ductile,
                    and generally extending along the whole length of the spinal canal. The
                    Plectognaths offer a singular exception in this respect, that the spinal cord is
                    much shortened, the posterior portion of the canal being occupied by a long
                    cauda equina; this shortening of the spinal cord has become extreme in the
                    sun-fish <hi rend="italic">(f)rthagoriscus),</hi> in which it has shrunk into a
                    short and conical appendage of the brain. In the devil-fish <hi rend="italic"
                    >{Lophius)</hi> also a long cauda equina partly conceals the cord which
                    terminates on the level of about the twelfth vertebra.</p>
                <p>The brain of fishes is relatively small; in the burbot <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Lota)</hi> it has been estimated to be the <hi rend="subscript"> τ</hi> ⅜ <hi
                    rend="subscript"> σ</hi> th part of the weight of the entire fish, in the pike
                    the - <hi rend="subscript"> r</hi> ⅛5th part, and in the large sharks it is
                    relatively still smaller.</p>
                <p>The brain of osseous fishes (fig. 40) viewed from above shows three
                    protuberances, respectively termed the prosencephalon, mesencephalon, and
                    metencephalon, the two anterior of which are paired, the hindmost being single.
                    The foremost pair are the hemispheres, which are solid in their interior, and
                    provided with two swellings in front, the olfactory lobes. The second pair are
                    the optic lobes, which generally are larger than the hemispheres, and succeeded
                    by the third single portion, the cerebellum. The optic lobes possess a cavity
                    (ventriculus lobi optici), at the bottom of which some protuberances of variable
                    development represent the corpora quadrigemina of higher animals. On the lower
                    surface of the base of the optic lobes, behind the crura cerebri, two swellings
                    are observed, the lobi inferiores, which slightly diverge in front for the
                    passage of the infundibulum, from which a generally large hypophysis or
                    pituitary gland is suspended. The relative size of the cerebellum varies greatly
                    in the different osseous fishes: in the tunny and silurus it is so large as
                    nearly to cover the optic lobes; sometimes distinct transverse grooves and a
                    median longitudinal groove are visible. The cerebellum possesses in its interior
                    a cavity which communicates with the anterior part of the fourth ventricle. The
                    medulla oblongata is broader than the spinal cord, and contains the fourth
                    ventricle. In most fishes a perfect roof is formed over the fourth ventricle by
                    two longitudinal pads, which meet each other in the median line (lobi
                    posteriores).</p>
                <p>The brain of Ganoid fishes shows great similarity to that of the <hi
                    rend="italic">Teleostei∙,</hi> there is, however, considerable diversity in the
                    arrangement of its various portions in the different types. In the sturgeons and
                    <hi rend="italic">Polypterus</hi> (fig. 41) the hemispheres are more or less
                    remote from the mesencephalon, so that in an upper view the crura cerebri, with
                    the intermediate entrance into the third ventricle (fissura <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit12newyrich/page/n668/mode/1up"

                    membranous sac, epiphysis, containing lymphatic fluid, takes its origin from the
                    third ventricle, its base being expanded over the anterior interspace of the
                    optic lobes, and the apex being fixed to the cartilaginous roof of the cranium.
                    This structure is not peculiar to the Ganoids, but is found in various stages of
                    development in Teleosteans, marking, when present, the boundary between the
                    prosencephalon and mesencephalon. The lobi optici are essentially as in
                    Teleosteans. The cerebellum penetrates into the ventriculus lobi optici, and
                    extends thence into the open sinus rhomboidalis. At its upper surface it is
                    crossed by a commissure formed by the corpora restiformia of the medulla.</p>
                <p>As regards external configuration, the brain of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Lepidosteus</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Amia</hi> approach still more the
                    Teleosteous type. The prosencephalon, mesencephalon, and metencephalon are
                    contiguous, and the cerebellum lacks the prominent transverse commissure at its
                    upper surface. The sinus rhomboidalis is open.</p>
                <p>The brain of Chondropterygians (fig. 42) is more developed than that of other
                    fishes, and is distinguished by well-marked characters. These are— first, the
                    prolongation of the olfactory lobes into pedicles of greater or less length,
                    which dilate into great ganglionic masses, where they come into contact with the
                    olfactory sacs; secondly, the space which generally intervenes between the
                    prosencephalon and mesencephalon, as in some Ganoids; thirdly, the large
                    development of the metencephalon.</p>
                <p>The cerebellum is very large, overlying a portion of the optic lobes and of the
                    sinus rhomboidalis, and is often transversely grooved. The side-walls of the
                    fourth ventricle, which are formed by the corpora restiformia, are singularly
                    folded, and appear as two pads, one on each side of the cerebellum (lobi
                    posteriores or lobi nervi trigemini).</p>
                <p>The brain of the Cyclostomes represents a type different from that of other
                    fishes, showing at its upper surface three pairs of protuberances in front of
                    the cerebellum; they are all solid. The foremost pair are the large olfactory
                    tubercles, which are extremely large in <hi rend="italic">Petromyzon.</hi> They
                    are followed by the hemispheres, with a single body wedged in between their
                    posterior half; in <hi rend="italic">Petromyzon,</hi> at least, the vascular
                    tissue leading to an epiphysis seems to be connected with this body. Then
                    follows the lobus ventriculi tertii, distinctly paired in Myxinoids, but less
                    distinctly in <hi rend="italic">Petromyzon.</hi> The last pair are the corpora
                    quadrigemina. According to this interpretation, the cerebellum would be absent
                    in Myxinoids, and represented in <hi rend="italic">Petromyzon</hi> by a narrow
                    commissure only, stretching over the foremost part of the sinus rhomboidalis. In
                    the Myxinoids the medulla oblongata ends in two divergent swellings, free and
                    obtuse at their extremity, from which most of the cerebral nerves take their
                    origin.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>For a more
                    detailed account of the spino-cerebral nerves, see <hi rend="italic"
                    >Introduction io the Study of Fishes,</hi> by A. Günther.</p></note></p>
                <p>Two very important conditions require mention. The first relates to the optic
                    nerves, viz., to their mutual relation immediately after their origin, which is
                    very characteristic of the subclasses of fishes. In the Cyclostomes they have no
                    further connexion with each other, each going to the eye of its own side. In the
                    <hi rend="italic">Teleostei</hi> (fig.</p>
                <p>40, n) they simply cross each other (decussate), so that the one starting from
                    the right half of the brain goes to the left eye and <hi rend="italic">vice
                    versa.</hi> Finally, in the <hi rend="italic">Palaeichthyes</hi> (fig.</p>
                <p>41, <hi rend="italic">f)</hi> the two nerves are fused together, immediately
                    after their origin, into a chiasma.</p>
                <p>The second noteworthy peculiarity occurs in the distribution of the nervus vagus;
                    it emits a strong branch, called nervus lateralis, which accompanies the lateral
                    mucous system of the trunk and tail. This is either a single longitudinal stem,
                    gradually becoming thinner behind, and running superficially below the skin <hi
                    rend="italic">(Sal-</hi><hi rend="italic">monidoe,</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Cyclopterus)</hi> or deeply between the muscles (sharks, <hi rend="italic"
                    >Chimoeraf</hi><hi rend="italic">οτ</hi> is divided into two parallel branches
                    (most <hi rend="italic">Teleostei)</hi>; thus in the perch there are two
                    branches on each side, the superficial one supplying the lateral line, whilst
                    the deep-seated branch communicates with the spinal nerves and supplies the
                    septa between the myocommas and the skin. In fishes which lack the lateral
                    muciferous system and possess hard integuments, as the Ostracions, the lateral
                    nerve is more or less rudimentary. It is entirely absent in Myxinoids, but the
                    gastric branches of the vagus are continued, united as a single nerve, along the
                    intestine to the anus.</p>
                <p>Fishes possess all the spino-cerebral nerves of the higher Vertebrata, with the
                    exception of the nervus accessorius. A separate nervus hypoglossus is also
                    absent, but elements from the first spinal nerve are distributed over the area
                    normally supplied by this nerve in higher vertebrates. The number of spinal
                    nerves corresponds to that of the vertebrae, through or between which they pass
                    out.</p>
                <p>A sympathie nervous system appears to be absent in <hi rend="italic"
                    >Branchiostoma,</hi> and has not yet been clearly made out in the Cyclostomes.
                    It is well developed in the <hi rend="italic">Palaichthyes,</hi> but without the
                    cephalic portion. This latter is present in all osseous fishes, in which the
                    communication of sympathy has been found to exist between all the cerebral
                    nerves, except the olfactory, optic, and acoustic. The sympathie trunks run
                    along each side of the aorta and the back of the abdomen into the haemal canal,
                    communicate in their course with the ventral branches of each of the spinal
                    nerves, and, finally, often blend together into a common trunk beneath the tail.
                    At the points of communication with the cerebral and spinal nerves ganglia are
                    frequently developed, from which nerves emerge which are distributed to the
                    various viscera.</p>

                    respiration passes through the nasal sac.</p>
                <p>The olfactory organ is single in <hi rend="italic">Branchiostoma</hi> and the
                    Cyclostomes. In the former a small depression on the front end of the body,
                    clothed with a ciliated epithelium, is regarded as a rudimentary organ of smell.
                    In the adult <hi rend="italic">Petromyzon</hi> a membranous tube leads from the
                    single opening on the top of the head into the cartilaginous olfactory capsule,
                    the inside of which is clothed by membranes prolonged into a posterior blind
                    tube (fig. 31, <hi rend="italic">s),</hi> which penetrates the cartilaginous
                    roof of the palate, but not the mucous membrane of the buccal cavity. In the
                    Myxinoids the outer tube is strengthened by cartilaginous rings like a trachea;
                    the capsule is lined by a longitudinally folded pituitary membrane, and the
                    posterior tube opens backwards on the roof of the mouth, the opening being
                    provided with a valve. In all other fishes the organ of smell is double, there
                    being one on each side; it consists of a sac lined with a pituitary membrane,
                    and may be provided with one or with two openings, or may have none. The
                    position of these openings is very different in the various orders and suborders
                    of fishes.</p>
                <p>It is certain that fishes possess the faculty of perceiving odours, and that
                    various scents attract or repel them. A mangled carcase or fresh blood attracts
                    sharks, as well as the voracious Serrasalmonoids of the South American rivers.
                    There is no reason to doubt that the seat of that perception is in the olfactory
                    sac; and it may be reasonably conjectured that its strength depends mainly on
                    the degree of development indicated by the number and extent of the interior
                    folds of the pituitary membrane.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Organ of Sight.—</hi> The position, direction, and dimensions
                    of the eyes of fishes vary greatly. In some they have an upward aspect, and are
                    often very close together; in others they are lateral, and in a few they are
                    even directed downwards. In a very few this organ appears to be entirely absent.
                    In some Gobioids and Trachinoids <hi rend="italic">lΡeriophthal-rnus,
                    Boleophthalmus, Uranoscopus,</hi> &lt;fcc,) the eyes, which are on the upper
                    side of the head, can be elevated and depressed at the will of the fish. In the
                    range of their vision and in their acuteness of sight, fishes are very inferior
                    to the higher classes of vertebrates, yet at the same time it is evident that
                    they perceive their prey, or approaching danger, from a considerable distance;
                    and it would appear that the visual powers of a <hi rend="italic"
                    >Periophthalmus</hi> (fig. 12), when hunting insects on the mud-flats of the
                    tropical coasts, are quite equal to those of a frog.</p>
                <p>The eye of <hi rend="italic">Braηchiostoma</hi> (fig. 30, <hi rend="italic"
                    >g}</hi> is of the most rudimentary kind. It is simply a minute speck coated
                    with a dark pigment, and receiving the end of a short nerve. In Myxinoids the
                    minute rudiment of the eye is covered by skin and muscles. This is also the case
                    in many of the blind Teleosteous fishes; whilst in the former fishes, however,
                    the organ of sight has not attained to any degree of development, the
                    rudimentary eye of blind <hi rend="italic">Teleostei</hi> is a retrogressive
                    formation, in which a lens and other portions of the eye can often be
                    recognized. In fishes with a well-developed eye it is imbedded in a layer of
                    gelatinous and adipose substance, which covers the cavity of the orbit. A
                    lachrymal gland is absent In the Chondropterygians the eyeball is supported by
                    and moves on a cartilaginous peduncle of the orbital wall. In the majority of
                    Teleosteans, and in <hi rend="italic">Acipenser,</hi> a fibrous ligament
                    attaches the sclerotic to the wall of the orbit. The proper muscles of the
                    eyeball are always present. In all fishes the general integument of the head
                    passes over the eye, and becomes transparent where it enters the orbit;
                    sometimes it simply passes over the orbit, sometimes it forms a circular fold.
                    The anterior and posterior portions may be specially broad, becoming the seat of
                    an adipose deposit (adipose eyelids), as in <hi rend="italic">Scomber,
                    Caranx,</hi><hi rend="italic">Mugil,</hi> &amp;c. In many of these fishes the
                    extent of the eyelids varies with the seasons; during the spawning season they
                    are so much loaded with fat as nearly to hide the whole eye. Many sharks possess
                    a nictitating membrane, developed from the lower part of the palpebral fold, and
                    moved by a proper set of muscles.</p>
                <p>The form of the bulhus (fig. 43) is subhemispherical, the cornea (co) being flat.
                    If it were convex, as in higher vertebrates, it would be more liable'to injury;
                    but, as it is level with the side of the head, the chances of injury by friction
                    are diminished. The sclerotica (sc) is cartilaginous in Chondropterygians and
                    Acipensers, fibrous and of varying thickness in Teleosteans, in the majority of
                    which it is supported by a pair of cartilaginous or ossified hemispheroid cups
                    (c). In a few fishes, as in <hi rend="italic">Cerαtοdus,</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Xiphias,</hi> the cups are confluent into one cup, which possesses a foramen
                    behind to allow the passage of the optic nerve (o).</p>
                <p>The membranes situated between the sclerotica and retina are collectively called
                    choroidea, and are three in number. The one in immediate contact with the
                    sclerotic, and continued upon the iris, is by no means constantly present; it is
                    the membrana argentea (a), and is composed of microscopical crystals reflecting
                    a silvery or sometimes golden lustre. The middle layer is the membrana vasculosa
                    or Halleri (v), the chief seat of the ramifications of the choroid vessels; the
                    innermost layer is the membrana Ruyscheana or uvea (u), which is composed of
                    hexagonal pigment-cells, usually of a deep-brown or black colour.</p>
                <p>In many <hi rend="italic">Τeleοslei</hi> a rete mirabile surrounds the entry of
                    the op tie nerve; it is situated between the membrana argentea and vasculosa,
                    and called the choroid gland (cΛ). It receives its arterial blood from the
                    artery issuing from the pseudobranchia, the presence of a choroid gland being
                    always combined with that of a pseudobranchia. Teleosteans without
                    pseudobranchia have no choroid gland. In the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Palaeiehthyes,</hi> on the other hand, the pseudobranchia is present and a
                    choroid gland absent.</p>
                <p>The iris (i) is merely the continuation of the choroid membrane; its capability
                    of contracting and expanding is much more limited than in higher vertebrates.
                    The pupil is generally round, sometimes horizontally or vertically elliptical,
                    sometimes fringed. In the rays and <hi rend="italic">Pleuronectidae</hi> a lobe
                    descends from the upper margin of the pupil, and the outer integument overlying
                    this lobe is coloured and non-transparent,—a structure evidently preventing
                    light from entering the eye from above.</p>
                <p>In most <hi rend="italic">Teleostei</hi> a fold of the choroidea, called the
                    processus falciformis (∕), extends from the vicinity of the entrance of the
                    optic nerve to the lens. It seems to be constantly absent in Ganoids..</p>
                <p>The vitreous humour (Λ), which fills the posterior cavity of the eye-ball, is of
                    a firmer consistency than in the higher vertebrates. The lens is spherical, or
                    nearly so, firm, denser towards the centre, and lies in a hollow of the vitreous
                    humour. When a falciform process is present, it has one end attached to the
                    lens, which is thus steadied in its position. It is composed of concentric
                    layers consisting of fibres, which in the nucleus of the body have marginal
                    teeth, by which they are interlocked together. In <hi rend="italic"
                    >Petromyzon</hi> this serrature is absent, or but faintly indicated.</p>
                <p>The anterior cavity of the eye is very small in fishes, in consequence of the
                    small degree of convexity in the cornea; the quantity of the aqueous humour,
                    therefore, is very small, just sufficient to float the free border of the iris;
                    and the lessened refractive power of the aqueous humour is compensated by the
                    greater convexity of the lens.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Organ of Hearing.—</hi> No trace of an organ of hearing has

                    dilating into one or more sacs, which contain the otoliths. A tympanum, tympanic
                    cavity, and external parts are entirely absent in the class of fishes.</p>
                <p>In the Chondropterygians and <hi rend="italic">Dipnoi,</hi> the labyrinth is
                    enclosed in the cartilaginous substance of the skull. In the former the
                    excavation in the cartilage is larger than the membranous labyrinth, but nearly
                    corresponds to it in form; the part which receives the membranous vestibulum is
                    called vestibulum cartilagineum, from which a canal issues and penetrates to the
                    surface of the skull, where it is closed by the skin in sharks, but opens by a
                    minute foramen in rays. The otolithic contents are soft and chalklike.</p>
                <p>In the Teleosteans the sac which contains the otoliths lies on each side of the
                    base of the cranial cavity, and is often divided by a septum into two
                    compartments of unequal size, each containing a firm and solid otolith (fig.
                    44); these bodies possess indented margins, frequently other impressions and
                    grooves, in which nerves from the N.</p>
                <p>acousticus are lodged; they vary much in size and form, but in both respects show
                    a remarkable constancy in the same kind of fishes. Outwards the vestibule is in
                    contact with the osseous side wall of the skull, inwards with the metencephalon
                    and medulla oblongata; it contains another firm concretion, and opens by five
                    foramina into the three semicircular canals. The terminations of the acoustic
                    nerve are distributed over the vestibular concretion and the ampulli-form ends
                    (fig. 45) of the semicircular canals, without being continued into the latter,
                    which are filled with fluid. The semicircular canals (fig. 45) are sometimes
                    lodged in the cranial bones, sometimes partly free in the cranial cavity. Many
                    <hi rend="italic">Teleostei</hi> have fontanelles in the roof of the skull,
                    closed only by skin or very thin bone at the place where the auditory organ
                    approaches the surface, by which means sonorous undulations must be conducted
                    with greater ease to the ear.</p>
                <p>In many <hi rend="italic">Teleostei</hi> a most remarkable relation obtains
                    between the organ of hearing and the air-bladder. In the most simple form this
                    connexion is established in Percoids and the allied families, in which the two
                    anterior horns of the air-bladder are attached to fontanelles of the occipital
                    region of the skull, the vestibulum occupying the opposite side of the membrane
                    by which the fontanelle is closed. . The condition is similar, but more
                    coιhplicated, in many Clupeoids. The anterior narrow end of the air-bladder is
                    produced into a canal at the base of the skull, and divided into two very narro
                    w branches, which again bifurcate and terminate in a globular swelling. An
                    appendage of the vestibulum meets the anterior of these swellings, and comes
                    into close contact with it. In addition, the two vestibules communicate with
                    each other by <hi rend="italic">a</hi> transverse canal, crossing the cranial
                    cavity below the brain.</p>
                <p>The connexion is effected by means of a chain of ossicles in <hi rend="italic"
                    >Siluridoe, Characinidae, Cyprinidae,</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >Gymnotidoe.</hi> A canal issues from the communication between the vestibule
                    and its sac, and meeting that from the other side forms with it a common sinus
                    impar (fig. 45, r), lodged in the substance of the basioccipital; this
                    communicates on each side by a small orifice with two sub-spherical atria, on
                    the body of the atlas, close to the foramen magnum. Each atrium is supported
                    externally by a small bone (∞); a a third and larger bone <hi rend="italic"
                    >(k)</hi> completes the communication with the anterior part of the air-bladder.
                    From the sinus impar a bifid canal penetrates into the alisphenoids, in which it
                    terminates. In <hi rend="italic">Cobitis</hi> and several loach-like Siluroids
                    the small air-bladder consists of two globular portions placed side by side, and
                    wholly included within two bullae formed by the modified parapophyses of the
                    second and third vertebrae. The three ossicles on each side are present, but
                    concealed by the fore part of the osseous bulla.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Organ of Taste.—</hi> Some fishes, especially vegetable
                    feeders, or those provided with broad molar-like teeth, masticate their food;
                    and it may be observed in carps and other Cyprinoid fish that this process of
                    mastication frequently takes some time. But the majority of fishes swallow their
                    food rapidly, and without mastication, and therefore we may conclude that the
                    sense of taste cannot be keen. The tongue is often entirely absent, and, even
                    when it exists in its most distinct state, it consists merely of ligamentous or
                    cellular substance, and is never furnished with muscles capable of producing the
                    movements of extension or retraction as in most of the higher vertebrates. A
                    peculiar organ on the roof of the palate of Cyprinoids is perhaps adapted for
                    the perception of this sense; in these fishes the palate between and below the
                    upper pharyngeal bones is cushioned with a thick, soft, contractile substance,
                    richly supplied with nerves from the nervus vagus and nervus
                    glosso-pharyngeus.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Organs of Touch.—</hi> The faculty of touch is more developed
                    than that of taste, and there are numerous fishes which possess special organs
                    of touch. Most fishes are very sensitive to external touch, although their body
                    may be protected by hard horny scales. They perceive impressions even on those
                    parts which are covered by osseous scutes, in the same manner as a tortoise
                    perceives the slightest touch of its carapace. The seat of the greatest
                    sensitiveness however, appears to be the snout and the labial folds surrounding
                    the mouth. Many species possess soft and delicate appendages, called barbels,
                    which are almost constantly in action, and clearly used as organs of touch.
                    Among the <hi rend="italic">Triglidae</hi> and allied families, there are many
                    species which have one or more rays of the pectoral fin detached from the
                    membrane, and supplied with strong nerves. Such detached rays (also found in the
                    <hi rend="italic">Polynemidoe</hi> and in <hi rend="italic">Bathypterois)</hi>
                    are used partly for locomotion, partly for exploring the ground over which the
                    fish moves.</p>
                <p>Some fishes appear to be much less sensitive than others, or at least lose their
                    sensitiveness under peculiar circumstances. It is well known that a pike whose
                    mouth has been lacerated and torn by the hook continues to yield to the
                    temptation of a bait immediately afterwards. The Greenland shark, when feeding
                    on the carcase of a whale, allows itself to be repeatedly stabbed in the head
                    without abandoning its prey. A pair of congers are so <pb break="no"

                    not a few feed on vegetable as well as animal substances, or on mud containing
                    alimentary matter in a living or decomposing state. Generally they are very
                    voracious, especially the carnivorous kinds, and the rule of “eat or be eaten”
                    applies to them with unusual force. They are almost constantly engaged in the
                    pursuit and capture of their prey, the degree of their power in these respects
                    depending on the dimensions of the mouth and gullet and the strength of the
                    teeth and jaws. If the teeth are sharp and hooked, they are capable of securing
                    the most slender and agile animals; if with teeth of this kind are combined a
                    wide gullet and distensible stomach, the fish is able to overpower and swallow
                    others larger than itself; if the teeth are broad, strong molars, they are able
                    to crush the hardest alimentary substances; if they are feeble, they are only
                    serviceable in procuring some small or inert and unresisting prey. Teeth may be
                    wanting altogether. Whatever the prey, in the majority of cases it is swallowed
                    whole; but some of the most voracious fishes, like some sharks and <hi
                    rend="italic">Characinidoe,</hi> are provided with cutting teeth, which enable
                    them to tear their prey to pieces if too large to be swallowed whole. Auxiliary
                    organs, similar to the claws of some carnivorous mammals and birds, for the
                    purpose of seizing and overpowering their prey before it is torn by the teeth,
                    are not found in this class; but in a few fishes the jaws themselves are
                    modified for that purpose. In the sword-fishes the bones of the upper jaw form a
                    long dagger-shaped weapon, with which they not only attack large animals, but
                    also frequently kill fishes on which they feed. The saw-fishes are armed with a
                    similar but still more complex weapon, the saw, which is armed on each side with
                    large teeth implanted in deep sockets, specially adapted for killing and tearing
                    the prey before it is seized and masticated by the small teeth within the mouth.
                    Fishes show but little choice in the selection of their food, and some devour
                    their own offspring indiscriminately with other fishes. Their digestive powers
                    are strong and rapid, but are affected in some degree by the temperature, which,
                    when it sinks below a certain point, lowers the vital powers of these
                    cold-blooded animals. On the whole, marine fishes are more voracious than those
                    inhabiting fresh waters; and, whilst the latter may survive total abstinence
                    from food, for weeks or months, the marine species succumb to hunger within a
                    few days.</p>
                <p>The organs of nutrition, manducation, and deglutition are lodged in two large
                    cavities—an anterior (the mouth or buccal cavity), and a posterior (the
                    abdominal cavity). In the former the alimentary organs are associated with those
                    fulfilling the respiratory functions, the transmission of food to the stomach
                    and of water to the gills being performed by similar acts of deglutition. The
                    abdominal cavity commences immediately behind the head, so, however, that an
                    extremely short thoracic cavity for the heart is partitioned off in front.
                    Besides the alimentary organs it contains also those of the urogenital system
                    and the air-bladder. The abdominal cavity is generally situated in the trunk
                    only, but in numerous fishes it extends into the tail, being continued for some
                    distance along each side of the haemal apophyses. In numerous fishes the
                    abdominal cavity opens outwards by one or two openings. A single porus
                    abdominalis in front of the vent is found in <hi rend="italic">Lepidosiren</hi>
                    and some sturgeons; a paired one, opening on each side of the vent, in <hi
                    rend="italic">Cerαtοdus,</hi> some species of sturgeon, <hi rend="italic"
                    >Lepidosteus, Polypterus,</hi><hi rend="italic">Amia,</hi> and all
                    Chondropterygians. As in these fishes semen and ova are discharged by their
                    proper ducts, the abdominal openings may serve for the expulsion of semen, and
                    of those ova only which, having lost their way to the abdominal aperture of the
                    oviduct, would be retained in the abdominal cavity. In those Teleosteans which
                    lack an oviduct a single porus genitalis opens behind the vent.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Mouth.—</hi> The mouth of fishes shows extreme variation with
                    regard to form, size, and position. Generally opening in front, it may be turned
                    upwards, or it may lie at the lower side of the snout, as in most
                    Chondropterygians, sturgeons, and some Teleosteans. In most fishes the jaws are
                    covered by the skin, which, before passing over the jaws, is often folded,
                    forming more or less fleshy lips. In the sharks the skin retains its external
                    character even within the teeth, but in other fishes it changes into a mucous
                    membrane. A tongue may exist as a more or less free and short projection, formed
                    by the glossohyal and a soft covering, or may be entirely absent. Salivary
                    glands and a velum palati are absent in fishes.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Teeth.—</hi> With regard to the dentition, the class of fishes
                    offers an amount of variation such as is not found in any of the other classes
                    of vertebrates. As the teeth form one of the most important elements in the
                    classification of fishes, their special arrangement and form will be referred to
                    in the account of the various families and genera. Whilst not a few fishes are
                    entirely edentulous, in others most of the bones of the buccal cavity, or some
                    of them, may be toothed, as the bones of the jaws, the palatines, pterygoids,
                    vomers, basi-sphenoid, glossohyal, branchial arches, upper and lower
                    pharyngeals. In others teeth may be found fixed in some portion of the buccal
                    membrane without being supported by underlying bone or cartilage; or the teeth
                    have been developed in membrane overlying one of the dentigerous bones
                    mentioned, without having become anchylosed to the bone. When the tooth is fixed
                    to the bone the attachment has generally been effected by the ossification of
                    the bone of the tooth, but in some fishes a process of the bone projects into
                    the cavity of the tooth; in others the teeth are implanted in alveoli. In these,
                    again, frequently a process of bone rises from the bottom, on which the tooth
                    rests.</p>
                <p>Many of the class, especially predatory fishes, with long, lancet-shaped teeth,
                    have all or some of these capable of being bent towards the interior of the
                    mouth. Such “hinged” teeth resume at once the upright position when pressure is
                    removed from them. They are, however, depressible in one direction only, thus
                    offering no obstacle to the ingress, while they oppose the egress of prey. Mr C.
                    S. Tomes has shown that the means by which this mechanism is worked are
                    different in different fishes; for, whilst in the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Pediculati</hi> and Gadoids (hake) the elasticity resides solely in the tissue
                    of the hinge (the tooth being as resilient as ever after everything else is
                    severed), in the pike the hinge is not in the least endowed with elasticity, but
                    the bundles of fibres proceeding from the interior of the dentine cap are
                    exceedingly elastic.</p>
                <p>The teeth may be, and generally are, very different as regards size or form in
                    the different parts of the mouth; they may be also different according to the
                    age or sex of the fish <hi rend="italic">(Raia).</hi> The teeth may be few in
                    number and isolated, or placed in a single, double, or triple series, distant
                    from one another or closely set; they may form narrow or broad bands, or patches
                    of various forms. As regards form, they may be cylindrical or conical, pointed,
                    straight, or curved, with or without an angular bend near their base; some are
                    compressed laterally or from the front backwards (the latter may be triangular
                    in shape, or truncated at the top like the incisors of mammals); they may have
                    one apex (cusp) only, or be bi-or tri-lobate (bi-or tri-cuspid), or may <pb
                    break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit12newyrich/page/n672/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0912-0672-0655"/> have the margins denticulated or serrated.
                    Compressed teeth may be confluent, and form a cutting edge in both jaws, which
                    assume the shape of a parrot’s beak. In some the apex is hooked or provided with
                    barbs. Again, some teeth are broad, with flat or convex surface, like molar
                    teeth. With regard to size, the finest teeth are like fine flexible bristles,
                    ciliiform or setiform; or, if very short and anchylosed to the bone, they appear
                    only as inconspicuous asperities of the bone. Very fine conical teeth arranged
                    in a band are termed villiform teeth; when they are coarser, or mixed with
                    coarser teeth, they are cardlike (dents en râpe or en cardes); molar-like teeth
                    of very small size are termed granular.</p>
                <p>In all fishes the teeth are shed and renewed during the whole course of their
                    life. In fishes which have compound teeth, as the <hi rend="italic">Dipnoi,</hi>
                    Chimaeroids, <hi rend="italic">Scari,</hi> Gymnodonts, as well as in those which
                    have apparently permanent teeth, as in the saw of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Pristis,</hi> the detrition of the surface is made up by a constant growth of
                    the tooth from its base. When the teeth are implanted in alveoli, they are
                    generally succeeded by others in the vertical direction; but in other forms they
                    succeed one another side by side. In the majority of fishes the new tooth is not
                    developed (as in reptiles and mammals) in a diverticulum of the sac of its
                    predecessor, but, like it, from the free surface of the buccal membrane.
                    Generally there are more than one tooth growing which are in various stages of
                    development, destined each to replace the others in function. This is very
                    conspicuous in sharks, in which the whole phalanx of their numerous teeth is
                    ever marching slowly forwards (or in some backwards), in rotatory progress, over
                    the alveolar border of the jaw, the teeth being successively cast off after
                    having reached the outer margin and fulfilled for a longer or shorter period
                    their special function.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"

                    rend="italic">Intestines.—</hi> The intestinal tract is divided into four
                    portions,—the oesophagus, the stomach, the small and the large intestine; two or
                    more of these divisions may coalesce in fishes and become indistinguishable. But
                    it is characteristic of the class that the urinary apertures are constantly
                    situated behind the termination of the intestinal tract.</p>
                <p>In <hi rend="italic">Branchiostoma</hi> the whole intestinal tract is straight,
                    and coated with a ciliated mucous membrane. The liver is represented by a
                    green-coloured coecal diverticulum of the stomachic dilatation. In the <hi
                    rend="italic">Cyclostomi</hi> the intestinal tract is likewise straight, and
                    without clearly defined divisions.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Palaeichthyes</hi> show differences in the structure of
                    their intestinal tract as considerable as are found among the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Teleostei,</hi> but they have this in common that the absorbent surface of
                    their intestine is enlarged by the development of a spiral valve, evidence of
                    the presence of which in extinct <hi rend="italic">Palaeichthyes</hi> is still
                    preserved in the fossilized faeces or coprolites, so abundant in some of the
                    older strata. Ï In Chondropterygians (fig. 46) the stomach is divided into a
                    cardiac and a pyloric portion, the former frequently terminating in a blind sac,
                    and the latter varying in length. The pyloric portion is bent both at its origin
                    and its end, and is separated from the short duodenum (called <hi rend="italic"
                    >Bursa eηtiaηα</hi> in these fishes) by a valve; the ductus hepaticus and ductus
                    pancreaticus enter the duodenum. This is succeeded by the straight intestine,
                    provided with the spiral valve, the coils of which may either be longitudinal
                    and wound vertically about the axis of the intestine, as in <hi rend="italic"
                    >Carcharias, Galeocerdο, Thalassorhinus,</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >Zygcena,</hi> or they may be transverse to that axis, as in the other genera.
                    The number of gyrations in the latter case varies; there may be as many as
                    forty. The short rectum passes into a cloaca, which contains also the orifices
                    of the urogenital ducts. Only the beginning and end of the intestinal tract are
                    fixed by mesenterial folds.</p>
                <p>The structure of the intestinal tract of Teleosteous fishes is subject to so
                    numerous modifications that we should go beyond the limits of the present
                    article were we to attempt to enter into details. Great differences in this
                    respect may be found even in groups of the same natural families. Frequently the
                    intestinal tract remains of nearly the same width throughout its course, and
                    only the entrance of the various ducts serves as a guide for the distinction of
                    its divisions. An intestine of such uniform width may be straight and short, as
                    in <hi rend="italic">Scombresocidae, Symbranchidoe,</hi> or it may be more or
                    less convoluted and long, as in many <hi rend="italic">Cyprinidoe,</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Doradina,</hi> &amp;c. On the whole, carnivorous fishes have a
                    much shorter and simpler intestinal tract than the herbivorous.</p>
                <p>In the majority of Teleosteans, however, the oesophagus, stomach, duodenum, small
                    intestine, and rectum can be more or less clearly distinguished, even
                    externally.</p>
                <p>There are two predominant forms of the stomach, intermediate forms, however,
                    being numerous. In the first, the siphonal, it presents the form of a bent tube
                    or canal, one-half of the horse-shoe being the cardiac, the other the pyloric
                    portion. In the second, the caecal, the cardiac division is prolonged into a
                    long descending blind sac, the cardiac and pyloric openings of the stomach lying
                    close together <hi rend="italic">{Clupea,</hi><hi rend="italic">Scomber,</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Thynnus,</hi> &amp;c.).</p>
                <p>The duodenum always receives the hepatic and pancreatic secretions, and also
                    those of the appendices pyloricae, which, in varying numbers (from 1 to 200),
                    are of very common occurrence in Teleosteans. They vary also in length and
                    width, and whilst the narrowest serve only as secretory organs, the widest are
                    frequently found filled with the same contents as the intestine.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Glands.—</hi> The liver of fishes is distinguished by the great
                    quantity of fluid fat (oil) which it contains. The gall-bladder is but rarely
                    absent; it is attached to the right lobe, or towards the centre; in some fishes,
                    however, it is detached from the liver and connected with it by the cystic duct
                    only. The bile may be conveyed by one or more hepatic ducts into a common duct
                    which is continued towards the gall-bladder as ductus cysticus, and towards the
                    duodenum as ductus choledochus; or some of the hepatic ducts enter the
                    gall-bladder directly, or the duodenum directly, without communicating with the
                    common duct. Individual variations in this respect are of common occurrence.</p>

                <p>Fishes breathe the air dissolved in water by means of gills or branchiae. The

                    temperature, or in which the air absorbed by them is not replaced, are speedily
                    suffocated. The absorption of oxygen by fishes is comparatively small; it has
                    been calculated that a man consumes fifty thousand times more than is required
                    by a tench. Some fishes, however, evidently require a much larger supply of
                    oxygen than others: eels and carps, and other fishes of similar low vitality,
                    can survive removal from their element for days, the small quantity of moisture
                    retained in their gillcavity being sufficient to sustain life, whilst other
                    fishes, especially such as have very wide gill-openings, are immediately
                    suffocated after being taken out of the water. In some fishes noted for their
                    muscular activity, like the <hi rend="italic">Scombridoe,</hi> the respiratory
                    process is so energetic as to raise the temperature of their blood far beyond
                    that of the medium in which they live. A few fishes, especially such as are
                    periodically compelled to live in water thickened into mud by desiccation and
                    vitiated by decomposing substances, breathe atmospheric air, and generally have
                    special contrivances for this purpose. These are so much habituated to breathing
                    air that many of them, even when brought into pure water of normal condition,
                    are obliged to rise to the surface at frequent intervals to take in a quantity
                    of air, and, if they are kept beneath the surface by means of a gauze net, they
                    perish from suffocation. The special contrivances consist of additional
                    respiratory organs, lodged in cavities either adjoining the gill-cavity or
                    communicating with the ventral side of the oesophagus, or of the air-bladder
                    which enters upon respiratory functions <hi rend="italic">{Dipnoi, Lepidοsteus,
                    Amia).</hi></p>
                <p>The water used by fishes for respiration is received by the mouth, driven to the
                    gills by an action similar to that of swallowing, and expelled by the
                    gill-openings, of which there may be one or several on each side behind the
                    head, or rarely one only in the median line of the ventral surface.</p>
                <p>The gills or branchiae consist essentially of folds of the mucous membrane of the
                    gill-cavity (laminae branchiales), in which the capillary vessels are
                    distributed. In all fishes the gills are lodged in a cavity, but during the
                    embryonic stage the Chondropterygians have the gill-laminae extended into long
                    filaments projecting beyond the gill-cavity, and in a few young Ganoids external
                    gills are superadded to the internal.</p>
                <p>In <hi rend="italic">Branchiostoma</hi> the dilated pharynx is perforated by
                    numerous clefts, supported by cartilaginous rods (fig. 30, Ä). The water passes
                    between these clefts into the peritoneal cavity, and makes its exit by the porus
                    abdominalis, situated considerably in advance of the vent. The water is
                    propelled by cilia.</p>
                <p>In the Cyclostomes the gills of each side are lodged in a series of six or more
                    antero-posteriorly compressed sacs, separated from each other by intervening
                    septa. Each sac communicates by an inner duct with the oesophagus, the water
                    being expelled by an outer duct. In <hi rend="italic">Bdellostomα</hi> each
                    outer duct has a separate opening, but in <hi rend="italic">Myxine</hi> all the
                    outer ducts pass outwards by one common gill-opening on each side. In the
                    lampreys the ducts are short, the outer ones having separate openings (fig. 1).
                    The inner ducts lead into a single diverticulum or bronchus, situated below the
                    oesophagus, blind behind, and communicating in front with the pharynx, where it
                    is provided with two valves by which the regurgitation of the water into the
                    buccal cavity is prevented.</p>
                <p>The same type of branchial organs persists in Chondropterygians, which possess
                    five, rarely six or seven, flattened pouches with transversely plaited walls.
                    The septa between them are supported by cartilaginous filaments rising from the
                    hyoidean and branchial arches. Each pouch opens by a cleft outwards, and by an
                    aperture into the pharynx, without intervening ducts. The anterior wall of the
                    first pouch is supported by the hyoidean arch. Between the posterior wall of the
                    first and the anterior of the second sac, and between the adjacent walls of the
                    succeeding, a branchial arch with its two series of radiating cartilaginous
                    filaments is interposed. Consequently the first and last pouches have one set of
                    gill-laminae only, viz., the first on its posterior and the last on its anterior
                    wall. The so-called spiracles on the upper surface of the head of
                    Chondropterygians must be referred to in connexion with the respiratory organs.
                    They are the external openings of a canal leading on each side into the pharynx,
                    and situated generally close to and behind the orbit. They frequently possess
                    valves or an irregularly indented margin, and are found in all species during
                    the embryonic stage, but it is only in some that they remain persistent. The
                    spiracles arc tiιe remains of the first visceral cleft of the embryo, and in the
                    foetal state long branchial filaments have been observed to protrude as from the
                    other branchial clefts.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Holocephali</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Ganοidei</hi> show
                    numerous deviations from the Chondropterygian type, all leading towards the
                    Teleosteans. As a whole they take an intermediate position between the preceding
                    types and the Teleosteans, but they show a great variation among themselves, and
                    have in common only the imperfect separation of the branchial sacs and the
                    presence of a single outer branchial aperture. ·</p>
                <p>In the <hi rend="italic">Teleostei</hi> the gills with their supporting branchial
                    arches lie in one undivided cavity; more or less wide clefts between the arches
                    lead from the pharynx to the gills, and a more or less wide opening gives exit
                    to the water after it has washed the gills. The interbranchial clefts have
                    sometimes nearly the same extent as the branchial arches; sometimes they are
                    reduced to small openings, the integuments stretching from one arch to the
                    other. Sometimes there is no cleft behind the fourth arch, in which case this
                    arch has only a uniserial gill developed. The gill-opening likewise varies much
                    in its extent, and when reduced to a foramen may be situated at any part of the
                    posterior boundary of the head. In the <hi rend="italic">Symbranchidoe</hi> the
                    gillopenings coalesce into a single narrow slit in the median line of the
                    isthmus. In the majority of Teleosteans the integument of the concave side of
                    the branchial arches develops a series of horny protuberances of various form,
                    the so-called gill-rakers. These serve to catch any solid corpuscles or
                    substances which would be carried into the gill-cavity with the water. In some
                    fishes they are setiform, and make a complete sieve, whilst in others they are
                    merely rough tubercles, the action of which must be very incomplete if they have
                    any function at all.</p>
                <p>The majority of Teleosteans possess four complete gills.</p>
                <p>The gills of the Teleosteans, as well as of the Ganoids, are supported by a
                    series of solid cartilaginous or horny pointed rods, arranged along the convex
                    edges of the branchial arches. Arches <pb break="no"

                    rods, one along each edge; those with uniserial gills bear one row of rods only.
                    The rods are not part of the arch, but fixed in its integument, the several rods
                    of the one row corresponding to those of the other, forming pairs (feuillet,
                    Cuvier) (fig. 47). Each rod is covered by a loose mucous membrane passing from
                    one rod to its fellow opposite, which again is finely plaited transversely, the
                    extent of surface being greatly increased by these plaits. In most <hi
                    rend="italic">Teleostei</hi> the branchial lamellae are compressed, and taper
                    towards their free end, but in the Lophobranchs their base is attenuated and the
                    end enlarged. The mucous membrane contains the finest terminations of the
                    vessels, which, being very superficial, impart a blood-red colour to living
                    gills. The arteria branchialis, the course of which lies in the open canal in
                    the convexity of the branchial arch, emits a branch (a) for every pair of
                    lamellae, which ascends (δ) along the inner edge of the lamella, and supplies
                    every one of the transverse plaits with a branchlet. The latter break up into a
                    fine network of capillaries, from which the oxygenized blood is collected into
                    venous branchlets, returning by the venous branch (&lt;Z), which occupies the
                    outer edge of the lamella.</p>
                <p>The so-called pseudobranchiae (fig. 48) are the remains of an anterior gill which
                    had respiratory functions during the embryonic life of the individuals. By ⅞
                    change in the circulatory system these organs have lost those functions, and
                    appear in the adult fish as retia mirabilia, as they receive oxygenized blood,
                    which, after having passed through their capillary system, is carried to other
                    parts of the head. In <hi rend="italic">Paloeichthyes</hi> the pseudobranchia is
                    a rete mirabile caroticum for the brain and eye; in Teleosteans a rete mirabile
                    ophthalmicum only. Pseudobranchiae are as frequently absent as present in'
                    Chondropterygians as well as Teleosteans. Among the Ganoids, the organs occur in
                    <hi rend="italic">Ceratod/us,</hi><hi rend="italic">Acipenser,</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Polyodon,</hi><hi rend="italic">aenàLepidosteus,</hi> and are

                    Poly-ρterus,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Amia.</hi></p>
                <p>In Chondropterygians and sturgeons the pseudobranchiae are situated within the
                    spiracles; in those in which spiracles have become obliterated, the
                    pseudobranchiae lie on the suspensorium, hidden below cellular tissue; but
                    pseudobranchiae are not necessarily coexistent with spiracles. In the other
                    Ganoids and Teleosteans the pseudobranchiae (fig. 48, <hi rend="italic">h)</hi>
                    are within the gill-cavity, near the base of the gill-cover; in <hi
                    rend="italic">Ceratodus</hi> even rudiments of the gillrakers (a∕, <hi
                    rend="italic">xh)</hi> belonging to this embryonic gill are preserved, part of
                    them (x") being attached to the hyoid arch. Pseudobranchiae are frequently
                    hidden below the integuments of the gill-cavity, and have the appearance of a
                    glandular body rather than of a gill.</p>

                <p>bladder, one of the most characteristic organs of fishes, is a hollow sac, formed
                    of several tunics, containing gas, situated in the abdominal cavity, but outside
                    the peritoneal sac, entirely closed or communicating by a duct with the
                    intestinal tract. Being compressible, its special functions consist in altering
                    the specific gravity of the fish or in changing the centre of gravity. In a few
                    fishes it assumes the function of the organ of higher vertebrates of which it is
                    the homologue —viz., of a lung. The gas contained in the air-bladder is secreted
                    from its inner surface. In most freshwater fishes it consists of nitrogen, with
                    a very small quantity of oxygen and a trace of carbonic acid; in sea-fishes,
                    especially those living at some depth, oxygen predominates, as much as 87 per
                    cent, having been found. Davy found in the air-bladder of a fresh-run salmon a
                    trace of carbonic acid and 10 per cent, of oxygen, the remainder of the gas
                    being nitrogen.</p>

                    >Holocephali,</hi> but occurs in all Ganoids, in which, besides, its respiratory
                    functions more or less clearly manifest themselves. Its occurrence in
                    Teleosteans is very irregular, closely allied species sometimes differing from
                    each other in this respect; it shows in this subclass the most extraordinary
                    modifications, but has no respiratory function whatever.</p>
                <p>Constantly situated within the abdominal cavity, below the vertebral column, but
                    outside the sac of the peritoneum which covers only its ventral portion, the
                    air-bladder is frequently prolonged into the tail, the prolongation being either
                    single and lodged between the non-united parapophyses, or double and penetrating
                    between the muscles and haemapophyses of each side. In the opposite direction
                    processes of the air-bladder may penetrate into the skull, as has been mentioned
                    above (p. 653). In some fishes the air-bladder is almost loose in the abdominal
                    cavity, whilst in others it adheres most intimately by firm and short tissue to
                    the vertebral column, the walls of the abdomen, and the intestines. In the <hi
                    rend="italic">Cobitina</hi> and many Siluroids it is more or less completely
                    enclosed in osseous capsules formed by the vertebrae.</p>
                <p>There are two tunics in the greater number of air-bladders,—an extremely thin
                    internal one, frequently shining with a silvery lustre, containing crystalline
                    corpuscles, sometimes covered with a pavement-epithelium, and a thicker outer
                    one of a fibrous texture, which sometimes attains to considerable thickness and
                    yields isinglass. The outer wall is strengthened in many fishes by muscular
                    layers for the compression of the whole organ or of some portion of it.</p>
                <p>A distinction has been made between air-bladders which communicate by a duct with
                    the intestinal tract and those which are entirely closed. It is to be
                    remembered, however, that at an early stage of development all air-bladders are
                    provided with such a duct, which in some fishes is more or less completely
                    obliterated, being then represented by a fine ligament only. Air-bladders
                    without duct are found in Acanthopterygians, Pharyngognaths, Anacanths, and
                    Lophobranchs. They may consist of a single cavity, or may be divided by
                    constrictions into two or three chambers situated behind one another; they may
                    consist of two lateral divisions, assuming a horseshoe-like form, or of a single
                    sac with a pair of simple or bifid processes in front or behind. The families of
                    <hi rend="italic">Scioenidoe</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Polynemidoe</hi> possess
                    air-bladders with a most extraordinary development of appendages rising from
                    each side. Air-bladders with a pneumatic duct are found in Ganoids and
                    Physostomes, the duct entering the dorsal side of the intestinal tract, with the
                    exception of <hi rend="italic">Polypterus</hi> and the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Dipnoi,</hi> in which it enters on the ventral side of the oesophagus. In most
                    cases the orifice is in the oesophagus, but in some it is in the cardiac portion
                    of the stomach, as in <hi rend="italic">Acipenser,</hi> or in its blind sac, as
                    in many Clupeoids. The air-bladder may be single, or may consist of two
                    divisions situated one behind the other (fig. 45); its inner surface may be
                    perfectly smooth, or it may form manifold pouches and cells. If two divisions
                    are present the anterior possesses a middle elastic membrane which is absent in
                    the posterior; each division has a muscular layer, by which it can be separately

                    posterior may be driven into the elastic anterior division, and <hi
                    rend="italic">vice versa.</hi> The posterior division being provided with the
                    ductus pneumaticus does not require the elasticity of the anterior.</p>
                <p>Some Siluroids possess a peculiar apparatus for voluntarily exercising a pressure
                    upon the air-bladder. From the first vertebra a process takes its origin on each
                    side, expanding at its end into a large round plate; this is applied to the side
                    of the air-bladder, and by pressing upon it expels the air through the duct; the
                    small muscle moving the plate rises from the skull. The connexion of the
                    air-bladder with the organ of hearing in some Physostomes has been described
                    above, p.</p>
                <p>653.</p>
                <p>In the modifications of the air-bladder hitherto mentioned, the chief and most
                    general function is a mechanical one: this organ serves to regulate the specific
                    gravity of the fish, to aid it in maintaining a particular level in the water,
                    in rising or sinking, in raising the front part of its body or depressing it, as
                    occasion may require. Yet a secretion of gas from the blood into its cavity must
                    take place; and if this be so, it is not at all impossible that an exchange of
                    gases between the two kinds of blood is also effected by means of the
                    extraordinary development of retia mirabilia in many air-bladders.</p>
                <p>In all fishes the arteries of the air-bladder take their origin from the aorta or
                    the system of the aorta, and its veins return either to the portal, the
                    vertebral, or the hepatic veins; like the other organs of the abdominal cavity,
                    it receives arterial blood and returns venous blood.</p>
                <p>Whilst the air-bladders of some Ganoids, anatomically as well as functionally,
                    closely adhere to the Teleosteous type, that of <hi rend="italic">Λmia</hi> is
                    more cellular and lunglike in its interior than the Teleosteous air-bladder, and
                    <hi rend="italic">Polypterus</hi> approaches the <hi rend="italic">Dipnoi,</hi>
                    not only in having a laterally divided air-bladder, but also in its pneumatic
                    duct entering the ventral side of the oesophagus. The air-bladder of the <hi
                    rend="italic">Dipnoi</hi> possesses still further the anatomical characteristics
                    of a lung and assumes its functions, though, as it coexists with gills, only
                    periodically or in an auxiliary manner. The ductus pneumaticus is a membranous
                    bronchus, entering the ventral side of the oesophagus, and provided at its
                    entrance with a glottis. In <hi rend="italic">Ceratodus</hi> (fig. 49) the lung
                    is still a single cavity, but with a symmetrical arrangement of its internal
                    pouches; it has no pulmonary artery, but receives branches from the arteria
                    coeliaca. Finally, in <hi rend="italic">Lepidosiren</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >Protopterus</hi> the lung is completely divided into lateral halves, and by its
                    cellular structure approaches most nearly that of a reptile; it is supplied with
                    venous blood by a true pulmonary artery.</p>

                <p>The blood-corpuscles of fishes, with one exception, are of an elliptic shape;
                    this exception is <hi rend="italic">Petromyzoη,</hi> which possesses circular,

                <p>Fishes, in common with the other vertebrates, are provided with a complete
                    circulation for the body, with another equally complete for the organs of
                    respiration, and with a particular abdominal circulation, terminating at the
                    liver by means of the vena portae; but the peculiar characteristic consists in
                    this, that the branchial circulation alone is provided at its base with a
                    muscular apparatus or heart, corresponding to the right half of the heart of
                    mammalia and birds.</p>
                <p>The heart is situated between the branchial and abdominal cavities, between the
                    two halves of the scapulary arch,—rarely farther behind, as in <hi rend="italic"
                    >Symbranchidoe.</hi> It is enclosed in a pericardium, generally separated
                    entirely from the abdominal cavity by a diaphragma, which is, in fact, the
                    anterior portion of the peritoneum, strengthened by aponeurotic fibres. In some
                    fishes, however, there is a communication between the pericardial and peritoneal
                    sacs, viz., in the Chondropterygians and <hi rend="italic">Acipenser,</hi>
                    whilst in the Myxinoids the pericardial sac is merely a continuation of the
                    peritoneum.</p>
                <p>Relatively to the size of the body, the heart is very small. It consists of three
                    divisions :—the atrium, with a large sinus venosus into which the veins enter;
                    the ventricle; and a conical hollow swelling at the beginning of the arterial
                    system, the structure of which forms one of the most important characters used
                    in the classification of fishes. In all <hi rend="italic">Paloeichthyes</hi>
                    (figs. 50 and 51) this swelling is still a division of the pulsating heart,
                    being provided with a thick muscular stratum; it is not separated from the
                    ventricle by two valves opposite to each other, but its interior is fitted with
                    a plurality of valves, arranged in transverse series more or less numerous in
                    the various groups of the subclass. <hi rend="italic">Lepidosiren</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">Protopterus</hi> offer an example of a modification of this
                    valvular arrangement, their valves being longitudinal, each valve in fact being
                    formed by the confluence of several smaller ones situated behind one another.
                    This Palaeichthyan type is called conus arteriosus.</p>
                <p>In Cyclostomes and Teleosteans (fig. 52) the enlargement is a swelling of the
                    artery, without muscular stratum and. without contractility; with the exception
                    of the Myxinoids, its walls are thick and fibrous with many trabeculae and
                    pouches, but it has no valves in its interior, and is separated <pb break="no"

                    other. This Teleostean type is called bulbus aortae.</p>
                <p>The sinus venosus sends the whole of the venous blood by a single orifice of its
                    anterior convexity into the atrium; two thin membranous valvules turned towards
                    the atrium prevent the blood from re-entering the sinus. A pair of other valves
                    between the atrium and ventricle have the same function. The walls of the
                    ventricle are strong, and, internally, it is furnished with powerful fleshy
                    trabeculae.</p>
                <p>The bulbus or conus arteriosus is prolonged into the branchial artery, which soon
                    divides, sending off a branch to each branchial arch. On returning from the
                    respiratory organ the branchial veins assume the structure and functions of
                    arteries. Several branches are sent off to different portions of the head and to
                    the heart, but the main trunks unite to form the great artery which carries the
                    blood to the viscera and to 1 all the parts of the trunk and tail, and which,
                    therefore, represents the aorta of higher animals.</p>
                <p>The circulatory system of <hi rend="italic">Branchiostoma</hi> and of the <hi
                    rend="italic">Dipnoi</hi> shows essential differences from that of other fishes.
                    <hi rend="italic">Branchiostoma</hi> is the only fish which does not possess a
                    muscular heart, several cardinal portions of its vascular system being
                    contractile. A great vein extends forwards along the caudal region below the
                    notochord, and exhibits contractility in a forward direction; it is bent
                    anteriorly, passing into another tube-like pulsatory trunk, the branchial heart,
                    which runs along the middle of the base of the pharynx, sending off branches on
                    each side to the branchiae; each of these branches has a small contractile
                    dilatation (bulbillus) at its base. The two anterior branches pass directly into
                    the aorta; the others are branchial arteries, the blood of which returns by
                    branchial veins emptying into the aorta. The blood of the intestinal veins is
                    collected in a contractile tube, the portal vein, below the intestine, and
                    distributed over the rudimentary liver. Of all other fishes, the portal vein is
                    contractile in Myxinoids only.</p>
                <p>In <hi rend="italic">Dipnoi</hi> a rudimentary partition of the heart into a
                    right and a left division has been observed; this is limited to the ventricle in

                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Urinary</hi><hi rend="smallcaps">Organs.</hi></p>
                <p>In <hi rend="italic">Branchiostoma</hi> no urinary organs have been found.</p>
                <p>In Myxinoids these organs are of very primitive structure; they consist of a pair
                    of ducts, extending from the urogenital porus through the abdominal cavity. Each
                    duct sends off at regular intervals from its outer side a short wide branch (the
                    uriniferous tube), which communicates by a narrow opening with a blind sac. At
                    the bottom of this sac there is a small vaso-ganglion (Malpighian corpuscle), by
                    which the urine is secreted.</p>
                <p>In the lampreys the kidneys form a continuous glandlike body, with irregular
                    detached small portions. The ureters coalesce before they terminate in the
                    urogenital papilla.</p>
                <p>In Chondropterygians the kidneys occupy the posterior half or tworthirds of the
                    back, of the abdominal cavity, outside the sac of the peritoneum (as in all
                    fishes), which forms a firm tendinous horizontal septum. The kidneys of the two
                    sides are never confluent, and generally show a convoluted or lobulated surface.
                    The ureters are short; each is dilated into a pouch, and communicating with its
                    fellow terminates by a single urethra (which also receives the vasa deferentia)
                    behind the end of the rectum in the large common cloaca.</p>
                <p>In Ganoids the kidneys occupy a similar position as in Chondropterygians, but
                    these fishes differ considerably with regard to the termination and the
                    arrangement of the ends of the urogenital ducts.</p>
                <p>The kidneys of Teleosteans are likewise situated outside the peritoneal cavity,
                    immediately below some part of the vertebral column, and vary.exceedingly with
                    regard to form and extent. Sometimes they reach from the skull to between the
                    muscles of the tail, sometimes they are limited to the foremost part of the
                    abdominal cavity (in advance of the diaphragm), but generally their extent
                    corresponds to that of the abdominal portion of the vertebral column. The
                    ureters terminate, either separate or united, in a urinary bladder, varying in
                    shape, which opens by a short urethra behind the vent. The urinary opening may
                    be separate from or confluent with that of the genital ducts, and is frequently
                    placed on a more or less prominent papilla (papilla urogenitalis). If separate,
                    the urinary opening is behind the <pb break="no"

                    extremity is perforated by the urethra, the genital opening being situated
                    nearer the base. A few Teleosteans show an arrangement similar to that of
                    Chondropterygians and <hi rend="italic">Dipnoi,</hi> the urogenital openings

                    Reproduction.</hi></p>
                <p>All fishes are dioecious, or of distinct sex. Instances of so-called
                    hermaphroditism are, with the exception of <hi rend="italic">Serranus,</hi>
                    abnormal individual peculiarities; such have been observed in the cod-fish, in
                    some <hi rend="italic">Pleuronectidoe,</hi> and in the herring. Either the
                    generative organ of one side was found to be male and that of the other female,
                    or the organ of one or both sides was observed to have been developed partly
                    into an ovary, partly into a testicle. In the European species of <hi
                    rend="italic">Serranus</hi> a testicle-like body is attached to the lower part
                    of the ovary; but many specimens of this genus are undoubtedly males, having
                    normally developed testicles only.</p>
                <p>The majority of fishes are oviparous (comparatively few viviparous), the embryos
                    being developed either in the ovarium or in some dilated portion of the oviduct.
                    In viviparous fishes actual copulation takes place, and the males of most of
                    them are provided with copulatory or intromittent organs. In oviparous fishes
                    the generative products are, during sexual excitement, discharged into the
                    water, a very small quantity of semen being sufficient for effectual
                    impregnation of a number of ova dispersed in a considerable quantity of
                    water,—circumstances which render artificial impregnation more practicable than
                    in any other class of animals.</p>
                <p>In <hi rend="italic">Branchiostoma</hi> the generative organs occupy the ventral
                    side of the abdominal cavity, into which they discharge their contents. No ducts
                    are developed in either sex.</p>
                <p>In the Cyclostomes the generative organ is single, and fixed to or suspended from
                    the median line of the back of the visceral cavity by a duplicature of the
                    peritoneum (mesoarium), the testicle and ovary being distinguishable by their
                    contents only. These escape by dehiscence of the cells or capsules and rupture
                    of the peritoneal covering into the abdominal cavity, and are expelled, by
                    reciprocal pressure of the intertwined sexes, through the porus genitalis.</p>
                <p>The ova of the lampreys are small and globular, like those of Teleosteans. Those
                    of <hi rend="italic">Myxine</hi> have a very peculiar shape when mature; they
                    are of an oval form, about 15 millimetres long and 8 millimetres broad,
                    enveloped in a horny case, which at each end is provided with a bundle of short
                    threads, each thread ending in a triple hook. Whilst in the mesoarial fold, the
                    eggs are attached to one another by means of these hooks, and after being
                    expelled they probably fix themselves by the same means to other objects. As in
                    all fishes producing ova of large size, the number of ova matured in one season
                    is but small.</p>
                <p>In Teleosteans the generative organs are comparatively large. In some families
                    the ovaries are without a closed covering and without oviducts, as in <hi
                    rend="italic">Salmonidce, Galaxiida?,</hi><hi rend="italic">Notopteridae,
                    Muroenidoe,</hi> and others. The surface of such an open ovary—as, for instance,
                    that of the salmon—is transversely plaited, the ova being developed in capsules
                    in the stroma of the laminae; after rupture of the capsules the mature ova drop
                    into the abdominal cavity, and are expelled by the porus genitalis. The ovaries
                    of the other Teleosteans are closed sacs, continued into oviducts. Frequently
                    such ovaries coalesce into a single body, or one in which the division is
                    effected internally only by a more or less complete septum. In the viviparous
                    Teleosteans the embryos are developed within the ovary, notably in the <hi

                <p>The ova of Teleosteous fishes are extremely variable in size, quite independently
                    of the size of the parent species. The ova of large and small individuals of the
                    same species, of course, do not differ in size; but, on the whole, larger
                    individuals produce a greater number of ova than smaller ones of the same
                    species. The larger the size of the ova is in a species, the smaller is the
                    number produced during one season. The ova of the eel are almost microscopic.
                    The numbers of ova in the small-sized roe of the herring, lump-fish, halibut,
                    and codfish have been estimated respectively at 25,000, 155,000, 3,500,000, and
                    9,344,000. Larger in size and fewer in number are those of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Antem</hi><hi rend="italic">narius, Salmo, Aspredo,</hi> Lophobranchs, &amp;c.
                    Those of <hi rend="italic">Gastrosteus</hi> are comparatively the largest; and
                    the Siluroid genus <hi rend="italic">Arius,</hi> the males of which take care of
                    their progeny, produces ova from 5 to 10 millimetres in diameter. The ova of all
                    Teleosteans are perfectly globular and soft-shelled. Teleosteans without oviduct
                    deposit them separated from one another; whilst in many Teleosteans with an
                    oviduct, the ova are enveloped in a glutinous substance, secreted by its glands,
                    swelling in the water and forming lumps or chords, in which the ova are
                    aggregated.</p>
                <p>Instances of the female taking care of her progeny are extremely rare in fishes.
                    At present only two examples are known, that of the Siluroid genus <hi
                    rend="italic">Aspredo,</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">Soleno-. stoma.</hi> In
                    theformer (fig. 55), during the time of propagation, the integuments of the
                    lower side of the flat trunk of the female assume a soft and spongy texture.
                    After having deposited the eggs, the female attaches them to and presses them
                    into the spongy integument, by merely lying over them. She carries them on her
                    belly, as the Surinam toad <hi rend="italic">(Pipa)</hi> carries her ova on her
                    back. When the eggs are hatched the excrescence on the skin disappears, and the
                    abdomen becomes as smooth as before. In <hi rend="italic">Solenostoma</hi> the
                    inner side of the long and broad ventral fins coalesces with the integuments of
                    the body, a large pouch being formed for the reception of the eggs. There is a
                    peculiar provision for the retention of the eggs in the sac, and probably for
                    the attachment of the embryo. The inner walls of the sac are lined with long
                    filaments, arranged in series along the ventral rays, and more numerous and
                    longer at the base ot the rays than in the middle of their length, behind which
                    they disappear entirely.</p>
                <p>The testicles of the Teleosteans are always paired, and occupy the same position
                    as the ovaries. Their size varies extraordinarily at the different seasons of
                    the year. Vasa deferentia are constant. In the males of viviparous Teleosteans
                    the urogenital papilla is frequently enlarged, and clearly serves as an
                    intromittent organ.</p>
                <p>Many <hi rend="italic">Teleostei</hi> take care of their progeny, but with the
                    exception of <hi rend="italic">Aspredo</hi> and <hi rend="italic"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0912-0678-0661"/> it is the male on which this duty devolves. In
                    some, as in <hi rend="italic">Cottus, Gastrosteus, Cycloptemis, Antennarius,
                    Ophiocephalus, Cαllichthys,</hi> the male constructs with more or less skill a
                    nest, and jealously guards the ova deposited in it by the female. The male of
                    some species of <hi rend="italic">Arius</hi> carries the ova (fig. 54) about
                    with him in his capacious pharynx. The species of <hi rend="italic">Chrοmis</hi>
                    inhabiting the sea of Galilee are said to take care of their ova in the same
                    manner. And, finally, in the Lophobranchs, nature has aided this instinct by the
                    development of a pouch or the abdomen or lower side of the tail. In the <hi
                    rend="italic">Syngnathidoe</hi> this pouch is formed by a fold of the skin
                    developed from each side of the trunk and tail, the free margins of the fold
                    being firmly united in the median line, whilst the eggs are being hatched in the
                    inside of the pouch. In <hi rend="italic">Hippocampus</hi> the pouch is
                    completely closed, with a narrow anterior opening.</p>
                <p><hi rend="subscript"> e</hi> The genital organs of Ganoids show diversity of
                    structure similar to that found in Teleosteans, but on the whole they approach
                    the Batrachian type. The ovaries are not closed, except in <hi rend="italic"
                    >Lepidosiren</hi>; all Ganoids possess oviducts. In the sturgeons the oviduct as
                    well as the vas deferens is represented by a funnel-shaped prolongation of the
                    peritoneum, which communicates with the wide ureter. The inner aperture of the
                    funnel is on a level with the middle of the testicle or ovary, while the outer
                    is within the ureter; and it is a noteworthy fact that only at certain periods
                    of the life of the fish is this outer aperture found to be open,—at other times
                    the peritoneal funnel appears as a closed blind sac within the ureter. The mode
                    of passage of the semen into the funnel is not known.</p>
                <p>In <hi rend="italic">Polypterus</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Amia</hi> proper
                    oviducts, with abdominal apertures in about the middle of the abdominal cavity,
                    are developed; they coalesce with the ureters close to the common urogenital
                    aperture.</p>
                <p>In <hi rend="italic">Cerαtodus</hi> a long convoluted oviduct extends to the
                    foremost limit of the abdominal cavity, where it opens by a slit at a
                    considerable distance from the front end of the long ovary; this aperture is
                    closed in sexually immature specimens. The oviducts unite close to their common
                    opening in the cloaca. During their passage through the oviduct the ova receive
                    a gelatinous covering secreted by its mucous membrane. This is probably also the
                    case in <hi rend="italic">Lepidosiren,</hi> which possesses a convoluted oviduct
                    with secretory glands in the middle of its length.</p>
                <p>The ova of Ganoids, so far as they are known at present, are small, and enveloped
                    in a gelatinous substance. In the sturgeon as many as 7,635,200 have been
                    counted. Those of <hi rend="italic">Lepidosteus</hi> seem to be the largest,
                    measuring 5 millimetres in diameter with their envelope, and 3 millimetres
                    without it. They are deposited singly, like those of newts.</p>
                <p>In Chondropterygians (and <hi rend="italic">HolocephaH)</hi> the organs of
                    reproduction assume a more compact form, and are more free owing to a lengthened
                    attachment to the back of the abdominal cavity. The ovaries of the majority are
                    paired (single in the <hi rend="italic">Carchariidae</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >Scylliidoe,</hi> one remaining undeveloped). But the oviducts are always
                    paired, with a common aperture beginning immediately behind the diaphragma. They
                    consist of two divisions, separated by a circular valve; the upper is narrow,
                    and is provided within its coats with a gland which secretes the leathery
                    envelope in which most of the Chondropterygian ova are enclosed; the lower forms
                    the uterine dilatation in which the embryos of the viviparous species are
                    developed. Generally the vitelline sac of the embryos is free, and has no
                    connexion with the uterus, which in these cases has merely the function of a
                    protecting pouch; but in <hi rend="italic">Carcharias</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >Must elms lαvis</hi> a placenta uterina is formed, the vascular walls of the
                    vitelline sac forming plaits fitting into those of the membrane of the uterus.
                    The ends of the uteri open into the cloaca by a common ap√rture behind the
                    ureter.</p>
                <p>The testicles are always paired, rounded, and situated in the anterior part of
                    the abdominal cavity, covered by the liver. The vas deferens opens with the
                    urethra in a papilla within the cloaca.</p>
                <p>The so-called claspers of Chondropterygians (fig. 56) are characteristic of all
                    male individuals. They are semiossified appendages of the pubic, with which they
                    are <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit12newyrich/page/n679/mode/1up"

                    regulate their movements. Sometimes they are armed with hook-like osseous
                    excrescences <hi rend="italic">(Selache).</hi> They are irregularly convoluted
                    longitudinally, and, when closely pressed to each other, form a canal open at
                    their extremity. A gland, which discharges a secretion abundantly during the
                    season of propagation, is situated at the base of the canal, and opens into it.
                    It is still doubtful whether the generally adopted opinion that their function
                    consists in holding the female during copulation is correct, or whether they are
                    not rather an intromittent organ, the canal of which conducts, not only the
                    secretion of their proper gland, but also the impregnating fluid.</p>
                <p>The ova of the oviparous Chondropterygians are large, and few in number; they are
                    successively impregnated, and the impregnation must take place before they are
                    invested with a tough leathery envelope, which would be impenetrable to the
                    semen, that is, before they •enter the uterus; therefore, copulation must take
                    place in all these fishes. The form of the egg-shell differs in the various
                    genera; usually (fig. 57) they are flattened and quadrangular, with each of the
                    four corners produced, and frequently prolonged into, lengthy filaments which
                    serve for the attachment of the ova to other fixed objects. In <hi rend="italic"
                    >N^otidanus</hi> the surfaces are crossed by numerous ridges. In <hi
                    rend="italic">Cestracion</hi> the egg is pyriform, with two broad ridges or
                    plates wound edgewise round it, the two ridges forming five spires. The eggs of
                    <hi rend="italic">Callοrhynchus</hi> have received a protective resemblance to a
                    broad-leaved fucus, forming a long depressed ellipse, with a plicated and
                    fringed margin.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Growth and Variation of Fishes.</hi></p>
                <p>Changes of form normally accompanying growth (after absorption of the vitelline
                    sac) are observed in all fishes, but in the majority these affect only the
                    proportional size of the various parts of the body. Relatively to the size of
                    the head, the eyes in young fishes are always larger than in the adult; and
                    again, the head is relatively larger than the body. Changes amounting to
                    metamorphosis have been hitherto observed in <hi rend="italic">Petromyzon</hi>
                    only. In the larval condition <hi rend="italic">(Ammocoetes)</hi> the head is
                    very small, and the toothless buccal cavity is surrounded by a semicircular
                    upper lip. The eyes are extremely small, hidden in a shallow groove; and the
                    vertical fins form a continuous fringe. In the course of three or four years the
                    teeth are developed, and the mouth changes into a perfect suctorial organ; the
                    eyes grow; and the dorsal fin is separated into two divisions. In
                    Malacopterygians and Anacanths the embryonal fringe from which the vertical fins
                    are developed is much longer persistent than in Acanthopterygians. A
                    metamorphosis relating to the respiratory organs, as in Eatra-chians, is
                    indicated in the class of fishes by the external gills with which foetal
                    Plagiostomes and the young of some Ganoids, viz., the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Protopterus</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Polypterus,</hi> are provided.</p>
                <p>One of the most extraordinary changes by which, during growth, the form and
                    position of several important organs are affected, occurs in flat-fishes <hi
                    rend="italic">{Pdeuronectidοd)</hi>; their young are symmetrically formed, with
                    a symmetrical mouth, and with one eye on each side, and therefore keep their
                    body in a vertical position when swimming. As they grow they live more on the
                    bottom, and their body, during rest, assumes a horizontal position; in
                    consequence, the eye of the lower side moves towards the upper, which alone is
                    coloured; and in many genera the mouth is twisted in the opposite direction, so
                    that the bones, muscles, and teeth are much more developed on the blind side
                    than on the coloured. In a great number of other <hi rend="italic"
                    >Teleostei</hi> certain bones of the head show a very different form in the
                    young state. Ossification proceeds in those bones in the direction of lines or
                    radii which project in the form of spines or processes; as the interspaces
                    between these processes are filled with bone, the processes disappear entirely,
                    or at least project much less in the older than in the younger individuals. The
                    young of some fishes may be armed with a long powerful praeopercular or scapular
                    spine, or may show a serrature of which nothing remains in the adult fish except
                    some ridges or radiating lines. These processes seem to serve as weapons of
                    defence during a period in the life of the fish in which it needs them most. In
                    not a few instances a portion of this armature is so much developed that the
                    disappearance of its most projecting parts with the growth of the fish is not
                    only due to its being surrounded by other bone, but partially, at least, caused
                    by absorption. The <hi rend="italic">Carangidoe, Cyttidoe,</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Squamipinηes,</hi><hi rend="italic">Xiphiidoe,</hi> offer instances of such
                    remarkable changes. A fish described, as <hi rend="italic">Tholichthys</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">osseus</hi> (fig. 58) is probably the young of a Cyttoid, the
                    suprascapula, humerus, and praeoperculum forming enormously enlarged plates. In
                    another fish (fig. 59) these bones appear still enlarged, and the frontals
                    develop a remarkably long and curved horn above the orbit. In the <hi
                    rend="italic">Tholichthys-stags</hi> of <hi rend="italic">Pomacanthus</hi>
                    (specimens 10 millimetres long), the frontal bone is prolonged into a straight
                    lancet-shaped process, nearly half as long as the body; the suprascapular and
                    praeopercular processes cover and hide the dorsal and ventral fins. The plates
                    attached to the shoulder-girdle remain persistent until the young fish has
                    assumed the form of the adult; thus they are still visible in young <hi

                    to the Teleosteans of the largest size; in young individuals, 9 millimetres long

                    ciliated; the parietal and praeoperculum are prolonged into long spines; the
                    dorsal and anal fins are a low fringe; and the rentrais make their appearance as
                    a pair of short buds. When 14 millimetres long the young fish has still the same
                    armature on the head, but the dorsal fin has become much higher, and the ventral
                    filaments have grown to a great length. At a third stage, when the fish has
                    attained to a length of 60 millimetres, the upper jaw is considerably prolonged
                    beyond the lower, losing its teeth; the spines of the head are shortened, and
                    the fins assume nearly the shape which they retain in mature individuals. Young
                    sword-fishes without ventral fins <hi rend="italic">(Xiphias)</hi> undergo
                    similar changes; and, besides, their skin is covered with small rough

                    considered by Lütken to be the young of a sun-fish <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Orthagoriscus).</hi> In still very young but more advanced sun-fishes (18 to
                    32</p>
                <p>millimetres) the vertical diameter of the body is not much less than the
                    longitudinal, and may even exceed it; and small conical spines are scattered
                    over its various parts.</p>
                <p>The caudal fin is developed long after the other vertical fins.</p>
                <p>Similar changes take place in a number of other fishes, and in many cases the

                <p>The fins are most frequently subject to changes during growth; but, whilst in
                    some fishes parts of them are prolonged into filaments with age, in others the
                    filaments exist during the early life-periods only; whilst in some a part of the
                    dorsal or of the ventral fins is normally developed in the young only, in others
                    those very parts are peculiar to the mature age. The integuments are similarly
                    altered: in some species the young only have asperities on the skin, in others
                    the young are smooth and the old have a tubercular skin; in some the young only
                    have a hard bony head, in others (some Siluroids) the osseous carapace of the
                    head and neck, as it appears in the adult, is more or less covered with soft
                    skin whilst the fish is young.</p>
                <p>In not a few fishes the external changes bear a relation to the sexual
                    development <hi rend="italic">(Callionymus,</hi> many <hi rend="italic"
                    >Labyrinthici</hi> Cyprinodonts). These secondary sexual differences do not show
                    themselves in the male individual till it commences to enter upon its sexual
                    functions, and it may require two or more seasons before its external
                    characteristics are fully developed. Immature males do not differ externally
                    from the old female. The secondary sexual characters of the male consist
                    principally in the prolongation of some of the fin-rays, or of entire fins, and
                    in <hi rend="italic">Sal-monidοe</hi> in the greater development of the
                    jaw-bones. The coloration of the male is in many fishes much brighter and more
                    variegated than that of the female, but is permanent in comparatively few (as in
                    some <hi rend="italic">Callionymus, Labmιs mirtus);</hi> generally it is
                    acquired immediately before and during the season of propagation only, and lost
                    afterwards. Another periodical change in the integuments, also due to sexual
                    influence and peculiar to the male, is the excrescence of wart-like tubercles on
                    the skin of many Cyprinoids; they are developed chiefly on the head, but
                    sometimes extend over the whole body and all the fins.</p>
                <p>With regard to size, it appears that in all Teleosteous fishes the female is
                    larger than the male; in many Cyprinodonts the male may be only one-sixth of the
                    bulk of the female or even less. In <hi rend="italic">Palaeichthyes</hi> we
                    possess few observations on the relative size of the sexes, but such as have
                    been made tend to show that, if a difference exists at all, the male is
                    generally the larger <hi rend="italic">(Lepidosteus).</hi> In the rays <hi
                    rend="italic">(Raid)</hi> the sexes, after they have attained maturity, differ
                    in the development of dermal spines and the form of the teeth, the female being
                    frequently much rougher than the male. There is much variation in this respect
                    in the different species; but the males are constantly distinguished by an
                    oblong patch of erectile clawlike spines on each pectoral fin, and by having the
                    teeth (all, or only a portion) pointed, and not obtuse, like those of the
                    females. In sharks no secondary sexual differences have been observed; the male
                    <hi rend="italic">Chirnoeridoe</hi> possess a singular comb-like cartilaginous
                    appendage on the top of the head, which can be erected or depressed into a
                    groove, both the appendage and the anterior part of the groove being armed with
                    booklets. The use of this singular organ is not known.</p>

                <p>The majority of <hi rend="italic">Teleostei</hi> are mixogamous—that is, the
                    males and females congregate on the spawning-beds, and, the number of the former
                    being in excess, several males attend to the same female, frequently changing
                    from one to another. The same habit has been observed in <hi rend="italic"
                    >Lepidosteus. Gastrosteus</hi> is truly polygamous, several females depositing
                    their ova in the same nest, guarded by one male only. Some <hi rend="italic"
                    >Teleostei (f)phiocephαlus'),</hi> and probably all Chondropterygians, are
                    monogamous; and it is asserted that the connexion between the pair is not merely
                    temporary, but lasts until they are separated by accident. All those Teleosteans
                    also are probably monogamous which bring forth living young.</p>
                <p>Hybridism is another source of changes and variations within the limits of a
                    species, and is by no means so rare as has been hitherto believed; it is
                    apparently of exceptional occurrence, merely because the life of fishes is more
                    withdrawn from our direct observation than that of terrestrial animals. It has
                    been observed among species of <hi rend="italic">Serranus,</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Pleuronectidoe, Cyprinidoe, Clupeidoe,</hi> and especially <hi rend="italic"
                    >Salmonidoe.</hi> As with other animals, the more certain kinds of fishes are
                    brought under domestication, the more readily do they interbreed with other
                    allied species. It is characteristic of hybrids that their characters are very
                    variable, the degrees of affinity to the one or the other of the parents being
                    inconstant; and, as these hybrids are known readily to breed with either of the
                    parent race, the variations of form, structure, and colour are infinite. Of
                    internal organs the teeth, the gill-rakers, and the pyloric appendages are those
                    particularly affected by such mixture of species.</p>
                <p>Some fishes are known to grow rapidly (in the course of from one to three years)
                    and regularly to a certain size, growth being definitely arrested after the
                    standard has been attained. Such fishes may be called “full-grown,” in the sense
                    in which the term is applied to warm-blooded vertebrates; the sticklebacks, most
                    Cyprinodonts, and many Clupeoids (herring, sprat, pilchard) are examples of this
                    regular kind of growth.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"
                    ><p>This applies only to individuals growing up under normal conditions. Dr Η.
                    A. Meyer has made observations on young herrings. Individuals living in the sea
                    had attained at the end of the third month a length of 45 to 50 millimetres,
                    whilst those reared from artificially impregnated ova were only from 30 to 35
                    millimetres long. When the latter had been supplied with more abundant food,
                    they grew proportionally more rapidly in the following months, so that at the
                    end of the fifth month they had reached the same length as their brethren in the
                    sea, viz., 65 to 70 millimetres. tion of the integuments of many marine fishes,
                    again, is dependent on the nature of their surroundings. In those which
                    habitually hide themselves on the bottom, in sand, between stones, or among
                    seaweed, the colours of the body readily assimilate to those of the vicinity,
                    and are thus an important element in the economy of their life. The changes from
                    one set or tinge of colours to another may be rapid and temporary, or more or
                    less permanent; in some fishes—as in the <hi rend="italic"> Pediculati, </hi> of
                    which the sea-devil, or <hi rend="italic"> Lophias, </hi> and <hi rend="italic">
                    Aηtenηarius </hi> are members—scarcely two individuals are found exactly alike
                    in coloration, and such differences are only too frequently mistaken for
                    specific characters. The changes of colour are produced in two ways,—either by
                    an increase or decrease of the pigment-cells, or chromatophors (black, red,
                    yellow, &amp;c.), in the skin of the fish, or by the rapid contraction or
                    expansion of the chromatophors which happen to be developed. The former change
                    is gradual, like every kind of growth or development; the latter, owing to the
                    great sensitiveness of the cells, is rapid, but certainly involuntary. In many
                    bright-shining fishes—as mackerels, mullets—the colours appear to be brightest
                    in the time intervening between the capture of the fish and its death, a
                    phenomenon clearly due to the pressure of the convulsively-contracted muscles on
                    the chromatophors. External irritation readily excites the chromatophors to
                    expand—a fact unconsciously utilized by fishermen, who, by scaling the red
                    mullet immediately before its death, produce the desired intensity of the red
                    colour of the skin, without which the fish would not be saleable. It does not,
                    however, require such strong measures to prove the sensitiveness of the
                    chromatophors to external irritation, the mere change from darkness into light
                    is sufficient to induce them to contract, the fish appearing paler, and <hi
                    rend="italic"> vice versa. </hi> In trout which are kept or live in dark places,
                    the black chromatophors are expanded, and, consequently, such specimens are very
                    dark-coloured; when removed to the light, they become paler almost
                    instantaneously.</p><p>Total absence of chromatophors in the skin, or albinism,
                    is very rare among fishes; much more common is incipient albinism, in which the
                    dark chromatophors are changed into cells with a more or less intense yellow
                    pigment. Fishes in a state of domestication, like the crucian carp of China, the
                    carp, the tench, and the ide, are particularly subject to this abnormal
                    coloration, and are known as the common gold-fish, the gold-tench, and the
                    gold-orfe. But it occurs also not rarely in fishes living in a wild state, and
                    has been observed in the haddock, flounder, plaice, carp, roach, and
                    eel.</p><p>It will be evident from the foregoing remarks that the amount of
                    variation within the limits of the same species —due either to natural growth
                    and development, or to external physical conditions, or to abnormal accidental
                    circumstances—is greater in fishes than in any of the higher classes of
                    vertebrates. The amount of variation is greater in certain genera or families
                    than in others, and it is much greater in Teleosteans and Ganoids than in
                    Chondropterygians. Naturally, it is greatest in the few species that have been
                    domesticated, which we shall mention in the following section.</p><p><hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Domestication, Tenacity of Life, Hibernation,
                    &amp;c.</hi></p><p>Only a few fishes are thoroughly domesticated—that is, bred
                    in captivity, and capable of transportation within certain climatic limits—viz.,
                    the carp, crucian carp (European and Chinese varieties), tench, orfe or ide, and
                    goramy. The first two have accompanied civilized man almost to every part of the
                    globe where he has effected a permanent settlement.</p></note> But in the
                    majority of fishes the rate of growth is extremely irregular, and it is hardly
                    possible to know when growth is actually and definitely arrested. All seems to
                    depend on the amount of food and the more or less favourable circumstances under
                    which the individual grows up. Fishes which rapidly grow to a definite size are
                    short-lived, whilst those, Teleosteans as well as Chondropterygians, which
                    steadily and slowly increase in size attain to a great age. Carp and pike have
                    been ascertained to live beyond a hundred years.</p>
                <p>Abundance or scarcity of food, and other circumstances connected with the
                    localities inhabited by fishes, affect considerably the colour of their muscles
                    and integuments; the periodical changes of colour in connexion with their sexual
                    functions have been referred to above. The flesh of many <hi rend="italic"
                    >Teleostei</hi> is colourless, or but slightly tinged by the blood; that of <hi
                    rend="italic">Scombridoe,</hi> and most Ganoids and Chondropterygians, is more
                    or less red; but in badly-fed fishes, as well as in very young ones, the flesh
                    is invariably white (anaemic). Many fishes, like the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Salmonidoe,</hi> feed at times exclusively on crustaceans, and the colouring
                    substance of these invertebrates, which by boiling and by the stomachic
                    secretion turns red, seems to pass into their flesh, imparting to it the
                    well-known “salmon” colour. The colora <pb break="no"

                    species in countries in which they are not indigenous have been made from time
                    to time, but have been permanently successful in a few instances only, the
                    failures being due partly to the choice of a species which did not yield the
                    profitable return expected, partly to utter disregard of the difference of
                    climatic and other physical conditions between the original and the new homes of
                    the fish. The first successful attempts at acclimatization were made with
                    domestic species, viz., the carp and goldfish, which were transferred from
                    Eastern Asia to Europe. Then, in the early part of the present century, the
                    Javanese goramy was acclimatized in Mauritius and Guiana, but no care seems to
                    have been taken to insure permanent advantages from the successful execution of
                    the experiment. In these cases fully developed individuals were transported to
                    the country in which they were to be acclimatized. The most successful attempt
                    of recent years is the acclimatization of the trout and sea-trout, and probably
                    also of the salmon, in Tasmania and New Zealand, and of the Californian salmon
                    <hi rend="italic">(Salmo</hi><hi rend="italic">quinnat ?),</hi> in Victoria, by
                    means of artificially-impregnated ova. In transporting these ice was employed,
                    in order to retard their development generally, and thus to preserve them from
                    destruction during the passage across the tropical zone.</p>
                <p>Artificial impregnation of fish-ova was first practised by J. L. Jacobi, a native
                    of Westphalia, in the years 1757-63, who employed exactly the same method which
                    is followed now; and there is no doubt that this able observer of nature
                    conceived and carried out his idea with the distinct object of advantageously
                    restocking water-courses that had become unproductive, and increasing production
                    by fecundating and preserving all ova which, in the ordinary course of
                    propagation, would be left unfecundated or might accidentally perish. Physiology
                    soon turned to account Jacobi’s discovery, and artificial impregnation has
                    proved to be one of the greatest helps to the student of embryology.</p>
                <p>Fishes differ in an extraordinary degree with regard to tenacity of life. Some
                    will bear suspension of respiration —caused by removal from water, or by
                    exposure to cold or heat—for a long time, whilst others succumb at once. Nearly
                    all marine fishes are very sensitive to changes in the temperature of the water,
                    and will not bear transportation from one climate to another. This seems to be
                    much less the case with some freshwater fishes of the temperate zones; the carp
                    may survive after being frozen in a solid block of ice, and will thrive in the
                    warmest parts of the temperate zones. On the other hand, some freshwater fishes
                    are s) sensitive to a change in the water that they perish when transplanted
                    from their native river into another apparently offering the same physical
                    conditions (grayling, <hi rend="italic">Salmo</hi><hi rend="italic">hncho).</hi>
                    Some marine fishes may be transferred at once from salt into fresh water, like
                    sticklebacks, some blennies, and <hi rend="italic">Cottιιs,</hi> &amp;c.; others
                    survive the change when gradually effected, as many migratory fishes; whilst
                    others, again, cannot bear the least alteration in the composition of the salt
                    water (all pelagic fishes). On the whole, instances of marine fishes voluntarily
                    entering brackish or fresh water are very numerous, whilst freshwater fishes
                    proper but rarely descend into salt water.</p>
                <p>Abstinence from food affects different fishes in a similarly different degree.
                    Marine fishes are less able to endure hunger than freshwater fishes,—at least in
                    the temperate zones, no observations having been made in this respect on
                    tropical fishes. Goldfishes, carps, and eels are known to be able to subsist
                    without food for months, without showing a visible decrease in bulk; whilst the
                    Trigloids, Sparoids, and other marine fishes survive abstinence from food for a
                    few days only. In freshwater fishes the temperature of the water has great
                    influence on their vital functions generally, and consequently on their
                    appetite. Many cease to feed altogether in the course of the winter; a few, like
                    the pike, are less inclined to feed during the heat of the summer than when the
                    temperature is lowered.</p>
                <p>Captivity is easily borne by most fishes, and the appliances introduced in modern
                    aquaria have rendered it possible to keep in confinement fishes which formerly
                    were considered to be intolerant of captivity, and even to induce them to
                    propagate.</p>
                <p>Wounds affect fishes generally much less than higher vertebrates. A Greenland
                    shark continues to feed though its head is pierced by a harpoon or by the knife,
                    so long as the nervous centre is not touched; a pike will survive the loss of
                    its tail, or a sea-perch that of a portion of it, and a carp that of half its
                    snout. Some fishes, however, are much more sensitive, and perish even from the
                    superficial abrasion caused by the meshes of the net during capture <hi
                    rend="italic">(Hullus).</hi></p>
                <p>The power of reproduction of lost parts in Teleosteous fishes is limited to the
                    delicate terminations of their fin-rays and the various tegumentary filaments
                    with which some are provided. These filaments are sometimes developed in an
                    extraordinary degree, imitating the waving fronds of the seaweed in which the
                    fish hides. The ends of the fin-rays and also the filaments are frequently lost,
                    not only by accident, but also merely by wear and tear; and, as these organs are
                    essential for the preservation of the fish, their reproduction is necessary. In
                    <hi rend="italic">Dipnoi, Ceratodus,</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >Protopterus,</hi> the terminal portion of the tail has been found to have been
                    reproduced, but without the notochord.</p>
                <p>Hibernation has been observed in many Cyprinoids and Muraenoids of the temperate
                    zones. They do not fall into a condition of complete torpidity, as reptiles and
                    mammals do, but their vital functions are simply lowered, and they hide in
                    sheltered holes, and cease to go abroad in search of their food. Between the
                    tropics a great number of fishes (especially Siluroids, <hi rend="italic"
                    >Labyrinthici,</hi> Ophiocephaloids, the <hi rend="italic">Dipnoi)</hi> are
                    known to survive long-continued droughts by passing the dry season in a
                    perfectly torpid state, imbedded in the hardened mud. <hi rend="italic"
                    >Protopterus,</hi> and probably many of the other fishes mentioned, prepare for
                    themselves a cavity large enough to hold them, and coated on the inside with a
                    layer of hardened mucus, which preserves them from complete desiccation.. It has
                    been stated that in India fishes may survive in this condition for more than one
                    season, and that ponds, known to have been dry for several years and to a depth
                    of many feet, have swarmed with fishes as soon as the accumulation of water
                    released them from their hardened bed.</p>
                <p>The principal benefit derived by man from the class of fishes consists in the
                    abundance of wholesome and nourishing food which they yield. In the polar
                    regions especially, whole tribes are entirely dependent on this class for
                    subsistence; and in almost all nations fishes form a more or less essential part
                    of food, many, in· a preserved condition, being most important articles of
                    trade. Their use in other respects is of but secondary importance. Codliver oil
                    is prepared from the liver of some of the Gadoids of the northern hemisphere and
                    of sharks, isinglass from the swim-bladder of sturgeons, Sciaenoids, and
                    Polynemoids, and shagreen from the skin of sharks and rays.</p>
                <p>The flesh of some fishes is constantly or occasionally poisonous. When eaten, it
                    causes symptoms of more or less intense irritation in the stomach and
                    intestines, inflammation of the mucous membranes, and not rarely death. The
                    fishes which appear always to have poisonous properties are— <hi rend="italic"
                    >Clupea</hi><hi rend="italic">thrissa,</hi><hi rend="italic">Clupea

                    others which have occasionally or frequently caused symptoms of poisoning. Poey

                    xml:id="kp-eb0912-0683-0666"/> different kinds from Cuba; and various species of
                    <hi rend="italic">Sphyroena,</hi><hi rend="italic">BaUstes, Ostracion, Caranx,
                    Lachnolcemus, Tetragoηurus,</hi><hi rend="italic">Thynnus,</hi> have been found
                    to be poisonous in all seas between the tropics. All or nearly all these fishes
                    acquire their poisonous properties from their food, which consists of poisonous
                    <hi rend="italic">Hednsoe</hi> and corals, or of decomposing substances.
                    Frequently the fishes are found to be eatable if the head and intestines are
                    removed immediately after capture. In the West Indies it has been ascertained
                    that all the fishes living and feeding on certain coral banks are poisonous. In
                    other fishes the poisonous properties are developed at certain seasons of the
                    year only, especially the season of propagation; as the barbel, pike, and
                    burbot, whose roe causes violent diarrhoea when eaten during the season of
                    spawning.</p>
                <p>Poison-organs are more common in the class of fishes than was formerly believed,
                    but they seem to have exclusively the function of defence, and are not auxiliary
                    in procuring food, as in venomous snakes. Such organs are found in the
                    sting-rays, the tail of which is armed with one or more powerful barbed spines.
                    Although they have no special organ secreting poison, or canal in or on the
                    spine by which the venomous fluid is conducted, the symptoms caused by a wound
                    from the spine of a sting-ray are such as cannot be accounted for merely by the
                    mechanical laceration, the pain being intense, and the subsequent inflammation
                    and swelling of the wounded part terminating not rarely in gangrene. The mucus
                    secreted from the surface of the fish and inoculated by the jagged spine
                    evidently possesses venomous properties. This is also the case in many
                    Scorpaenoids, and in the weever <hi rend="italic">^Trachinus),</hi> in which the
                    dorsal and opercular spines have the same function as the caudal spines of the
                    sting-rays; in the weevers, however, the spines are deeply grooved, the groove
                    being charged with a fluid mucus. In <hi rend="italic">Synanceia</hi> the
                    poison-organ (fig. 67) is still more developed: each dorsal spine is in its
                    terminal half provided with a deep <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi> groove on each
                    side, at the lower end of which lies a pear - shaped bag containing the milky
                    poison; it is prolonged into a membranous duct, lying in the groove of the
                    spine, and open at its point. The native fishermen, well acquainted with the
                    dangerous nature of these fishes carefully avoid handling them; but it often
                    happens that persons wading with naked feet in the sea step upon the fish, which
                    generally lies hidden in the sand. One or more of the erected spines penetrate
                    the skin, and the poison is injected into the wound by the pressure of the foot
                    on the poison-bags. Death has frequently been the result.</p>
                <p>The most perfect poison-organs hitherto discovered in fishes are those of <hi
                    rend="italic">Thalassophryηe,</hi> a Batrachoid genus of fishes from the coasts
                    of Central America. In these fishes again the operculum and the two dorsal
                    spines are the weapons. The former (fig. 69) is very narrow,, vertically
                    styliform, and very mobile; it is armed behind with a spine, eight lines long,
                    and of the same form as the hollow venom-fang of a snake, being perforated at
                    its base and at its extremity. A sac covering the base of the spine discharges
                    its contents through the apertures and the canal in the interior of the spine.
                    The structure of the dorsal spines is similar. There are no secretory glands
                    imbedded in the membranes of the sacs, and the fluid must be secreted by their
                    mucous membrane. The sacs have no external muscular layer, and are situated
                    immediately below the thick loose skin which envelops the spines to their
                    extremity; the ejection of the poison into a living animal, therefore, can only
                    be effected, as in <hi rend="italic">Synanceia,</hi> by the pressure to which
                    the sac is subjected the moment the spine enters another body</p>
                <p>GEOLOGICAL DISTRIBUTION.</p>
                <p>Of what kind the fishes were which were the first to make their appearance on the
                    globe, whether or not they were identical with or similar to any of the
                    principal types existing at present, are questions which probably will for ever
                    remain hidden in mystery and uncertainty. The supposition that the
                    Pharyngobranchs and Cyclostomes, the lowest of the vertebrate series, must have
                    preceded the other subclasses, is an idea which has been held by many
                    zoologists, and, as the horny teeth of the Cyclostomes are the only parts which
                    under favourable circumstances could have been preserved, palaeontologists have
                    ever been searching for this evidence.</p>
                <p>Indeed, in deposits belonging to the Lower Silurian and Devonian, in Russia,
                    England, and North America, minute, slender, pointed horny bodies, bent like a
                    hook, with sharp opposite margins, have been found and described under the name
                    of “conodonts.” More frequently they possess an elongated basal portion, in
                    which there is generally a larger tooth with rows of similar but smaller
                    denticles on one or both sides of the larger tooth, according as this is central
                    or at one end of the base. In other examples there is no prominent central
                    tooth, but a series of more or less similar teeth is implanted <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit12newyrich/page/n684/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0912-0684-0667"/> on a straight or curved base. Modifications of
                    these arrangements are very numerous, and many paleontologists still entertain
                    doubts whether the origin of these remains is not rather from annelids and
                    mollusks than from fishes.</p>
                <p>The first undeniable evidence of a fish, or, indeed, of a vertebrate animal,
                    occurs in the Upper Silurian rocks, in a bone-bed of the Downton Sandstone, near
                    Ludlow. It consists of compressed, slightly curved, ribbed spines, of less than
                    2 inches in length <hi rend="italic">{0nchus)</hi>; small shagreenscales <hi
                    rend="italic">{Thelodus);</hi> the fragment of a jaw-like bar with pluricuspid
                    teeth <hi rend="italic">(Plectrοdιis); the</hi> cephalic bucklers of what seems
                    to be a species of <hi rend="italic">Pteraspis;</hi> and, finally, coprolitic
                    bodies of phosphate and carbonate of lime, including recognizable remains of the
                    mollusks and crinoids inhabiting the same waters. But no vertebra or other part
                    of the skeleton has been found. The spines and scales seem to have belonged to
                    the same kind of fish, which probably was a Plagiostome. It is quite uncertain
                    whether or not the jaw (if it be the jaw of a fish) belonged to the
                    bucklerbearing <hi rend="italic">Pteraspis,</hi> the position of which among
                    Ganoids, with which it is generally associated, is open to doubt.</p>
                <p>No detached undoubted tooth of a Plagiostome or Ganoid scale has been discovered
                    in the Ludlow deposits; but this much is certain, that those earliest remains in
                    Palaeozoic rocks belonged to fishes closely allied to forms occurring in greater
                    abundance in the succeeding formation, the Devonian, where they are associated
                    with undoubted <hi rend="italic">Paloeichthyes,</hi> Plagiostomes as well as
                    Ganoids.</p>
                <p>These fish-remains of the Devonian or Old Red Sandstone can be determined with
                    greater certainty. They consist of spines, the so-called “ichthyodorulites,”
                    which show sufficiently distinctive characters to be referred to several genera,
                    one of them, <hi rend="italic">Onchus,</hi> still surviving from the Silurian
                    epoch. All these spines are believed to be those of Choπdropterygians, to which
                    order some pluricuspid teeth <hi rend="italic">(Cladοdus)</hi> from the Old Red
                    Sandstone in the vicinity of St Petersburg have been likewise referred.</p>
                <p>The remains of the Ganoid fishes are in a much more perfect state of
                    preservation, so that it is even possible to obtain a tolerably certain idea of
                    the general appearance and habits of some of them, especially of such as were
                    provided with hard carapaces, solid scales, and ordinary or bony fin-rays. A
                    certain proportion of them, as might have been expected, remind us, as regards
                    their external form, of Teleosteous fishes rather than of any of the few still
                    existing Ganoid types; but it is contrary to all analogy and to all
                    palaeontological evidence to suppose that those fishes were, in their internal
                    structure, more nearly allied to Teleosteans than to Ganoids. If they were not
                    true Ganoids, they may justly be supposed to have had the essential characters
                    of <hi rend="italic">Paloeichthyes.</hi> Other forms even at that remote
                    geological epoch exhibit so unmistakably the characteristics of existing Ganoids
                    that no one can entertain any doubt with regard to their place in the system. In
                    none of these fishes is there any trace of vertebral segmentation.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Paloeichthyes</hi> of the Old Red Sandstone, the systematic
                    position of which is still obscure, are the <hi rend="italic">Cephalaspidoe</hi>
                    from the Lower Old Red Sandstone of Great Britain and Eastern Canada; <hi
                    rend="italic">Ptemchthys, Cοccοsteus, Dinichthys,</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >Asterolepis</hi> (genera which have been combined in one group, <hi
                    rend="italic">Placodermoe)</hi>; and <hi rend="italic">Acanthodes</hi> and
                    allied genera, which combined numerous branchiostegals with Chondropterygian
                    spines and a shagreen-like dermal covering.</p>
                <p>Among the other Devonian fishes (and they form the majority) two types may be
                    recognized, both of which are unmistakably Ganoids. The first approaches the
                    still living <hi rend="italic">Polypterιιs,</hi> with which some of the genera
                    like <hi rend="italic">Diplοpterus</hi> singularly agree in the form and
                    armature of the head, the lepιdosιs of the body, the lobate pectoral fins, and
                    the termination of the vertebral column. Other genera, as <hi rend="italic"
                    >Holoptychius,</hi> have cycloid scales; many have two dorsal fins <hi
                    rend="italic">{Hοlοptychius),</hi> and, instead of branchiostegals, jugular
                    scutes; others have one long dorsal confluent with the caudal <hi rend="italic"
                    >{Phαηerοpleurοri).</hi> In the second type the principal characters of the <hi
                    rend="italic">Dipnoi</hi> are manifest; and some of them—for example, <hi
                    rend="italic">Dipterus,</hi><hi rend="italic">Paloedaphus,</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Holodus—</hi> approach so closely the <hi rend="italic">Dipnoi</hi> which still
                    survive that the differences existing between them warrant a separation into
                    families only.</p>
                <p>Devonian fishes are frequently found under peculiar circumstances, enclosed in
                    the so-called nodules. These bodies are elliptical flattened pebbles, which have
                    resisted the action of water in consequence of their greater hardness, whilst
                    the surrounding rock has been reduced to detritus by that agency. Their greater
                    density is due to the dispersion in their substance of the fat of the animal
                    which decomposed in them. Frequently, on cleaving one of these nodules with the
                    stroke of the hammer, a fish is found embedded in the centre. At certain
                    localities of the Devonian, fossil fishes are so abundant that the whole of the
                    stratum is affected by the decomposing remains, emitting a peculiar smell when
                    newly opened, and acquiring a density and durability not possessed by strata
                    without fishes. The flagstones of Caithness are a remarkable instance of
                    this.</p>
                <p>The fish-remains of the Carboniferous formation show a great similarity to those
                    of the preceding. They occur throughout the series, but are very irregularly
                    distributed, being extremely rare in some countries, whilst in others entire
                    beds (the so-called bone-beds) are composed of ichthyolites. In the ironstones
                    they frequently form the nuclei of nodules, as in the Devonian.</p>
                <p>Of Chondropterygians the spines of <hi rend="italic">Onchus</hi> and others still
                    occur, with the addition of teeth indicative of the existence of fishes allied
                    to the Cestracion type <hi rend="italic">(Cochliodus, Psamrnοdus),</hi> a type
                    which henceforth plays an important part in the composition of the extinct
                    marine fish faunae. Another extinct Selachian family, that of the Hybodonts,
                    makes its appearance, but is known from the teeth only.</p>
                <p>Of the Ganoid fishes, the family <hi rend="italic">Paloeoniscidoe</hi> (Traquair)
                    is numerously represented; others are Coelacanths <hi rend="italic"
                    >{Coel-</hi><hi rend="italic">acaηthus, Uhizodus),</hi> and <hi rend="italic"

                    vertebral column, but in some <hi rend="italic">(Megalichthys)</hi> the outer
                    surface of the vertebrae is ossified into a ring; the termination of their tail
                    is heterocercal. The Carboniferous <hi rend="italic">Urοηemus</hi> and the
                    Devonian <hi rend="italic">Phanerοpleuron</hi> are probably generically the
                    same; and the Devonian <hi rend="italic">Dipnoi</hi> are continued as, and well
                    represented by, <hi rend="italic">Gtenodus.</hi></p>
                <p>The fishes of the Permian group are very similar to those of the Carboniferous. A
                    type which in the latter was but very scantily represented, namely the <hi
                    rend="italic">Platysomidoe,</hi> is much developed. They were deep-bodied fish,
                    covered with hard rhomboid scales possessing a strong anterior rib, and provided
                    with a heterocercal caudal, long dorsal and anal, short non-lobate paired fins
                    (when present), and branchiostegals. <hi rend="italic">Paloeoniscus</hi> appears
                    in many species; the <hi rend="italic">Sauridoe</hi> are represented by <hi
                    rend="italic">Pygopterus</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Acrolepis,</hi> and

                    >Strophodus.</hi></p>
                <p>The passage from the Palaeozoic into the Mesozoic era is not indicated by any
                    marked change so far as fishes are concerned. The more remarkable forms of the
                    Trias are shark-like fishes represented by ichthyodorulites, like <hi

                <p>Thanks to the researches of Agassiz, and especially of Sir P. Egerton, the
                    ichthyological fauna of the Lias is perhaps the best knownof the Mesozoic era,
                    one hundred andfifty-two species having been described. Of the variou s locali
                    ties, Lyme Regis has yielded more than any other, nearly all the Liassic genera
                    being represented there by no fewer than seventy-nine species. The Hybodonts and
                    Cestracionts continue in their fullest development. Holocephales <hi
                    rend="italic">(Ischyodus),</hi> true sharks <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Paloeoscyllium),</hi> rays <hi rend="italic">(Squaloraia, Arthropterus),</hi>
                    and sturgeons <hi rend="italic">(Chondr osteus)</hi> make their first
                    appearance; but they are sufficiently distinct from living types to be classed
                    in separate genera, or even families. The Ganoids, especially Lepidosteoids,
                    predominate over all the other fishes: <hi rend="italic">Lepidotus, Semionοtus,
                    Pholidophorus, Pachycoτmus, Eugnathus, Tetragonolepis,</hi> are represented by
                    numerous species; other remarkable genera are <hi rend="italic">Aspidorhynchus,
                    Beloηostomus, Saurostomus, Sauropsis, Thrissonotus, Coηodus, Ptycholepis,
                    Endactis, Centrolβpis, Legnonotus, Oxygnathus, Heterolepi-dotus, Isοcolum,
                    Osteorhachis, Mesodon.</hi> These genera afford evidence of a great change since
                    the preceding period, the majority not being represented in older strata,
                    whilst, on the other hand, many are continued into the succeeding Oolitic
                    formations. The homocercal termination of the vertebral column begins to
                    supersede the heterocercal, and many of the genera have well-ossified and
                    distinctly segmented spinal columns. The cycloid form of scales also becomes
                    more common,—one genus <hi rend="italic">(Leptolepis)</hi> being, with regard to
                    the preserved hard portions of its organization, so similar to the Teleosteous
                    type that some palaeontologists refer it (with much reason) to that
                    subclass.</p>
                <p>As already mentioned, the Oolitic formations show a great similarity of their
                    fish fauna to that of the Lias; but still more apparent is its approach to the
                    existing fauna. Teeth have been found which cannot even generically be
                    distinguished from <hi rend="italic">Notidanus.</hi> The rays are represented by
                    genera like <hi rend="italic">Spathobatis, Belemnobatis,</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Thaumas</hi>; the <hi rend="italic">Holocephali</hi> are more numerous than in
                    the Lias <hi rend="italic">(Ischyodus, Ganodus).</hi> The most common Ganoid
                    genera are <hi rend="italic">Caturus, Pycηodus, Pholidophorus, Lepidotus,
                    Leptolepis,</hi> all of which had been more or less fully represented in the
                    Lias. <hi rend="italic">Ceratodus</hi> also is continued into it.</p>
                <p>The Cretaceous group gives clear evidence of the further advance towards the
                    existing fauna. Teeth of sharks of existing genera, <hi rend="italic">Carcharias
                    (Corax), Scyllium, Notidanus,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Galeocerdo,</hi> are
                    common in some of the marine strata, whilst Hybodonts and Cestracionts are
                    represented by a small number of species only; of the latter one new genus, <hi
                    rend="italic">Ptychodus,</hi> appears and disappears. A very characteristic
                    Ganoid genus, <hi rend="italic">Macropoma,</hi> comprises homocercal fishes with
                    rounded ganoid scales sculptured externally and pierced by prominent mucous
                    tubes. <hi rend="italic">Caturus</hi> becomes extinct. Teeth and scales of <hi
                    rend="italic">Lepidotus</hi> (with <hi rend="italic">Sρh&lt;xrodus</hi> as
                    subgenus), clearly a freshwater fish, are widely distributed in the Wealden, and
                    finally disappear in the Chalk; its body was covered with large rhomboidal
                    ganoid scales. <hi rend="italic">Gyrodus</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >Aspidorhynchus</hi> occur in the beds of Voirons, <hi rend="italic"
                    >Cοelodus</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Amiopsis</hi> (allied to <hi rend="italic"
                    >Amia)</hi> in those of Comen, in Istria. But the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Pal&lt;xichthyes</hi> are now in the minority; undoubted Teleosteans have
                    appeared for the first time on the stage of life in numerous genera, many of
                    which are identical with still existing fishes. The most of these are
                    Acanthopterygians, but Physostomes and Plectognaths are likewise well
                    represented, most of them being marine. Of Acanthopterygian families the first
                    to appear are the <hi rend="italic">Berycidae,</hi> represented by several very
                    distinct genera: — <hi rend="italic">Beryx∖ Pseudoberyx,</hi> with abdominal
                    ventral fins; <hi rend="italic">Berycoρ-sis,</hi> with cycloid scales; <hi

                <p>The position of <hi rend="italic">Pycηosteτyηx</hi> is uncertain; it approaches
                    certain Pharyngognaths. True <hi rend="italic">Percidae</hi> are abseut, whilst

                    one or more genera. Somewhat less diversified are the Physostomes, which belong
                    principally to the <hi rend="italic">Clupeidoe</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >Dercetidoe,</hi> most of the genera being extinct; <hi rend="italic"
                    >Cluρea</hi> is abundant in some localities. <hi rend="italic"
                    >Scopelidae</hi><hi rend="italic">(Hemisaurida</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >Saurocephalus)</hi> occur in the Chalk of Comen in Istria, and of Maestricht.
                    Of all Cretaceous deposits none surpass those of the Lebanon for the number of
                    genera, species, and individuals; the forms are exclusively marine, and the
                    remains in the most perfect condition.</p>
                <p>In the Tertiary epoch the Teleosteans have almost entirely replaced the Ganoids;
                    a few species only of the latter make their appearance, and they belong to
                    existing genera <hi rend="italic">(Lepidosteus,</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Acipenser).</hi> The Chondropterygians merge more and more into recent forms;
                    <hi rend="italic">Holocephali</hi> continue, and still are better represented
                    than in the present fauna. The Teleosteans show even in the Eocene a large
                    proportion of existing genera, and the fauna of some localities of the Miocene
                    (Oeningen) is almost wholly composed of them. Of the whole more than one-half
                    have already been found to belong to existing genera, and there is no doubt that
                    the number of distinct genera now seemingly extinct will be lessened as the
                    fossils come to be examined with a better knowledge of the living forms. The
                    distribution of the fishes differed widely from that of our period, many of our
                    tropical genera occurring in localities which are now included within our
                    temperate zone, and being mixed with others that nowadays are restricted to a
                    colder climate,—a combination which continues throughout the Pliocene.</p>
                <p>A few families of fishes, like the freshwater <hi rend="italic">Salmonidoe,</hi>
                    seem to have put in their appearance in Post-Pliocene times; not much attention,
                    however, has been paid to fishremains of these deposits; and such as have been
                    incidentally examined furnish evidence of the fact that the distribution of
                    fishes has not undergone any further essential change down to the present
                    period.</p>
                <p>GEOGRAPHICAL DISTRIBUTION.</p>
                <p>In an account of the geographical distribution of fishes the freshwater forms are
                    to be kept separate from the marine. When we attempt, however, to draw a line
                    between these two kinds of fishes, we meet with a great number of species and of
                    facts which would seem to render that distinction very vague. There are not only
                    species which can gradually accommodate themselves to a sojourn in either salt
                    or fresh water, but there are also some that seem to be quite indifferent to a
                    rapid change from the one into the other; so that individuals of one and the
                    same species <hi rend="italic">(Gastrosteus,</hi><hi rend="italic">Gobius,

                    others live in rivers far beyond the influence of the tide, or even in inland
                    fresh waters without outlet to the sea. The majority of these fishes belong to
                    forms of brackish-water fauna; and, as they are not an insignificant portion of
                    the fauna of almost every coast, we shall have to treat of them in a separate
                    chapter.</p>
                <p>Almost every large riyer offers instances of truly marine fishes ascending for
                    hundreds of miles of their course, and not periodically, or from any apparent
                    physiological necessity, but sporadically throughout the year. This is evidently
                    the commencement of a change in a fish’s habits; and, indeed, not a few of such
                    fishes have actually taken up their permanent residence in fresh waters, as

                <p>On the other hand, we find fishes belonging to freshwater genera descending
                    rivers and sojourning in the sea for a more or less limited period; but these
                    instances are much less in number than those in which the reverse obtains. We
                    may mention species of <hi rend="italic">Salmo</hi> (the common trout, the
                    northern charr), and Siluroids (as <hi rend="italic">Arius,</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Plotosus'). Careg onus,</hi> a genus so characteristic of the
                    inland lakes of Europe, Northern Asia, and North America, nevertheless offers
                    some instances of species wandering by the effluents into the sea, and taking up
                    their residence in salt water, apparently by preference, as <hi rend="italic"
                    >Coregonus oxy-rhynchus.</hi> But of all the freshwater families none exhibit so
                    great a capability of surviving the change from fresh into salt water as the <hi

                    the equally diminutive <hi rend="italic">Cypτino-</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >dontidoe</hi> of the tropics; not only do they enter into, and live freely in,
                    the sea, but many species of the latter family inhabit inland waters, which, not
                    having an outlet, have become briny, or impregnated with a larger proportion of
                    salts than pure sea water. During the voyage of the “Challenger” a species of

                    forms, in the tow-net, midway between St Thomas and Teneriffe.</p>
                <p>Some fishes annually or periodically ascend rivers for the purpose of spawning,
                    passing the rest of the year in the sea, as sturgeons, many Salmonoids, some
                    Clupeoids, lampreys, &amp;c. The first two evidently belonged originally to the
                    freshwater series, and it was only in the course of their existence that they
                    acquired the habit of descending to the sea, perhaps because their freshwater
                    home did not furnish a sufficient supply of food. These migrations of freshwater
                    fishes have been compared with the migrations of birds; but they are much more
                    limited in extent, and do not, as is the case with birds, impart an additional
                    element to the fauna of the place to which the fishes migrate.</p>
                <p>The distinction between freshwater and marine fishes is further obscured by
                    geological changes, in consequence of which the salt water is gradually being
                    changed into fresh, or <hi rend="italic">vice versa.</hi> These changes are so
                    gradual, and spread over so long a time, that many of the fishes inhabiting such
                    localities accommodate themselves to the new conditions. One of the most
                    remarkable and best studied instances of such an alteration is the Baltic,
                    which, during the second half of the Glacial period, was in open and wide
                    communication with the Arctic Ocean, and evidently had the same marine fauna as
                    the White Sea. Since then, by the rising of the land of Northern Scandinavia and
                    Finland, this great gulf of the Arctic Ocean has become an inland sea, with a
                    narrow outlet into the North Sea, and, in consequence of the excess of fresh
                    water pouring into it over the loss by evaporation, it has been so much diluted
                    as to be nearly fresh at its northern extremities; and yet nine species, the
                    origin of which from the Arctic Ocean can be proved, have survived the changes,
                    propagating their species, and agreeing with their brethren in the Arctic Ocean
                    in every point, but remaining comparatively smaller. On the other hand, fishes
                    which we must regard as true freshwater fishes, like the rudd, roach, pike,
                    perch, enter freely the brackish water of the Baltic. Instances of marine fishes
                    being permanently retained in fresh water in consequence of geological changes
                    are well known: as <hi rend="italic">Cottus quadricarms</hi> iu the large lakes
                    of Scandinavia; species of <hi rend="italic">Gobius, Biennius,</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">Atherina</hi> in the lakes of northern Italy; <hi rend="italic"
                    >Comepharus,</hi> which seems to be a dwarfed Gadoid, in the depths of Lake
                    Baikal. <hi rend="italic">Carcharias gangeticus</hi> in inland lakes of the Fiji
                    Islands, is another instance of a marine fish which has permanently established
                    itself in fresh water.</p>
                <p>Thus there is a constant interchange of species in progress between the
                    freshwater and marine faunae, and in not a few cases it would seem almost
                    arbitrary to refer a genus or even a larger group of fishes to the one or the
                    other; yet there are certain groups of fishes which entirely, or with but few
                    exceptions, are,, and apparently during the whole period of their existence have
                    been, inhabitants either of the sea or of fresh water; and, as the agencies
                    operating upon the distribution of marine fishes differ greatly from those
                    influencing the dispersal of freshwater fishes, the two series must be treated
                    separately. The most obvious fact that dry land, which intervenes between river
                    systems, presents to the rapid spreading of a freshwater fish an obstacle which
                    can be surmounted only exceptionally or by a most circuitous route, whilst
                    marine fishes may readily and voluntarily extend their original limits, could be
                    illustrated by a great number of instances. Without entering into details, it
                    may suffice to state, as the general result, that no species or genus of
                    freshwater fishes has anything like the immense range of the corresponding
                    categories of marine fishes, and that, with the exception of the Siluroids, no
                    freshwater family is so widely spread as the families of marine fishes. Surface
                    temperature or climate, which is, if not the most, one of the most important
                    physical factors in the limitation of freshwater fishes, similarly .affects the
                    distribution of marine fishes, but in a less degree, and only in the case of
                    those which live near the shore or the surface of the ocean; it ceases to
                    exercise its influence in propor∙ tion to the depth, the true deep-sea forms
                    being entirely exempt from its operation. Light, which is pretty equally
                    distributed over the localities inhabited by freshwater fishes, cannot be
                    considered as an important factor in their distribution, but it contributes to
                    the formation of the impassable barrier between the surface and abyssal forms of
                    marine fishes Altitude has stamped the fishes of the various alpine provinces of
                    the globe with a certain character, and limited their distribution; but the
                    number of these alpine forms is comparatively small, ichthyic life being
                    extinguished at great elevations even before the mean temperature equals that of
                    the high latitudes of the Arctic region, in which some freshwater fishes
                    flourish, On the otner hand, the depths of the ocean, far exceeding the altitude
                    of the highest mountains, still swarm with forms specially adapted for abyssal
                    life. That other physical conditions of minor and local importance, under which
                    freshwater fishes live, and by which their dispersal is regulated, are more
                    complicated than similar ones of the ocean, is probable, though perhaps less so
                    than is generally supposed; for the fact is that the former are more accessible
                    to observation than the latter, and are therefore more generally and more
                    readily comprehended and acknowledged. It will thus be necessary to treat of the
                    two series separately, not only because m⅛ny of the most characteristic forms of
                    the marine and the freshwater series are found, on taking a broader view of the
                    subject, to be sufficiently distinct, but also because their distribution
                    depends on causes different in their nature as well as in the degree of their
                    action. Whether the oceanic areas correspond in any way to the terrestrial will
                    be seen in the sequel.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Freshwater Fishes.</hi></p>
                <p>Having shown above that numerous marine fishes enter fresh waters, and that some
                    of them have permanently established themselves therein, we have to eliminate
                    from the category of freshwater fishes all such adventitious elements. They are
                    derived from forms the distribution of which is regulated by other agencies, and
                    which therefore would obscure the relations of the faunae of terrestrial regions
                    if they were included in them. They will be <pb break="no"

                    fishes constituting the fauna of brackish water.</p>
                <p>The true freshwater fishes are all embraced in the following families and groups
                    :—</p>
                <p>Dipnoi, with <hi rend="italic">4</hi> species; Acipenseridae and Polyodontidae,
                    26; Amiidae, 1; Polypteridae, 2; Lepidosteidae, 3; Percina, 46; Grystina, 11;
                    Aphredoderidae, 1; Centrarchina, 26; Doles, 10; Nandidae, 7; Polycentridae, 3;
                    Labyrinthici, 30; Luciocephalidae, 1; Gastrosteus, 10; Ophiocephalidae, 31;
                    Mastacembelidae, 13; Chrornides, 105; Comephoridae, 1; Gadopsidae, 1; Siluridae,
                    572; Characinidae, 261; Haplochitonidae, 3; Salmonidae (3 genera excepted), 135;
                    Percopsidae, 1; Galaxiidae, 15; Morrnyridae (and Gymnarchidae), 52; Esocidae, 8;
                    Umbridae, 2; Cyprinodontidae, 112; Heteropygii, 2; Cyprinidae, 724; Kneriidae,
                    2; Hyodontidae, 1; Pantodontidae, 1; Osteoglossidae, 5; Notopterîdae, 5;
                    Gymnotidae, 20; Symbranchidae, 5; Petromyzontidae, 12. Total, 2270 species.</p>
                <p>As in every other class of animals, these freshwater genera and families vary
                    exceedingly with regard to the extent of their geographical range,—some
                    extending over more than the half of the continental areas, whilst others are
                    limited to one continent only, or even to a very small portion of it. As a
                    general rule, a genus or family of freshwater fishes is regularly dispersed and
                    most developed within a certain district, the species and individuals becoming
                    fewer towards the periphery as the type recedes more from its central home, some
                    outposts, however, frequently being pushed far beyond the outskirts of the area
                    occupied by it. At the same time remarkable instances exist of closely allied
                    forms occurring, almost isolated, at most distant points, without being
                    connected by allied species in the intervening space, and of members of the same
                    family, genus, or species inhabiting the opposite shores of an ocean, and
                    separated by many degrees of abyssal depths.</p>
                <p>The dispersal of freshwater fishes has been effected in various ways; probably
                    all the causes are still in operation, most of them working so slowly and
                    imperceptibly as to escape direct observation. From the great number of
                    freshwater forms which we see at the present day already acclimatized or
                    gradually becoming acclimatized in the sea, or periodically or sporadically
                    migrating to it, we must conclude that, under certain circumstances, salt water
                    may cease to be an impassable barrier at some period of the existence of
                    freshwater species, and that many of them have passed from one river through
                    salt water into another. Secondly, the headwaters of some of the largest rivers,
                    the mouths of which are at opposite ends of the continents which they drain, are
                    sometimes distant from each other a few miles only; the intervening space may
                    easily have been bridged over for the passage of fishes by a slight geological
                    change affecting the level of the watershed, or even by temporary floods; and a
                    communication of this kind, if existing for a limited period only, would afford
                    the ready means for an exchange of a number of species previously peculiar to
                    one or the other of those river or lake systems. Some fishes provided with
                    gill-openings so narrow that the water moistening the gills cannot readily
                    evaporate, and endowed, besides, with an extraordinary degree of vitality, like
                    many Siluroids <hi rend="italic">(Clarias,</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Callichthys∖</hi> eels, &amp;c., are enabled to wander for some distance over
                    land, and thus may reach a watercourse leading them thousands of miles from
                    their original home. Finally, fishes or their ova may be accidentally carried by
                    waterspouts, or by aquatic birds or insects, to considerable distances.</p>
                <p>Freshwater fishes of the present fauna were already in existence when the great
                    changes in the distribution of land and water took place in the Tertiary epoch;
                    and, having seen that salt water is not an absolute barrier to the spreading of
                    freshwater fishes, we can now more easily account for those instances of
                    singular disconnexion of certain families or genera. It is not necessary to
                    assume that there was a continuity of land stretching from the present coast of
                    Africa to South America, or from South America to New Zealand and Australia, to
                    explain the presence of identical forms in localities so distant; it suffices to
                    assume that the distances were lessened by intervening archipelagoes, or that an
                    alteration has taken place in the level of the land area.</p>
                <p>Dispersal of a type over several distant continental areas may be evidence of its
                    great antiquity, but does not prove that it is of greater antiquity than another
                    limited to one region only. Geological evidence is the only proof of the
                    antiquity of a type. Thus, although the <hi rend="italic">Dipnoi</hi> occur in
                    the continents of Africa, South America, and Australia, and their present
                    distribution is evidently the consequence of their wide range in Palaeozoic and
                    Secondary epochs, the proof of their high antiquity can be found in their fossil
                    remains only. The Siluroids, for example, have a still greater range, but their
                    wide distribution is of comparatively recent date, as the few fossil remains
                    that have been found belong to the Tertiary epoch. The rapidity of dispersal of
                    a type depends entirely on its power to accommodate itself to a variety of
                    physical conditions, and on the degree of vitality by which it is enabled to
                    survive more or less sudden changes under unfavourable conditions; proof of this
                    is afforded by the family of Siluroids, many of which can suspend for some time
                    the energy of their respiratory functions, and readily survive a change of
                    water.</p>
                <p>To trace the geological sequence of the distribution of an ichthyic type, and to
                    recognize the various laws which have governed and are still governing its
                    dispersal, is one of the ultimate tasks of ichthyology. But the endeavour to
                    establish by means of our present fragmentary geological knowledge the divisions
                    of the fauna of the globe leads us into a maze of conflicting evidence; as Mr
                    Wallace truly observes, “any attempt to exhibit the regions of former geological
                    ages in combination with those of our own period must lead to confusion.”
                    Nevertheless, as the different types of animals found at the present day within
                    a particular area have made their appearance therein at distant periods, we
                    should endeavour, in giving an account of the several zoo-geographical
                    divisions, to decide, so far as we can, the following questions :—</p>
                <p>1. Which of the fishes of an area should be considered to be the remnants of
                    ancient types, probably spread over much larger areas in preceding epochs?</p>
                <p>2. Which are to be considered to be autochthonous species, that is, forms which
                    in the Tertiary epoch or later came into existence within the area to which they
                    are still limited, or from which they have since spread 1</p>
                <p>3. Which are the forms which must be considered to be immigrants from some other
                    region?</p>
                <p>It is the aim of every philosophical classification to indicate the degrees of
                    affinity which obtain between the various categories. In dividing the earth’s
                    surface into zoological regions, the two families, <hi rend="italic"
                    >Cyprinidae</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Siluridae,</hi> the former of which
                    yields a contingent of one-third and the latter of one-fourth of all the known
                    freshwater species of our period, afford most important guidance for the
                    estimation of those degrees of affinity. The Cyprinoids may be assumed to have
                    originated in the alpine region dividing the temperate and tropical parts of
                    Asia; endowed with a greater capability than any other family of freshwater
                    fishes of acclimatizing themselves in a temperate as well as in a tropical
                    region, they spread north and south as well as east and west; in the Pre-Glacial
                    epoch they reached North America, but they have not had time to penetrate into
                    South America, Australia, or the islands of the Pacific. The Siluroids,
                    principally fishes of the sluggish waters of the plains, well adapted for
                    surviving changes of the water in which they live, and for living either in mud
                    or in seawater, flourish most in the tropical climate in which this <pb

                    xml:id="kp-eb0912-0688-0671"/> type evidently had its origin. They came into
                    existence after the Cyprinoids, their fossil remains being found only in
                    Tertiary deposits in India, none in Europe. They rapidly spread over the areas
                    of land within the tropical zone, reaching Northern Australia from India, and
                    one species migrating even into the Sandwich Islands, probably from South
                    America. The coral islands of the Pacific still remain untenanted by them. Their
                    progress into temperate regions was evidently slow, only very few species having
                    penetrated into the temperate parts of Asia and Europe, and the North American
                    species, although more numerous, showing no great variety of structure, all
                    belonging to the same group <hi rend="italic">(Amiurina).</hi> Towards the south
                    their progress was still slower, Tasmania, New Zealand, and Patagonia being
                    without any representative, whilst the streams of the Andes of Chili are
                    inhabited by a few dwarfed forms identical with such as are characteristic of
                    similar localities in the more northern and warmer parts of the South American
                    continent.</p>
                <p>These remarks may serve to introduce the following division of the fauna of

                <p>In the following account we begin with a description of the equatorial zone, this
                    being the one from which the two principal families of freshwater fishes seem to
                    have spread.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Equatorial Zone.</hi> —Roughly speaking, the borders of this
                    zoological zone coincide with the geographical limits of the Tropics of Cancer
                    and Capricorn; its characteristic forms, however, extend in undulating lines
                    several degrees both northwards and southwards. Commencing from the west coast
                    of Africa, the desert of the Sahara forms a well-marked boundary between the
                    equatorial and northern zones; as the boundary approaches the Nile, it makes a
                    sudden sweep towards the north as far as northern Syria <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Afastacembel·us,</hi> near Aleppo and in the Tigris; <hi rend="italic"
                    >Clamas</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Chromides,</hi> in the Lake of Galilee),
                    crosses through</p>
                <p>Persia and Afghanistan <hi rend="italic">(f)phiocephalus')</hi> to the southern
                    ranges of the Himalayas, and follows the course of the Yang-tse-Keang, which
                    receives its contingent of equatorial fishes through its southern tributaries.
                    Its continuation through the North Pacific may be considered as indicated by the
                    tropic, which strikes the coast of Mexico at the southern end of the Gulf of
                    California. Equatorial types of South America are known to extend so far
                    northwards; and, by following the same line, the West India Islands are
                    naturally included in this zone.</p>
                <p>Towards the south the equatorial zone embraces the whole of Africa and
                    Madagascar, and seems to extend still farther south in Australia, its boundary
                    probably following the southern coast of that continent; the detailed
                    distribution of the freshwater fishes of south-western Australia has been but
                    little studied, but the few facts which we know show that the tropical fishes of
                    that region follow the principal water-course, the Murray river, far towards the
                    south and probably to its mouth. The boundary line then stretches to the north
                    of Tasmania and New Zealand, coinciding with the tropic until it strikes the
                    western slope of the Andes, on the South American continent, where it again
                    bends southward to embrace the system of the Rio de la Plata.</p>
                <p>The four regions into which the equatorial zone is divided arrange themselves
                    into two well-marked divisions, one of which is characterized by the presence of
                    Cyprinoid fishes, combined with the development of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Labyrinthici,</hi> whilst in the other both these types are absent. The
                    boundary between the Cyprinoid and Acyprinoid division seems to follow Wallace’s
                    line,—a line drawn from the south of the Philippines between Borneo and Celebes,
                    and farther south between Bali and Lombok. Borneo abounds in Cyprinoids; from
                    the Philippine Islands a few only are known at present, and in Bali two species
                    have been found; but none are known from Celebes or Lombok, or from islands
                    situated farther east.</p>
                <p>Taking into consideration the manner in which Cyprinoids and Siluroids have been
                    dispersed, we are obliged to place the Indian region as the first in the order
                    of our treatment; and indeed the number of freshwater fishes which appear to
                    have spread from it into the neighbouring regions far exceeds that of the
                    species which it has received from them.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Indian Region</hi> comprises the whole continent of Asia
                    south of the Himalayas and the Yang-tse-Keang, and includes the islands to the
                    west of Wallace’s line. Towards the north-east the island of Formosa, which also
                    by other parts of its fauna shows the characters of the equatorial zone, has
                    received some characteristic Japanese freshwater fishes, for instance, the
                    singular Salmonoid <hi rend="italic">Plecoglossus.</hi> Within the geographical
                    boundaries of China the freshwater fishes of the tropics pass gradually into
                    those of the northern zone, both being separated by a broad debateable ground.
                    The affluents of the great river traversing this district are more numerous from
                    the south than from the north, and carry the southern fishes far into the
                    temperate zone. Scarcely better defined is the boundary of this region towards
                    the north-west. Before Persia passed through the geological changes by which its
                    waters were converted into brine and finally dried up, it seems to have been
                    inhabited by many characteristic Indian forms, of which a few still survive in
                    the tract intervening between Afghanistan and Syria; <hi rend="italic"
                    >Ophiocephalus</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Discogηathus</hi> have each at least
                    one representative, <hi rend="italic">Macrones</hi> has survived in the Tigris,
                    and <hi rend="italic">Mastacembelus</hi> has penetrated as far as Aleppo. Thus
                    freshwater fishes belonging to India, Africa, and Europe are intermingled in a
                    district which forms the connecting link between the three continents. Of the
                    freshwater fishes of Arabia we are almost entirely ignorant; we only <pb
                    break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit12newyrich/page/n689/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0912-0689-0672"/> know that the Indian <hi rend="italic"
                    >Discognathus lamta</hi> occurs in the reservoirs of Aden (having also found its
                    way to the opposite African coast), and that the ubiquitous Cyprinodonts thrive
                    in the brackish pools of northern Arabia.</p>
                <p>In analysing the list of Indian fishes, we find that out of 40 families or groups
                    of freshwater fishes 12 are represented in this region, and that 625 species are
                    known to occur in it, or two-sevenths of the entire number of freshwater fishes
                    known. This large proportion is principally due to the development of numerous
                    local forms of Siluroids and Cyprinoids, of which the former show a contingent
                    of about 200, and the latter of about 330 species. The combined development of
                    those two families, therefore, and their undue preponderance over the other
                    freshwater types, is the principal characteristic of the Indian region. The
                    second important character of its fauna is the apparently total absence of
                    Ganoid and Cyclostomous fishes. Every other region has representatives of either
                    Ganoids or Cyclostomes, some of both.</p>
                <p>Of the autochthonous freshwater fishes of the Indian region, some are still
                    limited to it, viz., the <hi rend="italic">Nandiηa,</hi> the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Luciocephalidae</hi> (of which one species only exists in the archipelago), of
                    Siluroids the <hi rend="italic">Chacina</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >Bagariina,</hi> of Cyprinoids the <hi rend="italic">Semiplotina</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">Homaloptemna</hi>; others are very nearly so, such as the <hi
                    rend="italic">Labyrinthici,</hi><hi rend="italic">Ophiocephalidoe,
                    Mastacembelidoe,</hi> of Siluroids the <hi rend="italic">Silurina,</hi> of
                    Cyprinoids the <hi rend="italic">Iiasbomna</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >Danionvna,</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">Symbranchidoe.</hi></p>
                <p>The regions to which the Indian has least similarity are the North American and
                    the Antarctic, as they are the most distant. Its affinity to the other regions
                    is of very different degrees :—</p>
                <p>1. Its affinity to the Europo-Asiatic region is very slight, and is indicated
                    almost solely by three groups of Cyprinoids, viz., the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Cypriηiηα, Abramidina,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Cοbitidina.</hi> The
                    development of these groups north and south of the Himalayas is due to their
                    common origin in the highlands of Asia; but the forms which descended into the
                    tropical climate of the south are now so different from their northern brethren
                    that most of them are referred to distinct genera. The only genera which are
                    still common to both regions are (1) the true barbels <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Barbus),</hi> a genus which of all Cyprinoids has the largest range over the
                    Old World, and of which some one hundred and sixty species have been described,
                    and (2) the mountain barbels <hi rend="italic">(Schizothorax,</hi> &amp;c. ),
                    which, peculiar to the alpine waters of Central Asia, descend a short distance
                    only towards the tropical plains, but extend farther into rivers within the
                    northern temperate districts. The origin and the laws of the distribution of the
                    <hi rend="italic">Cobitidina</hi> appear to have been identical with those of
                    <hi rend="italic">Barbus,</hi> but they have not spread into Africa.</p>
                <p>2. There exists a great affinity between the Indian and African regions;
                    seventeen out of the twenty-six families or groups found in the former are
                    represented by one or more species in Africa, and many of the African species
                    are not even generically different from the Indian. As the majority of these
                    groups have many more representatives in India than in Africa, we may reasonably
                    assume that the African species have been derived from the Indian stock; but
                    probably this is not the case with the Siluroid group of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Clariina,</hi> which with regard to species is nearly equally distributed
                    between the two regions, the African species being referable to three genera <hi
                    rend="italic">(Clarias,</hi><hi rend="italic">Ηeterobranchus, Gymnallabes,</hi>
                    with the sub-genus <hi rend="italic">Chan-nallabes),</hi> whilst the Indian
                    species belong to two genera only, viz., <hi rend="italic">Clarias</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">Heterobranchus.</hi> On the other hand, the Indian region has
                    derived from Africa one freshwater form only, viz., <hi rend="italic"
                    >Ebroρlus,</hi> a member of the family of <hi rend="italic">Chromides,</hi> so
                    well represented in tropical Africa and South America. <hi rend="italic"
                    >Etroplus</hi> inhabits southern and western India and Ceylon, and has its
                    nearest ally in a Madagascar freshwater fish, <hi rend="italic"
                    >Paretroplus.</hi> Considering that other African <hi rend="italic"
                    >Chromides</hi> have acclimatized themselves at the present day in saline water,
                    we think it more probable that <hi rend="italic">Ebroplus</hi> should have found
                    its way to India through the ocean than over the connecting land area, where,
                    besides, it does not occur.</p>
                <p>3. No closer affinity exists between the Indian and Tropical American regions
                    than is indicated by the character of the equatorial zone generally. With two
                    exceptions, no genus of freshwater fishes occurs in India and South America
                    without being found in the intermediate African region. Four small Indian
                    Siluroids <hi rend="italic">(Sisor, Erethistes, Pseτιdecheneis,</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">Exostoma)</hi> have been referred to the South .American <hi
                    rend="italic">Hypostomatina</hi>; but it remains to be seen whether this
                    combination is based upon a sufficient agreement of their internal structure, or
                    whether it is not rather artificial. On the other hand, the occurrence and wide
                    distribution in tropical America of a fish of the Indian family <hi
                    rend="italic">Symbranchidoe</hi><hi rend="italic">(Symbranchus</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">marmoratus),</hi> which is not only congeneric with, but also most
                    closely allied to, the Indian <hi rend="italic">Symbranchτιs bengaleusis,</hi>
                    furnishes one of those extraordinary anomalies in the distribution of animals of
                    which no satisfactory explanation can at present be given.</p>
                <p>4. The relation of the Indian to the Tropical Pacific region consists only in its
                    having contributed a few species to the poor fauna of the latter. This
                    immigration must have taken place within a recent period, because some species
                    now inhabit the fresh waters of tropical Australia and the South Sea Islands
                    without having in any way changed their specific characters, as <hi
                    rend="italic">Lates</hi><hi rend="italic">calcarifer,</hi> species of <hi
                    rend="italic">Dules, Plotosus anguillaris</hi>; others (species of <hi
                    rend="italic">A rius)</hi> differ but little from their Indian congeners. All
                    these fishes must have migrated by the sea, a supposition which is supported by
                    what we know of their habits. We need not add that India has not received a
                    single addition to its freshwater fish fauna from the Pacific region.</p>
                <p>It may be mentioned, before concluding these remarks oh the Indian region, that
                    peculiar genera of Cyprinoids and Siluroids inhabit the streams and lakes of its
                    alpine ranges in the north. Some of them, like the Siluroid genera <hi
                    rend="italic">Clyptosternum, Euglyptosternum, Pseudecheneis,</hi> have a folded
                    disk on the thorax between their horizontally spread pectoral fins; by means of
                    this they adhere to stones at the bottom of the mountain torrents, and without
                    it they would be swept away into the lower courses of the rivers. The Cyprinoid
                    genera inhabiting similar localities and the lakes into which alpine rivers
                    pass,—such as <hi rend="italic">Oreinus, Schizothorax, Ptychobarbus,
                    Schizopygopsis, Diptychus, Gymnocypηs,—</hi> are distinguished by peculiarly
                    enlarged scales near the vent, the physiological use of which has not yet been
                    ascertained. These alpine genera extend far into the Europo-Asiatic region,
                    where the climate is similar to that of their southern home. No observations
                    have been made by which the altitudinal limits of fish life in the Himalayas can
                    be fixed, but it is probable that it reaches the line of perpetual snow, as in
                    the European Alps, which at that height are inhabited by Salmonoids. Griffith
                    found an <hi rend="italic">Oreinus</hi> and a loach, the former in abundance, in
                    the Helmund at Gridun Dewar, altitude 10,500 feet, and another loach at Kaloo at
                    11,000 feet.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">African Region</hi> comprises the whole of the African
                    continent south of the Atlas and the Sahara. It might have been conjectured that
                    the more temperate climate of its southern extremity would have been accompanied
                    by a conspicuous difference in the fish fauna. But this is not the case; the
                    difference between the tropical and southern parts of Africa consists simply in
                    the gradual disappearance of specifically tropical forms, whilst Siluroids,
                    Cyprinoids, and even <hi rend="italic">Labyrinthici</hi> penetrate to its
                    southern coast; no new form has entered to impart to South Africa a character
                    distinct from the central portion of the continent. In the north-east the
                    African fauna passes the Isthmus of Suez and penetrates into Syria; the system
                    of the Jordan presents so many African types that it has to be included in a
                    description of the African region as well as of the Europo-Asiatic. This river
                    is inhabited by three species of <hi rend="italic">Chromis,</hi> one of <hi
                    rend="italic">Hemichromis,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Clarias</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">macracanthus,</hi> a common fish of the upper Nile. Madagascar
                    clearly belongs to this region. Besides some gobies and <hi rend="italic"
                    >Dules,</hi> which are not true freshwater fishes, four <hi rend="italic"
                    >Chromides</hi> are known. To judge from general accounts, its freshwater fauna
                    is poorer than might be expected; but, singular as it may appear, collectors
                    have hitherto paid but little attention to the freshwater fishes of this island.
                    The fishes found in the fresh waters of the Seychelles and Mascarenes are
                    brackish-water fishes, such as <hi rend="italic">Fundulus, Haplochilus,</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Elops, Mugil,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                <p>Out of the 40 families or groups of freshwater fishes 15 are represented in the
                    African region, or three more than in the Indian region; of two of them,
                    however, viz., the <hi rend="italic">Ophiocephalidoe</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >Mastacembelidoe,</hi> a few species only <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit12newyrich/page/n690/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0912-0690-0673"/> have found their way into Africa. On the other
                    hand, the number of species is much less, viz., 255, being only two-fifths of
                    the known Indian species. The small degree of specialization and localization is
                    principally due to the greater uniformity of the physical conditions of this
                    continent, and to the almost perfect continuity of the great river systems,
                    which take their origin from the lakes in its centre. This is best shown by a
                    comparison of the fauna of the upper Nile with that of the West African rivers.
                    The number of species known from the upper Nile amounts to 56, and of these not
                    less than 25 are absolutely identical with West African species. There is an
                    uninterrupted continuity of the fish fauna from the west to the north-east, and
                    the species known to be common to both extremities may be reasonably assumed to
                    inhabit also the great reservoirs of water in the centre of the continent. A
                    greater dissimilarity is noticeable between the west and north-east fauna on the
                    one hand and that of the Zambezi on the other; the affinity between them is
                    merely generic, and all the fishes hitherto collected in Lake Nyassa have proved
                    to be distinct from those of the Nile, and even from those of other parts of the
                    system of the Zambezi.</p>
                <p>Unlike India, Africa does not possess either alpine ranges or outlying
                    archipelagoes, the fresh waters of which would swell the number of its
                    indigenous species; but, when its fauna becomes better known than at present,
                    the great difference in the number of species between this and the Indian
                    regions may possibly be somewhat lessened.</p>
                <p>The most numerously represented families are the Siluroids, with 61 species; the
                    Cyprinoids, with 52; the <hi rend="italic">Hormyridae,</hi> with 51; the <hi
                    rend="italic">Characinidoe,</hi> with 35; and the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Chromides,</hi> with 29. There is not, therefore, that great preponderance of
                    the first two families over the rest which we noticed in the Indian region; in
                    Africa there is a comparatively greater variety of distinct freshwater types,
                    making the study of its fauna an unflagging pleasure such as is scarcely reached
                    in the study of the other region. With the forms peculiar to it there are
                    combined those of India as well as of South America.</p>
                <p>In tropical Africa there are still remnants of Ganoids,— <hi rend="italic"
                    >Protopterus (Lepidosiren)</hi><hi rend="italic">annectens</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">Ρolypterus bichir,</hi> with the singularly modified <hi
                    rend="italic">Calαmoichthys.</hi> The first two range from east to west, and are
                    accompanied by an Osteoglossoid <hi rend="italic">(Heterotis),</hi> which has
                    hitherto been found in the Nile and on the west coast only. Autochthonous and
                    limited to this region are the <hi rend="italic">Mormyridae,</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Paη-</hi><hi rend="italic">todontidoe,</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >Kneriidoe,</hi> a singular type somewhat akin to the loaches. Of Siluroid
                    genera the most characteristic are <hi rend="italic">Synodontis,
                    Rhinoglanis,</hi> and the electric <hi rend="italic">Hαlapterurus;</hi> of
                    Characinoids, <hi rend="italic">Cithamnus, Alestes, Xenο-chαrax, Hydrocyon,
                    Distichodoη, Lchthyborns.</hi></p>
                <p>The regions to which Africa (like India) has least similarity are again the North
                    American and Antarctic. Its affinity with the Europo-Asiatic region consists
                    only in its having received, like the latter, a branch of the Cyprinoids, the
                    African carps and barbels, which on the whole resemble Indian more than
                    Europo-Asiatic forms. Its similarity to Australia is limited to the two regions
                    possessing Dipnoous and Osteoglossoid types. But its relations to the other two
                    regions of the equatorial zone are near and of great interest.</p>
                <p>1. Africa has in common with India the Siluroid groups of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Clαriinα, Silurina,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Bagrina,</hi> and more
                    especially the small but very natural family of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Notopteridae,</hi> represented by three species in India, and by two on the
                    west coast of Africa. It would be hazardous to state at present in which of the
                    two regions these fishes first made their appearance, but the discovery of
                    remains of <hi rend="italic">Noto·</hi><hi rend="italic">pteridoe</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">Silurina</hi> in Tertiary deposits of Sumatra points to the Indian
                    region as their original home. We are in less doubt about the other, fishes
                    common to the two regions; they are clearly immigrants into Africa from the
                    east, and it is a remarkable fact that these immigrants have penetrated to the
                    most distant limits of Africa in the west as well as in the south, viz., the <hi
                    rend="italic">Labyrinthici,</hi> represented by two genera closely allied to the
                    Indian <hi rend="italic">Anabas</hi>; the <hi rend="italic">Ophiocephalidoe</hi>
                    and <hi rend="italic">Mastaccmbclidoe,</hi> a few species of which have
                    penetrated to the west coast, while, singularly enough, they are absent from the
                    eastern rivers; the <hi rend="italic">Ariina,</hi> represented by several
                    species, of which one or two are identical with Indian, having extended their
                    range along the intervening coasts to the east coast of Africa. The Cyprinoids
                    also afford an instance of an Indian species ranging into Africa, viz., <hi
                    rend="italic">Discognathus lamta,</hi> which seems to have crossed at the
                    southern extremity of the Red Sea, as it is found in the reservoirs at Aden and
                    in the hill-streams of the opposite coastregion of Abyssinia.</p>
                <p>2. No such direct influx of species and genera has occurred from South America
                    into Africa, yet the affinity of their freshwater fishes is striking. Two of the
                    most natural'families of fishes, the <hi rend="italic">Chromides</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">Characinidoe,</hi> are peculiar and (with the exception of <hi
                    rend="italic">Etroplus)</hi> restricted to them. The African and South American
                    <hi rend="italic">Dipnoi</hi> are closely allied to each other. The <hi
                    rend="italic">Ρirnclodina,</hi> so characteristic of tropical America, have
                    three representatives in Africa, viz., <hi rend="italic">Pimelodτcsplatychir, Γ.
                    balayi,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Auchenoglanis biscutatus;</hi> the <hi
                    rend="italic">Doradina</hi> are another Siluroid group restricted to these two
                    continents.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>We have left
                    out of consideration here the <hi rend="italic">A riina</hi> and Cyp∏nodonts,
                    which can pass with impunity through salt water, and are spread over much larger
                    areas.</p></note> Yet, with all these points of close resemblance, the African
                    and South American series are, with the exception of the two species of <hi
                    rend="italic">Pimelodus,</hi> generically distinct,—which shows that the
                    separation of the continents must have been of old date. On the other hand, the
                    existence of so many similar forms on both sides of the Atlantic affords much
                    support to the supposition that at a former period the distance between the
                    present Atlantic continents was much less, and that the fishes which have
                    diverged towards the east and west are descendants of a common stock which had
                    its home in a region now submerged under some intervening part of that ocean. Be
                    this as it may, it is evident that the physical conditions of Africa and South
                    America have remained unchanged for a considerable period, and are still
                    sufficiently alike to preserve the identity of a number of peculiar freshwater
                    forms on both sides of the Atlantic. Africa and South America are, moreover, the
                    only continents which have produced in freshwater fishes, though in very
                    different families, one of the most extraordinary modifications of an organ—the
                    conversion, that is, of muscle into an apparatus creating electric force.</p>
                <p>The boundaries of the <hi rend="italic">Neotropical</hi> or <hi rend="italic"
                    >Tropical American Region</hi> have been sufficiently indicated in the
                    definition of the equatorial zone. A broad and most irregular band of country,
                    in which the South and North American forms are mixed, exists in the north,
                    offering some peculiarities which deserve fuller attention in the subsequent
                    description of the relations between the South and North American faunae.</p>
                <p>Out of the 40 families or groups of freshwater fishes, 9 only are represented in
                    the tropical American region. This may be accounted for by the fact that South
                    America is too much isolated from the other regions of the equatorial zone to
                    have received recent additions to its fauna. On the other hand, the number of
                    species (672) exceeds that of every other region, even of the Indian, with
                    which, in regard to the comparative development of families, the neotropical
                    region shows a close analogy, as will be seen fron? the following table :—</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Indian.—</hi> Siluridae, 200 species; Cyprinidae, 330;
                    Labyrinthici, 2t&gt;; Üphiocephalidae, 30; Mastacembelidae, 10.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Neotropical.</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi> Siluridae, 276
                    species; Cliaracinidae, 226; Chromides, 80; Cyprinodontidae, 60; Gymnotidae,
                    20.</p>
                <p>In both regions the great number of species is due to the development of numerous
                    local forms of two families, the <hi rend="italic">Characinidoe</hi> in the New
                    World taking the place of the <hi rend="italic">Cyprvnidoe</hi> of the Old. To
                    these are added a few smaller families with a moderately large number of
                    species, which, however, is only a fraction of that of the leading families, the
                    remainder being represented by a few species only. The number of genera within
                    each of the two regions belonging to the two principal families is also
                    singularly alike; the Indian region having produced about 45 Siluroid and as
                    many Cyprinoid genera, whilst the Neotropical region is tenanted by 54 Siluroid
                    and 40 Chara-cinoid<pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit12newyrich/page/n691/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0912-0691-0674"/> genera. These points of similarity between the
                    two regions cannot be accidental; they indicate that agreement in their physical
                    and hydrographical features which in reality exists. Of Ganoids, we find in
                    tropical America one species only, <hi rend="italic">Lepidosiren</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">paradoxa,</hi> accompanied by two Osteoglossoids <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Osteoglossum bicirrhosum</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Arapaima gigash</hi>
                    Autochthonous and limited to this region are the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Pvlycentridae∙,</hi> all the non-African genera of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Chromides</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Characinidoe</hi>; of Siluroids, the <hi
                    rend="italic">Hypophthalmina, Aspredi-nina,</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >Stegophilina,</hi> and the majority of <hi rend="italic">Pimelodina,
                    Hypostomatina,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Doradina</hi>; the herbivorous
                    Cyprinodonts or <hi rend="italic">Limnophagae,</hi> and numerous insectivorous
                    Cyprinodonts or <hi rend="italic">Carnivoroe</hi>; and the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Gymnotidoe</hi> (electric eel).</p>
                <p>The relations to the other regions are as follows :—</p>
                <p>1. The resemblances to the Indian and Tropical Pacific regions partly date from
                    remote geological epochs, or are partly due to that similarity of physical
                    conditions to which we have already referred. We have again to draw attention to
                    the unexplained presence in South America of a representative of a truly Indian
                    type (not found in Africa), viz., <hi rend="italic">Symbrαmchus</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">marmoratus.</hi> On the other hand, a direct genetic affinity
                    exists between the Neotropical and African regions, as has been noticed in the
                    description of the latter, a great part of their freshwater fauna consisting of
                    descendants from a common stock.</p>
                <p>2. A comparison of the specifically Neotropical with the specifically North
                    American types shows that no two regions can be more dissimilar. It is only in
                    the intervening borderland, and in the large West Indian islands, that the two
                    faunae mix with each other. We need not enter into the details of the physical
                    features of Central America and Mexico; the broken ground, the diversity of
                    climate (produced by different altitudes) within limited districts, the hot and
                    moist alluvial plains surrounding the Mexican Gulf, offer a variety of
                    conditions most favourable to the intermixture of the types from the north and
                    the south. Still the interchange of peculiar forms appears to be only beginning;
                    none have yet penetrated beyond the debateable ground, and it is evident that
                    the land connexion between the two continents is of comparatively recent date,—a
                    view which is confirmed by the identity of the marine fishes on both sides of
                    Central America.</p>
                <p>Cuba—which is the only island in the West Indies that has a number of freshwater
                    fishes sufficient for the determination of its zoo-geographical relations—is
                    inhabited by several kinds of a perch <hi rend="italic">(Ceηtropomus),</hi>
                    freshwater mullets, Cyprinodonts, one species of Chromid (an <hi rend="italic"
                    >Acara),</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Symbranchus</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >marmoratus.</hi> All these fishes are found in Central America, and, as they
                    belong to forms known to enter brackish water more or less freely, it is evident
                    that they have crossed either from that region or from the mainland of South
                    America. But with them there came a remarkable North American type, <hi

                    is found in the United States, has penetrated on the mainland to the Pacific
                    coast of Guatemala, where it is common at the mouth of the rivers and in
                    brackish-water likes along the coast; it probably crossed into Cuba from
                    Florida. A perfectly isolated type of fishes inhabits the subterranean waters in
                    the caves of Cuba (two species of <hi rend="italic">Lucifuga).</hi> The eyes are
                    absent, or quite rudimentary, as in most other cave animals. Singularly, it
                    belongs to a family <hi rend="italic">(Ophidiidoe)</hi> the members of which are
                    strictly marine; and its nearest ally is a genus, <hi rend="italic"
                    >Brotula,</hi> the species of which are distributed over the Indo-Pacific Ocean,
                    one only occurring in the Caribbean Sea. This type must have witnessed all the
                    geological changes which have taken place since Cuba rose above the surface of
                    the sea. A similar mixture of forms of the tropical and temperate types of
                    freshwater fishes takes place in the south of South America; its details have
                    not yet been so well studied as in the north, but this much is evident, that,
                    whilst in the east tropical forms follow the Plate river far into the temperate
                    region, in the west the temperate fauna finds still a congenial climate in
                    ranges of the Andes, situated close to, or even north of, the tropic.</p>
                <p>Like the Indian region, the Tropical American has a peculiar alpine fauna, the
                    freshwater fishes of which, however, belong to the Siluroids and Cyprinodonts.
                    The former are small, dwarfed forms <hi rend="italic">(Arges,</hi><hi

                    in the lowlands of at least the first four genera are mailed. The alpine
                    Cyprinodonts, on the other hand <hi rend="italic">(Orestiash</hi> exceed the
                    usual small size of the other members of this family, and are covered with thick
                    scales, but have lost their ventral fins. Some of these alpine forms, like <hi
                    rend="italic">Trichomycterus,</hi> follow the range of the Andes far into the
                    Southern Temperate region. The majority are found at a height of 15,000 feet
                    above the level of the sea, and a few still higher.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Tropical Pacific Pegion</hi> includes all the islands east
                    of Wallace’s line, New Guinea, Australia (with the exception of its
                    south-eastern portion), and all the islands of the tropical Pacific to the
                    Sandwich group. Comparing the area of this region with that of the others, we
                    find it to be the poorest, not only in point of the number of its species
                    generally (36), but also in the possession of peculiar forms. The paucity of
                    freshwater fishes is due, in the first place, to the arid climate and the
                    deficiency of water in the Australian continent, as well as to the insignificant
                    size of the freshwater courses in the smaller islands. Still this cannot be the
                    only cause; the large island of Celebes, which, by its mountainous portions, as
                    well as by its extensive plains and lowlands, would seem to offer a favourable
                    variety of conditions for the development of a freshwater fauna, is, so far as
                    has been ascertained, tenanted by seven freshwater fishes only, viz., 2 <hi

                    >Monopterus,</hi> all of which are the commonest species of the Indian region.
                    New Guinea has not yet been explored, but, from the faunae nearest to this
                    island, we expect its freshwater fishes will prove to be equally few in number,
                    and identical with those of Celebes and North Australia,—a supposition confirmed
                    by the few small collections which have reached Europe. Finding, then, that even
                    those parts of this region which are favourable to the development of freshwater
                    fishes have not produced any distinct forms, and that the few species which
                    inhabit them are unchanged or but slightly modified Indian species, we must
                    conclude that the whole of this area has remained geologically isolated from the
                    other regions of this zone since the commencement of the existence of <hi
                    rend="italic">Teleostei,</hi> and that, with the exception of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Ceratodus</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Osteoglossum,</hi> the immigration of the
                    other species is of very recent date.</p>
                <p>Fossil remains of <hi rend="italic">Ceratodus</hi> have been found in the Liassic
                    and Triassic formations of North America, England, Germany, and India; it is,
                    therefore, a type which was widely spread in the Mesozoic epoch. Although it
                    would be rash to conclude that its occupation of Australia dates equally far
                    back, for it may have reached that continent long afterwards, yet it is evident
                    that, as it is one of the most ancient of the existing types, so it is certainly
                    the first of the freshwater fishes which appeared in Australia. <hi
                    rend="italic">Osteoglossum,</hi> of which no fossil remains have yet been found,
                    is proved by its distribution to be one of the oldest Teleosteous types. There
                    must have been a long gap of time before these ancient types were joined by the
                    other <hi rend="italic">Teleostei.</hi> All of them migrated through the

                <p>In south-western Australia a mingling of the scanty fauna with that of the
                    southern temperate parts takes place. <hi rend="italic">Oligorus
                    macquariensis</hi> (the Murray cod), which has a congener on the coast of New
                    Zealand, ascends high up the Murray river, so that we cannot decide whether this
                    Percoid should be located in the tropical or the temperate part of Australia.
                    Several <hi rend="italic">Galaxias</hi> also extend to the confines of
                    Queensland, and will probably some day be found members of this region.</p>
                <p>In the smaller Pacific islands the freshwater fishes exhibit a remarkable
                    sameness;· they comprise two or three species of <hi rend="italic">Dales,</hi>
                    several eels, an atherine, and some gobies, mullets, and other fishes which with
                    equal readiness exchange fresh for salt water, and which would at once reach and
                    occupy any streams or freshwater lakes that might be formed on an island.</p>
                <p>The Sandwich Islands are the only group among the smaller islands which are
                    tenanted by a Siluroid, a species of <hi rend="italic">Arius,</hi> which is
                    closely allied to Central American species, and therefore υrobably migrated from
                    tropical America.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Northern Zone.</hi> —The boundaries of the northern zone
                    coincide in the main with the northern limit of the equatorial zone; but, as has
                    been already indicated, they overlap the latter at three different points. This
                    happens in Syria, as well as east of it, where the mixed faunae of the Jordan
                    and the rivers of Mesopotamia demand the inclusion of this territory in the
                    northern zone as well as in the equatorial; in the island of Formosa, where a
                    Salmonoid and several Japanese Cyprinoids flourish; and in Central America,
                    where a <hi rend="italic">Lepidosteus,</hi> a Cyprinoid <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Sclera-gnathus</hi><hi rend="italic">meridionalis),</hi> and an <hi

                    North American fauna in the midst of a host of tropical forms.</p>
                <p>There is no separate arctic zone for freshwater fishes; ichthyic life becomes
                    extinct towards the pole wherever the fresh water remains frozen throughout the
                    year, or thaws for a few weeks only; and the few fishes which extend into high
                    latitudes, in which lakes are open for two or three months in the year, belong
                    to types in no wise differing from those of the more temperate south. The
                    highest latitude at which fishes have been obtained is 82° N. lat., whence the
                    late Arctic Expedition brought back specimens of charr <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Salmo</hi><hi rend="italic">arcturιιs</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Salmo</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">ηaresii).</hi></p>
                <p>The ichthyological features of this zone are well marked. The Chondrosteous
                    Ganoids or sturgeons, and the families of <hi rend="italic">Salmonidoe</hi> and
                    <hi rend="italic">Esocidoe,</hi> are limited to and characteristic of it;
                    Cyprinoids flourish with the Salmonoids, both families preponderating in numbers
                    over the others, whilst the Siluroids are few in number and in variety.</p>
                <p>The two regions into which this zone is divided are very closely related to one
                    another, and their affinity is not unlike that which obtains between the
                    sub-regions of the southern zone. Several species are common to both, viz., <hi
                    rend="italic">Acipenser</hi><hi rend="italic">sturio,</hi><hi rend="italic">A.
                    maculatus, Perca fluviatilis,</hi><hi rend="italic">Gastrosteus

                    branchialis</hi>; and ali recent investigations have resulted in giving
                    additional evidence of the affinity and not of the diversity of the two
                    regions.</p>
                <p>In Europe and temperate Asia, as well as in North America, mountain ranges
                    elevated above the line of perpetual snow would seem to offer physical
                    conditions favourable for the development of a distinct alpine fauna. But this
                    is not the case, because the difference of climate between the mountain
                    districts and the lowlands is much less in this zone than in the equatorial.
                    Consequently the alpine freshwater fishes do not essentially differ from those
                    of the plains; they are principally Salmonoids, and in Asia there are also
                    mountain-barbels and loaches. <hi rend="italic">Salmo</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >orientalis</hi> was found by Griffith to abound in the tributaries of the
                    Bamian river at an altitude of about 11 000 feet.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">The</hi><hi rend="italic">Pdloearctic</hi> or <hi rend="italic"
                    >Europo-Asιatic Region.—</hi> The western and southern boundaries of this region
                    coincide with those of the northern zone, so that only those which divide it
                    from North America need to be indicated. Behring’s Strait and the Kamtchatka Sea
                    have been conventionally taken as the boundary, but this is shown to be
                    artificial by the fact that the animals of both coasts, so far as they are known
                    at present, are not sufficiently distinct to be referred to two different
                    regions. As to the freshwater fishes, those of north-western America and of
                    Kamtchatka are but imperfectly known, but there can be little doubt that the
                    same agreement exists between them as is the case -with other classes of
                    animals. The Japanese islands exhibit a decided Palaearctic fish fauna, which
                    includes <hi rend="italic">Barbus</hi> and Cobitioids, farms strange to the
                    North American fauna. A slight influx of tropical forms is perceived in the
                    south of Japan, where two <hi rend="italic">Bagrνna (PseudobagrU8
                    aurantiacus</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Liocassis longirostms)</hi> have
                    established themselves for a considerable .period, for both are peculiar to the
                    island, and have not been found else where.</p>
                <p>In the east, as well as in the west, the distinction between the Europo-Asiatic
                    and the North American regions disappears almost entirely as we advance farther
                    towards the north. Of four species of the genus <hi rend="italic">Salmo</hi>
                    known from Iceland, one (N. <hi rend="italic">salar)</hi> is common to both
                    regions, two are European <hi rend="italic">(S.famo</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >S. alpinus),</hi> and one is a peculiarly Icelandic race <hi rend="italic">(S.
                    nivalis).</hi> So far as we know the Salmonoids of Greenland and the tract
                    adjoining Baffin’s Bay, they are all very closely allied to European species,
                    though they may be distinguished as local races.</p>
                <p>Finally, as we have seen above, the Europo-Asiatic fauna mingles with African and
                    Indian forms in Syria, Persia, and Afghanistan. <hi rend="italic">Capoeta,</hi>
                    a Cyprinoid genus, is characteristic of this district, and well represented in
                    the Jordan and the rivers of Mesopotomia. Out of the 40 families of freshwater
                    fishes 13 are represented in this region; the number of species is comparatively
                    small, viz., 360.</p>
                <p>Assuming that the distribution of Cyprinoids has taken its origin from the alpine
                    tract of country dividing the Indian and Palaearctic regions, we find that this
                    type has found in the temperate region as favourable conditions for its
                    development as in the tropical. Out of the 360 species no less than 215 are
                    Cyprinoids. In the countries and on the plateaus immediately adjoining the
                    Himalayan ranges those mountain forms which we mentioned as peculiar to the
                    Indian Alps abound, and extend for a considerable distance towards the west and
                    east, mixed with other <hi rend="italic">Cyρrinina</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >Cobitidina.</hi> The representatives of these two groups are more numerous in
                    Central and Eastern Asia than in Europe and the northern parts of Asia, where
                    the <hi rend="italic">Leuciscina</hi> predominate. <hi rend="italic"
                    >Abramidina</hi> or breams are more numerous in the south and east of Asia, but
                    they spread to the extreme north-western and northern limits to which the
                    Cyprinoid type readies. The <hi rend="italic">Rhodeina</hi> are a small family
                    especially characteristic of the East, but with one or two offshoots in Central
                    Europe. Very significant is the appearance in China of a species of the <hi
                    rend="italic">Catostomiηa,</hi> a group otherwise limited to North America.</p>
                <p>The Cyprinoids, in their dispersal northwards from the south, are met from the
                    opposite direction by the freshwater Salmonoids. These fishes are, without
                    doubt, one of the youngest families of <hi rend="italic">Téleostei,</hi> for
                    they did not appear before the Pliocene era; they flourished at any rate during
                    the Glacial period, and, as is testified by the survivors which we find in
                    isolated elevated positions, like the trout of the Atl is, <pb break="no"

                    Kush, they spread to the extreme south of this region. At the present day they
                    are most numerously represented in its northern temperate parts; towards the
                    south they become fewer, but increase again in numbers and species where-ever a
                    great elevation offers them the snow-fed waters which they affect. In the rivers
                    of the Mediterranean, Salmonoids are by no means rare, but they prefer the upper
                    courses of those rivers, and do not migrate to the sea, with the exception,
                    perhaps, of some species in the rivers of the North Adriatic.</p>

                    >Comephorus,</hi> a dwarrect and much changed Gadoid which inhabits the greatest
                    depths of Lake Baikal.</p>
                <p>Remnants of the Palaeichthyic fauna exist in the sturgeons and lampreys. The
                    former inhabit in abundance the great rivers of eastern Europe and Asia,
                    periodically ascending them from the sea; their southernmost limits are the
                    Yang-tse-Keang in the east, and towards the centre of this region the rivers
                    flowing into the Adriatic, Black, and Caspian Seas, and Lake Aral. None are
                    known to have gone beyond the boundaries of the northern zone. If the lampreys
                    are justly reckoned among freshwater fishes, their distribution is unique and
                    exceptional. In the Palaearctic region some of the species descend periodically
                    to the sea, whilst others remain stationary in the rivers; the same has been
                    observed in the lampreys of North America. They are entirely absent in the
                    equatorial zone, but reappear in the temperate zone of the southern hemisphere.
                    Many points in the organization of the Cyclostomes indicate that they are a type
                    of great antiquity.</p>
                <p>The remaining Palaearctic fishes are clearly immigrants from neighbouring
                    regions: thus <hi rend="italic">Silurus,</hi><hi rend="italic">Afacrones,</hi>
                    and <hi rend="italic">Pseudobagrus</hi> have migrated from the Indian region,
                    <hi rend="italic">Amiurus</hi> and, as mentioned above, <hi rend="italic"
                    >Catostomus</hi> from North Am rica. The Cyprinodonts are restricted to the
                    southern and warmer parts, and all belong to the carnivorous division. The
                    facility with which these fishes accommodate themselves to a sojourn in fresh,
                    brackish, or salt water, and even in thermal springs, renders their general
                    distribution easily comprehensible, but it is impossible to decide to which
                    region they originally belonged; their remains in Tertiary deposits round the
                    Mediterranean are not rare.</p>
                <p>The boundaries of the <hi rend="italic">North American</hi> or <hi rend="italic"
                    >Nearctic Region</hi> have been sufficiently indicated. The main features and
                    the distribution of this fauna are identical with those of the preceding region.
                    Out of the 40 families of freshwater fishes 19 are found in this region. The
                    proportion of Cyprinoid species to the total number of North American fishes
                    (135: 339) appears to be considerably less than in the Palaearctic region, but
                    we cannot admit that these figures approach the truth, as the Cyprinoids of
                    North America have been much less studied than those of Europe; of many scarcely
                    more than the name is known. This also applies in a great measure to the
                    Salmonoids, of which only half as many as are found in the Palaearctic region
                    have been sufficiently described to be worthy of consideration. North America
                    will, without doubt, in the end show as many distinct races as Europe and
                    Asia.</p>
                <p>Cyprinoids belonging to living as well as extinct genera existed in North America
                    in the Tertiary period. At present the <hi rend="italic">Cyprinina,

                    Some very remarkable forms, types of distinct families, though represented by

                    fishes, viz., <hi rend="italic">Aphredoderus, Percopsis, Hyodon,</hi> and the

                <p>A peculiar feature of the North American fish fauna is that it has retained,
                    besides the sturgeons and lampreys, representatives of two Ganoid families, <hi

                    been found in the western hemisphere only.</p>
                <p>It is difficult to account for the presence of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Amiu-ιiηα</hi> in North America. They form a well-marked division of the <hi

                    should not be regarded as immigrants from the south, as is the case with the
                    Palaearctic Siluroids. Nor again, has the connexion between South and North
                    America been established sufficiently long to admit of the supposition that
                    these Siluroids could have spread in the interval from the south to the northern

                    boundaries of the latter in South Australia and South America, but we have not
                    at present the means of exactly defining the limits to which southern types
                    extend northwards. This zone includes Tasmania, with at least a portion of
                    south-eastern Australia <hi rend="italic">(Tasmanian subregion),</hi> New
                    Zealand and the Auckland Islands <hi rend="italic">(New Zealand

                    known from Kerguelen’s Land, or from islands beyond 55° S. lat. The southern
                    extremity of Africa has to be excluded from this zone so far as freshwater
                    fishes are concerned.</p>
                <p>With regard to its extent as well as to the number of species, this zone is the
                    smallest of the three, the number of species known being 11 in the Tasmanian, 8
                    in the New Zealand, and 18 in the Fuegian sub-region. Yet the ichthyological
                    features of this zone are well marked; they consist in the presence of two
                    peculiar families, each of which is analogous to a northern type, viz., the <hi

                <p>Although geographically widely separate from each other, the freshwater fishes of
                    the three divisions are nevertheless so closely allied that conclusions drawn
                    from this group of animals alone would hardly justify us in regarding these
                    divisions as sub-regions. One species of <hi rend="italic">Galaxias (G.</hi><hi

                    ascend rivers periodically to spawn; another part remain in rivers and lakes,
                    where they propagate, never descending to the sea, this freshwater race being
                    constantly smaller than their marine brethren. That this small Teleostean of the
                    northern hemisphere should reappear, though in a generically modified form, in
                    New Zealand, without having spread over other parts of the southern zone, is one
                    of the most remarkable and at present inexplicable facts of the geographical
                    distribution of freshwater fishes.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Brackish-Water Fishes.</hi></p>
                <p>On those parts of a coast at which there is a mixture of fresh and salt water,
                    either in consequence of some river emptying itself into the sea, or from
                    accumulations on the land-surface forming lagoons which are in uninterrupted or
                    temporary communication with the sea, there flourishes a peculiar brackish-water
                    fauna characterized by the presence of fishes found sometimes in the sea, and
                    sometimes in pure fresh water.</p>
                <p>This fauna can be somewhat sharply defined if a limited district only is taken
                    into consideration; thus, the species of the brackish-water fauna of Great
                    Britain, of the Pacific co ist of Central America, of the larger East India
                    islands, &lt;fcc., can be enumerated without much hesitation. But difficulties
                    occur when we attempt to generalize in the enumeration of the forms referable to
                    the brackish-water fauna, because the genera and families enumerated include
                    certain species and genera which have habituated themselves exclusively either
                    to a freshwater or a marine existence, and also because a species of fish may be
                    at one locality an inhabitant of brackish water, at another of the sea, and at a
                    third of fresh water. The circumstance that these fishes can live either in the
                    sea or in fresh water has enabled them to spread readily over the globe, a few
                    only being limited to particular regions; in dividing the earth’s surface into
                    natural zoological regions, therefore, the taxonomist receives no assistance
                    from the brackish-water f &gt;rms. The following fishes may be referred to this

                    local interest, and would carry us beyond the scope of a general account of the
                    distribution of fishes.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Marine Fishes.</hi></p>
                <p>Marine fishes fall, with regard to their mode of life and distribution, into
                    three distinct categories :—</p>
                <p>1. <hi rend="italic">Shore Fishes—</hi> that is, fishes which chiefly inhabit
                    parts of the sea in the immediate neighbourhood of land either actually raised
                    above, or at least but little submerged below, the surface of the water. They do
                    not descend to any great depth,—very few to 300 fathoms, and the majority live
                    close to the surface. The distribution of these fishes is determined, not only
                    by the temperature of the surface water, but also by the nature of the adjacent
                    land and its animal and vegetable products,— some being confined to flat coasts
                    with soft or sandy bottoms, others to rocky and fissured coasts, others to
                    living coral formations. If it were not for the frequent mechanical and
                    involuntary removals to which these fishes are exposed, their distribution
                    within certain limits, as it no doubt originally existed, would resemble still
                    more that of freshwater fishes than we find it actually does at the present
                    period.</p>
                <p>2. <hi rend="italic">Pelagic Fishes-</hi> —that is, fishes which inhabit the
                    surface and uppermost strata of the open ocean, and approach the shores only
                    accidentally, or occasionally (insearch of prey), or periodically (for the
                    purpose of spawning). The majority spawn in the opsn sea, their ova and young
                    being always found at a great distance from the shore. With regard to their
                    distribution, they are still subject to the influences of light and the
                    temperature of the surface water; but they are independent of the variable local
                    conditions which tie the shore fish to its original home, and therefore roam
                    freely over a space which would take a freshwater or shore fish thousands of
                    years to cover in its gradual dispersal. Such as are devoid of rapidity of
                    motion are dispersed over similarly large areas by the oceanic currents, more
                    slowly than the strong swimmers, but not less surely. An accurate definition,
                    therefore, of their distribution within certain areas equivalent to the

                    depths of the ocean that they are but little or not at all influenced by light
                    or the surface temperature, and which, by their organization, are prevented from
                    reaching the surface stratum in a healthy condition. Living almost under
                    identical tellurian conditions, the same type, the same species, may inhabit an
                    abyssal depth under the equator as well as one near the arctic or antarctic
                    circle; and all that we know of these fishes points to the conclusion that no
                    separate horizontal regions can be distinguished in the abyssal fauna, and that
                    no division into bathymetrical strata can be attempted on the base of generic
                    much less of family characters.</p>

                    :—</p>
                <p>1. The Arctic Ocean.</p>

                <p>C The Pacific coast of Tropical America.</p>
                <p>1. The Central American district</p>
                <p>2. The Galapagos district.</p>
                <p>3. The Peruvian district.</p>
                <p><hi> IV</hi> The Southern Temperate Zone.</p>
                <p>1. The Cape of Good Hope district.</p>
                <p>2. The South Australian district.</p>
                <p>3. The Chilian district.</p>
                <p>4. The Patagonian district.</p>
                <p>V. The Antarctic Ocean.</p>
                <p>As with freshwater fishes, the main divisions of the shore-fish faunae are
                    determined by their distance from the equator, the equatorial zone of the
                    freshwater series corresponding entirely to that of the shore-fish series. But
                    as marine fishes extend farther towards the poles than freshwater fishes, and as
                    the polar types are more specialized, a distinct arctic and antarctic fauna may
                    be separated from the faunae of the temperate zones. The two subdivisions of the
                    northern temperate zone in the freshwater series are quite analogous to the
                    corresponding divisions in the coast s ries. Tn the southern hemisphere the
                    shore fishes of the extremity of Africa form a separate district of the
                    temperate zone, whilst the freshwater fishes of South Africa were found to be
                    tropical types. The marine series of the southern temperate zone is also much
                    more diversified than the freshwater series, and admits of further subdivision,
                    which, although in some degree indicated in the freshwater series, does not
                    entirely correspond to that proposed for the latter.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Arctic Ocean.</hi> —The shore fishes clearly prove a
                    continuity of the arctic circumpolar fauna, as the southern limit of which we
                    may indicate the southern extremity of Greenland and the Aleutian Archipelago,
                    or 60° N. lat.</p>
                <p>Towards the north, fishes become less in variety of species and fewer in number
                    of individuals, and only very few genera are restricted to this fauna.</p>
                <p>The highest latitude at which shore fishes have been observed is 83° N. The late
                    Arctic Expedition collected at and near that latitude specimens of <hi

                    rend="italic">Gadus</hi><hi rend="italic">fabricü.</hi> The number would
                    probably have been larger were it not that the difficulties of collecting fishes
                    in these high latitudes are almost insuperable for the greater part of the
                    year.</p>
                <p>So far as we know, the fishes north and south of Behring’s Straits belong to the
                    same generic or family types as those of the corresponding latitudes of the
                    eastern hemisphere, though the majority are specifically distinct. But the
                    information we possess of the fishes of the northernmost extremity of the
                    Pacific is extremely scanty and vague. Farther south, whence now and then a
                    collection reaches Europe, we meet with some European species, as the herring,
                    holibut, and hake.</p>
                <p>Chondropterygians are very rare. Of Acanthopterygians the families of <hi
                    rend="italic">Cottidae,</hi><hi rend="italic">Cataphracti,</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Discoboli,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Blenniidae</hi> are well represented, and
                    several of the genera are characteristic of the arctic fauna. Characteristic
                    also is the development of Gadoid fishes, of which some thirteen species,
                    belonging to <hi rend="italic">Gadus, Merluccius,</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >Hοlva,</hi> form one of the principal articles of food for the inhabitants of
                    the coasts of the Arctic Ocean. The Blen-noid <hi rend="italic">Anacanthini</hi>
                    or <hi rend="italic">Lycodidae</hi> are limited to the Arctic and Antarctic
                    coasts. <hi rend="italic">Ammodytes</hi> and a few flat-fishes <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Hippoglossoides</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Pleuronectes)</hi> are common in
                    the more temperate parts. Labroids only exceptionally penetrate so far towards
                    the north. Physostomes are very rare, and are represented only by a few species
                    of <hi rend="italic">Clupea</hi> and by <hi rend="italic">Mallotus.</hi> The
                    arctic climate is still less favourable to the existence of Lophobranchs, only a
                    few of <hi rend="italic">Syηgηa-thus</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Nerophis</hi>
                    being present in the more southern latitudes, to which they have been carried by
                    oceanic currents from their more congenial home in the south. Scleroderms and
                    Plectognaths are entirely absent. The Gadoids are accompanied by <hi
                    rend="italic">Myxine,</hi> which thrives in them as a parasite.</p>

                    North Atlantic.—</hi> This part of the fauna may be subdivided into three
                    districts :—</p>
                <p>1. The fishes of the north-eastern shores, viz., of the British Islands, of
                    Scandinavia so far as it is not included in the arctic fauna, and of the
                    continent of Europe southwards to about 40° N. lat.: British district.</p>
                <p>2. The fishes of the Mediterranean shores and of the adjoining shores of the
                    Atlantic, including the Azores, Madeira, and the Canary Islands: Mediterranean
                    district.</p>
                <p>3. The fishes of the western shores, from 60° to about 30° N. lat.: North
                    American district.</p>
                <p>1. The British district shows scarcely any marked distinctive features; the
                    character of its fauna is simply intermediate between that of the Arctic Ocean
                    and the Mediterranean district; truly arctic forms disappear, while such as are
                    also found in the Mediterranean make their appearance. With regard to the
                    abundance of individuals and variety of fishes also, this district forms a
                    transition from the north towards the south.</p>
                <p>Besides the few arctic Chondropterygians, all of which extend into this district,
                    the small shore dog-fishes are well represented <hi rend="italic">(Mustelus,
                    Gαleus, Scyllium, Pristiurus);</hi> the ubiquitous <hi rend="italic">Rhina</hi>
                    or monk-fish is common; of rays, <hi rend="italic">Raia</hi> predominates in a
                    variety of species over <hi rend="italic">Torpedo</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >Trygon,</hi> which are still rare.</p>
                <p>Of Acanthopterygians, <hi rend="italic">Centridermichthys, Icelus, Triglops,</hi>
                    and <hi rend="italic">Aspidophoroides</hi> do not extend from the north into
                    this district; and <hi rend="italic">Cottus, Anarrhichas, Centronotus,
                    Stichceus,</hi> and lhe <hi rend="italic">Discoboli</hi> disappear within its
                    limits. Nearly all the remainder are genera which are also found in the
                    Mediterranean district. The following are the principal forms known to propagate
                    on these shores: <hi rend="italic">Ldbrax;</hi><hi rend="italic"

                <p>Of the <hi rend="italic">Anacanthini</hi> the Gadoids are. as numerous as in the

                    >Tautoga,</hi> all the other genera are met with.</p>
                <p>Physostomes are not well represented, viz., by one species of <hi rend="italic"

                    >Syngnathus</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Nerophis</hi> become more common as we
                    proceed southwards; but the existence of Scleroderms and Plectognaths is
                    indicated by single individuals only, stragglers from their southern home,
                    unable to establish themselves in a climate ungenial to them.</p>
                <p>The Gadoids are accompanied by <hi rend="italic">Myxine</hi>; and <hi
                    rend="italic">Branchiostoma</hi> may be found in all suitable localities.</p>
                <p>2. The Mediterranean district is distinguished by a great variety of forms; yet,
                    with the exception of a few genera established for single species, none of the
                    forms can be considered peculiar to it; ana even that small number of peculiar
                    genera is more and more diminished as our knowledge of the distribution of
                    fishes advances. Some genera are identical with those found on the western
                    coasts of the Atlantic and in the West Indies; but a most remarkable and
                    unexpected affinity obtains with another very distant fauna, viz., that of
                    Japan. The number of genera common to the Mediterranean district and the
                    Japanese coasts is larger than that of the genera common to the Mediterranean
                    and the opposite American coasts.</p>
                <p>The Chondropterygians found in the British district continue in the
                    Mediterranean, their number being increased by <hi rend="italic">Centrina,
                    Spinax, Pteroplatea,</hi> and some species of <hi rend="italic">Rhinobatus,</hi>
                    a genus more numerously represented in the tropics. <hi rend="italic"
                    >Torpedo</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Trygon</hi> are common.</p>
                <p>The greatest variety belong to the Acanthopterygians, which are represented by

                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Labridae</hi> are as common as in the British district, or
                    even more so, and are represented by the same genera. But, besides these, some
                    other Pharyngognaths, properly belonging to the tropical Atlantic, have fully
                    established themselves, though only by a few species, viz., <hi rend="italic"

                <p>The Gadoids show a marked decrease of development; and the species of <hi
                    rend="italic">Gadus, Gadiculus, Mora, Slrinsia,</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Phycis,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Molva</hi> which are peculiar to the
                    Mediterranean seem to inhabit rather the tolder water of moderate depths than
                    the surface near the shore. <hi rend="italic">Motella,</hi> however, proves also
                    to be a true shore fish in the Mediterranean, at least in its adult state. <hi
                    rend="italic">Ophidium</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Fierasfer</hi> appear now
                    besides <hi rend="italic">Ammodytes.</hi> As the Gadoids decrease, so the <hi
                    rend="italic">Pleuro~ nectidoe</hi> increase, 9 genera being found in this
                    district.</p>
                <p>The variety of Physostomes is small, the following only having to be added to
                    those of the British district: <hi rend="italic">Sauras</hi> (a tropical genus),
                    <hi rend="italic">Aulopus;</hi><hi rend="italic">Congromuroena,</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Heteroconger,</hi><hi rend="italic">Myrus,</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Ophichthys, Maraena.</hi></p>
                <p>The Lophobranchs are more numerous in species and individuals than in the British
                    district; and, besides <hi rend="italic">Syngnathus</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >Nerophis,</hi> several species of <hi rend="italic">Hippocampus</hi> are
                    common. A few species of <hi rend="italic">Balistes</hi> also occur.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Myxine</hi> is lost in this district, whilst <hi rend="italic"
                    >Branchiostoma</hi> is abundant.</p>
                <p>3. The shore fishes of the North American district consist, as on the eastern
                    coasts of the North Atlantic, of northern (about 50 general and southern (about
                    30) elements; but they are still more mixe&lt;l with each other than on the
                    European coasts, so that a boundary line cannot be drawn between them. The
                    affinity to the fauna of the eastern shores is great, but almost entirely
                    limited to the genera composing the fauna of the British district. British
                    genera not found on the American coasts are— <hi rend="italic">Galeus, Scyllium,
                    Chimaera,</hi><hi rend="italic">Mullus,</hi><hi rend="italic">Pagellus, Trigla,
                    Trachinus, Zeus, Callionymus.</hi> The southern elements of North America are
                    rather derived from the West Indies, and have no special affinity to
                    Mediterranean forms; very few of the non-British Mediterranean forms extend
                    across the Atlantic; instead of a Mediterranean we find a West Indian element.
                    Many of the British <hi rend="italic">species</hi> range across the Atlantic,
                    and inhabit in an unchanged condition the northern parts of this district; and
                    from the frequent occurrence of isolated specimens of other British species on
                    the North American coast, we may presume that many more occasionally cross the
                    Atlantic, but without being able to obtain a permanent footing.</p>
                <p>The genera peculiar to this district are few in number, and composed of very few
                    species, viz., <hi rend="italic">Hemitripterus. Pammclas, Chasmodes,
                    Cryptacanthodes,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Tautoga.</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Temperate North Pacific.—</hi> This fauna shows a great affinity to that of the
                    Temperate North Atlantic, not only in including a considerable proportion of
                    identical genera, and even of species, but also in having its constituent parts
                    similarly distributed. Our knowledge of the ichthyology of this fauna, however,
                    is by no means complete, and the details of the distribution of the fishes of
                    these shores have •still to be worked out; nevertheless, three divisions may be
                    recognized which, for the present, may be defined as follows :—</p>
                <p>1. The fishes of the north-western shores, to about 37®</p>
                <p>N. lat., including the corresponding northern parts of Japan: Kamtchatkan
                    district. This corresponds to the British district of the Atlantic. ♦</p>
                <p>2. The fishes of southern Japan and the corresponding shores of the continent of
                    Asia, between 37° and 30 <hi rend="superscript"> δ</hi> N. lat.: Japanese
                    district, which corresponds to the Mediterranean.</p>
                <p>3. The fishes of the eastern shores southwards to the latitude of San Francisco:
                    Californian district. This corresponds to the North American district of the
                    Atlantic.</p>
                <p>Too little is known of the shore fishes of the coasts between San Francisco and
                    the tropic to enable us to treat of it as a separate division.</p>
                <p>The shore fishes of the North Pacific generally are composed of the following
                    elements :—</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">a.</hi> Arctic forms which extend into the Arctic Ocean, and
                    the majority of which are also found in the British district.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">l&gt;.</hi> Peculiar forms limited to the North Pacific, like
                    the <hi rend="italic">Heteroleρidina,</hi><hi rend="italic">Ernbiotocidoe,</hi>
                    and certain Cottoid and Bien-nioid genera.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">c.</hi> Forms identical with fishes of the Mediterranean.</p>
                <p>&lt;Z. Peculiar forms limited to the southern parts of Japan.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">e.</hi> Tropical forms which have entered the North Pacific
                    from the south.</p>
                <p>1. To the Kamtchatkan district we can assign but a small list of fishes, probably
                    because of the imperfect manner in which its fauna has been explored. At present
                    we have positive knowledge of the occurrence of only two Chondropterygians,
                    viz., <hi rend="italic">Chimaera</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Raia;</hi> the
                    species of the latter genus seem to be much less numerous than in the Atlantic.
                    Of Acanthopterygians 15 genera are known. Labroids are absent; they are clearly
                    a type unable to endure great cold; of the Embiotocoids which represent them in
                    the Pacific, one species only (a species of <hi rend="italic">Ditrema)</hi> is
                    known from this district.</p>
                <p>The Gadoids are, so far as we know at present, sparsely represented, viz., by
                    isolated species of <hi rend="italic">Gadus,</hi><hi rend="italic">Motella,</hi>
                    and <hi rend="italic">Lotella,</hi> the last being an inhabitant of moderate
                    depths rather than of the surface. <hi rend="italic">Hippoglossus,
                    Pleuronectes,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Parophrys</hi> seem to occur everywhere
                    in suitable localities.</p>
                <p>The Physostomes are nearly the same as in the British district, viz., a smelt <hi
                    rend="italic">{Hypomesus),</hi> probably also the arctic <hi rend="italic"
                    >Mallotus,</hi> an anchovy, several species of <hi rend="italic">Clupea,</hi>
                    and the conger-eel. A very singular Salmonoid fish, <hi rend="italic"
                    >Salanx,</hi> which is limited to the northwestern Pacific, occurs in great
                    abundance. The Lophobranchs also correspond in their development to those of the
                    British district, <hi rend="italic">Nerophis</hi> being replaced by <hi
                    rend="italic">Urocampus.</hi> Neither Myxinoids nor <hi rend="italic"
                    >Branchiostoma</hi> have as yet been found.</p>
                <p>2. The Japanese district is, like the Mediterranean, distinguished by a great
                    variety of forms. Of 102 genera known to inhabit these coasts, 13 are peculiar
                    to it, 53 occur in the Mediterranean, though also in other districts. This
                    resemblance to the Mediterranean is even greater than would appear from a
                    comparison of the genera, inasmuch as a considerable number of species are
                    identical in both districts. Three of the Berycoid genera have hitherto been
                    found in the Japanese and Mediterranean districts and nowhere else. Another very
                    singular fact is that some of the most characteristic genera, like <hi
                    rend="italic">Mullus,</hi><hi rend="italic">Zeus, Callionymus,</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Centrismes,</hi> inhabit the Mediterranean and Japanese districts,
                    but have never reached the opposite American coasts, either in the Atlantic or
                    the Pacific; although, at least in the latter, the oceanic currents would rather
                    favour than obstruct their dispersal in the direction of America. Bold as the
                    hypothesis may appear, we can only account for the singular distribution of
                    these shore fishes by assuming that the Mediterranean and Japanese seas were in
                    direct and open communication with each other within the period of the existence
                    of the present Teleosteous fauna.</p>
                <p>Gadoids have disappeared, or are represented by forms inhabiting moderate depths.
                    Neither <hi rend="italic">Myxine</hi> nor <hi rend="italic">Branchiostoma</hi>
                    are as yet known to have been found.</p>
                <p>3. The Californian district includes a marked northern element, the principal
                    constituents of which are identical with types occurring in the corresponding
                    district of the Atlantic, viz., the North American, as exemplified by <hi
                    rend="italic">Discoboli, Anarrhichas, Ccntronotus</hi><hi rend="italic
                    subscript"> t</hi><hi rend="italic">Coitus, Hippoglossus,</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Clupea</hi><hi rend="italic">(harengus),</hi> &amp;c. But it possesses also, in
                    the greatest degree of development, some types almost peculiar to itself, as the
                    <hi rend="italic">Heterolejridina,</hi> some remarkable Cottoid and Blennioid
                    genera, and more especially the Embiotocoids—viviparous Pharyngognaths—which
                    replace the Labroids of the other herni-sphere<pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit12newyrich/page/n697/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0912-0697-0680"/>. Gadoids are much less numerous than in the North
                    American district. The southern forms are but little known, but it may be
                    anticipated that, owing to the partial identity of the faunae of the two coasts
                    of the isthmus of Panama, a fair proportion of West Indian forms will be found
                    to have entered this district from the south.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Equatorial Zone.</hi> —As we approach the tropic from the
                    north, the types characteristic of the arctic and temperate zones become rarer,
                    and disappear altogether, to be replaced by the greater variety of tropical
                    types. Of Chondropterygians, the <hi rend="italic">Chimoeridoe,
                    Spinacidoe,</hi><hi rend="italic">Alustelus,</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >Raia</hi> do not pass the tropic, or appear in single species only; and of
                    Teleosteans, the <hi rend="italic">Berycidoe,</hi><hi rend="italic">Pagrus,
                    lh,eHetero-lepidiηa, Cott us</hi> and allied genera, <hi rend="italic">Lophius,
                    Anarrhichas,</hi><hi rend="italic">Stichoeus,</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Lepadogaster,</hi><hi rend="italic">Psychrolutes,</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Centriscus, Hotacan-ihus,</hi> the <hi rend="italic">Labridoe</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">Embiotocidoe,</hi> the <hi rend="italic">Lycodidoe, Gadidoe,</hi>
                    and marine <hi rend="italic">Salmonidoe</hi> either entirely disappear, or
                    retire from the shores and surface into the depths of the ocean.</p>
                <p>With regard to variety of forms, as well as to number of individuals, this zone
                    far surpasses either of the temperate zones; in this respect, the life in the
                    sea is like that on the land. Shore fishes are not confined to the actual coast
                    line, but abound on the coral reefs with which some parts of the Atlantic and
                    Pacific are studded, and many of which are below the surface of the water. The
                    abundance of animal and vegetable life which flourishes on these renders them
                    the favourite pasture grounds for the endless va∣iety of coralfishes <hi
                    rend="italic">(Squamipinnes,</hi><hi rend="italic">Acronuridoe, Pomacentridoe,
                    Julidoe,</hi><hi rend="italic">Plectognathi,</hi> &lt;kc.) and for the larger
                    predatory kinds. The colours and grotesque forms of the fishes of the tropics
                    justly excited the admiration of the earliest observers. Scarlet, black, blue,
                    pink, red, yellow, &amp;c., are arranged in patterns of the most bizarre
                    fashion, mingling in spots, lines, or bands, and reminding us of the words of
                    Captain Cook when describing the coral-reefs of Palmerston Island: “The glowing
                    appearance of the mollusks was still inferior to that of the multitude of fishes
                    that glided gently along, seemingly with the most perfect security. The colours
                    of the different sorts were the most beautiful that can be imagined—the yellow,
                    blue, red, black, &amp;c., far exceeding anything that art can produce. Their
                    various forms, also, contributed to increase the richness of this submarine
                    grotto, which could not be surveyed without a pleasing transport.”</p>

                    are represented by numerous species; and the majority of these genera and

                    >Pomacentridoe,</hi><hi rend="italic">Julidina,</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >Scarina</hi> are met with near every coral formation in a living condition. Of
                    Gadoids, a singular minute form, <hi rend="italic">Bregmaceros,</hi> is almost
                    the only representative, the other forms belonging to deep water, and rarely
                    ascending to the surface. Flatfishes <hi rend="italic">(Pleuronectidae)</hi> are
                    common on sandy coasts, and the majority of the genera are peculiar to the

                    several coasts.</p>
                <p>Geographically it is convenient to describe the coast fauna of the tropical
                    Atlantic separately from that of the 1ndυ-Pacific Ocean. The differences between
                    them, however, are far less numerous and important than between the freshwater
                    or terrestrial faunae of continental regions. The majority of the principal
                    types are found in both, many of the species being even identical; but the
                    species are far more abundant in the Indo-Pacific than in the Atlantic, owing to
                    the greater extent of the archipelagoes in the former. But for the broken and
                    varied character of the coasts of the West Indies, the shores of the tropical
                    Atlantic would, by their general uniformity, afford but a limited variety of
                    conditions for the development of specific and generic forms, whereas the deep
                    inlets of the Indian Ocean, with the varying configuration of their coasts and
                    the different nature of the bottom, its long peninsulas, and its archipelagoes,
                    and the scattered islands of the tropical Pacific, render this part of the globe
                    the most perfect for the development of fish life. The fishes of the Indian and
                    Pacific Oceans (between the tropics) are almost identical, and the number of
                    species ranging from the Red Sea and the east coast of Africa to Polynesia, even
                    to its most westerly islands, is very great indeed. This Indo-Pacific fauna,
                    however, does not reach the Pacific coast of South America. The wide space
                    devoid of islands east of the Sandwich Islands and the Marquesas group, together
                    with the current of cold water which sweeps northwards along the South American
                    coast, has proved to be a very effectual barrier to the eastward extension of
                    the Indo-Pacific fauna of coast fishes; and, consequently, we find an assemblage
                    of fishes on the American coast and at the Galapagos Islands, sufficiently
                    marked to constitute a distinct zoological division.</p>

                    entirely absent. The genera that remain are such as are found in the tropical
                    zone generally, but the species are entirely different from those of the
                    Indo-Pacific. They are mixed with a sprinkling of peculiar genera, consisting of
                    one or two species, like <hi rend="italic">Discopyge, Hoplopagrus,
                    Doydixodon,</hi> but they are too few in number to give a strikingly peculiar
                    character to this fauna.</p>
                <p>Three districts are distinguishable, viz., the Central American, the Galapagos,
                    and Peruvian. We add a few remarks on the first only.<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>For the others the reader is referred to
                    Giinther’s <hi rend="italic">Introduction to the Study of Fishes,</hi> p.
                    280.</p></note> That district shows so close an affinity to the Tropical
                    Atlantic that, if the two were not separated by the neck of land uniting North
                    and South America, they would most assuredly be regarded as embracing a single
                    fauna. With scarcely any exceptions the genera are identical, and of the species
                    found on the Pacific side nearly one-half have proved to be’the same as those of
                    the Atlantic. The explanation of this fact has been found in the existence of
                    communications between the two oceans by channels and straits which must have
                    been open till within a recent period. The isthmus of Central America was then
                    partially submerged, and appeared as a chain of islands similar to that of the
                    Antilles; but as the reef-building corals flourished chiefly north and east of
                    those islands, and were absent to the south and west of them, reef fishes were
                    excluded from the Pacific shores when the communications were destroyed by the
                    upheaval of the land.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Southern Temperate Zone.</hi> —This zone includes the coasts
                    of the southern extremity of Africa from about 30° S. lat, of the south of
                    Australia, with Tasmania, and of New Zealand, and the Pacific and Atlantic
                    coasts of South America between 30° and 50° S lat.</p>
                <p>The most striking character of this fauna is the reappearance of types inhabiting
                    the corresponding latitudes of the northern hemisphere, and not found in the
                    intervening tropical zone. This interruption of the continuity in the
                    geographical distribution of shore fishes is exemplified by species as well as

                <p>Naturally, where the coasts of the tropical zone are continuous with those of the
                    temperate, a number of tropical genera enter the latter, and genera which we
                    have found between the tropics, as well as in the temperate zone of the northern
                    hemisphere, extend in a similar manner towards the south. But the truly tropical
                    forms are absent; there are no <hi rend="italic">Squamipinnes,</hi> scarcely any

                    to their distribution in time and in space, consists of temperate and tropical

                    zone <hi rend="italic">(Trachichthys)</hi> is much more nearly allied to the
                    northern than to the tropical genera.</p>

                    (forms with a bony stay of the praeoperculum, which is generally armed) have not
                    crossed the tropical zone; they are replaced by fishes extremely similar in
                    general form, and having the same habits, but lacking that osteolυgical
                    peculiarity. Their southern analogues belong chiefly to the family <hi

                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Discoboli</hi> of the northern hemisphere likewise have not

                <p>Nearly all the <hi rend="italic">Pleuronectidoe</hi> (but they are not numerous)
                    belong to distinct genera, some, however, being remarkably similar in general
                    form to the northern <hi rend="italic">Pleuro-ηectes.</hi></p>
                <p>With Gadoids <hi rend="italic">Myxinidoe</hi> reappear, one species being

                    a genus peculiar to the southern temperate zone.</p>
                <p>As in the northern temperate zone, so in the southern the number of individuals
                    and the variety of forms is much less than between the tropics. This is
                    especially apparent on comparing the numbers of species constituting a genus. In
                    this zone genera composed of more than ten species are the exception, the
                    majority having only from one to five.</p>
                <p>The proportion of genera limited to this zone is very high, about 65 out of a

                    Agriopus, Clinus, Genypterus, Bdellostorna)</hi> leave no doubt that this
                    district belongs to the southern temperate zone, whilst the freshwater fishes of
                    South Africa are members of the tropical fauna. Only a few <hi rend="italic"
                    >{Rhinobatus, Narcine, Astrape,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Sphyroena)</hi> have
                    entered from the neighbouring tropical coasts. The development of Sparoids is
                    greater than in any of the other districts of this zone, and may be regarded as
                    one of its distinguishing features.</p>
                <p>2. The South Australian district comprises the southern coasts of Australia
                    (northwards to about the latitude of Sydney), Tasmania, and New Zealand. It is
                    the richest in the southern temperate zone, partly in consequence of a
                    considerable influx of tropical forms on the eastern coast of Australia, where
                    they penetrate farther southwards than would be expected from merely
                    geographical considerations, partly in consequence of the thorough manner in
                    which the ichthyology of New South Wales and New Zealand has been explored. Of
                    the 120 genera hitherto found in this district 42 are peculiar.</p>
                <p>The shore fishes of New Zealand are not so distinct from those of south-eastern
                    Australia as to deserve to be placed in a separate district. With the exception
                    of the genera which enter this zone from the tropics, and which are more
                    numerous on the Australian coast than on that of New Zealand,, and a few very
                    local genera in addition, the remainder are identical. Many of the South
                    Australian species, too, are found also on the coasts of New Zealand. The
                    principal points of difference are the extraordinary development of <hi
                    rend="italic">Monacanthus</hi> on the coast of South Australia, and the
                    apparently total absence in Australia of Gadoids, which in the New Zealand fauna
                    are represented by 6 genera.</p>
                <p>3. The Chilian district extends over 20 degrees of latitude only, and is nearly
                    straight. In its northern and warmer parts it is of a very uniform character; it
                    is there exnosed to high and irregular tides, and to remarkable and sudden
                    changes in the levels of land and water, which must seriously interfere with
                    fishes living and propagating near the shore. No river of considerable size
                    interrupts the monotony of the physical conditions, to offer an additional
                    element in favour of the development of littoral animals. In the southern parts,
                    where the coast is lined with archipelagoes, the climate is too severe for most
                    fishes. All these conditions combine to render this district comparatively poor
                    as regards variety of shop fishes; they belong to 45 genera, of which 6 only are
                    not found in <pb break="no"

                    of the neighbourhood of the mouth of the Rio de la Plata, in too fragmentary a

                    of subsistence for the large seals which there pass at least some portion of the

                    state of our knowledge justifies us in saying is, that the general character of
                    the fauna of Magellan’s Straits and Kerguelen’s Land is extremely similar to
                    that of Iceland and Greenland.</p>
                <p>As in the Arctic fauna, Chondropterygians are rare, and are represented by <hi
                    rend="italic">Acanthias vulgaris</hi> and species of <hi rend="italic">Raia.

                <p>As to Acanthopterygians, <hi rend="italic">Cataphracti</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >Scorpoenidae</hi> are represented as in the Arctic fauna, two of the genera <hi
                    rend="italic">(Sebastes</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Agonus)</hi> being identical.
                    The <hi rend="italic">Cottidoe</hi> are replaced by six genera of <hi
                    rend="italic">Trachinidoe,</hi> remarkably similar in form to Arctic types; but
                    <hi rend="italic">Discoboli</hi> and the characteristic Arctic Blennioids are
                    absent.</p>
                <p>Gadoid fishes reappear, but are less developed; as usual they are accompanied by
                    <hi rend="italic">Myxine.</hi> The reappearance of so specialized a genus as <hi
                    rend="italic">Lycodes</hi> is most remarkable. Flatfishes are few as in the
                    north, and belong to peculiar genera.</p>
                <p>Physostomes are probably not entirely absent, but hitherto none have been met
                    with so far south. Lophobranchs are rare, as in the Arctic zone; it is
                    noteworthy, however, that a peculiar genus, with persistent embryonic characters
                    <hi rend="italic">{Protocampus),</hi> is rather common on the shores -of the
                    Falldand Islands.</p>

                <p>Pelagic fishes,—that is, fishes inhabiting the surface of mid-ocean, —belong to
                    various orders, viz., Chondropterygians, Acanthopterygians, Physostomes,
                    Lophobranchs, and Plectognaths. Neither Anacanths nor Pharyngognaths contribute
                    to this series of the marine fauna. The following genera and families are
                    included in it :—</p>

                    Echinorhinus, Isistius; Myliobatidae.</p>

                    Psenes, Xiphiidae, Antennarius.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Physostomi.—</hi> Stemoptychidae, Scopelus, Astronesthes,
                    Scombresocidae (majority).</p>

                <p><hi rend="italic">Plectognathi.—</hi> Orthagoriscus, and some other
                    Gymnodonts.</p>
                <p>Pelagic fishes differ much from one another in their mode of life. The majority
                    are excellent swimmers, which not only can move with great rapidity, but are
                    also possessed of great powers of endurance, and are thus enabled to continue
                    their course for weeks, apparently without the necessity of rest; such are many
                    sharks, scombroids, dolphins, pilot-fish, sword-fishes. In some, as in <hi
                    rend="italic">Dactylopterus</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Exoccetus,</hi> the
                    ability to take flying leaps out of the water is superadded to the power of
                    swimming (flying-fishes). But in others the power of swimming is greatly
                    reduced, as in <hi rend="italic">Antennarius, Hippocampus,</hi> and Gymnodonts;
                    they frequent places in the ocean covered with floating seaweed, or drift on the
                    surface without resistance, at the mercy of wind and current. The <hi
                    rend="italic">Echeneis</hi> or sucking-fishes attach themselves to other large
                    fishes, ships, or floating objects, and allow themselves to be carried about,
                    unless change of climate or want of food obliges them to abandon their temporary
                    carrier. Finally, another class of pelagic fishes come to the surface of the
                    ocean during the night only; in the day time they descend to some depth, where
                    they are undisturbed by the rays of the sun or the agitation of the
                    surface-water; such are <hi rend="italic">Brama,</hi> the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Stemoptychidae,</hi><hi rend="italic">Scopelus, Astronesthes,—</hi> fishes the
                    majority of which are provided with those extraordinary visual organs that we
                    find so much developed in the true deep-sea fishes. Indeed, this last kind of
                    pelagic fishes constitutes a connecting link with the deep-sea forms.</p>
                <p>Pelagic fishes, like shore fishéS, are most numerous in the tropical zone; and,
                    with few exceptions <hi rend="italic">{Echinorhinus, Psenes,</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Sternoptychidoe,</hi><hi rend="italic">Astronesthes),</hi> the
                    same genera are represented in the tropical Atlantic as well as in the
                    Indo-Pacific. The number of identical species occurring in both these oceans is
                    great, and probably still greater than would appear from systematic lists, in
                    which there are retained many specific names that were given at a time when
                    species were believed to have a very limited range. The pelagic fauna of the
                    tropics gradually passes into that of the temperate zones, only a few genera,
                    like <hi rend="italic">Cybium,</hi><hi rend="italic">Psenes, Antennarius,</hi>
                    being almost entirely confined to the tropics. All the other tropical genera
                    range into the temperate zones, but their representatives become fewer with the
                    increasing distance from the equator. North of 40° N. lat. many genera have
                    disappeared, or are met with in isolated examples only, as <hi rend="italic"
                    >Carcharias,</hi><hi rend="italic">Zygaena,</hi><hi rend="italic"

                    >Astronesthes, Exoccetus, Tetrodοn, Diodon;</hi> and only one genus of sharks,
                    <hi rend="italic">Galeocerdo,</hi> approaches the Arctic Circle. Some few
                    species, like <hi rend="italic">Antennarius, Scopelus,</hi> are carried by
                    currents near to the farther confines of the temperate zones; but such
                    occurrences are accidental, and these fishes must be regarded as entirely
                    foreign to the fauna of those latitudes. On the other hand, some pelagic fishes
                    inhabit the temperate zones, whilst their occurrence within the tropics is very
                    problematical; thus, in the Atlantic, <hi rend="italic">Thalassorhiηus,
                    Selache,</hi><hi rend="italic">Laemargus,</hi><hi rend="italic">Centrolophus,

                    genera composed of one or two species only). Besides the shark mentioned, no
                    other pelagic fishes are known from the Arctic Ocean.</p>
                <p>We possess very little information about the pelagic fishfauna of the southern
                    oceans. This much only is certain, that the tropical forms gradually disappear;
                    but it would be hazardous, in the present state of our knowledge, to state even
                    approximately the limits of the southward range of a single genus. Scarcely more
                    is known about the appearance of types peculiar to the southern temperate
                    zone,—for instance, the gigantic shark <hi rend="italic">Rhinodon</hi>
                    representing the northern <hi rend="italic">Selache,</hi> near the coasts of
                    South Africa, and the Scombroid genus <hi rend="italic">Gastrochisma,</hi> in

                <p>The largest of marine fishes, <hi rend="italic">Rhinodon, Selaehe, Car-

                    found in mid-ocean, which are the offspring of shore fishes normally depositing
                    their spawn near the coast. The manner in which this fry passes into the open
                    sea is unknown; for it has not yet been ascertained whether it is carried by
                    currents from the place where it was deposited originally, or whether shore
                    fishes sometimes spawn at a -distance from the coast. We may remember that shore
                    fishes inhabit not only coasts but also submerged banks with some depth of water
                    above, and that, by the action of the water, spawn deposited on these latter
                    localities is very liable to be dispersed over wide areas of the ocean. Embryos
                    of at least some shore fishes hatched under abnormal conditions seem to have an
                    abnormal growth up &lt;to a certain period of their life, when they perish. The
                    <hi rend="italic">Leptocephali</hi> must be regarded as such abnormally
                    developed forms. Fishes of a similar condition are the so-called pelagic <hi
                    rend="italic">Plagusiae,</hi> young Pleuronectoids, the origin of which is still
                    unknown. As already mentioned, flat-fishes, like all the other Anacanths, are
                    not otherwise represented in the pelagic fauna.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Deep-Sea Fishes.</hi></p>
                <p>The knowledge of the existence of deep-sea fishes is one of the recent
                    discoveries of ichthyology. It was only about twenty years ago that, from the
                    evidence afforded by the anatomical structure of a few singular fishes obtained
                    in the North Atlantic, an opinion was expressed that these fishes inhabited
                    great depths of the ocean, and that their organization was specially adapted for
                    living under the physical abyssal conditions. These fishes agreed in the
                    character of their connective tissue, which was so extremely weak as to yield
                    to, and to break under, the slightest pressure, so that the greatest difficulty
                    was experienced in preserving their body in its continuity. Another singular
                    circumstance was that some of the examples were picked up floating on the
                    surface of the water, having met their death whilst engaged in swallowing or
                    digesting other fishes not much smaller in size if not actually larger than
                    themselves.</p>
                <p>The first peculiarity was accounted for by the fact that, if those fishes really
                    inhabited the great depths supposed, their removal from the enormous pressure
                    under which they lived would be accompanied by such an expansion of gases within
                    their tissues as to rupture them, and to cause a separation of the parts which
                    had been held together by the pressure. The second circumstance was explained
                    thus. A raptorial fish organized to live at a depth of between 1500 and 800
                    fathoms seizes another usually inhabiting a depth of between 300 and 500
                    fathoms. In its struggles to escape, the fish seized, being nearly as large or
                    strong as the attacking fish, carries the latter out of its depth into a higher
                    stratum, where the diminished pressure causes such an expansion of gases as to
                    make the destroyer with its victim rise with increasing rapidity towards the
                    surface, which they reach dead or in a dying condition. Specimens in this state
                    are not rarely picked up; and as, of course, it is but comparatively few that
                    can by accident fall into the hands of naturalists, occurrences of this kind
                    must happen very often.</p>
                <p>The existence of fishes peculiarly adapted for the deep sea has thus been a fact
                    maintained and admitted for some time in ichthyology; and as the same genera and
                    species were found at very distant parts of the ocean, it was further •stated
                    that those deep-sea fishes were not limited in their range, and that,
                    consequently, the physical conditions of the depths of the ocean must be the
                    same or nearly the same ever the whole globe. That deep-sea fishes were not of a
                    peculiar order, but chiefly modified forms of surface types, was another
                    conclusion arrived at from the sporadic evidence collected during the period
                    which preceded systematic deep-sea dredging.</p>
                <p>Nothing, however, was positively known as to the exact depths inhabited by those
                    fishes until observations were made during the voyage of H.M.S. “Challenger.”
                    The results obtained by this expedition afforded a surer and more extended basis
                    for our knowledge of deep-sea fishes.</p>
                <p>The physical conditions of the deep sea, which must affect the organization and
                    distribution of fishes, are the folkw-ing</p>
                <p>1. Absence of sunlight. Probably the rays of the sun do not penetrate to, and
                    certainly do not extend beyond, a depth of 200 fathoms, therefore we may
                    consider this to be the depth where the deep-sea fauna commences. Absence of
                    light is, of necessity, accompanied by modifications of the organs of vision and
                    by simplification of colours.</p>
                <p>2. The absence of sunlight is in some measure compensated by the presence of
                    phosphorescent light, produced by many marine animals, and also by numerous
                    deep-sea fishes.</p>
                <p>3. Depression and equality of the temperature. At a depth of 500 fathoms the
                    temperature of the water is already as low as 40° Fahr., and perfectly
                    independent of the temperature of the surface-water; and from the greatest depth
                    to about 1000 fathoms beneath the surface the temperature is uniformly but a few
                    degrees above the freezing point. Temperature, therefore, ceases to offer an
                    obstacle to the unlimited dispersal of the deep-sea fishes.</p>
                <p>4. The increase of pressure by the water. The pressure of the atmosphere on the
                    body of an animal at the level of the sea is 15 δ) per square inch of surface;
                    but under water the pressure amounts to a ton weight for every 1000 fathoms of
                    depth.</p>
                <p>5. With the sunlight, vegetable life ceases in the depths of the sea. All
                    deep-sea fishes are therefore carnivorous,— the most voracious feeding
                    frequently on their own offspring, and the toothless kinds being nourished by
                    the animalcules which live on the bottom, or which, “like a constant rain,”
                    settle down from the upper strata towards the bottom of the sea.</p>
                <p>6. The perfect quiet of the water at great depths. The agitation of the water
                    caused by the disturbances of the air does not extend beyond the depth of a few
                    fathoms; below this surface-stratum there is no movement except the quiet flow
                    of ocean-currents, and near the bottom of the deep sea the water is probably in
                    a state of almost entire quiescence.</p>
                <p>The effect upon fishes of the physical conditions described is clearly testified
                    by the modification of one or more parts of their organization, so that every
                    deep-sea fish may be recognized as such without the accompanying positive
                    evidence that it has been caught at a great depth; and, <hi rend="italic">vice
                    versa,</hi> fishes reputed to have been obtained at a great depth, and not
                    having any of the characteristics of the dwellers of the deep sea, must be
                    regarded as surface fishes.</p>
                <p>The most striking characteristic found in many deep-sea fishes is in relation to
                    the tremendous pressure under which they live. Their osseous and muscular
                    systems are, as compared with the same parts of surface fishes, very feebly
                    developed. The bones have a fibrous, fissured, and cavernous texture; they are
                    light, with scarcely any calcareous matter, so that the point of a needle will
                    readily penetrate them without breaking. The bones, especially the vertebrae,
                    appear to be very loosely connected with one another; and it requires the most
                    careful handling to avoid the breaking of the connective ligaments. The muscles,
                    especially the great lateral muscles of the trunk and tail, are thin, the
                    fascicles being readily separated from one another or torn, and the connective

                    observed in the <hi rend="italic">Trachypteridae,</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Plagyodus, Chiasmodus, Melanocetus, Saccopharynx.</hi> But we cannot assume
                    that it actually obtains whilst those fishes exist under their natural
                    conditions. Some of them are most rapacious creatures, which must be able to
                    execute rapid and powerful movements to catch and overpower their prey; and for
                    that object their muscular system, thin as its layers may be, must be as firm,
                    and the chain of the segments of their vertebral column as firmly linked
                    together as in surface fishes. It is evident, therefore, that the change which
                    the body of those fishes has undergone on their withdrawal from the pressure
                    under which they live is a much aggravated form of the affection that is
                    experienced by persons reaching great altitudes in their ascent of a mountain or
                    in a balloon. In every living organism with an intestinal tract there are
                    accumulations of free gases; and, moreover, the blood and other fluids, which
                    penetrate every part of the body, contain gases in solution. Under greatly
                    diminished pressure these gases expand, so that, if the withdrawal from a depth
                    is not an extremely slow and gradual process, the various tissues must be
                    distended, loosened, ruptured; and what is a vigorous fish at a depth of 500
                    fathoms or more appears at the surface as a loosely-jointed body which, if the
                    skin is not of sufficient toughness, can only be kept together with difficulty.
                    At great depths a fibrous osseous structure and a thin layer of muscles suffice
                    to obtain the same results for which, at the surface, thickness of muscle and
                    firm osseous or cartilaginous tissue are necessary.</p>
                <p>The muciferous system of many deep-sea fishes is developed in an extraordinary
                    degree. We find in fishes which are comparatively little removed from the
                    surface (that is, to depths of from 100 to 200 fathoms) the lateral line much
                    wider than in their congeners or nearest allies which live on the surface, as in
                    <hi rend="italic">Trαchichthys, Hoplostethus,</hi> many <hi rend="italic"
                    >Scorpaenidoe.</hi> Butin fishes inhabiting depths of 1000 fathoms and more the
                    whole muciferous system is dilated; it is especially the surface of the skull
                    which is occupied by large cavities <hi rend="italic">{Macriimdae,</hi> deep-sea
                    <hi rend="italic">Ophidiidae),</hi> and the whole body seems to be covered with
                    a layer of mucus. These cavities collapse and shrink in specimens which have
                    been preserved in spirit for some time, but a brief reimmersion in water
                    generally suffices to show the immense quantity of mucus secreted by them. The
                    physiological use of this secretion is unknown; it has been observed to have
                    phosphorescent properties in perfectly fresh specimens.</p>
                <p>The colours of deep-sea fishes are extremely simple, their bodies being either
                    black or silvery; in a few only are some filaments or the fin-rays of a bright
                    scarlet colour. Among the black forms albinoes are not rare.</p>
                <p>The organ of sight is the first to be affected by a sojourn in deep water. Even
                    in fishes which habitually live at a depth of only 80 fathoms, we find the eye
                    of a proportionally larger size than in their representatives at the surface. In
                    such fishes the eyes increase in size with the depth inhabited by them, down to
                    the depth of 200 fathoms, the large organs being necessary to collect as many
                    rays of light as possible. Beyond that depth small-eyed as well as large-eyed
                    fishes occur, the former having their want of vision compensated by tentacular
                    organs of touch, whilst the latter have no such accessory organs, and evidently
                    see only by the aid of phosphorescence. In the greatest depths blind fishes
                    occur, with rudimentary eyes and without special organs of touch.</p>
                <p>Many fishes of the deep sea are provided with more or less numerous, round,
                    shining, mother-of-pearl-coloured bodies, imbedded in the skin. These so-called
                    phosphorescent or luminous organs are either larger bodies of an oval or
                    irregularly elliptical shape placed on the head, in the vicinity of the eye, or
                    smaller round globular bodies arranged symmetrically in series along the side of
                    the body and tail, especially near the abdominal profile, less frequently along
                    the back. The former kind of organs possess in the interior a lenticular body,
                    like the lens of an eye, and are considered by some naturalists true organs of
                    vision (accessory eyes), the function of the latter, which have a glandular
                    structure, being left unexplained by them.</p>
                <p>There is no doubt that the functions of these organs have some relation to the
                    peculiar conditions of light under which the fishes provided with them live,
                    these fishes being either deep-sea forms or nocturnal pelagic kinds. And it is
                    highly probable that all produce and emit phosphorescent light, enabling the
                    fishes to see in the darkness of the night or of the depths of the sea.</p>
                <p>Whenever we find in a fish long delicate filaments developed in connexion with
                    the fins or the extremity of the tail, we may conclude that it is an inhabitant
                    of still water and uf quiet habits. Many deep-sea fishes <hi rend="italic"
                    >{Trachypteridae, Macruridoe, Ophidiidae,</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Bathyptevois)</hi> are provided with such filamentous prolongations, the
                    development of which is perfectly in accordance with their sojourn in the
                    absolutely quiet waters of abyssal depths.</p>
                <p>Some of the raptatorial deep-sea fishes have à stomach so distensible and
                    capacious that it can receive a fish of twice or thrice the bulk of the
                    destroyer (<hi rend="italic">Melanocetus, Chiasmodus, Saccopharyηx).</hi>
                    Deglutition is performed in them, not by means of the muscles of the pharynx, as
                    in other fishes, but by the independent and alternate action of the jaws, as in
                    snakes. These fishes cannot be said to swallow their food; they rather draw
                    themselves over their victim, after the fashion of an <hi rend="italic"
                    >Actinia.</hi></p>
                <p>Before the voyage of H.M.S. “Challenger,” scarcely thirty deep-sea fishes were
                    known. This number is now much increased, six times as many new species and
                    genera having been discovered. Modifications of certain organs, perfectly novel,
                    and of the greatest inteιest, were found; but, singularly, no new types of
                    families were discovered, —nothing but what might have been expected from our
                    previous knowledge of this group of fishes.</p>
                <p>The fish fauna of the deep sea is chiefly composed of forms or modifications of
                    forms which we find represented at the surface in the cold and temperate zones,
                    or which belong to the class of nocturnal pelagic fishes. The Chondropterygians
                    are few in number, not descending to a greater depth than 600 fathoms. The
                    Acanthopterygians, which form the majority of the coast and surface faunas, are
                    also scantily represented; genera identical with surface types are confined to
                    the same inconsiderable depth as the Chondropterygians, whilst those
                    Acanthopterygians which are so much specialized for a life in the deep sea as to
                    deserve generic separation range from 200 to 2400 fathoms. Three distinct
                    families of Acanthopterygians belong to the deep-sea fauna, viz., <hi

                    >Nota-</hi><hi rend="italic">canthidoe</hi>; they consist of three, one, and two

                    are very numerous, ranging through all depths; they constitute about onefourth
                    of the whole deep-sea fauna.</p>
                <p>Of <hi rend="italic">Physostomi,</hi> the families of <hi rend="italic"

                    represented. Of these the Scopeloids are the most numerous, constituting nearly
                    another fourth of the fauna. <hi rend="italic">Salmonidoe</hi> are only
                    represented by three small genera. <hi rend="italic">Bathythmsmdoe</hi> include
                    one species only, which is probably confined in its vertical as well as its
                    horizontal range; it occurs at a depth of about 350 fathoms in the sea of Japan.

                    seem to descend to the greatest depths. <hi rend="italic">Myxine</hi> has been
                    ob tained from a depth of 345 fathoms.</p>
                <p>The greatest depth hitherto reached by a dredge in which fishes were enclosed is
                    2900 fathoms. But the specimens thus obtained belong to a species <hi

                    extremely abundant in upper strata of the Atlantic and Pacific, and were
                    therefore most likely caught by the dredge in its ascent. The next greatest
                    depth, viz., 2750 fathoms, must be accepted as one at which fishes do
                    undoubtedly live,—the fish obtained from this depth of the Atlantic, <hi

                <p>CLASSIFICATION.</p>
                <p>The class of fishes is divided into four subclasses :—</p>
                <p>I. <hi rend="italic">Paloeichthyes.</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi> Heart with a
                    contractile conus arteriosus; intestine with a spiral valve; optic nerves
                    nondecussating, or only partially decussating.</p>

                    bulbus arteriosus; intestine without spiral valve; optic nerves decussating.

                    arteriosus; intestine simple. Skeleton cartilaginous and notochordal. One nasal

                <p><hi> IV.</hi><hi rend="italic">Leptocardii.—</hi> Heart replaced by pulsating
                    sinuses; intestine simple. Skeleton membrano-cartilaginous and notochordal.

                <p><hi rend="italic">Subclass I.—</hi><hi rend="italic">Paloeichthyes.</hi></p>
                <p>This subclass comprises the sharks and rays and the Ganoid fishes. Though it is
                    based upon a singular concurrence of most important characters, its members
                    exhibit as great a diversity of form, and as manifold modifications in the
                    remainder of their organization, as the <hi rend="italic">Teleostei.</hi> The
                    <hi rend="italic">Paloeichthyes</hi> stand to the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Teleostei</hi> in the same relation as the Marsupials to the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Placentalia.</hi> Geologically, as a subclass, they were the predecessors of
                    Teleosteous fishes; and it is a remarkable fact that all those modifications
                    which show an approach of the ichthyic type to the Batrachians are found in this
                    subclass. It is divided into two orders, —the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Chondropterygii</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">Gaηoidei.</hi><hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Order</hi> I.— <hi rend="italic">Chondropterygii.</hi></p>
                <p>Skeleton cartilaginous. Body with medial and paired fins, the hinder pair
                    abdominal. Vertebral column generally heterocercal, the upper lobe of the caudal
                    fin produced. Gills attached to the skin by the outer margin, with several
                    intervening gill-openings; re rely one external gill-opening only. No
                    gill-cover. No air- 1 ladder. Two, three, or more series of valves in the conus
                    arteriosus. Ova large and few in number, impregnated and, in some species,
                    developed within a uterine cavity. Embryo with deciduous external gills. Males
                    with intromittent organs attached to the ventral fins.</p>
                <p>This order, for which, also, the name <hi rend="italic">Elαsmobrαnchii</hi> has
                    been proposed (by Bonaparte), comprises the sharks, rays, and chimaeras. It is
                    divided into two suborders,— <hi rend="italic">Ρlagiostomata</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">Holocephala.</hi><hi rend="smallcaps">Suborder</hi> I. <hi
                    rend="italic">Plagiostomata.—</hi> From five to seven gill-openings. Skull with
                    a suspensorium and the palatal apparatus detached. Teeth numerous. .</p>
                <p>The Plagiostomes differ greatly from each other with regard to the general form
                    of the body. In the sharks, or <hi rend="italic">Selachoidei,</hi> the body is
                    elongate, more or less cylindrical, gradually passing into the tail; the
                    gill-openings arc lateral. In the rays, or <hi rend="italic">Batoidei,</hi> the
                    gill-openings are always placed on the abdominal aspect of the fish; the body is
                    depressed, and the trunk, whi ’ is surrounded by the immensely developed
                    pectoral fins, forms abroad flat disk, of which the tail appears as a thin and
                    slender appendage. Spiracles are always present; the number of gill-openings is
                    constantly five; there is no anal fin; the dorsal fins, if present, are situated
                    on the tail. Some of the rays, however, approach the sharks in having th J
                    'audal portion less abruptly contracted behind the trunk.</p>
                <p>Fossil Plagiostomes are very numerous in all formations. Some of the earliest
                    determinable fish remains are, or are believed to be, derived from Plagiostomes.
                    Those which can be referred to any of the families specified below will be
                    mentioned in due course; but there are others, especially fin-spines, which
                    leave us in doubt to which group of Plagiostomes their owners had affinity: as

                    order of fishes, the Ganoida In external appearance, and as regards the
                    structure of their organs of propagation, the chimaeras are sharks. The females
                    are provided with “claspers” in connexion with the ventral fins, and the ova are
                    large, encased in a horny capsule, and few in number; there is no doubt that
                    they are impregnated within the oviduct, as in sharks. The males are provided
                    with a singular erectile appendage, spiny at its extremity, and received in a
                    groove on the top of the head. On the other hand, the relations of the chimaeras
                    to the Ganoid, and, more especially, to the Dipnoous type become manifest in
                    their notochordal skeleton and continuity of cranial cartilage. The spine in
                    front of the first dorsal fin is articulated to the neural apophysis, and not
                    merely implanted in the soft parts; it is immovable as in sharks. A
                    cartilaginous operculum makes its appearance, and the external gill-opening is
                    single. The dentition is that of a Dipnoid, each “jaw” being armed with a pair
                    of broad dental plates, with the addition of a pair of smaller cutting teeth in
                    the upper “jaw.” Fossils of similar dental combination are not rare in strata
                    commencing with the Lias and the bottom of the Oolitic series; but it is
                    impossible to decide in every case whether the fossil should be referred to the
                    Holoceρhalous or the Dipnoous type. According to Newberry, Chimaeroid fishes

                    hitherto have come from the Burnett, Dawson, and Mary rivers, some from the
                    fresh waters of the upper parts, others from the lower brackish portions. The
                    fish is said to grow to a weight of 20 tb and to a length of 6 feet. Locally,
                    the settlers call it “Flat-head,” “Burnett-Salmon,” or “Dawson-Salmon,” and the
                    aborigines “Barramunda,” a name which they appear to apply also to other
                    large-scaled freshwater fishes, as the <hi rend="italic">Osteoglossurn
                    leichardU.</hi> In the stomach there is generally found an enormous quantity of
                    the leaves of plants growing on the banks of rivers, evidently eaten after they
                    had fallen into the water and when in a decomposing condition. The flesh of the
                    fish is salmon-coloured, and is much esteemed as food. The barramunda is said to
                    be in the habit of going on land, or at least on mud-flats; and this assertion
                    appears to be borne out by the fact <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit12newyrich/page/n704/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0912-0704-0687"/> that it is provided, with a lung. If is much more
                    probable, however, that it rises now and then to the surface of the water in
                    order to fill its lung with air, and descends again until the air is so much
                    deoxygenized as to render a renewal of it necessary. As the barramunda has
                    perfectly developed gills, as well as the lung, we can hardly doubt that, when
                    it is in water of normal composition, and 'pure enough to yield the necessary
                    supply of oxygen, these organs are sufficient for the purpose of breathing, and
                    that the respiratory function rests with them alone. But when the fish is
                    compelled to sojourn in thick muddy water charged with gases which are the
                    products of decomposing organic matter (and this must very frequently be the
                    case during the droughts which annually exhaust the creeks of tropical
                    Australia), it commences to breathe air with its lung in the way indicated
                    above. If the medium in which it happens to be is altogether unfit for
                    breathing, the gills cease to have any function; if it is irrespirable in a less
                    degree the gills may still continue to assist the lung. The barramunda, in fact,
                    can breathe by either gills or lung alone, or by both simultaneously.</p>

                    crustaceans, and aquatic insects have been found in its stomach. Wilder has
                    observed its respiratory actions; it rises to the surface, and, without emitting
                    any air-bubble whatever, opens the jaws widely, and apparently gulps in a large
                    quantity of air; these acts of respiration are more frequently performed when

                <p>Skeleton cartilaginous and notochordal, without ribs and without real jaws. Skull
                    not separate from the vertebral column. No limbs. Gills in the form of fixed
                    sacs, without branchial arches, six or seven in number on each side. One nasal
                    aperture only. Heart without bulbus arteriosus. Mouth anterior, surrounded by a
                    circular or subcircular lip, suctorial. Alimentary canal straight, simple,
                    without caecal appendages, pancreas, or spleen. Generative outlet peritoneal.
                    Vertical fins rayed.</p>
                <p>The Cyclostomes are most probably a very ancient type.. Unfortunately the organs

                    naked. Subject to a metamorphosis; in the perfect stage with a suctorial mouth
                    armed with teeth, simple or multicuspid, horny, sitting on a soft papilla.
                    Maxillary, mandibulary, lingual, and suctorial teeth may be distinguished. Eyes
                    present (in mature animals). External nasal aperture in the middle of the upper
                    side of the head. The nasal duct terminates without perforating the palate.
                    Seven branchial sacs and apertures on each side behind the head; the inner
                    branchial ducts terminate in a separate common tube. Intestine with a spiral
                    valve. Eggs small. The larvae without teeth, and with a single continuous

                    the tongue. Branchial apertures at a great distance from the head; the inner
                    branchial ducts lead into the oesophagus. A series of mucous sacs along each
                    side of the abdomen. Intestine without spiral valve. Eggs large, with a horny
