                <p><label type="entry">INDEX</label> is a word that may be understood either
                    specially as a table of references to a book or, more generally, as an indicator
                    of the position of required information on any given subject. According to
                    classical usage, the Latin word <hi rend="italic">index</hi> denoted a
                    discoverer, discloser, or informer; a catalogue or list; an inscription; the
                    title of a book; and the fore or index-finger. Cicero also used the word to
                    express the table of contents to a book, and explained his meaning by the Greek
                    form <hi rend="italic">syllabus.</hi> Shakespeare uses the word with the general
                    meaning of a table of contents or preface—thus Nestor says <hi rend="italic"
                    >{Troilus</hi><hi rend="italic">and Cressida,</hi> i. 3)—</p>
                <p>“And in such indexes, although small pricks To their subsequent volumes, there is
                    seen The baby figure of the giant mass.”</p>
                <p>Table was the usual English word, and index was not thoroughly naturalized until
                    the beginning of the 17th century, and even then it was usual to explain it as
                    “index or table.” By the present English usage, according to which the word
                    table is reserved for the summary of the contents as they occur in a book, and
                    the word index for the arranged analysis of the contents, we obtain an advantage
                    not enjoyed in other languages , for the French <hi rend="italic">table</hi> is
                    used for both kinds, as is <hi rend="italic">indice</hi> in Italian and Spanish.
                    There is a group of words each of which has its distinct meaning but finds its
                    respective place under the general heading of index work; these are
                    calendar,catalogue, digest, inventory, register, summary, syllabus, and
                    table.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Another old word
                    occasionally used in the sense of an index is “pye.” The late Sir T. Duffus
                    Hardy, in some observations on the derivation of the word “Pye-Book” (which most
                    probably comes from the Latin pica), remarks that the earliest use he had noted
                    of pye in this sense is dated 1547—“a Pye of all the names of such Balives as
                    been to accompte pro anno regni regis Edwardi Sexti primo.”</p></note> The value
                    of indexes was recognized in the earliest times, and many old books have full
                    and admirably constructed ones. A good index has sometimes kept a dull book
                    alive by reason of the <hi rend="superscript"> r</hi> ^alue or amusing character
                    of its contents. Mr Carlyle refers to Prynne’s <hi rend="italic"
                    >Histrio-</hi><hi rend="italic">Mastix</hi> as “a book still extant, but never
                    more to be read by mortal;” but the index must have given amusement to many from
                    the curious character of its entries, and Attorney· General Noy particularly
                    alluded to it in his speech at Prynne’s trial. Indexes have sometimes been used
                    as vehicles of satire, and the witty Dr William King was the first to use them
                    as a weapon of attack. His earliest essay in this field was the index added to
                    the second edition of the Hon. Charles Boyle’s attack upon Bentley’s <hi
                    rend="italic">Dissertation on the Epistles of</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Phalaris.</hi> 1698.</p>
                <p>To serve its purpose well, an index must be compiled with care, the references
                    being placed under the heading that the reader is most likely to seek. An index
                    should be one and indivisible, and not broken up into several alphabets; thus
                    every work, whether in one or more volumes, ought to have its complete index.
                    This important rule has been often neglected in English books, and is almost
                    universally rejected in foreign ones, to the great inconvenience of readers. The
                    mode of arrangement calls for special attention; this may be either
                    chronological, alphabetical, or according to classes, but great confusion will
                    be caused by uniting the three systems. The alphabetical arrangement is so
                    simple, convenient, and easily understood that it has naturally superseded the
                    other forms, save in some exceptional cases. Much of the value of an index
                    depends upon the mode in which it is printed, and every endeavour should be made
                    to set it out with clearness. In old indexes the indexed word was not brought to
                    the front, but was left in its place in the sentence, so that the alphabetical
                    order was not made perceptible to the eye. There are few points in which the
                    printer is more likely to go wrong than in the use of marks of repetition, and
                    many otherwise good indexes are full of the most perplexing cases of
                    misapplication in this respect. The oft-quoted instance— Mill on Liberty on the
                    Floss actually occurred in a catalogue. There appears now to be a revived
                    interest in indexes, and as books daily increase the need of some satisfactory
                    digest of information becomes more keenly felt. In 1877 the Index Society was
                    formed with the object of making and printing indexes of books unprovided with
                    them, of compiling and printing indexes of particular subjects, and of gradually
                    preparing a universal index for reference. In order to obtain uniformity in the
                    compilation of indexes a series of rules for indexing have been drawn up by the
                    society. Several publications have already been issued to the subscribers.</p>
                <p>The following is a list of some of the most important indexes, both of words and
                    of subjects. The chief indexes of words are dictionaries, but these are a
                    special class by themselves. Next come concordances: the first one to the Bible
                    was compiled by Hugo of St Cher in 1247, the first English concordance to the
                    New Testament was published in 1536, and to the whole Bible in 1550, compiled by
                    John Marbeck. Other Biblical concordances are those of R. F. Hervey, 1579; C.
                    Cotton, 1622 (frequently reprinted); J. Downame, 1632; R. Wickens, 1655; S.
                    Newman, 1650, 3d ed. 1682; A. Cruden, 1737 (this superseded all works of the
                    same character); and R. Young, 1880. The following concordances may also be
                    mentioned: —to the Psalter, 1834; to the Prayer Book, 1851; to the <hi
                    rend="italic">Iliad,</hi> by G. L. Prendergast, 1875 , to Shakespeare, by S.
                    Ayscough (1790), by F. Twiss (1805), by Mrs Cowden Clarke (1845), by <hi
                    rend="italic">J. O.</hi> Halliwell <hi rend="italic">{Handbook Index,</hi>
                    1866), and by A. Schmidt (1874) <hi rend="subscript"> l</hi> and to
                    Shakespeare’s <hi rend="italic">Poems,</hi> by Mrs H. H. Furness, 1874; to
                    Milton’s <hi rend="italic">Paradise Lost</hi> (1741), and to his <hi
                    rend="italic">Poetical Works,</hi> by H. J. Todd (1809), byG. L. Prendergast
                    (1857), and byC. D. Cleveland (1867); to Pope’s <hi rend="italic">Works,</hi> by
                    E. Abbott, 1875; to Tennyson’s <hi rend="italic">Works,</hi> by D. B.
                    Brightwell, 1869, and another published by Strahan, 1870; to <hi rend="italic"
                    >In</hi><hi rend="italic">Memoriam</hi> (1862); to Keble’s <hi rend="italic"
                    >Christian Year,</hi> 1871; and to Watts’s <hi rend="italic">Psalms,</hi> by D.
                    Guy, 1774. A large number of historical works have been supplied with indexes in
                    separate volumes. Among the more important indexes of prose writers are those of
                    the works of Samuel Richardson (1755), Joanna Southcott(n. d., and 1815), John
                    Strype (1828), and T. Carlyle (1874); <hi rend="italic">The Wellington
                    Despatches</hi> (1839); Wesley’s <hi rend="italic">Journals</hi> (1872). A large
                    number of series of publications oι societies and of periodicals have been
                    supplied with general indexes.</p>
                <p>The Indexes to the Statutes and to the Journals of the Houses of Parliament are
                    perhaps the most elaborate works of the kind ever published. In 1778 a sum of
                    £12,900 was voted for indexes to the Journals of the House of Commons. Few
                    parliamentary papers are issued without a satisfactory index being added. Most
                    of the indexes mentioned above refer to particular books, but in 1848 Mr W. F.
                    Poole published in New York an index to subjects treated in reviews and other
                    periodicals; a second edition was published in 1853 as <hi rend="italic">An
                    Index to Periodical Literature.</hi> A greatly enlarged edition is now in
                    preparation with the co-operation of English and American librarians. A larger
                    work of a similar character for scientific literature, but arranged under
                    authors’ names <pb break="no"
