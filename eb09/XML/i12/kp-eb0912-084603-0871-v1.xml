                    by post-classical writers it is often employed in a more special sense to denote

                    sense it was taken up by ecclesiastical writers; thus Ambrose says “nemo recte
                    egerit poenitentiam nisi a Deo per Christum speraverit indulgentiam and

                    the church.” The natural and actual synonyms of the word are “gratia,” “venia,”
                    “relaxatio,” and “remissio.”</p>
                <p>The penitential discipline of the ancient church was very severe in its treatment
                    of a large class of scandalous offences; and in the canonical punishments or
                    penances (which from a very early date began to be determined with considerable
                    precision) time , was always a prominent element. But a certain power of showing

                    lengthening the prescribed duration of the period during which ecclesiastical
                    penance was to be done, was always left to the discretion of the bishop. An
                    early and explicit proof of this is found in the fifth canon of the council of
                    Ancyra (314).<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>See
                            Bingham, <hi rend="italic">Anti.,</hi> xviii. 4; and Hefele, <hi

                    discretionary leniency was sometimes, as appears from the writings of Cyprian,
                    granted by the bisho » on the intercession of those who were witnessing for the
                    truth in prison; sometimes also at the instance of the civil magistrate. The
                    episcopal power was occasionally exercised, not only in a shortening of the
                    canonical duration of the penance, but in some mitigation of the nature of the
                    penalty itself (Syn. Ancyr., can. 2). We find indications at a very early period
                    that some of the minor ecclesiastical offences could be readily and canonically
                    atoned for by almsgiving (Aug., <hi rend="italic">De Fid.</hi><hi rend="italic"
                        >et.</hi><hi rend="italic">Op.,</hi> c. 19); thus gradually arose, by steps
                    which can readily be conjectured, a regular system of commutations (redemtiones,
                    commutationes), set forth in “libri penitentiales,” offering striking analogies
                    to the provisions made by the various criminal codes by which the Theodosian was
                    supplanted throughout Europe. In the <hi rend="italic">Penitential</hi> of the
                    Greek Theodore of Canterbury, for example (690), which is to be found in Migne’s
                        <hi rend="italic">Patrologia,</hi> a canonical fast of days, weeks, or years
                    may be redeemed by saying a proportionable number of psalms, or by paying an
                    adequate fine. For more than four centuries this work held a position of great
                    authority all over Europe. At the time of the crusades, to go to Palestine and
                    take part in the struggle against the infidel was held to be a work of such
                    extraordinary merit as to render unnecessary any other penitential act on the
                    part of the sinner who engaged in it. Thus at the council of Clermont, held
                    under Urban II. (1095), it was decreed “iter illud pro omni poenitentia
                    reputetur.” The great schoolmen were the first to reduce to a theory the praxis
                    which had gradually thus sprung up within the Western Church. That theory may be
                    said to resolve itself into the two positions—(1) that, after the remission of
                    the eternal punishment due for sin, there remains due to the justice of God a
                    certain amount of temporal pain to be undergone, either before death in this
                    world, or after death in purgatory; (2) that this pain may be remitted by the
                    application of the superabundant merits of Christ and of the saints out of the
                    treasury of the church, the administration of which treasury is the prerogative
                    of the hierarchy. A characteristically elaborate statement and defence of these
                    theses will be found in the supplement to the <hi rend="italic">Summa</hi> of
                    Thomas Aquinas (p. 3, qu. 25) and in the <hi rend="italic">Summa</hi> of
                    Alexander Halesius (p. 4, qu. 23, art. 2, membr. 5). In their Tridentine form
                    they occur in sess.</p>
                <p>6, can. 30, and sess. 14, can. 12-14. · With these passages must be compared the
                    condemnation of the synod of Pistoia by Pius VI. in 1794.</p>
                <p>Indulgences are either general or particular, <hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> either
                    open to the whole church or confined to particular localities. The most general
                    of all is that which is proclaimed in the year of jubilee. Indulgences again are
                    either plenary or non-plenary, the former being a total remission of all the
                    temporal punishment which may have been incurred by the recipient. It must
                    carefully be borne in mind that, in Roman Catholic orthodoxy, indulgence is
                    never absolutely gratuitous, and that those only can in any circumstances
                    validly receive it who are in full communion with the church, and have resorted
                    to the sacrament of penance, in which alone, after due contrition and
                    confession, provision is made for the remission of the graver penalty of sin.
                    The doctrine of indulgences, however, is singularly open to misunderstanding;
                    and in its practical applications it has too often been used to sanction the
                    most flagrant immorality, The scandalous abuses connected with the “pardoner’s”
                    trade, and in particular the reckless conduct of the hawkers of the papal
                    indulgence granted to those who should contribute funds for the completion of St
                    Peter’s, Rome, were, as is well known, very prominent among the proximate causes
                    of the Protestant Reformation. In the 14th article of the Church of England the
                    doctrine of the “thesaurus meritorum” or “thesaurus supererogationis
                    perfectorum” is by implication rejected; and in art. 22 “the Romish doctrine
                    concerning purgatory and pardons” is expressly condemned. It is hardly necessary
                    to add that “the power of the keys” is inseparable from the idea of a church,
                    and that in this power is plainly involved a certain discretion as to the time
                    and manner in which discipline shall be administered. This discretion is claimed
                    by every organized body of Christians.</p>
