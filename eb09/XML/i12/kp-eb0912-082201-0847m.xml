                <p><label type="entry">INDIANS, <hi rend="smallcaps">American</hi></label>. The
                    application of the name Indians to the native peoplesand tribes of the New World
                    is an erroneous usage, originating in the belief of the Spanish discoverers of
                    America that they had reached the eastern shores of Asiatic countries already
                    partially known. As it happens, the name is now, even apart from the addition of
                    American, customarily applied to the aborigines of the western hemisphere, while
                    it is used with far less frequency as a collective name for the inhabitants of
                    the great country of the East known from the remotest times as India.</p>
                <p>Various questions in regard to the American Indians have been discussed in the
                    article <hi rend="smallcaps">America.</hi> It is here intended to treat more
                    particularly their ethnographical position, and to give what may be called a
                    working classification of the races. This is followed by a separate notice of
                    the present distribution and condition of the North American Indians.</p>
                <p>It may be asserted with some confidence that there is nothing in the physical and
                    mental condition of the aboriginal Americans which requires us to postulate for
                    them a foreign origin. If man was evolved originally from several centres,
                    America assuredly included one at least; if he sprang from a single pair, then
                    we can even conceive that pair to have been first established in the New World,
                    and the arguments brought forward in support of an Asiatic origin of the
                    American would not lose their point if adduced in favour of an American origin
                    of the Asiatic peoples.</p>
                <p>Andreas Retzius, the founder of scientific craniology, arguing on insufficient
                    materials, grouped all the American aborigines in two great divisions—(1) a
                    western or highland, occupying the main ranges of the Rocky Mountains and Andes,
                    with the intervening lands thence to the Pacific: and (2) an eastern, mainly
                    lowland, whose domain stretched from the western uplands to the Atlantic
                    seaboard. The former, being characterized by brachycephalous or round heads, he
                    felt disposed to connect with the brachycephalous Mongolians and Malays of Asia
                    and Australasia. The latter, being of a decided dolichocephalous or long-headed
                    type, he traced to possible Berber and Guanche migrations from north-west Africa
                    and the Canary Islands, doubtless because the historical arrival of the
                    dolichocephalous Norsemen in the New World was of too recent date to serve his
                    purpose. But Virchow (“Anthropologie Amerika’s,” in <hi rend="italic"
                    >Verhandlungen der Gesell,</hi><hi rend="italic">fur Anthropologie,</hi> 1877,
                    p. 144-56) has amply shown that this classification is untenable, and it will be
                    seen further on that there are long and round-headed types often intermingled in
                    every part of the continent. Virchow himself, while denying the claim of the
                    American race to be considered autochthonous, declines to commit himself as to
                    the probable regions whence they may have reached their present habitat. The
                    theory of an Asiatic immigration <hi rend="italic">via</hi> Behring Strait has
                    been somewhat revived since ethnologists have, so to say, rediscovered the lost
                    Tchuktchis of the north-east coast of Siberia through Nordenskjold’s Swedish
                    polar expedition of 1878-9. These Tchuktchis are supposed to form the connecting
                    link between the races of the two worlds, and the supposition is strengthened by
                    the <hi rend="italic">invention</hi> of an American branch of the tribe.
                    Professor Nordenskjöld himself remarks that “this race, settled on the primeval
                    route between the Old and the New World, bears an unmistakable stamp of the
                    Mongols of Asia and Eskimo and Indians of America” (Petermann’s <hi
                    rend="italic">Mittheilungen,</hi> 1879, p. 330). But Lieutenant Palander of the
                    same expedition says that “they undoubtedly descend from the Greenland Eskimo”
                    (t½.), which would at once deprive them of all value as a connecting link, while
                    Peschel <hi rend="italic">{Races of Man,</hi> p. 391) much more probably allies
                    them to the Itelmes (Kamtchadales), the <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit12newyrich/page/n848/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0912-0848-0823"/> two languages being “as closely related as is
                    Spanish to Portuguese.” W. H. Dall <hi rend="italic">(Contributions to American
                    Ethnology,</hi> vol. i., Washington, 1877) further points out that the Innuit
                    (Eskimo) tongue, said to be spoken by the Tchuktchis, is merely a trading
                    jargon, a mixture of Koriak, Tchuktchi, Innuit, English, Hawaiian, and others.
                    It is also to be noted that the Samoyedes and other Asiatic Arctic peoples,
                    assumed by many to be the progenitors of the Eskimo, are of Mongoloid stock and
                    distinctly brachycephalous, while the Eskimo are the most dolichocephalous race
                    on the globe next to the Kai Cυlos of Fiji (Flower). Thus the Eskimo, instead of
                    being a connecting link, form an anthropological barrier between the populations
                    of the two hemispheres at the very point geographically most convenient for
                    effecting the transition.</p>
                <p>Nor would the question be much furthered by allowing the arrival of a few
                    barbarous tribes <hi rend="italic">via</hi> Behring Strait in prehistoric times.
                    Their presence would leave the Aztec, Mayan, Peruvian, and other local cultures
                    unexplained, except as independent developments. And more recent historic
                    migrations of Chinese, Japanese, and other civilized peoples, otherwise involved
                    in tremendous difficulties, would leave equally unexplained the primeval
                    moundbuilding races of the Ohio valley and the still more ancient Brazilian
                    races of the Santa Catharina and Santos shellheaps. Because a stray vessel has
                    been cast ashore on the western seaboard since the discovery of America, Virchow
                    suggests the possibility of similar arrivals in remoter times. But if the
                    Chinese arrived so recently as even 8000 years ago (an extreme supposition) in
                    sufficient numbers to build up a civilization in Central America, the Chinese
                    origin of such a civilizatiou would to this day be as self-evident as is the
                    Chinese origin of the neighbouring Japanese civilization. The foreign founders
                    of these communities would necessarily have brought with them their arts, their
                    domestic animals, their more useful plants and cereals, without which they must
                    have themselves speedily perished or been absorbed in the surrounding native
                    populations. But no trace of these things was found in the New World on its
                    discovery. There was neither the rice of the Chinese, nor the wheat, barley,
                    oats, or rye of the Western nations, nor the iron now proved to have been known
                    to the ancient Assyrians and Egyptians, nor the horse, camel, ox, sheep, pig,
                    dog, or poultry of the eastern hemisphere. Instead of these, there was little
                    beyond one cereal (maize), one esculent root (potato), one feeble beast of
                    burden (llama), limited to the uplands of the southern Cordilleras, one species
                    of dog elsewhere unknown. Most of the useful plants and animals of the East have
                    since been introduced, and flourish vigorously even in the wild state, a
                    sufficient proof that they would have been propagated had they been introduced
                    at an earlier epoch. The knowledge of metals was limited to copper, both wrought
                    and, in Wisconsin, apparently cast (J. S. Butler), bronze, lead, gold, and
                    silver. Otherwise most of the nations were at the discovery still in the Stone
                    Age; and, although Virchow’s assertion may be true that the most practised
                    archaeologist will fail to detect any material difference between the stone
                    implements of the two hemispheres, this merely implies that the arts of
                    Palaeolithic and Neolithic man were pretty much the same everywhere.</p>
                <p>Nor is there anything in the religions, systems of government, architecture, and
                    other arts of the native Americans, by which they can be connected with the
                    corresponding systems of the East. That the Toltec builders of the low
                    obtruncated Mexican pyramids were a different people from the pyramid builders
                    of the Nile valley, and that the mummies of the Ancon necropolis and other parts
                    of Peru were of a different stock from the Egyptian mummies, is sufficiently
                    evident from the texture of the hair alone. The hair of the old cultured races
                    of America was the same as that of all the later American races, uniformly lank,
                    because cylindrical in section. The hair of the old Egyptians, like that of the
                    modern Fellahin, is, on the contrary, uniformly wavy, because more or less oval
                    in section. The religions, again, of the Red Man, we are told by Carl
                    Schultz-Sellack, Oscar Loew, and other good observers, are “essentially
                    astrological, based on star, sun, and moon worship,” with which was often
                    associated an intricate method of measuring time built on a series of twenty
                    constellations” <hi rend="italic">(Zeitschr.</hi><hi rend="italic">für
                    Ethnologie,</hi> 1879, p. 209). “The sun,” says Loew, “is the god of most Indian
                    tribes. ‘ He diffuses warmth and nourishment for us and our animals; why shall
                    we not worship him? ’ observed to me on one occasion Masayamtiba, a Moqui Indian
                    (New Mexico) <hi rend="italic">” (ib.</hi> p. 265). This Masayamtiba was a
                    better philosopher than those ethnologists who seek for the origin of such a
                    simple cult in the remote corners of the globe, rather than in the beneficial
                    influence of the heavenly bodies which shine alike for all mankind. The four
                    great gods of the Mayas, the “props of the heavens,” answered to the four great
                    Mexican gods of the four quarters of the compass, all being associated with the
                    four elements of wind, water, fire, and earth. But to what does either system
                    answer in the polytheistic creeds of the Hindus, Assyrians, Babylonians, or
                    other nations of antiquity 1 There is something similar in the Neo-Buddhistic
                    teachings; but Buddhism, even of the oldest type, is much too recent to explain
                    anything in the religious worlds of Mexico or Yucatan. The hare is associated in
                    America, in Asia, and even amongst the Bushmen of South Africa with the moon.
                    But this association was obviously suggested independently by the spots which,
                    especially in the first quarter of the moon seem to present the outlines of a
                    hare on its form. Waitz <hi rend="italic">(Anthropology,</hi> p. 255) well
                    observes that a common belief in a universal flood, or in the periodical
                    destruction of the world, whether by fire, water, storms, or earthquakes, and
                    analogous or parallel lines of thought—taken individually—afford no proof
                    whatever in favour of affinity, and even resemblances in several points possess
                    only a secondary importance; for they may partly, under like conditions, arise
                    spontaneously among peoples who have always lived in a state of separation, or
                    may have partly resulted from periods of short intercourse between two different
                    peoples.</p>
                <p>In any case, these slight coincidences are of little account when weighed against
                    the argument based on diversity of speech. The tremendous force of this
                    argument, as applied to the American aborigines, is scarcely realized by
                    anthropologists such as Waitz or Virchow, who have not cultivated philological
                    studies, and it is significant that, in the already quoted paper by Virchow on
                    the “Anthropology of America,” the linguistic element is not even referred to.
                    On the other hand, it has been greatly depreciated and even brought into
                    contempt by the vagaries of certain etymologists, who discover affinities where
                    there is nothing but the vaguest verbal resemblance.<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>It may be sufficient to refer to the series
                    of papers by Mr John' Campbell of Montreal on the “Hittites in America,” which
                    have recently appeared in the <hi rend="italic">Canadian Quarterly Journal of
                    Science,</hi> and which on the most fanciful grounds connect the native idioms
                    not only with each other but with most of the known languages of the universe.
                    Thus Iroquois and Peruvian are declared to be radically one, while the former is
                    connected with Basque, Dakotan with Circassian, Accad with Japanese, and a
                    general Kbita linguistic family is made to include, besides all these, Choctaw,
                    Cherokee, Aleutian, Fuegian, Aino, Kamtchadale, Tchuktchi, Haussa, Barabra, and
                    many others in every part of the world.</p></note> Science has demonstrated

                    absolutely distinct order of speech. They are neither isolating or monosyllabic
                    like the Indo-Chinese group, agglutinating like the Ural-Altaic, Bantu, or
                    Dravidian, nor inflexional like the Semitic and Aryan. They come nearest in
                    structure to the Basque, which is the only incorporating language of the Old
                    World, but differ from it essentially inasmuch as their capacity of
                    incorporating words in the sentence is not restricted to the verb and a few
                    pronominal elements, but extends in principle to all the parts of speech. This
                    faculty, which, with one or two doubtful exceptions, seems to be characteristic
                    of every American idiom from Behring Strait to Cape Horn, has received the name
                    of polysynthesis, literally “a much putting together.”<note anchored="true"

                    >(Linguistique,</hi> Paris, 1877) has endeavoured to confound polysynthesis with
                    agglutination; but A. H. Keane (Appendix to Stanford’s <hi rend="italic">Central
                    and South, America,</hi> 1878) has shown that the difference between the two is
                    fundamental, and Prof. Sayce <hi rend="italic">(Science of Language,</hi> 1880)
                    has finally adopted this view.</p></note> Hence, in a comprehensive
                    classification of articulate speech according to its inner mechanism, a special
                    place must be reserved for the American group; and, if we assume as the most
                    probable theory that all speech has slowly evolved from a few simple beginnings,
                    passing successively from the state of crude roots to the isolating condition,
                    and so onwards to the agglutinating and other orders, then in such a scheme the
                    American will stand apart in some such position as under :—</p>

                    but only from some now extinct agglutinating forms of speech of which Malayan or
                    Dravidian may be taken as still surviving typical instances. The disappearance
                    in America of all such assumed forms, unless the Otomi of Mexico is to be
                    accepted as a solitary lingering specimen, argues both a very great antiquity
                    and an independent evolution of the American languages. And as the course this
                    evolution has taken differs entirely from that pursued by the idioms of the Old
                    World, it follows that the first peopling of America, if from the Old World,
                    must be thrown back to a time when all speech itself was in its infancy, to a
                    time when slow diffusion might be conceived as equally probable from an eastern
                    or a western starting-point. It is this feature of polysynthesis that gives the
                    American race its first and greatest claim to be regarded as truly
                    autochthonous, in the same sense that we regard the Mongolian and Caucasian
                    races as truly autochthonous in Asia.</p>
                <p>There is a general consensus amongst anthropologists that on the western
                    continent we are in presence of two distinct original types, the brachycephalous
                    and dolichocephalous. But these are no longer confined to separate geographical
                    areas, as Retzius supposed. The very general practice of artificially flattening
                    or otherwise deforming the skull has naturally caused less value to be attached
                    to the craniological test in America than elsewhere. The practice has been
                    traced back even to prehistoric times, and a clay figure recently found
                    associated with the remains of a child by Reiss and Stiibel in a gravein Ancon
                    puts in a clear light the method adopted by the ancient Peruvians <hi
                    rend="italic">(The Necropolis of Ancon,</hi> Berlin and London, 1881, plate 90).
                    Still, careful investigations have placed it beyond doubt that the normal skull
                    both in North and in South America is now mesaticephalous, or of a type
                    intermediate between the two extremes, a fact supposed to imply a general
                    intermingling of the two primeval stocks. On the other hand, Virchow, <hi
                    rend="italic">(loc. cit.,</hi> passim) shows perfectly normal ancient and recent
                    crania from both sides of Greenland, from El Carmen on the Rio Negro, Patagonia,
                    from the Botocudo tribe, East Brazil, from a tumulus of Santa Fé de Bogota, and
                    even a Peruvian mummy exhumed at Pancatambo, all of which are distinctly, in
                    some cases extremely, dolichocephalic. In the same way he produces
                    brachycephalic skulls from the Brazilian shell-mounds of Santos and Santa
                    Catharina, from the barrows of the Ohio valley mound-builders, from the Carib
                    and Araucanian tribes, and from the Pampas of La Plata, the last mentioned of an
                    extreme type, in close proximity to the extreme dolichocephalous specimens from
                    Patagonia. Were it safe to argue from the analogy of Britain, where the
                    dolichocephalic builders of the long barrows seem to have preceded and
                    afterwards become intermingled with the brachycephalic builders of the round
                    barrows (Dr Thurnam), the western continent might be supposed to have been
                    successively occupied first by a long-headed and then by a round-headed race,
                    which kept aloof in a few places, while more generally becoming fused in a
                    normally mesaticephalic type. But we have in America no guide to the relative
                    priority of the two forms of head, nor are there now any long-headed races on
                    the eastern Asiatic seaboard whose ancestors might be taken as the precursors of
                    the corresponding element in the West. The obvious alternative also remains,
                    that the two forms may have become differentiated on the American continent,
                    just as similar differentiations must, by those who do not accept the doctrine
                    of fixity of species, be assumed to have taken place in Asia. For such an
                    evolution America offered a more ample field even than Asia, for it is not
                    confined to the northern hemisphere, but stretches from the Arctic nearly to the
                    Antarctic Circle, presenting in this wide range almost every conceivable variety
                    of climate, atmosphere, soil, and temperature.</p>
                <p>We thus see that the two cranial forms do not necessarily militate against the
                    possible primordial unity of the <hi rend="italic">homo</hi><hi rend="italic"

                    and mental features, common to all the native races. Of the physical traits the
                    most important and uniform are—(1) the hair, which is always black, coarse,
                    glossy, and long, like a horse’s mane, round in transverse section and

                    their colour, shows that the extremes of a deep brown almost approaching a true

                    and who can reckon to a million and upwards, and on the other by the Chiquitos
                    of the Bolivian lowlands, who, D’Orbigny assures us <hi rend="italic">(op.
                    cit.,</hi> ii. p. 163), “cannot get beyond one (tama), after which they have
                    nothing but terms of comparison.” The only real intellectual faculty common to
                    all the American races is that implied by the peculiar polysynthetic mechanism
                    of their speech. But beneath this general morphological structure, the substance
                    of the languages themselves varies greatly in all that concerns their phonetic
                    systems, vocabularies, relational forms, syntax, and methods of combination.
                    While, for instance, the Thlinkeet of the extreme north-west Pacific seaboard,
                    the Apache of Arizona, the Quichua of Peru, and the Aymara of the Bolivian
                    uplands are amongst the very harshest and most guttural tongues in the world,
                    the Otuke of the Bolivian plains, the Mohave of Arizona, the Chiquito of the
                    upper Paraguay basin, the Samucu on the north frontier of Gran Chaco, and many
                    Amazonian dialects are distinguished by great softness, often rivalling in
                    euphony the most musical languages of the eastern hemisphere. The linguistic
                    families differ from each other, not only in the measure to which their
                    polysynthesis has been developed, but even in its very character, so that while
                    some have scarcely yet arrived at a clear differentiation of verb and noun,
                    others, like the Iroquois, have a purely verbal, others again, such as the
                    extinct Timucua of Florida, an exclusively nominal inflexion. In the same way
                    some are partial to prefixes, some to suffixes, some to infixes. Many of the
                    Californian idioms seem to be still verging on the agglutinating stage, while
                    the just-mentioned Timucua, the Aztec, Choctaw, Shoshone, Cree, Matlalzinca, and
                    others of the Anahuac table-land, have reached the very acme of polysynthesis,
                    in which all the parts of the sentence often become by indefinite composition
                    and syncope fused into one interminable “bunch-word” of from ten to fifteen
                    syllables and upwards. As these languages also differ entirely in their
                    vocabularies, often possessing not a single root in common, it follows that they
                    can be no more classed together than can for instance the various agglutinating
                    tongues of the Caucasus or the Soudan.</p>
                <p>It thus appears hopeless to look for any unity of details in the mental and
                    physical faculties of the American aborigines. What they have in common is
                    reducible to one physical and one mental quality, the universal texture and
                    black colour of the hair, and their polysynthetic speech. These two properties
                    point directly at primordial unity of origin; the endless varieties of detail
                    argue a prodigious antiquity and an independent development of the race on the
                    American continent. The variety renders the work of classification a labour of
                    extreme difficulty and uncertainty. Amidst all these endless points of
                    divergence, it seems impossible to find any common basis round which to group
                    the various tribes and races, and the problem becomes further complicated by the
                    fact that, while many of these tribes differ in speech, though evidently of one
                    racial stock, others belonging to the same linguistic connexion present the
                    widest physical discrepancies. Thus the Chiquitos and the Moxos peoples of
                    Bolivia, obviously of one ethnical type, speak several fundamentally distinct
                    languages. The same is true of the Moqui, Queres, Isletta, Tegua, Zuni, and
                    other New Mexican Pueblos, while the reverse phenomenon is presented by the
                    Montagnais and Nasquapees of Labrador, both of whom speak closely related Cree
                    dialects, yet differ so much in appearance that, “judging from their exterior,
                    one would suppose them to belong to different families of the human race”
                    (Hind’s <hi rend="italic">Labrador,</hi> 1. p. 332). Within comparatively narrow
                    areas occurs occasionally every conceivable element of confusion, as in
                    California and the south-western States, occupied by the morally debased and
                    physically degraded Pah-Utes, the tall and manly Mohaves, the ferocious Apaches,
                    the mild and intellectual Indians of the New Mexican Pueblos, some fishers and
                    hunters, some living on roots and berries, some skilled agriculturists, all
                    speaking fundamentally distinct languages.</p>
                <p>It is evidently impossible in such a case to adhere throughout to any one method
                    of classification, and the following tentative survey is consequently based
                    partly on the linguistic and partly on the ethnical elements, but partly also on
                    mere geographical grounds. Fortunately there are in all the divisions of the
                    continent a few great families, occupying vast regions, in which the ethnical
                    and linguistic elements largely coincide. Foremost amongst these are the
                    sub-arctic races and the Athabascans, Algonquins, and Dakotas in the north, the
                    Maya-Quiché in the centre, and in the south the Caribs, Quichua-Aymaras, and
                    Guaranis. These eight stocks cover jointly an area of not less than 11 millions
                    of square miles, with a total <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit12newyrich/page/n851/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0912-0851-0826"/> aboriginal population of about four millions. But
                    the seven millions of pure and mixed Indians occupying the remainder of the
                    land, 5 millions of square miles in extent, are divided into a multiplicity of
                    tribes, whose racial and linguistic affinities present problems the solution of
                    which must long tax the utmost ingenuity of science. The total number of
                    distinct languages alone is estimated at about 760, of which 430 are in the
                    north and 330 in the south. In the northern division Balbi reckons, exclusive of
                    California, thirty-two stock languages, far too low an estimate, while Rivero
                    and Tschudi consider that of the southern idioms as many as four-fifths are
                    radically distinct. But all such calculations are mere vague guesses at the
                    truth; and in the present state of our knowledge it is impossible to form an
                    estimate of the actual number of languages still current in Gran Chaco,
                    Chiquitos, the Amazon valley, Central America, Mexico, California, the Columbia
                    basin, regions where an extraordinary complexity of speech prevails. N
                    evertheless language forms on the whole perhaps the most convenient basis of
                    classification, and without its aid it would have been impossible to determine
                    the affinities of many wide-spread races, such, for instance, as that of the
                    Arizona Apaches with the Canadian Chippewyans, or on the other hand to separate
                    nations apparently closely related, like the Iroquois from their Algonquin
                    neighbours, or the Araucanians from the Peruvians. The true relations of many
                    tribes are, on the other hand, still doubtful, because of uncertainty regarding
                    the languages they speak. Such are the Cheyennes, Bl·ickfeet, and Arapahoes,
                    classed by some with the Dakotas, by others more probably with the Algonquins.
                    Such also are the so-called Dieguenos (Kizh, Netela, and Kechi) of South
                    California, oscillating between the Shoshone (Snake) and Yuma connexions, and
                    the Pawnees of Nebraska and Kansas grouped by Bancroft with the Shoshone, but by
                    Morgan regarded as an independent race. So close is the physical resemblance in
                    these and many other cases that the question must ultimately be decided by a
                    more exhaustive study of their languages.</p>
                <p>The American races may be conveniently grouped under the following eighteen
                    divisions :—</p>
                <p>I. <hi rend="italic">Hyperborean Races.—</hi> This division may on the whole be
                    regarded as possessing a certain ethnical, linguistic, and geographical unity.
                    Still the Aleutians differ so greatly in language, and in some respects in type,
                    from the Eskimo proper that it seems desirable to class them separately. The <hi
                    rend="italic">Eskimo</hi> (or “Innuits,” as they call themselves) are thus
                    distributed by Dall :—</p>
                <p>Kopagrnut, mouth of the Mackenzie; Kangmâligmut, thence to Manning Point;
                    Nûwukmut, about Point Barrow and Icy Cape; Kowagmut, east end of Hotham Inlet;
                    Salawigmut, at Salawik river; Chuklukmut, Gulf of Anadyr, Asia, oft en
                    confounded with the Tchuktchis, from whom they are entirely distinct;
                    Okee-ogmut, the islands north of 63° N. lat.; Kikhtogamut, St Lawrence Island;
                    Kaviagmut, between Kotzebue and Norton Sounds; Mahlemut, neck of Kadiak
                    Peninsula; Unaligmut, from Norton Sound to mouth of the Yukon; Ekogmut, Yukon
                    Delta; Magemut, from Yukon to Kuskokwim river; Kuskwogmut, Kus-kokwimBay;
                    Nushagagmut, Bristol Bay, west to Cape Newenham; 0gulmut, north side of Alaska
                    peninsula; Ka ’ &gt;iagmut, south side of Alaska peninsula and Kadiak Island;
                    Chugachigmut, Prince William's Sound to Atna river; Ugalakmut, from Atna river
                    to Mount St Elias.</p>
                <p>The last-named, the Ugalenzes of the Russians, call themselves Chilkhatmut, and
                    are undoubtedly true Eskimo, although frequently confounded with the Thlinkeets,
                    on whose domain they converge. The few Innuit tribes east of the Mackenzie have
                    not been classified, but two of them, the Netchillik and Uquisiksillik, were met
                    by Lieut. Schwatka in 1879, who received from them some particulars regarding
                    the remains of the Franklin expedition.</p>
                <p>Of the Aleuts, whose collective name is “Ungungun,” or “People,” there are two
                    divisions :—</p>
                <p>I. <hi rend="italic">Unalashkans,</hi> who call themselves Kagataya Kung'n (“Men
                    of the East ”), occupying the extremity of the Alaska Peninsula, as far as 160°
                    W., and the Una-lashka or Fox Islands. 2. <hi rend="italic">Atkhas,</hi>
                    occupying all the other Aleutian Islands.</p>
                <p><hi> II.</hi><hi rend="italic">Thlinkeets.—</hi> These form a distinct ethnical
                    and linguistic group, occupying a compact geographical area along the Pacific
                    coast from about Mount St Elias to the Simpson river, and including Sitka and
                    the other adjacent islands. They are often called “Koloshes,” a term of doubtful
                    origin, but the national name is “T’linket,” “man,” or “T’linketantukwan,” “men
                    belonging to ill villages.” The tribal divisions are <hi rend="subscript">
                    -</hi> Yakutat, between Mounts St Elias and Fairweather; Chilkahtkwan, Chilkhaht
                    river valley; Sitkakwan, Sitka Islands and part of Prince of wales Islands;
                    Stâkhinkwan, lower course of Stikine river; Takukwan and Skatkwan, Taku Inlet,
                    Alaska; Hudsunu, Hood’s Bay and Huchinu Rapids; Iliknu and Tungass, about
                    Simpson river.</p>
                <p>The Thlinkeet language seems to be completely isolated, showing nothing beyond
                    the faintest verbal resemblance to the Aleut and more southern Hydah. It has a
                    plural in <hi rend="italic">k,</hi> and an instrumental form in <hi
                    rend="italic">ich</hi> or <hi rend="italic">tsh,</hi> the combination of which
                    produces a heaping up of final consonants, which none but the natives can
                    pronounce. Thus <hi rend="italic">ass,</hi> tree; <hi rend="italic">asstsh,</hi>
                    by a tree; <hi rend="italic">isk,</hi> trees; <hi rend="italic">assktsh,</hi> by
                    trees. (See “Notes on the Sitkakwan Dialect,” by J. Furnhehn, in <hi

                <p><hi> III.</hi><hi rend="italic">Columbian Races.—</hi> The general grouping of
                    these is purely geographical, the main divisions largely ethnical and
                    linguistic; the area, British Columbia, Queen Charlotte and Vancouver Islands,
                    Washington, and Oregon. Here are five stock races speaking an immense number of
                    dialects, which, owing to their extremely evanescent character, it is very
                    difficult to classify. The Puget Sound district, in the north-west of
                    Washington, is in this respect specially remarkable. But great light has
                    recently been thrown on this Babel of tongues by the labours of G. Gibbs,
                    published by Dall, in <hi rend="italic">North American Ethnology,</hi> vol. i.
                    p. 240. The five stock races with their chief tribal subdivisions are as follows
                    :—</p>
                <p>1. <hi rend="italic">Hydahs.—</hi> The Kaigani of Prince of Wales Islands and
                    north coast of Queen Charlotte Islands; the Klue, Kiddan, Ninstence,
                    Skid-a-gate, Skid-a-gatee, Cum-slιe-was, and Chut-sin-ni of Queen Charlotte
                    Islands; and the Tsimsians, including the Kispachloht of Fort Simpson, the
                    KΓkuskamoluk of river Naas, and the Kittistzu, Hailtzukh, Bilikfιla, and
                    Kwa-Kiûtl of Milbank Sound. 2. <hi rend="italic">Nutkas.-</hi> The Ahts,
                    including Pachlnalιt, Nitinaht, Ohyaht, Howchuklisaht, Klah-oh-quaht, Manohsaht,
                    Nishquayaht, Ayhuttisaht, and Khahosaht, on the west coast of vancouver Island,
                    in their order going northwards; the Makaor Klasset,about Cape Flattery; and the
                    Quoquoulth, Komux, Kowitchan, Klailum, Ukletas, Sokes, Pachina, and
                    Sankaulutuch, of the east coast of Vancouver Island. 3. <hi rend="italic">Selish
                    or Flat Heads.—</hi> The Kwantlum and Haitlin or Tait, Fraser river below Fort
                    Yale; the Kalispelm, Quarlpi, Spokane, Pisquouse, Soaiatlpi, of middle Columbia
                    basin; the Nisqualli (including the Skokomish, S'hotlmamish, Sawamish,
                    Segwallitsu, Puyallupahmish, Dwamish, Snohomish, Snokwalmu, Yakama, Skagit,
                    Lummi,and S'klallam) of Puget Sound; the Chihaliβ or Tsihalis, Grey Harbour; and
                    the Shushwaps (including Shewhapmuch, Kutenais, and Okanagan) of Upper Columbia.

                    Palouse, Tairtla. Cayuse, and Mollale of upper Clear Water and Snake rivers; and
                    the Kamai and Lapwai of Idaho reserve. 5. <hi rend="italic">Chinuks.—</hi> The

                    Speech radically distinct, but now represented only by the Chinuk jargon.</p>
                <p>The names of Nos. 1 and 2 are purely conventional. <hi rend="italic">Hydah</hi>
                    or <hi rend="italic">Haida</hi> was originally applied by Francis Poole to the
                    Queen Charlotte tribes, and was afterwards extended to all the members of that
                    family. <hi rend="italic">Natka,</hi> from Nutka Sound, west coast of Vancouver
                    Island, came gradually into use as the collective name of the eastern Vancouver
                    tribes, and of some peoples on the opposite mainland ethnically related to them.
                    But the languages differ so widely that they cannot be reduced to a common root.
                    Though possessing great intelligence and even considerable artistic skill, shown
                    especially in their wood and bone carvings and plastic works, these
                    north-western nations betray an absolute incapacity for adapting themselves to
                    civilized institutions. Sproat tells us that many of those who have been
                    settled, under the most favourable circumstances, in different parts of
                    Vancouver, simply die out through inanition, or from sudden change of life.</p>
                <p><hi> IV.</hi><hi rend="italic">Californian Races.—</hi> This is mainly a
                    geographical grouping, but with three large ethnical and linguistic families—the
                    Klamath, Pomo, and Runsien. Many of the others belong to the Shoshone,
                    Athabascan, and Yuma connexions. But the rest form a chaos of tribes, generally
                    of a debased physical and moral type, and speaking rude dialects which baffle
                    all attempts at classification. They are all rapidly disappearing into the
                    “reserves,” or off the face of the land. The <hi rend="italic">Klamath</hi>
                    family, in the Klamath river basin, and thence eastwards to Nevada, comprises
                    the Lutuami or Klamaths proper, the Cahrocs and Eurocs (“Upper and Lower Rocs
                    ”), the Modocs, Yacons, Shastas, Weitspeks, Wishosks, Wallies, Yukas, and others
                    stretching south to the Humboldt river. South of them are the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Pomos,</hi> or “People,” mainly in the Potter valley, including the Kahto,
                    Choam, Chadela, Kalamet, Shebalne, Lama, Comacho, Socoa, Sanel, and the
                    Gallinomero of the Russian River. Still further south are the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Runsiens</hi> of Monterey Bay, with linguistic affinities stretching all along
                    the coast northwards to San Francisco, and southwards beyond Cape Concepcion to
                    the islands of San Miguel and Sta Cruz. The chief members of the group are the
                    Eslenes, Olhones, Mipacmacs, Yolos, Talluches, Waches, Powells, and others about
                    Lake Tulare. In the Napa valley is a small family including the Ulukas, Suskols,
                    Kalayomanes, Myaconιas, and Caymus; and in the Sacramento valley are the
                    Secumne, Kosumne, Yasumne, Ochecumne, Chupumne, and some twenty others, whose
                    tribal names all end in <hi rend="italic">umne,</hi> and who may perhaps be
                    regarded as forming a distinct linguistic group. But they will have vanished
                    before the point can be settled.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                <p>V. <hi rend="italic">Shoshone and Pawnee Families.—</hi> These form one ethnical,
                    but apparently two linguistic groups, for L. H. Morgan regards the Pawnee as
                    distinct not only from the Shoshone but from all other languages.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Shoshone</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Snake</hi> family
                    occupies a wide domain, including most of Idaho, Utah, and Wyoming, besides
                    parts of Oregon, Nevada, West Montana, Arizona, North Texas, South California,
                    and New Mexico. There are six distinct groups :—</p>
                <p>1. <hi rend="italic">Wininasht,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Western Shoshones,</hi>
                    Oregon and Idaho. 2. <hi rend="italic">Bannacks,</hi> Oregon, Idaho, Nevada. 3.
                    <hi rend="italic">Utahs</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Utes,</hi> with numerous
                    subdivisions (Utes proper, Washoes,Pah-Utes, Gosh-Utes, Pi-Edes,
                    &amp;c.),Colorado, Utah, Nevada, Arizona, and South California. 4. <hi

                    >ans,</hi> three branches (Paducas, Yamparaks, and Tenawas), North Texas, New
                    Mexico, North Mexico. 5. <hi rend="italic">Moqui,</hi> New Mexico; all the seven
                    Moqui pueblos except the Oreibe (Haro), in which the Teg∣ιa language is current.
                    6. <hi rend="italic">DiegueΑo</hi> (Kizh, Kechi, and Netela), about S. Diego,
                    the south-west corner of California; but by Gatschet these are now affilia:ed to
                    the Yuma stock <hi rend="italic">(Zeitschr.</hi><hi rend="italic">für
                    Ethnologie,</hi> 1877, p. 365). The <hi rend="italic">Benemé</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">Cobqji</hi> of south-east California are also included by Gatschet
                    in the Shoshone family.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Pawnee (Pani)</hi> area is confined to Kansas and Texas,
                    besides the Pawnee reserve, Indian territory, with three main divisions :—</p>
                <p>1. <hi rend="italic">Pawnees proper,</hi> including the Chänd, Kitkä, Skidi and
                    Petähänerot, Kansas and Pawnee reserve, Indian Territory. 2. <hi rend="italic"
                    >Arikarees</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Rikarees,</hi> formerly in the Missouri
                    valley, 47° N. 3. <hi rend="italic">Wichitas,</hi> upper course of Red and
                    Canadian Rivers, Texas, with whom should be grouped the Kichai, λVaccoe, and
                    perhaps the Towiak, Towakoni, wacho, and Caddo of Texas and Louisiana. To the
                    same connexion probably belonged the extinct Adaize, Nachitoch, Chetimach,
                    Attacapa, and others of Louisiana, figuring in Gallatin's synopsis as stock
                    languages (Schoolcraft, iii. p. 401).</p>
                <p>VI. <hi rend="italic">New Mexican Pueblos.—</hi> This is a strictly ethnical
                    family occupying a compact area in New Mexico, but according to W. C. Lane
                    (Schoolcraft, v. p. 689) speaking six distinct languages sprung of one original
                    stock, as under :—</p>
                <p>1. <hi rend="italic">Queres,</hi> current in the Acorna, Cochitirni, Kiworni,
                    Laguna, and four other pueblos. 2. <hi rend="italic">Tegua</hi> or <hi
                    rend="italic">Taywaugh,</hi> current in the Nambe, Tesugue, San Juan, and three
                    other pueblos, besides the Haro, a Moqui pueblo. 3. <hi rend="italic"
                    >Picori</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Enaghmagħ,</hi> current in the Picori,
                    Isletta, Taos, a id five other pueblos. 4. <hi rend="italic">Jemez,</hi> current
                    in Jcmez and Pecos only. 5. <hi rend="italic">Zuni,</hi> current in Zufii only,
                    and said to be a radically distinct language. 6. <hi rend="italic">Moqui,</hi> a
                    Shoshone dialect (see V. above), current in all the Moqui pueblos except
                    Haro.</p>
                <p>One of the most remarkable of existing linguistic phenomena is the number of
                    widely diverging languages spoken in these twenty-six New Mexican pueblos, where
                    the uniformity of institutions, agricultural habits, town life, and social
                    intercourse might be supposed to establish a community of speech.</p>
                <p>VII. <hi rend="italic">Yuma Stock.—</hi> This linguistic and ethnical group in
                    South Arizona and South California is named from the typical Yuma tribe formerly
                    at the junction of the Gila and Colorado rivers. The family has been learnedly
                    treated by A. S. Gatschet <hi rend="italic">(Zcitsch. f.</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Ethnologie,</hi> 1877, pp. 341 and 366), who regards the Yuma as fundamentally
                    distinct from all the surrounding forms of speech. The tribes are now mostly
                    gathered in the three reserves of the Colorado river (right bank, 34° N.), San
                    Carlos, Gila river, south-east Arizona, and Pinia and Maricopa, South Arizona,
                    with a joint population of 5249, to which must be added about 750 for those who
                    are still independent, making 6000 for the whole race. Chief tribes</p>
                <p>1. <hi rend="italic">Yavipii</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Yampai,</hi> formerly west
                    and north-west of the Aztec Mountains. 2. <hi rend="italic">Konino</hi> or <hi
                    rend="italic">Casnino,</hi> San Francisco Mountains; said to be extinct. 3. <hi
                    rend="italic">Tonto</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Tonto-Apache,</hi> between the
                    Green River and Aztec Mountains, distinct from the Tonto-Apaches of Athabascan
                    stock. 4. <hi rend="italic">Maricopa</hi> or <hi rend="italic"
                    >Cocomaricopa,</hi> middle course of the Gila. 5. <hi rend="italic"
                    >Hualapai</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Wallapai,</hi> between the Colorado and
                    Black Mountains. 6. <hi rend="italic">Mohave</hi> or <hi rend="italic"
                    >Mojave,</hi> properly <hi rend="italic">Hamukh-habi</hi> (“Three Hills ”),
                    largest of all the Yuma tribes, both sides of the middle and lower Colorado. 7.
                    <hi rend="italic">Yuma</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Kutchan,</hi> at junction of
                    Colorado and Gila rivers. 8. <hi rend="italic">Cocopa</hi> or <hi rend="italic"
                    >Cucapa,</hi> at mouth of the Colorado. 9. <hi rend="italic">Comoyei</hi> or <hi
                    rend="italic">Queιneya,</hi> collective name of all the Yuma tribes between the
                    lower Colorado and the Pacific, including (according to Gatschet) the <hi
                    rend="italic">Diegueθcs</hi> (see V., No. 6), and the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Kiliwi</hi> near San Tomas mission. 10. <hi rend="italic">Cochimi,
                    Pericui,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Guaicuri of</hi> lower California.' Probably
                    to the same family belonged the extinct <hi rend="italic">Cojuenches, Cucapas,
                    Jalchedums, Noches, Cawinas, Niforas,</hi> and others of South and East
                    Arizona.</p>
                <p>VIII. <hi rend="italic">Athabascan or Tinney Family.—</hi> This is the most
                    widespread ethnical and linguistic group in North America, comprising most of
                    Alaska and the Canadian Dominion from the Eskimo domain to the Churchill river
                    north and south, and from the Rocky Mountains to Hudson Bay west and east,
                    besides isolated enclaves in Oregon, Arizona, New Mexico, Colorado, and North
                    Mexico. The term <hi rend="italic">Athabascan</hi> is geographical, from Lake
                    Athabasca, a great rallying point of the northern tribes, while <hi
                    rend="italic">Tinney,</hi> suggested by Petitot, variously pronounced Tinné,
                    Thynné, Déné, Tena, Itynai, Tanai, Dtinne, &amp;c., and meaning <hi
                    rend="superscript"> u</hi> People,” is the general tribal name. About the
                    spelling, sound, and identification of the individual tribal names, the greatest
                    confusion prevails. Thus <hi rend="italic">Kenai,</hi> used by Francis Mιiller
                    as the collective name of a distinct group, is supposed to be an Innuit word by
                    Dall, who says that it should consequently be applied to no tribes of Tinney
                    race. <hi rend="italic">Kolchaina</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Kolshanc,</hi>
                    figuring in most tables as a special tribe, appears to be a term vaguely applied
                    by the Russians to all the interior Tinneys of Alaska, about whom they knew
                    little or nothing. The Chippewyans of Lake Athabasca are constantly confused
                    with the Algonquin</p>
                <p>Chippewas of Upper Canada, just as the Tonto-Apaches of Yuma stock are with the
                    Tonto-Apaches of Athabascan stock. The Alaska division especially was in a
                    chaotic state until Dall <hi rend="italic">(op. cit.</hi>) surveyed the field
                    anew, and supplied the subjoined corrected and apparently complete list :—</p>
                <p>KaiyuhkhotAna, lower Yukon and Kuskokwirn rivers; Koyûkukhotâna and Unâkhotâna,
                    right bank of lower Yukon; Kutchins or “People” (including the Tenan-Kutchin,
                    Tananah river watershed; Tennuth Kutchin and Tatsah Kutchin, between the Yukon
                    rapids and mouth of the Porcupine, extinct; Kutcha-Kutchin, about junction of
                    Yukon and Porcupine; Natsit-Kutchin, from the Porcupine to Romanzoff Mountains;
                    Vunta-Kutchin, from the Porcupine to the Arctic Innuits; Tukkuth-Kutchin,
                    head-waters of the Porcupine; Han-Kutchin, Yukon river above Kotlo river;
                    Tutchone-Kutchin, about white River; Tehânin-Kutchin, Kenai Peninsula;
                    Abbato-Tena, Pelly and MacMillan rivers; Nehaunees, about source of Pelly river;
                    Acheto-Tinneh, head-waters of Liardriver; Daho-Tena or Sikanees, Lian river;
                    Tâhko-Tinneh, Lewis river basin; Chilkaht-Tena, Lewis and Lebarge rivers;
                    Ahtena, Atna river basin.</p>
                <p>The other members of the Tinney family may be grouped in four geographical
                    divisions as under :—</p>
                <p>1. <hi rend="italic">Mackenzie Basin</hi>: Sawessaw Tinney (Chippewyans), Lake
                    Athabasca; Tant-sawhoots of the Coppermine; Beavers, Dog-ribs, Strongbows, Red
                    Knives, Hares, Sheep, Bπιshwood, and others enumerated by Petitot, whose
                    theories are wild, but whose facts form a substantial contribution to science.
                    2. <hi rend="italic">New Caledonia·.</hi> the Tahkali or Taeullies, Mackenzie’s
                    Nagailers, and the Carriers of the Canadian trappers include the Nascotin,
                    Nathliautin, Chilcotin, Taltotin, and several others. 3. <hi rend="italic"
                    >Oregon</hi>: the Umpquas on the Umpqwa river, the Tlaskanai of the lower
                    Columbia, and the Hoopahs near the north frontier of California. 4. <hi
                    rend="italic">SouthWestern States</hi> the Apaches and Navajos, who roam over
                    the region between Utah and Sonora.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p><hi rend="italic">Apache, i.e.,</hi> “the men" (root <hi
                    rend="italic">apa,</hi> man), is a Yuma word, applied to the southern Tinneys,
                    whose true name is <hi rend="italic">S'</hi><hi rend="italic">is Inday,</hi> or
                    “men of the woods. From the ending <hi rend="italic">ehe,</hi> an attempt has
                    been made by certain etymologists to connect these people with the Puelche,
                    ∏uilliche, and other Patagono-Chilian tribes whose names end in the same
                    syllable. But here <hi rend="italic">ehe</hi> is the Araucanian “man, whereas in
                    Yuma <hi rend="italic">ehe</hi> is the definite article suffixed. Of the Apaches
                    the chief trib s are the Coyoteros, Tont∩s, Lipans, M&lt;∙scaleros, Pinaletios.
                    Llancros. and G∏eflos, so named by the Spaniards; the real tribal names are
                    undetermined.</p></note><hi> IX.</hi><hi rend="italic">Algonquin Family.—</hi>
                    This ethnical and linguistic group, next in extent to the Tinneys, but far more
                    important historically and numerically, stretches from the Tinney domain
                    southwards to the latitude of South Carolina, and from the Atlantic to the Rocky
                    Mountains. Most of the tribes on the Atlantic seaboard have either disappeared,
                    migrated westwards, or been collected into the reserves. But many have acquired
                    such celebrity in the stirring records of Indian warfare that the more noted
                    with their original geographical domain will be included in the subjoined list
                    of all the Algonquin races.</p>
                <p>1. <hi rend="italic">Northern Branch</hi>: Chippewas or Ojibways, Upper Canada
                    and Michigan; Ottawas, Ottawa river valley (some now in Manitoulin Island, Lake

                    M&lt;&gt;ntagnais, south coast of Labrador; Crees or Knisteneaux, between Lakes
                    Winnipeg and Athabasca north and south, and from Rocky Mountains to Hudson’s
                    Bay, west and east. 2. <hi rend="italic">Eastern Branch</hi>: Abenakis, Maine,
                    New Hampshire (later on, Lower Canada); Mikmaks, Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, and
                    Lower Canada; Tarratines, New Brunswick; Etchemins or Milicetes, New Brunswick

                    Manhattan Island, site of present city of New York; Leni-Lennappes or Delawares,
                    Delaware, now in Indian Territory. 3. <hi rend="italic">Southern Branch</hi>;
                    Powhattans, Virginia and Maryland; Accomacs, Accomac river, East Virginia;
                    Rappahannocks. Rappahannock river, Virginia; Panticoes, North Carolina,
                    southernmost of all the Algonquin tribes; Shawnces, Pennsylvania, Kentucky, and
                    Ohio, now in Indian Territory. 4. <hi rend="italic">Western Branch</hi>:
                    Illinois, Illinois river basin; Miamis, Great Miami river basin; Pottawattamies,

                <p>The linguistic affinities of the four last named are somewhat doubtful, but
                    Albert Gallatin shows good grounds for connecting them with the Algonquin
                    group.</p>
                <p>X. <hi rend="italic">Wyandot-Iroquois Family.—</hi> This is a distinct and
                    historically famous group, allied ethnically to the Algonquins, and
                    linguistically, Morgan thinks, remotely to the Dakotas. Their area is Upper
                    Canada, about the great lakes, New York, and the Virginian highlands; they
                    nowhere reach the Atlantic coast, and are everywhere surrounded by tribes of
                    Algonquin stock. There are three main divisions :—</p>

                    widespread ethnical and linguistic group, whose proper domain is the western
                    prairies between the Mississippi and Rocky Mountains east and west, and
                    stretching from the Saskatchewan southwards to the Red River of Texas. The chief
                    divisions are</p>
                <p>1. <hi rend="italic">Dakotas proper,</hi> of the Missouri basin. Tills teιτn

                    the Dakota family.</p>
                <p>XII. <hi rend="italic">Appalachian Races.—</hi> These form an ethnical and
                    geographical grouping, including four distinct languages, which, however,
                    according to Morgan, are remotely related to the Dakota; area, the south-east
                    corner of the United States, westwards to Arkansas and Louisiana, northwards to
                    Tennessee and South Carolina, all inclusive; name purely conventional, from the
                    Appalachian or southern spurs of the Alleghanies. Here was a large linguistic
                    family forming a powerful confederacy, of which the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Muscogees</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Greeks</hi> of Alabama were the centre. The
                    other members were the <hi rend="italic">Seminoles</hi> of South Alabama and
                    Florida; the <hi rend="italic">Chickasaws</hi> of Mississippi; the <hi

                    >Timucuas</hi> ( ?) of South Carolina and Georgia. Of distinct speech were the
                    <hi rend="italic">Natchez</hi> of the lower Mississippi, who were said to have
                    spoken three languages; the <hi rend="italic">Cherokees oτChelckees,</hi> of the
                    Appalachian slopes, and the <hi rend="italic">Catawbas</hi> of South Carolina,
                    supposed by some to be the Eries, or the neutral nation who disappeared from the
                    lake region about 1656. All these races are either extinct, or have hern removed
                    to the reserves of Indian Territory, where two of the stock languages (Cherokee
                    and Creek) are still current. Natchez and Catawba are extinct. Special interest
                    attaches to the extinct Timucua language, formerly current along the east coast
                    of Georgia and Florida southwards to and beyond Cape Canaveral. It is a highly
                    synthetic form of speech, regarded by Gatschet (“Volk und Sprache der Timucua,”
                    in <hi rend="italic">Zeitsch. f.</hi><hi rend="italic">Ethnologie,</hi> 1877, p.
                    245) as a stock language, and possessing in the grammar, dictionary, and
                    catechisms of Pareja, published in 1612-13 in Mexico, the oldest written records
                    of any native tongue east of the Rocky Mountains. Gatschet gives a full account
                    of its structure, which philologists will find extremely interesting.</p>
                <p>XIII. <hi rend="italic">Mexican Races.—</hi> This is a geographical grouping, the
                    region comprising an exceptional number oU radically distinct languages, and
                    apparently three or four ethnical types. There is one large and important
                    linguistic family, the Aztec-Sonora, which stretches southwards to Nicaragua,
                    and for which Buschmann has sought affinities as far north as the Shoshone
                    group. Its chief members are</p>
                <p>1. <hi rend="italic">Aztec</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Mexican proper,</hi> widely
                    diffused throughout the Nahua empire, overthrown by Cortez. 2. <hi rend="italic"
                    >Cora,</hi> in the state Jalisco. 3. <hi rend="italic">Tarahumara,</hi> in
                    Chihuahua and Sonora. 4. <hi rend="italic">Cahita,</hi> in Sinaloa and Sonora.
                    5. <hi rend="italic">Niquiran,</hi> of Nicaragua. 6. <hi rend="italic"
                    >Tlascaltec, of</hi> San Salvador, with these are probably related the <hi
                    rend="italic">Pima</hi> and <hi rend="italic">opata of</hi> Sonora and Sinaloa,
                    the <hi rend="italic">Aca.ree of</hi> Durango, and the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Tubar</hi> of Chihuahua.</p>
                <p>The other chief stock or at least not yet classified Mexican tongues are the <hi
                    rend="italic">Miztec</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Zapotcc</hi> of Oajaca, <hi
                    rend="italic">Tarasco</hi> current in the old kingdom of Michoacan, <hi
                    rend="italic">Matlalzinca</hi> north of Anahuac, <hi rend="italic">Ceres</hi>
                    and <hi rend="italic">Cochita</hi> of Sonora, <hi rend="italic">Tepecano</hi> of
                    Jalisco, <hi rend="italic">Zacatec</hi> of Zacatecas, <hi rend="italic"
                    >Tamil-liρec</hi> of Tamaulipas, and <hi rend="italic">Otomi,</hi> an
                    interesting form of speech still almost in the monosyllabic state, cuxτent in
                    the mountains enclosing the Anahuac table-land. This is the more remarkable that
                    most of the other Mexican languages are highly polysynthetic; but the attempt
                    made to connect Otomi with Chinese has merely served to place their fundamental
                    difference in a clearer light.</p>
                <p>XIV. <hi rend="italic">Central American Races. —</hi> Like the foregoing, this is
                    a geographical grouping, with one wide-spread linguistic and ethnical family,
                    the <hi rend="italic">Maya-Quiché</hi> of Yucatan and Guatemala with an outlying
                    branch in Vera Cruz and Tamaulipas. Of this family the chief members are the <hi
                    rend="italic">Maya,</hi> still generally current in Yucatan; <hi rend="italic"
                    >Zendal</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Zotzil</hi> of Chiapas; <hi rend="italic"
                    >Mam</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Pokomam</hi> of Vera Paz, Guatemala; <hi
                    rend="italic">Huastec</hi> of Vera Cruz and Tamaulipas; <hi rend="italic"
                    >Totonac</hi> of Vera Cruz; <hi rend="italic">Quiehé,</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Chol,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Zuiugil</hi> of Guatemala. The Mayas, like the
                    Aztecs, possessed a writing system, of which three documents still survive,—the
                    Dresden Codex, published in Lord Kingsborough’s collection as an Aztec MS., the
                    Mexican MS., No. 2 of the Paris National Library, and the Troano MS. in Madrid.
                    Bishop Landa even credited them with the invention of an alphabet; but all
                    attempts to interpret these documents by the key left by him have hitherto
                    failed.</p>
                <p>In Nicaragua and Honduras, besides the Aztec Niquiran, Squiβr <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Nicaragua,</hi> ii. p. 308) reckons three distinct linguistic groups :—</p>
                <p>1. <hi rend="italic">Melchora,</hi> including the wâlwa, Rama, Toac&lt;τ,
                    P&lt;&gt;ya, and waikna or Mosco (Mosquito), collectively known as Bravos, pi
                    obably of Carib stock, but with a mixture of Negro blood. 2. <hi rend="italic"
                    >Chorontega,</hi> including the Dirian, between Lake Nicaragua and the Pacific;
                    Nagrandan, north of the Dirian; Orotinan, about the Gulf of Nicoya. 3. <hi
                    rend="italic">Chondal,</hi> Chondales highlands, north and east side of Lake
                    Nicaragua.</p>
                <p>In Costa Rica and the peninsula of Panama there are a multiplicity of
                    unclassified tribes, amongst whom are current at least five stock languages
                    :—</p>
                <p>(1) <hi rend="italic">Doracho of</hi> Veraguas; (2) <hi rend="italic"
                    >Savaneric</hi>; (3) <hi rend="italic">Bayano,</hi> Rio Chapo, Pacific coast;
                    (4) <hi rend="italic">Manzanillo</hi> (San Bias), Atlantic coast, Costa Rica;
                    (5) <hi rend="italic">Bribri,</hi> a Costa Rica dialect, has been compared, but
                    on slender grounds, with some west African tongues.</p>
                <p>XV. <hi rend="italic">New Granada and Guiana Races.—</hi> The confusion of tribes
                    is continued southwards into the Colombian and Venezuelan Cordilleras; but, as
                    we proceed eastwards along the Orinoco plains and through the Guianas, greater
                    order seems to prevail. In New Granada itself there is at least one marked
                    ethnical and linguistic group, the <hi rend="italic">Chibcha</hi> or <hi
                    rend="italic">Muisca</hi> of Bogota, a civilized people, noted for their
                    remarkable taste and skill in the execution of gold ornaments. Some of these
                    works recently discovered and exhibited by Mr Powles at a meeting of the
                    Anthropological Institute, London, excited universal surprise and admiration.
                    This little known but extremely interesting people formed an important link in
                    the chain of civilized and agricultural nations stretching along the western
                    uplands from the New Mexican Pueblos, through the Aztecs of Mexico, Mayas of
                    Yucatan, Dorachqs of Veraguas, Chibchas of Bogota, and Peruvian Quichuas, to the
                    Àymaras of Bolivia. Elsewhere in New Granada the tribes are almost past
                    counting. In the southern province of Popayan alone ninety-four distinct
                    languages were reckoned at the time of the conquest; and, although most of these
                    are extinct, the unclassified races both here and in the north are still very
                    numerous. The only large linguistic group is that of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Salivi,</hi> including the Betois, Eles, Yaruras, Atures (extinct), Quaquas,
                    Macos, and others about the western head-streams of the Orinoco and in the
                    Popayan highlands. Further east is the <hi rend="italic">Barré</hi> family,
                    including the Maypuri, Baniwa, Achegua, and many others in Venezuela and Guiana,
                    besides some tribes as far south as Moxos in Bolivia. From the recent
                    ethnological researches of Everard F. im Thum <hi rend="italic">(British Guiana
                    Museum,</hi> Georgetown, 1878), there appear to be at least four independent
                    linguistic groups in the Guianas <hi rend="italic">JVarau</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">Araιcack</hi> in the coast region, <hi rend="italic">Wapiana</hi>
                    or <hi rend="italic">Wapisana,</hi> with <hi rend="italic">Atorais,</hi> in the
                    savannah region, and <hi rend="italic">Carib</hi> everywhere. At the time of the
                    discovery the Caribs represented the conquering element in the West Indies,
                    whence they have since disappeared, unless a few survive in Dominica (Vivien de
                    Saint Martin). But they are still numerous, either pure or mixed with Negroes
                    and others, from Honduras round the coast to the Amazon delta. They are
                    represented in French Guiana chiefly by the <hi rend="italic">Galibi, Oyapok,
                    Emerillon, Nuragwe,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Rucuycnnes,</hi> the
                    last-mentioned on both sides of the Tumac-Humac range (Dr J. Ore vaux in <hi
                    rend="italic">Tour du Monde,</hi> June 28, 1879). In British Guiana the Carib
                    tribes are the <hi rend="italic">Ackawais</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >Caribisi</hi> of the coast and forest regions, the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Arecumas</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Macusis</hi> of the savannah region. On the
                    upper Orinoco are the <hi rend="italic">Carinas</hi> or <hi rend="italic"
                    >Calinas</hi>; in Dutch Guiana the <hi rend="italic">Kirikiricots, Acuria,
                    Saramacca, Aukan,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Mataarie;</hi> in Brazilian Guiana
                    the <hi rend="italic">Pianghottos,Parechi, Daurais</hi> (extinct ?), <hi
                    rend="italic">Mandaucas, Masacas;</hi> in Venezuela the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Tivcri∙ gates, Guaraunos,</hi><hi rend="italic">Guayanas,</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Tamanacs, Avarigotes, Acherigotes, Piritus, Palβncas, Chacopatas,</hi> and many
                    others. On the affinities of the Carib race great uncertainty prevails, some
                    regarding them as an independent stock, some tracing them across the islands to
                    the Allighewis or Alleghans, who are supposed to have been driven by the
                    Algonquins from the Mississippi regions in the 10th century, while others, with
                    D’Orbigny <hi rend="italic">(L'homme Américain,</hi> vol. ii.), affiliate them
                    with some show of probability to the Guaranis of Brazil.</p>
                <p>XVI. <hi rend="italic">Peruvian and Bolivian Races.—</hi> Here the grouping is
                    strictly ethnical and linguistic in the Cordilleras and upland plateaus, which
                    are mainly occupied by one great historical and civilized race, with two
                    well-defined branches— <hi rend="italic">Quichua</hi> of Peru and <hi
                    rend="italic">Aymara</hi> of Bolivia. Underthe Incas Quichua, one of the most
                    highly cultivated but also one of the harshest of American tongues, was current
                    along both sides of the Cordilleras, from Quito on the equator southwards to the
                    Araucanian domain about 30° S., but interrupted between 13° and 20° S. by the
                    Aymara, which, like the northern Quiteno, seems to be an older and ruder form of
                    the common stock language. Still more primitive forms were probably the extinct
                    <hi rend="italic">Cara</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Puruha</hi> of Ecuador. But in
                    this northern province, which was the last added to the empire (under the
                    twelfth Inca Huaina-capac), there were said to be at the conquest forty other
                    nations, speaking as many distinct languages, with three hundred different
                    dialects. Of these a considerable number still people the banks of the Yapura,
                    Pulumayo, Pastassa, Napo, and other northwestern head-streams of the Amazons,
                    the most noteworthy being the <hi rend="italic">Jivaros</hi> of the Pastassa,
                    the <hi rend="italic">Zapâros</hi> of the upper Napo, the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Anguteras</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Orejoncs</hi> of the lower Napo, the <hi
                    rend="italic">Colorados</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Capayas</hi> of the uplands
                    east of Quito, and the <hi rend="italic">Copanes</hi> of the upper Aguarico. The
                    secret language of the Incas was apparently the Aymara of Lake Titicaca, the
                    cradle of their race; and remotely connected with the same branch are probably
                    the Olipe or Atacameno, between 19° and 22° S., and the Chango, between 22° and
                    24° S., although R. A. Philippi <hi rend="italic">(Reise durch</hi><hi

                <p>As we descend to the Bolivian lowlands, the confusion of races reaches its climax
                    in the provinces of Moxos, Chiquitos, and Gran Chaco. Notwithstanding the
                    disappearance of many tribes in recent years, E. D. Matthews <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Up the Amazon and Madeira,</hi> 1879) still found in the Beni Missions, Moxos,

                    >Banres—</hi> “each having a language of its own.” But the Baures would seem to
                    be a branch of the Mojenos, who are again affiliated to the ∆laypuri of the
                    Barre family (see XV.). Other nations in Moxos with distinct speech are the <hi

                    >Pacaguaras</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Itenes</hi> in the north.</p>
                <p>Chiquitos is occupied by eleven distinct nations, all speaking radically
                    different languages, but presenting a uniform physical type:— <hi rend="italic"
                    >Chiqu,itos</hi> in the centre; <hi rend="italic">Samucus, Guravcs,

                    originally in the south-east; <hi rend="italic">Saraνecas, Otukcs, Curwminacas,
                    Covarecas, Curucanecas,</hi> in the north-east; and <hi rend="italic"
                    >Paiconecas</hi> in the north-west. The language of the Chiquitos, of whom there
                    are endless subdivisions, is one of the richest and most widely diffused in
                    South America, serving, like the Tupi in the east, as a sort of lingua franca in
                    the Bolivian lowlands and the northern parts of Gran Chaco. The numerous tribes
                    of this latter region seem to form an ethnical group related to the Chiquitos
                    peoples, and like them speaking a great variety of distinct languages. The
                    greatest confusion still prevails as to their mutual relations; but the main
                    linguistic groups seem to be the <hi rend="italic">Mocobi-Toba</hi> of the
                    Salado and Vermejo rivers; the <hi rend="italic">Matagιιaya,</hi> including the

                    the Pilcomayo and Vermejo; the <hi rend="italic">Abipone,</hi> on the right bank
                    of the Parana, between 28°-30° S.; and the so-called <hi rend="italic"
                    >Lengua</hi> (properly <hi rend="italic">Jwiaje)</hi> in the centre of Gran
                    Chaco, surrounded by Mocobi tribes. Here were also the extinct <hi rend="italic"
                    >Guaycurus</hi> (probably akin to the Tobas), noted for their skill in
                    horsemanship. Hence the term Guaycuru came to be applied generally to all the
                    mounted Indians of Gran Chaco, and, though no longer the name of any particular
                    tribe, it continues to figure in ethnographic works as a racial designation,
                    increasing the confusion in a region already overburdened with obsolete or
                    erroneous ethnical nomenclature.</p>
                <p>XVII. <hi rend="italic">Brazilian Races.—</hi> Here the grouping, with one great
                    exception, is still mainly geographical. The exception is the widespread <hi
                    rend="italic">Tupi-Guarani</hi> ethnical and linguistic family, rivalling in
                    extent the Athabascan and Algonquin of the northern continent, and including,
                    besides a great part of Brazil, all Paraguay, about half of Uruguay, large
                    enclaves in Bolivia, and, if the Carib is to be regarded as a branch, nearly all
                    the Guianas and Venezuela. Of this race the two main divisions are the <hi
                    rend="italic">Guarani,</hi> from about the neighbourhood of Monte Video to Goyaz
                    south and north, and stretching west and east from the Paraguay to the Atlantic,
                    and the <hi rend="italic">Tupi</hi> thence northwards to the Amazon and Rio
                    Negro. The southern division may be regarded as nearly compact, but the northern
                    everywhere encloses a number of races apparently of different stocks, while
                    along the Amazon and its great tributaries the tribes are as numerous as they
                    are diverse in speech and often in physique. Over 15 distinct peoples are
                    mentioned on the Xinga river alone, 20 on the Tapajoz, as many on the Ucayali,
                    50 on the Japura. R. S. Clough <hi rend="italic">(The Amazons,</hi> 1872) gives
                    lists of 33 on the Purus, and of 37 on the Naupes, a tributary of the Rio Negro;
                    over 100 different dialects are current on the Rio Negro itself (Martius), and
                    as many as 234 tribal names occur in Milliet de Saint-Adolphe’s <hi

                <p>XVIII. <hi rend="italic">Austral Races.—</hi> These occupy four geographical
                    areas, to which correspond four distinct ethnical and linguistic groups :—</p>
                <p>1. <hi rend="italic">Auca or Araucanian,</hi> Chilian and Patagonian Cordilleras;
                    type very uniform, and by DOrbigny affiliated to the Peruvian; speech entirely
                    distinct from all others, and spoken with little dialectic variety throughout
                    the whole area. The numerous branches are generally indicated by a geographical
                    terminology, as <hi rend="italic">Picunche,</hi> “northern people,” <hi
                    rend="italic">Puelchc,</hi> “eastern people, <hi rend="italic">'</hi><hi
                    rend="italic superscript"> ,</hi><hi rend="italic">Huilliche,</hi> “southern
                    people,” &amp;c., the final syllable <hi rend="italic">ehe</hi> signifying
                    “people.” But the official Chilian divisions are :— <hi rend="italic">(a)
                    Moluche,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Arribanos, i.e.,</hi> “highlanders,” and <hi
                    rend="italic">Abajinos</hi> or “lowlanders,” between rivers Malleco and Cautin;
                    <hi rend="italic">(b) Lavquenche</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Cosiinos, i.e.,</hi>
                    “coast people,” between rivers Lebu and Imperial; (c) <hi rend="italic"
                    >Huilliche,</hi> or “southerners,” in two divisions, south of rivers Cautin and
                    Tolten. Total population, 24,360 unmixed Araucanians (Edouard Sève, <hi
                    rend="italic">Le Chili tel qu’il est,</hi> Valparaiso, 1876).</p>
                <p>2. <hi rend="italic">Puclche,</hi> occupying the Pampas region from the Saladillo
                    to the Rio Negro; hence known to the Spaniards as the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Pampas</hi> Indians. <hi rend="italic">Puelche</hi> or eastern people is their
                    Araucanian name, answering to the Patagonian <hi rend="italic">Y</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">once</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Penck.</hi> There is great
                    uniformity of type and speech, the latter, like Araucanian, being distinct from
                    all others. No well-recognized tribal divisions exist. The race is dying out or
                    becoming absorbed in the general mass of the Argentine population.</p>
                <p>3. <hi rend="italic">Patagonian,</hi> the <hi rend="italic">Tehuelche,
                    Chιιelche,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Huilliche (i.e.,</hi> “southerners ”) of
                    the Araucanians; national name <hi rend="italic">Tsoneca;</hi> area, Patagonia
                    from the Rio Negro to Magellan Strait, and from the Cordilleras to the Atlantic.
                    This is the tallest race on the globe, with mean height 5 feet 11 inches
                    (Topinard, <hi rend="italic">Anthropology,</hi> p. 320), and otherwise differing
                    widely from all the American types, with which they have nothing in common
                    except the structure of the hair and the polysynthetic form of their speech. The
                    present race again seems distinct from the prehistoric in this region as
                    represented by the skulls recently found by Moreno at El Carmen on the Rio
                    Negro. These are highly dolichocephalous, whilst Dr A. Weissbach <hi
                    rend="italic">(Zeitschr. far Ethnologic,</hi> 1877, p. 8) represents the modern
                    Tehuelches as amongst the most brachycephalous on the globe, approaching in this
                    respect nearest to the chimpanzee type.</p>
                <p>4. <hi rend="italic">Fuegians,</hi> the <hi rend="italic">Pescherais</hi> of some
                    writers, Tierra del Fuego; no recognized collective national or tribal names;
                    one ethnical type, entirely different from the Patagonian, and by DOrbigny
                    allied to the Araucanian; two apparently distinct languages, a northern and a
                    southern variety, with no known affinities to any on the mainland or elsewhere.
                    They probably occupy the lowest scale of culture in the American division of
                    mankind,—in this respect corresponding to the Negritos and Bushmen of the
                    eastern hemisphere.</p>

                <p>It is only very recently that the number of Indians on the North American
                    continent has come to be known with any degree of accuracy. The best estimates
                    at present accessible, based on the reports of Indian agents and on the United
                    States census for 1880, give the total number in the United States as 303,248.
                    The number in British North America is estimated, more roughly, at 103,969,
                    making a total for the continent, north of Mexico, of 407,217. The following
                    table, which is compiled from the census returns for 1880, and from the reports
                    for 1879 of the superintendents of Indian affairs for the United States and for
                    the British Possessions, may be relied on as approximately correct :—</p>

                <p>The popular idea has always been that these races are fast disappearing, and that
                    their total extinction is merely a question of time. This conclusion has
                    recently been called in question by Colonel Garrick Mallory, of the United
                    States army, in a paper read before the American Association for the Advancement
                    of Science. From the evidence he presents it appears that, while many tribes
                    have decreased in number, and some have even become extinct, others have
                    increased very decidedly, leading to the probable conclusion that the Indian
                    population of North America as a whole has not decreased greatly since the
                    earliest occupation of the country by Europeans. It is at least certain that the
                    Indians have been brought under various influences which tend to prolong and
                    preserve life. The murderous inter-tribal wars have ceased; the people are now
                    better housed, clothed, and fed; many of them have regular avocations; and they
                    have medical attendance when sick.</p>
                <p>The general policy of the United States Government, in its management of the
                    Indian tribes within its borders, has been to treat with them as separate but
                    subject principalities. It thus makes treaties with the different tribes,
                    purchases land from them, &amp;c. Its policy further is to place all the tribes
                    upon reservations, whence they are prohibited from wandering, and which are
                    forbidden ground to whites, thus isolating them from the rest of mankind. In
                    return for land ceded by them to the United States most of the tribes receive
                    yearly grants, which are paid in the form of supplies of food, clothing, arms,
                    and ammunition. Under such conditions, the experiment of civilizing them is
                    being attempted,—in the case of some tribes with success, in others, thus far,
                    with utter failure. As, however, all stimulus to self support is wanting, it
                    seems surprising that any tribe should have made perceptible advance at all, and
                    the progress attained is therefore encouraging for future effort. The policy of
                    the Dominion Government is almost precisely similar to that of the United
                    States, but the results are very different in the two countries. While the
                    United States have had almost continual trouble with their aboriginal
                    inhabitants, Canada has had no Indian difficulties of importance. This is due in
                    part to a difference in the practical working out of the policy, but more to
                    differences in environment. The Indian service of the Dominion Government is
                    composed of a trained body of men, who remain in it through life, who thoroughly
                    understand the Indian character, and who become known and trusted by their
                    charges. The members of the United States Indian service, on the other hand, are
                    appointed by political or church influence, and are in many cases unfit for the
                    work; they are changed also as the balance of political power passes from one
                    party to another. The Dominion has always fulfilled the conditions of its
                    treaties, and has always administered punishment promptly and severely when the
                    necessity arose. The United States have broken treaty after treaty, or have
                    neglected to fulfil their obligations to such an extent that most tribes no
                    longer have confidence in the promises of the Government. In cases of outrages
                    by Indians, it has, as a rule, been very slow and dilatory in punishment.</p>
                <p>But undoubtedly the principal reason for the immunity the British Possessions
                    have hitherto enjoyed from Indian wars lies in the fact that the Indians have
                    not yet been crowded by the whites. While the area is larger than that of the
                    United States, the Indian population is but about two-fifths as great, and the
                    whites are but one-tenth. The Indians still hold their favourite hunting and
                    fishing grounds; the game and fish have not yet sensibly decreased; and the
                    whites do not yet so press upon them as to arouse their jealousy and suspicion.
                    The history of the Indian tribes in the United States, from the time of the
                    first occupation of the country by the whites, has been one of forced
                    migrations, always westward, to make way for the repeated encroachments of
                    civilization. As the result of a succession of disastrous wars and forced
                    treaties, nearly all the aboriginal population formerly living east of the
                    Mississippi has either been destroyed or removed beyond that river In the
                    British Possessions they have been more fortunate. The first settlements in the
                    provinces were made by the French, who associated freely with the natives,
                    intermarrying to a large extent. This produced a bond of union between them, the
                    effects of which, in both peoples, are to be seen to the present day. The
                    country being still but thinly peopled, the necessity for removing the Indians,
                    in large numbers, has not yet arisen J and their treatment by the Dominion
                    Government has been more humane and just than in the United States. In
                    consequence of all this, most of them remain in or near their original homes.
                    Excepting those tribes which have <pb break="no"

                    few, if any, have engaged in war against the whites. As long as the western
                    country was the domain of the Hudson’s Bay Company the interests of the traders
                    were, to a large extent, identical with those of the natives. The Company
                    furnished a ready market for furs and pelts, of which the Indians were quick to
                    avail themselves; indeed, although it supported a large number of French
                    trappers, by far its principal business was done with the natives.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Indians in the Dominion of Canada.</hi> —The general
                    distribution of the tribes of the British Possessions is as follows. In the
                    province of Ontario are found parts of the Six Nations, Wyandots, Chippewas,
                    Minsees, Mississauguas, and others of Algonquin stock. In the province of Quebec
                    are another part of the famous Six Nations, besides Abenakis, Montagnais,
                    Milicetes, Micmacs, and other smaller tribes. In Nova Scotia and Prince Edward’s
                    Island are Micmacs, in New Brunswick a part of the same tribe and a few of the
                    Milicetes. In Manitoba and North-West Territory, the Chippewas, Crees,
                    Blackfeet, and Dakotas make up the aboriginal population. The Athabasca district
                    is peopled by the Crees, Assiniboines, Chippewyans, and Beavers; while British
                    Columbia and Rupert’s Land contain a great number of small tribes, too numerous
                    to be mentioned here.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Indians of the United States.</hi> —Of the numerous and
                    powerful tribes which inhabited New England at the time of its first settlement,
                    but few fragments remain.</p>
                <p>A remnant of the once powerful <hi rend="italic">Penobscot</hi> tribe is settled
                    at Oldtown on the Penobscot river, in Maine, and in other parts of that State
                    and in Massachusetts, and fragments of other tribes still exist.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Pequod</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Mohegan</hi> tribes were
                    amongst the largest and most powerful. Their range was central Massachusetts and
                    Connecticut. During the settlement of those States, these Indians were removed
                    to westeπr New York, where they rapidly became civilized and prosperous. But in
                    1857, their land being wanted, they were removed to Wisconsin, and placed on a
                    poor reservation there. They now number barely one hundred men, women, and
                    children.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Delawares,</hi> when first discovered by the whites, were
                    living on the banks of the Delaware river. Early in the 17th century the Dutch
                    commenced trading with them, under friendly relations. Subsequently William Penn
                    bought large tracts of land from them, moving the Indians inland. A war followed
                    this purchase, the Delawares alleging they had been defrauded, but, with the
                    assistance of the Six Nations, the whites forced them back west of the
                    Alleghanies. In 1789 they were placed on a reservation in Ohio, and
                    subsequently, in 1818, were moved to Missouri. Various removals followed, until,
                    in 1866, they accepted lands in severalty, in the Indian Territory, and gave up
                    the tribal relation. They are now living in civilized fashion, and nave become
                    useful and prosperous citizens. Their number is now between 1000 and 1100.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Iroquois,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Six Nations.—</hi> This
                    powerful and celebrated confederation was composed originally of five tribes
                    known as Mohawks, Oneidas, Onondagas, Senecas, and Cayugas. Later, the
                    Tuscaroras were admitted into the league, which was then called the “Six
                    Nations.” At that time their total number was estimated at 11,650, including
                    2150 warriors. They were unquestionably the most powerful confederation of
                    Indians on the continent. Their home was the central and western parts of New
                    York State. In the war of the American Revolution they fought on the side of the
                    English, and in the repeated battles their power was nearly destroyed. They are
                    now scattered about on various reservations in New York State, Indian Territory,
                    Wisconsin, and Canada. In 1870 they numbered altogether 13,669, having increased
                    decidedly since the close of the Revolution.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">JVyandots</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Hurons</hi> were an
                    Iroquois tribe which lived originally on the shore of Lake Huron. They served as
                    a shuttlecock between the Six Nations and the Sioux, being driven alternately
                    east and west by them, until the end of the last century. In 1832 they removed
                    to a reservation in Kansas. In 1855 many became citizens, while the small
                    remaining fragment of this once powerful tribe removed to Indian Territory.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Chippewas</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Ojibways.—</hi> This tribe,
                    of the Algonquin family, formerly ranged over most of Michigan, Wisconsin, and
                    Minnesota. They were constantly at war with the Dakotas and with their other
                    neighbours. They sided with the English in the Revolution and in the war of
                    1812. At present the tribe is divided upon thirteen reservations in the above
                    States, and is making gratifying progress in civilization. Their number is now
                    above 20,000.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Menominees,</hi> on the Menominee river, in Wisconsin, have
                    never been moved from their original habitat. They served with the French in the
                    war against the Foxes in 1712, and against the English up to 1763. During the
                    Revolution and the war of 1812 they sided with the English. They are now living
                    in a civilized manner, and are engaged very largely in lumbering. Their number
                    is now about 1445, and is said to be diminishing rapidly.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Miamis</hi> were first found in eastern Wisconsin, and were
                    estimated at 8000 in number. They were a warlike race, continually engaged in
                    broils with their neighbours, the Iroquois, Sioux, and French, in which they
                    lost heavily. In the Revolution and the war of 1812, like most of the Indian
                    tribes, they sided with the English. After the latter war they fought among
                    themselves, reducing their numbers greatly. The tribe has now almost entirely
                    disappeared, a few families only remaining, scattered over Indian Territory and
                    Kansas.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Ottawas</hi> lived originally on the northern shore of the
                    upper peninsula of Michigan. In 1650 they were driven by the Iroquois beyond the
                    Mississippi, only to be forced back by the Dakotas. Then they settled at
                    Mackinaw, and joined the French in their operations against the English. During
                    the Revolution they sided with the English. Most of them were finally moved to
                    the Indian Territory, where they now are, reduced to a mere handful.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Pottawattamies</hi> occupied a part of the lower peninsula
                    of Michigan, whence they were driven into Wisconsin by the more powerful
                    Iroquois. They were allied with the French in their wars against the Iroquois,
                    and took part in Pontiac’s conspiracy. In the wars between the colonists and the
                    mother country they took the part of the latter. In 1838 most of them were
                    removed to a reservation in Kansas. Of these the larger proportion have
                    abandoned the tribal relation, and become citizens. Of the others, some are in
                    Kansas, upwards of 300 are in Indian Territory, while the remainder are
                    wanderers.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Seminales</hi> are a tribe of the Muskogee family; they
                    originally inhabited the peninsula of Florida. About 1842, after a very
                    disastrous war with the whites, lasting seven years,' nearly all of them were
                    removed to the Indian Territory, where they are now settled, are civilized, and
                    are succeeding in the cultivation of the soil. They number about 2500.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Creeks</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Muskogees</hi> formed the
                    most powerful tribe of the Muskogee family; they originally occupied a large
                    part of Georgia, Alabama, and Florida. During the Revolution they fought against
                    the colonists. A few years later they broke out again, but received a severe
                    chastisement. Subsequently nearly all of them were removed to the Indian
                    Territory, where they have made great progress in civilization and material
                    prosperity. During the late civil war they were divided, part adhering to the
                    Union and part joining the Confederacy. At present they number about 14,000.</p>

                    possess fine physique, great personal courage, and great skill in warfare.
                    Though backward in adopting civilization, their intellectual powers contrast
                    very favourably with those of most other tribes. The nation numbers 30,000 to
                    35,000 souls, divided into twenty-one bands or subtribes more or less
                    independent of one another. At present they range over most of the unsettled
                    portion of Dakota, eastern Montana, and north-eastern Wyoming, their
                    reservations amounting altogether to 108,450 square miles. Until within a very
                    recent period most of the bands of this tribe have resisted all efforts for
                    civilizing them. At present, however, several of the bands are settling down to
                    agricultural labour. Their history has, from the first, been one of war, their
                    name a terror to their Indian neighbours as well as to the whites. Originally
                    their range extended as far east as the State of Wisconsin, and thence west to
                    the Rocky Mountains, its present limit. On the east they encountered the
                    Chippewas, who at that time formed a powerful tribe, fully able to cope with
                    them: By them the Sioux were driven back into Minnesota, after long continued
                    warfare. In 1862 the bands inhabiting Minnesota fell upon the white settlers,
                    and a terrible massacre ensued. The result of this was the removal of these
                    bands from the State to Dakota, where they were placed upon reservations. The
                    bands inhabiting the country farther west have been to a greater or less extent
                    almost continually at war with the whites until 1877; and for many years the
                    protection of the border settlements required the constant presence of large
                    bodies of troops. In 1875 and 1876 the chief, Sitting Bull, at the head of a
                    large body of warriors, maintained a successful resistance against all the
                    troops which could be brought against him, and finally escaped across the
                    boundary line into the British Possessions, with the bulk of Ins followers. <hi

                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Arapahoes</hi> originally ranged over the central portion
                    of the plains between the Platte and Arkansas. This is a brave, warlike,
                    predatory tribe. With the Sioux and Cheyennes, with whom they have ever been on
                    terms of friendship, they have waged unremitting warfare upon the Utes. From
                    timeto time, also, the border settlements have received hostile attentions from
                    them. The southern bands of the tribe have a large reservation in the western
                    part of Indian Territory, while the northern bands have been placed on the
                    reservation of the Shoshones in western Wyoming.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Cheyennes</hi> are a tribe of the Algonquin family, which
                    originally lived on the Cheyenne river, a branch of the Red River of the North,
                    in Dakota. Driven westward by the Dakotas, they were found by early explorers at
                    the eastern base of the Black Hills, in Dakota. Subsequently part of them moved
                    south, and allied <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0912-0857-0832"/> themselves with the Arapahoes. Within a few years
                    they have all been collected on a reservation in the western part of the Indian
                    Territory. Their whole history has been a series of wars against their red
                    neighbours and the whites. They are a large, powerful, athletic race, mentally
                    superior to most of the other tribes. Their occupations are war and hunting.
                    Thus far they have made little or no progress in civilization. They number about
                    3600.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Arikarees, Gros Ventres,</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >Mandans</hi> are three tribes which inhabit a permanent village at Fort
                    Berthold, Dakota, on the Missouri. They have a partial civilization of their
                    own, not acquired from intercourse with whites. They live in houses made of
                    wood, covered and thatched with earth and straw. For sustenance they depend
                    largely upon the produce of agricultural labour. Their total number is probably
                    about 2000, the Arikarees being the largest tribe, and the Mandans the smallest.
                    The Arikarees, Arikaras, or Rees, as the name is variously rendered, originally
                    lived in the Platte valley, in Nebraska, with the Pawnees, to whom they are
                    related. Within the present century they have made their way northward to their
                    present location. The Mandans were first found living on the Missouri, at the
                    mouth of Heart river, while the Gros Ventres, or Minnetaτees, occupied three
                    small villages at the mouth of Knife river. These three tribes were decimated by
                    the small-pox in 1837, shortly after which event they joined together in one
                    village at their present location.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Sacs</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Foxes,</hi> now one tribe,
                    located in Indian Territory, were originally separate, living near Green Bay,
                    Wisconsin. Driven on before the westward march of civilization, they moved first
                    to Iowa, then to Missouri, and finally to their present location. A few still
                    remain in Iowa, Nebraska, and Kansas.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Shawnees</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Shawanoes,</hi> supposed
                    to have been primarily a part of the Kickapoo tribe, were first found in
                    Wisconsin. Moving eastward, they came in contact with the Iroquois, by whom they
                    wpre driven south into Tennessee. Thence they crossed the mountains into South
                    Carolina, and spread northward as far as New York and southward to Florida.
                    Subsequently they drifted northward, again came in contact with the Iroquois,
                    and were driven over into Ohio. They joined in Pontiac’s conspiracy, and during
                    the Revolution fought under the English flag. After the latter war they
                    commenced migrating westward, and finally accepted homes in Indian Territory,
                    where they now are. In 1854 most of them abandoned tribal relations, and divided
                    their lands in severalty. They are now in a civilized and prosperous
                    condition.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Grows</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Upsarokas</hi> are a branch
                    of the Dakota family occupying at present a large reservation in southern
                    Montana, south and east of the Yellowstone river. Thejr original range included
                    this reservation, and extended eastward and southward, while from their forays
                    ħo part of the country for many hundreds of miles around was safe. A cowardly
                    tribe, they have ever been noted as marauders and horse stealers. Though they
                    have generally been crafty enough to avoid open war with the whites, they have
                    not scrupled to rob them whenever opportunity offered. Physically they are tall
                    and athletic, with very dark complexions. Their number is about 4200. They have
                    made-little if any progress in civilization, preferring to be supported by the
                    Government.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Osages</hi> were first found on the lower Missouri, whence
                    they moved south to the Arkansas, and shortly after became allies of the French.
                    After the usual succession of treaties and removals, they finally found
                    themselves in Indian Territory, where they are now fast reaching a condition of
                    self-support. They number about 2100 souls.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Kaw</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Kansas</hi> tribe was
                    originally an offshoot from the Osages. Their original home was in Missouri,
                    whence they were driven to Kansas by the Dakotas. They were moved from one
                    reservation to another, until finally they were placed in Indian Territory,
                    where they are rapidly becoming civilized. They numbered 360 souls in 1879.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">JVinnebagoes</hi> are a branch of the Dakota family. At the
                    time of the advent of the whites they formed the vanguard of the eastward
                    migration of the Dakotas, and were living about Winnebago Lake and Green Bay in
                    Wisconsin. They took up arms on the side of the French in the Franco-English
                    wars, on the side of the English in the Revolution and the war of 1812. In 1820
                    they numbered about 4500, and inhabited their original home. A series of
                    treaties followed, by which they were moved no less than six times, occupying
                    reservations in various parts of Minnesota and Dakota. At present they are on
                    the Omaha reservation in eastern Nebraska, and are prospering.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Otoes</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Missouries,</hi> which now
                    form one tribe, under the former name, are a branch of the great Dakota family.
                    They were early allies of the French. They now inhabit a small reservation in
                    Nebraska, where they are making gratifying progress. They number but 457.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">0mahas</hi> were found on St Peter’s river, in Minnesota,
                    where they lived an agricultural life, supporting themselves from the soil.
                    After a fatal visitation of the small-pox, which reduced their numbers terribly,
                    they abandoned their village, and wandered westward to the Niobrara river in
                    Nebraska. After a succession of treaties and removals, they are now located on a
                    reservation in eastern Nebraska, where they are rapidly improving in
                    civilization and pecuniary resources. They numbered 1100 in 1878.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Poncas</hi> were originally part of the Omaha tribe, with
                    whom they lived near the Red River of the North. They shared the common fate of
                    the weaker tribes in this part of the country, being driven westward by the
                    Dakotas. They halted on the Ponca river in Dakota, and there held their ground,
                    but suffered severely from their hereditary enemies. After a succession of
                    treaties and removals, they were placed on a reservation at the mouth of the
                    Niobrara, where they took lands in severalty, and were prospering greatly, when
                    they were forced to give up their lands and improvements and remove to Indian
                    Territory. Naturally they were extremely dissatisfied with this change, and in
                    1878 a number of them left the reservation in Indian Territory and made their
                    way back to the Omahas, their former neighbours. They were arrested for leaving
                    the reservation, and were about to be returned to Indian Territory, when the
                    case was taken up by able lawyers, and after a long trial the Indians were set
                    free, it having been decided that they were United States citizens, and
                    therefore not to be confined on reservations. The whole history of the Poncas is
                    a tale of oppression by red men and white.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Pawnees</hi> were formerly a brave, warlike tribe, living
                    on the Platte river in Nebraska. Their history, until a recent date, is one of
                    almost constant warfare with the Dakotas. In 1823 their village was burned by
                    the Delawares, and shortly after the tribe lost heavily by the small-pox. In
                    1874 they moved to a reservation in Indian Territory, where they are making
                    gratifying progress. They number 1440.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Caddos,</hi> now located on a small reservation in Indian
                    Territory, are but the remnant of a large tribe that formerly ranged over the
                    Red River country, in Arkansas, northern Texas, and Indian Territory. They have
                    well-managed farms, and are noted for industry and intelligence. Their number is
                    543.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Shoshones</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Snakes</hi> are a tribe
                    inhabiting the country about the head of the Snake, Green, and Bighorn rivers,
                    in Wyoming, Idaho, and northern Nevada, and distributed mainly on four
                    reservations. They number about 6000. They are a mild, peaceful tribe, but until
                    within a recent period have been involved in almost constant defensive warfare
                    with their neighbours, the Crows and Blackfeet on the north, and the Cheyennes
                    and Arapahoes on the south. The history of their relations with the whites has
                    been one of almost unbroken peace.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Bannocks</hi> are a small tribe of the Shoshone family, in
                    the southern portion of Idaho. Their number is about 1000, divided between the
                    Fort Hall and the Lemhi reservations. They have generally been friendly with the
                    whites, although in 1866, and again in 1878, they broke out into hostilities.
                    Very little progress has been made by the tribe.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Kiowas</hi> are another tribe of the Shoshone family, a
                    wild, roving people, ranging over the country about the Arkansas and Canadian
                    rivers, in Indian Territory, Colorado, and New Mexico. Formerly their range was
                    very much less restricted, extending from the Platte to the Rio Grande. They
                    have the reputation of being brave warriors, but cruel and treacherous. In
                    recent years they have made repeated raids upon the settlers in western Texas,
                    which have been stopped by the imprisonment of their chief, Satanta. In 1869
                    they were placed on a reservation in the Indian Territory, which they appear to
                    use only as headquarters for r aids into the adjoining country. Their number is
                    given as 1138, but this is undoubtedly too small.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Ute</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Utah</hi> tribe, which is
                    composed of several bands, all acknowledging the authority of one head chief,
                    inhabits reservations in the western part of Colorado and eastern Utah. They
                    number about 4200. Averse to civilization, they have made little or no progress.
                    They originally inhabited the whole mountain region of Colorado and northern New
                    Mexico, whence they made inroads on the plains in pursuit of buffalo, and of
                    their hereditary enemies the Sioux, the Cheyennes, and the Arapahoes. Their
                    intercourse with the whites has been, almost without exception, characterized by
                    friendship. The recent outbreak of the White River band, in 1879, is almost the
                    only case on record. The rapid settlement of the State has driven them westward,
                    and has deprived them of the fairest portion of their domain.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Apaches</hi> are a branch of the Athabasca family which has
                    wandered far from the parent region, and now range over large parts of New
                    Mexico and Arizona. It is a powerful, warlike tribe, at war with the whites
                    almost continually since the latter entered the country. A large part of the
                    tribe is on the Fort Stanton reservation in eastern New Mexico, while another
                    portion, under the chief Victoria, has for a long time been devastating the
                    border settlements of New Mexico. The Tonto-Apaches, collected in large numbers
                    on the San Carlos reservation in Arizona, where they are doing something at
                    farming, are of Yuma stock. Besides these, there are several bands of Apaches
                    scattered about on other reservations, or roaming without a fixed habitat,
                    swelling the total to about 10,600 souls.</p>

                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Navajoes</hi> are another tribe of the Athabascan group
                    which is far removed from the body of the family. They innabit the northern part
                    of Arizona and New Mexico, where they have a fine reservation. They have
                    considerable native civilization, not a few of them engaging in agriculture, and
                    in raising horses, sheep, and goats. They weave blankets, which are prized
                    highly throughout the south-west. They are a fine athletic race, and excellent
                    horsemen. While not an aggressive tribe, they have frequently been at war with
                    the whites. They number now 11,850.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Nez Percés,</hi> with the exception of a small portion in
                    Indian Territory, inhabit a reservation in northern Idaho, which includes a part
                    of their ancestral home. They are a fine race, physically and mentally. Until
                    1877 they had been at peace with the whites. In 1875, a portion of their
                    reservation having been taken from them, owing to the alleged fact that they had
                    not carried out the treaty stipulations, difficulties arose which, two years
                    later, brought on a rupture, and the famous “Nez Percés” war. The disaffected
                    portion of the tribe, numbering some 400 or 500, held out for several months
                    against all the force the Government could bring against them, but were finally
                    captured on the Sweet Grass Hills, in northern Montana. The malcontents were
                    then placed on a reservation in the Indian Territory.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Modocs</hi> are a small tribe, which lived in southern
                    Oregon. They are known mainly from their stubborn resistance to the United
                    States Government in 1872 and 1873, known as the Modoc war. This was caused by
                    an attempt to place them upon a reservation. After some preliminary fighting,
                    the Modocs retreated to the ‘ ‘ Lava Beds,” a basaltic region, seamed and
                    crevassed, and abounding in caves. Here they made a stand for several months
                    before they were finally subdued. During the war General Canby, commanding the
                    troops, and Dr Thomas, a peace commissioner, were treacherously massacred by
                    them while under a flag of truce. The leaders of this revolt were hanged, and
                    the remainder removed to Indian Territory.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Pimas, Papagoes,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Maricopas</hi>
                    form a semi-civilized community, living on a reservation on the Gila and Santa
                    Cruz rivers in Arizona. Originally they were distributed over the whole
                    south-western portion of that territory. Missions were established among them at
                    an early date by the Spanish Jesuits, and with very good success. At present
                    they are mainly self-supporting, while a large proportion of them wear citizens’
                    dress and live in houses. The three tribes now number 10,500.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Pacific Coast Indians.—</hi> The Indians upon and near the
                    Pacific coast are divided into a great number of small tribes. Speaking
                    generally, they are lower in the scale of humanity, both physically and
                    mentally, than those of the interior. In northern California, Oregon, and
                    Washington, their principal subsistence was, before the Government undertook
                    their support, the salmon, which in spring crowded the rivers. They are mostly
                    of a mild, peaceful disposition. The Indians of southern California were early
                    taken in charge by the Jesuit missionaries, who Christianized and partly
                    civilized them. Since the settlement of the State by Americans, they have,
                    through neglect, to a large extent relapsed and become worthless members of
                    society.</p>
                <p>The name <hi rend="italic">Pueblo</hi> (city) is used to designate a number of
                    tribes of town-building Indians in New Mexico. They resemble one another very
                    closely in their surroundings, and in their manners and customs; and their
                    history has been the same. Subdued by Coronado in 1540, they made a successful
                    revolt two years later, but were subdued again in 1586. In 1680 they made
                    another unsuccessful revolt. When the country was ceded to the United States in
                    1848, these Indians were recognized as citizens, and have since remained so.
                    Their houses are communal, generally but one structure for the whole village.
                    They are sometimes built of stone, but offener of adobe, several stories high,
                    each story receding from the one below. The common plan is a hollow square, or
                    curved figure, though in some cases the form of a pyramid is followed. Some of
                    the towns are built upon high mesas, almost inaccessible, obviously for purposes
                    of defence. These Indians retain their primitive form of government, each
                    village electing a governor and council. They cultivate the soil, raising grain
                    and vegetables for their own consumption, and keep large flocks of sheep and
                    goats. Their number is about 9000.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Moquis</hi> are a semi-civilized people living in seven
                    towns on the plateau in northern Arizona. Our first accounts of them date from
                    the expedition of Coronado in 1540. Their history is similar to that of the
                    town-building Indians of New Mexico, except that after a successful revolt
                    against the Spaniards, in 1680, they have remained independent. They are
                    kind-hearted and hospitable, cultivate the soil, raising grain and vegetables,
                    and possessing large flocks of sheep and goats. They weave very fine blankets,
                    an art which they have taught several neighbouring tribes. The houses are built
                    of stone, set in mortar, and for security are perched upon the summits of almost
                    inaccessible mesas. The Moquis numbered 1780 in 1878.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Indian Antiquities.</hi> —The ancient remains of the Indians
                    are coextensive with their occupancy of the country, but in general they teach
                    but little concerning their life in prehistoric times. The Atlantic and Gulf
                    coasts are lined with shell-heaps, indicating the sites of ancient villages.
                    Spear or arrow heads are often ploughed up all over the country, relics, it may
                    be, from some well-fought field.</p>
                <p>At the copper mines on the northern peninsula of Michigan, there are many
                    evidences that the Indians had been working. Excavations, some of considerable
                    depth, have been found, and in them stone hammers, evidently used in extracting
                    the native copper. Indeed, it is well known that this metal was a common article
                    of commerce among them.</p>
                <p>In the south-western territories, however, are found the most interesting remains
                    of this people, in the form of towns, some of great magnitude and extent, built
                    of stone set in mortar. These towns, which were evidently inhabited by a people
                    closely resembling the Moquis and Pueblos, are found in south-western Colorado
                    on the San Juan river and its branches, in north-western New Mexico, in
                    southeastern Utah, and over the greater part of Arizona. Certain regions appear
                    to have been very densely populated. The largest towns are built in exposed
                    situations, without special precautions for defence, and were plainly inhabited
                    by a mild agricultural race, who were enjoying a period of peace. Others are
                    perched upon high inaccessible mesas, with strong towers for defence and
                    observation, while others, “cave dwellings,” are merely walled-in niches in the
                    cliffs of the canons,—evidently the last refuge of a hunted, desperate people.
                    Everywhere in the neighbourhood of these ruins are vast quantities of fragments
                    of pottery, some of which is painted in the most elaborate designs. Wicker work
                    and arrow and spear heads are also found in abundance. These extensive ruins,
                    scattered over a large area of country, show that at some time in the past this
                    region, now arid and desert, supported a large population of a degree of
                    civilization fully equal to that of the Pueblos and Moquis of the present day,
                    and in all probability their ancestors. <hi rend="smallcaps">(h. g.*)</hi></p>
