                <p><label type="entry">INDIAN OCEAN</label>. This designation is given to the
                    portion of the oceanic area which extends northwards from the great southern
                    water-zone, between the eastern coast of South Africa and the western boundary
                    of the partially submerged Malayo-Australian continent. But whilst the Atlantic
                    and Pacific extensions from the southern waterzone—the one dividing South Africa
                    from South America, and the other forming the wide expanse of ocean between the
                    western coast of South America and the eastern side of the Malayo-Australian
                    continent—are prolonged into the land hemisphere as far as the north polar area,
                    the Indian Ocean does not extend itself northwards beyond the Tropic of Cancer,
                    where it is abruptly closed in by the great land mass of the Asiatic continent.
                    The north-western boundary of its basin is formed by the south-eastern coast of
                    Arabia, its north-eastern by the western coast of Burmah. But, between these two
                    parts of its border, its basin is encroached on by the southward projection of
                    the Indian peninsula, and is thus divided into two deep gulfs, of which the
                    western is distinguished as the Arabian Sea, and the eastern as the Bay of
                    Bengal. Now, looking to the fact that these gulfs must have been united, at no
                    remote period, by a transverse band of sea, covering what is now the continuous
                    alluvial plain of Northern India, we may consider the real northern border of
                    this basin to be the great Himalaya range, the southern slope of which must have
                    once formed its shore-line. It is remarkable that nearly the whole of its
                    land-border is of considerable elevation,—being formed on the west by the
                    mountainous ridge that flanks the great table-land of South Africa, on the
                    north-west by the corresponding ridge which forms the south-eastern border of
                    the elevated plateau of Arabia, whilst near its eastern margin there is a nearly
                    continuous mountain range, that extends southwards from Assam to the extremity
                    of the Malay Peninsula, and is thence prolonged through Sumatra and Java.</p>
                <p>The Indian Ocean has no definite southern limit, but is considered to terminate
                    at the parallel (about 38° S.) which stretches between the southernmost points
                    of the African and Australian continents,—near which, about midway between these
                    two extremes, lie the volcanic islands of St Paul and Amsterdam. And this seems
                    the natural border of its basin, the sea-bed (as will presently appear) showing
                    a distinct rise to the south of this parallel along a considerable part of it.
                    The Indian Ocean is often spoken of as divided by the equator into a northern
                    and a southern portion; and this division it will be convenient to adopt in the
                    description of its current-system.</p>

                <p><hi rend="italic">Depth and Islands.'</hi> —The main basin of the Indian Ocean
                    has an average depth of about 2500 fathoms, increasing to 3000 fathoms in the
                    angle between Java and north-western Australia, which is the deepest part of it
                    yet sounded. Its southern border is formed by a submarine plateau, which rises
                    in some parts to within 1500 fathoms of the surface, and which forms the common
                    foundation, not only of the islands already mentioned, but also of the Crozets,
                    the Kerguelen group, Prince Edward’s Islands, and the Heard Islands, all of
                    which seem to have had a volcanic origin. This plateau, however, does not shut
                    in the south-eastern portion of the basin; for a southward extension of the
                    depression already described follows the trend of the western and southern
                    coasts of Australia and the western coast of Tasmania, and is continuous with
                    the deep channel (in some parts exceeding 2500 fathoms) between Australia and
                    New Zealand. The western and north-western parts of the basin, on the other
                    hand—as the number of their island-groups would lead us to anticipate—have a
                    much less uniform depth. In the first place, the western border of the basin is
                    encroached on by the great island of Madagascar, which must be considered as an
                    outlying extension of the continental platform of South Africa, the Mozambique
                    channel being comparatively shallow; and, although the bottom, at no great
                    distance from its eastern coast, rapidly deepens to 2000 fathoms or more, yet
                    this is only in a channel that separates Madagascar from a platform .of about
                    half that depth, on which are based the volcanic Mascarene Islands (Mauritius,
                    Bourbon, and Rodriguez), and of which a northern extension forms the base of the
                    Seychelles group. This platform then curves to the south-west, so as to pass
                    round the north of Madagascar, forming the base of several coral islands, and
                    thus comes into continuity with the bed of the Mozambique Channel, from which
                    the Comoro group arises. To the north of this platform, the 2500 fathom line
                    follows the trend of the African coast as far as Cape Gardafui, keeping outside
                    the island of Socotra; and a bottom of more than 2000 fathoms (crossed by the
                    telegraph-cable between Aden and Bombay) extends into the Arabian Sea as far as
                    15° N. lat. On the eastern side of that gulf, however, the declivity from the
                    Indian coast-line to the deepest part of the basin is much more gradual; the
                    Maidive and Laccadive groups of coral islands rising from a comparative shallow,
                    which extends itself a little to the south of the equator. And about half way
                    between this platform and that of the Seychelles the bottom rises into the bank
                    which bears the Chagos archipelago, and which divides the communication between
                    the deeper portion of the general basin and that of the Arabian Sea into two
                    channels of no great width. Though the 2500 fathom line does not enter the Bay
                    of Bengal, a considerable portion of it has a depth exceeding 2000 fathoms.
                    Here, again, the declivity is more gradual along the eastern margin of the gulf;
                    and the Andaman and Nicobar Islands arise from a comparatively shallow platform
                    that stretches between the delta of the Irawadi and the north end of
                    Sumatra.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Surface and Bottom Temperature.—</hi> The surface-temperature
                    of the Indian Ocean is higher than that of either the Atlantic or the Pacific;
                    and this difference shows itself especially in its northern, division, on which
                    the proximity of tropical land exerts an important thermal influence. For the
                    mean annual temperature of the portion which lies between the equator and the
                    Tropic of Cancer, including the Arabian Sea and the Bay of Bengal, is
                    considerably above 80°, whilst that of the corresponding part of the southern
                    division—lying between the equator and the Tropic of Capricorn— ranges from 80°
                    to 70°, the average maximum temperature in the centre of the Arabian Sea being
                    87°. In July the thermal equator moves considerably to the north, and the
                    surface-temperature sometimes rises in the Arabian Gulf and the Bay of Bengal to
                    above 90°. In January, when the thermal equator lies to the south of the
                    geographical, the temperature of these two gulfs falls below 80“, while that of
                    the vast expanse which lies between the parallel of 10’ N. and 25° S., has a
                    temperature of 80° or upwards. In the southern hemisphere the January (summer)
                    isotherm of 70° and the July (winter) isotherm of 60° correspond pretty closely
                    with the border of the Indian Ocean,—the range of its temperature being thus
                    very moderate.</p>
                <p>The bathymetrical isotherms of the Indian Ocean have not yet been systematically
                    worked out by temperature-soundings; but there is adequate evidence of the
                    extension of the Antarctic underflow over the deeper portion of its sea-bed,
                    even to the north of the equator. For the “Hydra” line of soundings between Aden
                    and Bombay gave a bottom-temperature of 36° <hi rend="italic">'5</hi> at a depth
                    of 1800 fathoms, the surface-temperature being 75°, while in the deep depression
                    on the eastern side of the basin, almost immediately beneath the equator,
                    Commander Chimmo met with a bottom-temperature but little above 32°.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Surface-Level.—</hi> A very remarkable effect is produced upon
                    the coast-level of part of the northern division of the Indian Ocean, by the
                    attraction of the great mountain-masses and high table-lands of Central Asia,
                    uncompensated by that of any elevated land-mass to the southward, nearer than
                    that which may lie behind the Antarctic ice-barrier. From the results of the
                    great geodetical survey of India Archdeacon Pratt was able to deduce the veιy
                    remarkable fact that the level of the sea at the mouth of the Indus is no less
                    than 515 feet higher than at Cape Comorin.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    of the Indian Ocean is clearly dependent upon the winds which prevail over its
                    several parts,—the seasonal reversal of the monsoons in the northern part of its
                    area producing a corresponding modification in the direction of the
                    surface-movement of its water, whilst in the southern division the constancy of
                    the south-east trade-wind keeps up through the whole year a strong westerly
                    equatorial current. The north-east monsoon has, of course, while it lasts, the
                    same effect as a north-east tradewind would exert, in producing a general
                    south-westerly drift over the northern division of the Indian Ocean, which
                    manifests itself in a southerly flow along all the shores it meets, viz., the
                    southeast coast of the Indian peninsula, the south-east coast of Arabia, and the
                    east coast of Central Africa. Besides this, a special currentmovement is
                    produced by the action of the north-east monsoon on the surface-water of the
                    China Sea, by the drift of which to the south-west it is forced into the channel
                    between the Malay Peninsula and Sumatra, whence it issues into the Indian Ocean,
                    through the Strait of Malacca, as a current that crosses the Bay of Bengal and
                    impinges against the Coromandel coast of India. By this it is deflected
                    southwards, along with the general drift already mentioned, and then courses
                    round the southern angle of the great peninsula,— partly between Ceylon and the
                    mainland, and partly along the outer coast-line of Ceylon,—into the Arabian Sea,
                    where it merges into the general drift of the surface-water towards the African
                    coast. The average rate of this current, as it issues from the Strait of
                    Malacca, is 30 miles per day; along the south-east coast of India, <hi
                        rend="italic">24</hi> miles; on the east coast of Ceylon, 40 miles; and
                    along the Arabian coast, 18 miles. But when the north-east gives place to the
                    south-west monsoon, about the vernal equinox, the whole of this movement is
                    reversed. The drift then commences from the African and Arabian coasts, and sets
                    across the Arabian Sea, at the rate of about 24 miles a day, to the. Malabar
                    coast of India, along which a current flows in a southerly direction at the rate
                    of about <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit12newyrich/page/n847/mode/1up"
                        xml:id="kp-eb0912-0847-0822"/> 30 miles a day. This current rounds Cape
                    Comorin and the southern coast of Ceylon, where it sometimes attains the rate of
                    45 miles a day, and passes into the Bay of Bengal, reinforcing the general
                    north-east movement of its own water, circulating round the head of this gulf,
                    and then undergoing a deflexion by the coastline towards the entrance of the
                    Strait of Malacca, into which it flows at the rate of from 20 to 24 miles per
                    day. "When the sun crosses the equator towards the south at the autumnal
                    equinox, so that its heating power is exerted on South Africa, the indraught of
                    air towards that continent reproduces the north-east monsoon; and this restores
                    the westerly drift, which extends over the Indian Ocean as far as 5° S. lat.,
                    giving place at about that parallel to the equatorial counter-current.</p>
                <p>The surface of the southern Indian Ocean, between the parallel of 10° S. and the
                    Tropic of Capricorn (the precise limits varying with the season), is pretty
                    constantly traversed by the south-east trade-wind, which gives a steady westward
                    movement to its water, known as the south equatorial current, whose average rate
                    is about 14 miles per day. This meets the eastern coast of Madagascar, and that
                    of continental Africa to the north and south of it; and, its onward flow being
                    thus checked and deflected southwards by the trend of the land, it forms a
                    strong current which sets along the Natal coast towards Cape Colony. The
                    strength of this current varies according as the north-east or the south-west
                    monsoon is blowing; for the movement produced by the former reinforces it, while
                    that produced by the latter weakens it, by deflecting northwards a portion of
                    the water which the southern equatorial current brings to the coast of Africa,
                    and drifting it towards the Indian peninsula. When flowing with its greatest
                    force and velocity, the Natal current<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                        type="authorial"><p>This is commonly termed the Mozambique current; but, as
                            the usual southerly direction of the surface flow in the Mozambique

                            south-west monsoon, or even under the influence of local winds, the term
                            Natal current (suggested by Mr Laughton) seems decidedly
                        preferable.</p></note> is scarcely, if at all, inferior to the Gulf Stream
                    where it issues from the Florida Strait. When passing Cape Corrientes, at the
                    southern extremity of the Mozambique Channel, it is said to have a rate of 80
                    miles per day, and has been even said to rush, under a rare combination of
                    impelling forces, with a velocity of 140 miles per day. Its rate gradually
                    diminishes, however, until, off Cape Colony (where it is known as the Agulhas
                    current), it has a velocity of about 50 miles per day. The warmth it carries has
                    a very important influence in ameliorating the climate of Cape Colony; for this
                    would otherwise suffer from the importation of the low temperature brought by
                    the Antarctic current which there meets it.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                        type="authorial"><p>Some very curi ms temperature phenomena are produced on
                            the Agulhas bank by the splitting up of the cold and warm currents,
                            which form distinct bands and strata that do not mix for some
                        time.</p></note> When the Agulhas current is at its strongest, it carries a
                    temperature of 7 9° as far west as the meridian of 15° E. But when the drift of
                    the monsoon wind countervails that of the south-east trade, instead of
                    reinforcing it, the temperature of the Agulhas current is lower and its force
                    less. Whilst a portion of this current rounds the Cape and becomes a tributary
                    of the South African current of the Atlantic (thus carrying away the excess
                    brought into the basin of the Indian Ocean by the Malacca current), the
                    principal part of it is deflected to the south and east, partly by the agency of
                    the Antarctic current, but chiefly under the influence of the westerly winds or
                    “antitrades,” that prevail throughout the southern water-zone which almost
                    continuously girdles the globe between the parallels of 40" and 60° S. Thus
                    there is here a pretty constant retrograde set of surface-water (corresponding
                    with the southern connecting current of the South Atlantic), at the rate of
                    about 24 miles a day, towards the western coast of Australia; and since,
                    notwithstanding the reduction of its temperature, the water which has circulated
                    in the Indian Ocean is still much warmer than that which forms the general mass
                    of the easterly drift, it is probably through this excess (imparting a
                    corresponding excess of vapour to the atmosphere above, which is condensed again
                    by contact with the colder land) that the fogs are generated, for which the
                    islands that lie in the course of this flow are notorious. On arriving at the
                    shores of Australia, this drift is divided by the south-west projection of its
                    coast-line into two streams, one of which continues its eastward course along
                    the southern coast, whilst the other, turning northwards, forms the West
                    Australian current, of wl·iich the greater part, when it reaches the head-water
                    of the southern equatorial current, is drawn into it, and thus completes the
                    circulation of the southern Indian Ocean.</p>
                <p>Between the parallel of 5°, to which the influence of the monsoon winds extends,
                    and that of 10° S., which is the usual northern limit of that of the southern
                    trade, there is a “belt of calms,” wherein there runs an equatorial counter
                    current, which corresponds to that of the Atlantic, and is, like it, to be
                    considered as a back-water flowing towards the source from which the currents to
                    the north and south of it derive their supplies. (W. B. C. )</p>
