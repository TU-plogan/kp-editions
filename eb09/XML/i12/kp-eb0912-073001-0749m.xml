                    the literature circulated among those under their jurisdiction; for various
                    examples, both in ancient and in modern times, reference may be made to the
                    article <hi rend="smallcaps">Bibliography</hi> (vol. iii. p. 658). The earliest
                    known instance of a list of proscribed books being issued with the authority of
                    a bishop of Rome is sometimes assigned to the pontificate of Gelasius (494) and
                    sometimes to that of Hormisdas (514), but most probably ought not to be dated
                    earlier than the 8th century. The document is for the most part, as its name
                    implies, a <hi rend="italic">Notitia Librorum Apocryphorum</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >qτιi non</hi><hi rend="italic">recipiuntur,</hi> and chiefly consists of an
                    enumeration of such apocryphal works as by their titles might be apt to mislead
                    the unwary into attaching an undue weight to their teaching (the “Acts” of
                    Philip, Thomas, Peter, Philip, and the Gospels of Thaddaeus, Matthias, Peter,
                    James the Less, and others). Its concluding paragraph, however, sweepingly
                    declares all the writings of Simon Magus and of many other heretics who are
                    mentioned by name, as also of many more whose names have been completely
                    forgotten <hi rend="italic">(minime retinentur),</hi> to be repudiated,
                    eliminated entirely from the Roman Catholic and Apostolic Church, and eternally
                    condemned.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Hardouin, <hi

                    pontiffs continued to exhort the episcopate and the whole body of the faithful
                    to be on their guard against heretical writings, whether old or new; and one of
                    the functions of the Inquisition when it was established was to exercise a rigid
                    censorship over books put in circulation. The bishops in their dioceses had
                    always, however, a considerable discretion. With the discovery of the art of
                    printing, and the wide and cheap diffusion of all sorts of books which ensued,
                    the need for new precautions against heresy and immorality in literature made
                    itself felt, and more than one pope (Sixtus IV. in 1479 and Alexander VI. in
                    1501) gave special direction to the archbishops of Cologne, Mainz, Treves, and
                    Magdeburg regarding the growing abuses of the printing press; in 1515 the
                    Lateran council formulated the decree <hi rend="italic">De</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Impressione Librorum,</hi> which required that no work should be printed
                    without previous examination by the proper ecclesiastical authority, the penalty
                    of unlicensed printing being excommunication of the culprit, and confiscation
                    and destruction of the books. The council of Trent in its fourth session, 8th
                    April 1546, forbade the sale or possession of any anonymous religious book which
                    had not previously been seen and approved by the ordinary; in the same year the
                    university of Louvain, at the command of Charles V., prepared an “Index” of
                    pernicious and forbidden books, a second edition of which appeared in 1550. In
                    L557, and again in 1559, Pope Paul IV., through the Inquisition at Rome,
                    published what may be regarded as the first Roman <hi rend="italic">Index</hi>
                    in the modern ecclesiastical use of that term <hi rend="italic">(Index</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">auctorum et librorum</hi><hi rend="italic">qui tanquarn
                    hoeretici</hi><hi rend="italic">aut suspecti aut perversi ab Officio</hi><hi

                    >interdicuntur).</hi> All anonymous works published since 1519 were condemned
                    without exception in this Index, which directed its hostility chiefly against
                    works that seemed unfavourable to the claims of the Roman curia,, or maintained
                    the superiority of councils over popes. A list of sixty-two printers of
                    heretical books was appended. At the 18th session of the council of Trent ∙(26th
                    February 1562), in consideration of the great increase in the number of suspect
                    and pernicious books, and also of the inefficacy of the many previous “censures”
                    which had proceeded from the provinces and from Rome itself, certain fathers
                    were appointed to enquire into these “censures,” and to consider what ought to
                    be done in the circumstances. At the 25th session (4th December 1563) this
                    committee of the council was reported to have completed its work, but as the
                    subject did not seem (on account of the great number and variety of the books)
                    to admit of being properly discussed by the council, the result of its labours
                    was handed over to the pope (Pius IV.) to deal with as he should think proper.
                    In the following March accordingly were published, with papal approval, the <hi
                    rend="italic">Index</hi><hi rend="italic">librorum prohibitorum,</hi> which
                    continues to be reprinted and brought down to date, and the “Ten Rules” which,
                    supplemented and explained by Clement VIII., Sixtus V., Alexander VIΓ., and
                    finally by Benedict XIV. (10th July 1753), still regulate the preparation of
                    that catalogue. By the first of these rules the condemnation of all books
                    already condemned by pope or council prior to 1515 is renewed; by the second the
                    works of “heresiarchs” (Luther, Zwingli, Calvin, Schwenkfeld, Hübmaier) are
                    condemned whatever be their subject, but it is provided that the non-religious
                    works of those who are heretics merely may on examination and approval be
                    permitted; the third and fourth relate to translations of the Bible; the fifth
                    orders the expurgation of lexicons, concordances, and similar com« pilations by
                    heretics; the sixth discourages the circulation of books in the vulgar tongue
                    about controversies between Catholics and heretics; the seventh, eighth, and
                    ninth relate to obscene or grossly superstitious publications; the tenth
                    contains various details of procedure about the licensing of books, and
                    concludes with the declaration that the possessor or reader of heretical books
                    is forthwith to be excommunicated, while the possessor or reader of books
                    prohibited on other grounds falls into mortal sin, and is to be dealt with
                    severely at the discretion of the bishop. The business of correcting the Index
                    to date is now in the hands of an ecclesiastical board known as the
                    “Congregation of the Index,” which consists of a prefect (who is always a
                    cardinal) and other cardinals, with whom are associated the “consultera” and
                    “examiners of books” <hi rend="italic">(qualificatores).</hi> The <hi
                    rend="italic">Index</hi><hi rend="italic">Librorum Expurgandorum</hi> or <hi
                    rend="italic">Expurgatorius</hi> catalogues the works which may be read after
                    the deletion of specified passages. Bishops have the power of granting at their
                    discretion the right to read forbidden books, except in some reserved cases,
                    where the papal dispensation is required. The Roman Index is unfortunately very
                    far from being an exhaustive catalogue of works inconsistent with Catholic
                    orthodoxy, and thus lacks the interest and vast importance it would otherwise
                    have had for the bibliographer.</p>
                <p>The early Reformers, by their attitude towards writings which from their point of
                    view seemed objectionable, furnished many an <hi rend="italic"
                    >argumentum</hi><hi rend="italic">ad</hi><hi rend="italic">hominem</hi> to the
                    Catholics (see Gretser’s learned work, <hi rend="italic">De Jure</hi><hi

                    Calvin writing to the ministers at Frankfort about one of the books of Servetus,
                    with a view to its being burnt <hi rend="italic">(Ep.</hi> 153). Gradually,
                    however, all the Protestant churches have recognized the expediency of leaving
                    individuals and communities practically free to select for their instruction and
                    amusement the works which in the conscientious exercise of their own responsible
                    judgment they may find best adapted to their wants.</p>
