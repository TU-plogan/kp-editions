                    animate or inanimate, conventional or the reverse. Thus, for example, every form
                    of animal worship is excluded by it, and also the cultus connected with memorial
                    stones of which traces so unmistakable are found in the Old Testament and in
                    almost every other ancient literature (the <hi rend="italic">λίθοι λιπαροί</hi>

                    have been regarded as aids to devotion and spiritual instruction, or made the

                    various aspects under which they have been viewed forms a large and not
                    unimportant chapter in the history of religion in general and of the Christian
                    church in particular. Only the outlines of that history can be indicated
                    here.</p>
                <p>Most religions of which the history has been traced give distinct indications of
                    a primitive period in which “idols” were unknown. Thus in India “the worship of
                    idols is a secondary formation, a later degradation of the more primitive
                    worship of ideal gods” (Μ. Müller). In the Vedic hymns it is the appearances of
                    nature themselves that are worshipped as symbols of unseen deity; and the
                    present image worship of the Hindus is most probably Post-Buddhistic in its
                    origin. The testimonies of the Greek historians (Herod., i. 131; Strabo, p. 732;
                    Diog. Laer., <hi rend="italic">De Vit.</hi><hi rend="italic">Phil.,</hi> prooem.
                    6) as to the absence of religious images from the worship of the ancient
                    Persians is confirmed by all the more recent direct investigations into the
                    primitive life of that branch of the Aryan race. There is the same concurrence
                    of testimony as regards the ancient Greeks<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    serpents, trees, meteoric stones,—and in some cases temples occurred which
                    contained no visible symbol at all. Even in the Homeric poems, the allusions to
                    images of the gods are but few: where an image is mentioned (as in <hi
                    rend="italic">ll.</hi> vi. 301), it is evident that it was of the rudest
                    description, and but little indebted to human art. The same remark applies to
                    the cultus of ancient Rome. It was carried on without the use of images until
                    the comparatively late period at which the state entered into relations with
                    Etruria, Magna Graecia, and Sicily.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    of the Semitic races, there can be little doubt, so far as the Jews at least are
                    concerned, of the correctness of their own impression that “idolatry,” in the
                    strict etymological sense of that word, was not the most primitive form of
                    religion practised among them.</p>
                <p>The decalogue contains a direct precept against the making of any “graven image”
                    <hi rend="italic">{pesel</hi> or <hi rend="italic">ρasil),</hi> for religious
                    uses at least (Ex. xx. 4, 5; Deut. v. 8, 9; with which compare Deut. iv. 15-18).
                    The “graven images” contemplated in the passage last cited are images of men,
                    quadrupeds, birds, reptiles, and fishes; and the manner in which the prohibition
                    is made is fitted to suggest that all these “likenesses” had made their
                    appearance and already become objects of religious veneration prior to its
                    promulgation. Nothing certain, however, is known as to the “strange gods”
                    alluded to in Gen. xxxv. 4 as having been buried by Jacob under the oak
                    atShechem; nor can much be said with regard to the “teraphim” which are first
                    mentioned as having been worshipped in one of the branches of the family of
                    Terah (Gen. xxxi. 19), but are often subsequently referred to as having been
                    used in the time'of the judges (Judg. xvii. 5; <hi rend="italic">cf.</hi> xviii.
                    30), and at various stages throughout the history both of the northern and of
                    the southern kingdom (Hos. iii. 4; Zech. x. 2; 2 Kings xxiii. 24). Sometimes
                    they must have been but small; but from other passages it may be inferred that
                    they may have been, occasionally at least, of human form and size (1 Sam. xix.
                    13, 16). Much obscurity attaches also to the calf worship of which an instance
                    occurred in the wilderness (Ex. xxxii. 4), and which was a prominent feature in
                    the religion of the northern kingdom from the days of Jeroboam t,∣ the end; it
                    is a disputed question whether the cult was of Egyptian or of purely Semitic
                    origin. The difficulty in Lev. xvii. 7, and perhaps also in Deut, xxxii. 17, Ps.
                    cvi. 37, is by some interpreters explained by a reference to the Egyptian goat
                    worship (Mendes); if so, these passages contain no allusion to image worship.
                    The various forms of the Baal cultus so often referred to in the Old Testament
                    were no doubt Semitic; there are no explicit references to any images, however,
                    in this connexion; and in point of fact (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Baal)</hi>
                    that deity was generally represented in his “high-places,” not by images, but by
                    obelisks or pillars. That the plastic arts, even in a religious connexion, were
                    not wholly discouraged among the Jews, appears from what we read, not only about
                    the brazen serpent in the wilderness, but also about the existence in tabernacle
                    and temple of such figures as cherubs (Ex. xxv. 18-20; xxvi. 1; xxxvi.</p>
                <p>35; 1 Kings vi. 23, 32, 35) executed in various materials, lions, oxen, lotus
                    flowers, and pomegranates <hi rend="italic">(cf.</hi> Ex. xxxi. 4, 5). The
                    graphic descriptions of the process of idolmaking, both “graven images” and
                    “molten images” in Isa. xl. and xliv. (with which may be compared Wisd. xv.; see
                    also the reference in Isa. xxx. 22 to molten images overlaid with a precious
                    metal) show that the exercise of those arts was far from being confined, at the
                    periods to which these passages relate, within the limits fixed by the second
                    commandment. After the captivity, however, there developed itself among the Jews
                    a steadily growing tendency to interpret the language of the law with the most
                    stringent literality; and at the time of the Roman occupation the masses, under
                    Pharisaic influences, showed a sensitiveness on the subject of images which in
                    certain recorded instances led to very striking results. Thus, the existence of
                    trophies in the theatre at Jerusalem was violently objected to; Vitellius found
                    it necessary to avoid Judaea in his march from Antioch to Petra, lest the Holy
                    Land should be defiled by the presence of the Roman eagles; at the outbreak of
                    the Jewish war the house of Antipas at Tiberias was destroyed because it was
                    adorned with sculptures (Joseph., <hi rend="italic">Λnt., xv.</hi> 8. 1, 2;
                    xviii. 3. 1; <hi rend="italic">Vit.,</hi> 12). This aversion to every exercise
                    of the imitative arts, as regards living things at least, passed over from
                    Judaism to Mahometanism.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"

                <p>As regards the attitude towards religious images assumed by the primitive
                    Christian church, several questions have often been treated as one which cannot
                    too carefully be kept quite apart. There can be no doubt, for example, that the
                    early Christians were absolutely unanimous in utterly condemning all heathen
                    image-worship and the various customs, many of them obviously immoral, with
                    which it was associated; it is needless to multiply citations from the fathers
                    in proof of so undisputed a fact. A form of iconolatry specially deprecated in
                    the New Testament was the then prevalent adoration of the images of the reigning
                    emperors (see Rev. xv. 2). It is also tolerably certain that, if for no other
                    reasons besides the fewness, obscurity, and poverty of the early converts to
                    Christianity, the works of art seen in their meeting houses cannot possibly at
                    first have been numerous. Along with these reasons would certainly cooperate
                    towards the exclusion of visible aids to devotion, not only the church’s vivid
                    recollection of what Christ had been, and its living sense of His continued real
                    though unseen presence, but also, during the first years, its constant
                    expectation of His second advent as imminent. In point of fact it was a common
                    accusation brought against the Christians by their enemies that they had “no
                    altars, no temples, no known images” (Min. Fel., <hi rend="italic">Oct.,</hi> c.
                    10), that “they set up no image or form of any god” (see Arnob., <hi
                    rend="italic">Adv. Gent.,</hi> vi. 1; similarly Celsus); and this charge was
                    never denied. At a comparatively early date indeed we read of various Gnostic
                    sects calling in the fine arts to aid their worship; thus Irenaeus (7∕α <hi
                    rend="superscript"> i</hi> r i. 25, 6), speaking of the followers of Marcellina,
                    says that “they possess images, some of them painted, and others formed from
                    different kinds of material; and they maintain that a likeness of Christ was
                    made by Pilate at that time when Jesus lived among men. They crown these images,
                    and set them up along with the images of the philosophers of the world; that is
                    to say, with the images of Pythagoras and Plato and Aristotle and the rest. They
                    have also other modes of honouring these images after the same manner as the
                    Gentiles” <hi rend="italic">{pf.</hi> Aug., <hi rend="italic">De Haer.,</hi> c.
                    7). It is <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit12newyrich/page/n731/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0912-0731-0712"/> also well known that the emperor Alexander
                    Severus round a place for several Scripture characters and even for Christ in
                    his lararium (Lamprid., <hi rend="italic">Vit.</hi><hi rend="italic">Alex.
                    Sev.,</hi> c. 29). But there is no evidence that such a use of images extended
                    itself at that early period to orthodox Christian circles; and the presumption
                    is all the other way. The first unmistakable indication of the actual public use
                    of the painter’s art for directly religious ends does not occur indeed until the
                    year 306 A.D., when the synod of Elvira, Spain, decreed (can. 36) that “pictures
                    ought not to be in a church, lest that which is worshipped and adored be painted
                    on walls.”<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Placuit
                    picturas in ecclesia esse non debere, ne quod colitur et adoratur in parietibus

                    170.</p></note> The scope of this prohibition has been very differently viewed
                    by interpreters,—some thinking that all that is forbidden is any attempt at
                    delineating the divine; others considering that the synod contemplated frescos
                    only and not pictures, which could be more readily hidden from profanation in
                    times of persecution; others taking the canon in the broadest sense as directed
                    against the exhibition in churches of pictures of sacred subjects. In any ease,
                    and particularly if the last theory be adopted, it is evident that the use of
                    sacred pictures in public worship was not at the beginning of the 4th century a
                    thing wholly unknown within the orthodox church in Spain; and the presumption is
                    that in other places, about the same period, the custom was looked upon with a
                    more tolerant eye. Indications of the existence of allied forms of sacred
                    Christian art prior to this period are not wholly wanting. It seems possible to
                    trace some of the older and ruder frescos in the catacombs back to a very early
                    century; and it is certain that Bible manuscripts were often copiously
                    illuminated and illustrated even before the middle of the 4th century. An
                    often-quoted passage from Tertullian (De <hi rend="italic">Pudic.,</hi> c. 10,
                    <hi rend="italic">cf.</hi> c. 7) shows that in his day the communion cup was
                    wont to bear a representation of the Good Shepherd. Clement of Alexandria <hi
                    rend="italic">(Poeday.,</hi> iii. 11) mentions the dove, fish, ship, lyre,
                    anchor, as suitable devices for Christian signet rings.</p>
                <p>During the 4th and following centuries the tendency to enlist the fine arts in
                    the service of religion and the church may be said to have steadily advanced;
                    not, however, so far as appears, with the formal sanction of any regular
                    ecclesiastical authority, and certainly not without strong protests raised by
                    more than one powerful voice. From a passage in the writings of Gregory of Nyssa
                    <hi rend="italic">(Oral. de</hi><hi rend="italic">Laudibus Theodori
                    Martyris,</hi> c. 2) it is easy to see how the stories of recent martyrs would
                    offer themselves as tempting subjects for the painter, and at the same time be
                    considered to have received from him their best and most permanent expression;
                    that this feeling was very widespread is shown in many places by Paulinus of
                    Nola (oδ. 431), from whom we gather that not only martyrdoms, and Bible
                    histories, but also symbols of the Trinity were in his day freely represented
                    pictorially. Augustine <hi rend="italic">(De Cons. Ev.,</hi> i. 10) speaks less
                    approvingly of those who look for Christ and His apostles “on painted walls”
                    rather than in His written word. How far the Christian feeling of the 4th and
                    5th centuries was from being thoroughly settled in favour of the employment of
                    the fine arts is instructively shown by such a case as that of Eusebius of
                    Caesarea, who in reply to a request of Constantia, sister of Constantine, for a
                    picture of Christ, wrote that it was unlawful to possess images pretending to
                    represent the Saviour either in His divine or in His human nature, and added
                    that to avoid the reproach of idolatry he had actually taken away from a lady
                    friend the pictures of Paul and of Christ which she had.<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>The letter, which is most probably, though
                    not certainly, genuine, appears in the <hi rend="italic">Acta</hi> of the second

                    Jerusalem, tells how in a church at Anablatha near Bethel he had found a curtain
                    painted with the image “of Christ or of some other saint,” which he had torn
                    down and ordered to be used for the burial of some pauper. The passage, however,
                    reveals, not only what Epiphanius thought on the subject, but also the fact that
                    such pictures must have been becoming frequent. Nilus, the disciple and defender
                    of Chrysostom, permitted the symbol of the cross in churches and also pictorial
                    delineations of Old and New Testament history, but deprecated other symbols,
                    pictures of martyrs, and most of all the representation of Christ. In the time
                    of Gregory the Great the Western Church at last obtained something like an
                    authoritative declaration on the vexed question about images, but in a sense not
                    quite the same as that of the synod of Elvira; Serenus of Marseilles, on account
                    of what he considered to be flagrant abuses, had ordered the removal and
                    destruction of all sacred images within his diocese; this vigorous action called
                    forth several letters from Pope Gregory (viii. 2, ∏1; ix. 4,11), in which he
                    utterly disapproved of that violent course, and, for the first time clearly
                    drawing the distinction which has ever since been authoritative for the Roman
                    Church, pointed out that “it is one thing to worship a picture and another to
                    learn from the language of a picture what that is which ought to be worshipped.
                    What those who can read learn by means of writing, that do the uneducated learn
                    by looking at a picture. . . . That, therefore, ought not to have been destroyed
                    which had been placed in the churches, not for worship, but solely for
                    instructing the minds of the ignorant.” Here it may be mentioned with regard to
                    the symbol of the cross, that its public use dates from the time of Constantine,
                    though, according to many Christian archaeologists it had, prior to that date, a
                    very important place in the so-called “disciplina arcani.” The introduction of
                    the crucifix was decidedly later, and originally the favourite combination was
                    that of the figure of a lamb lying at the foot of the cross; the Trullan council
                    in 692 by its 82d canon enjoined that this symbol should be discontinued, and
                    that where Christ was shown in connexion with His cross He should be represented
                    in His human nature.</p>
                <p>It was not until the 8th century that the religious and theological questions
                    which seem naturally to connect themselves with image worship were at last
                    distinctly raised in the Eastern Church in their entirety, and argued in what
                    from some points of view might fairly be called an exhaustive manner. The
                    controversy began with the edict by which Leo the Isaurian, in the tenth year of
                    his reign (726), sought to deliver the church from what he called “the idolatry
                    of image worship.” The text of that edict is not extant, but it seems to have
                    been directed exclusively against such “idolatrous” homage as appeared to be
                    involved in the established custom of prostration before them. The use of the
                    strong word “idolatrous” at once led to a keen controversy, in which it was
                    urged by the theologians that a “relative worship” (ττροσκΰν^σις σχετική) might,
                    without idolatry, be given to the image of Christ. Among those who took this
                    ground was the famous John of Damascus, who retorted upon the iconoclastic
                    emperor with charges of Judaizing and even of Manichaean leanings. Leo,
                    unconvinced, but finding that his first edict had been wholly ineffectual, four
                    years later (730) issued a second decree, of a more sweeping character than the
                    first, inasmuch as all the holy images were ordered to be removed, and all
                    recalcitrant bishops summarily ejected from their posts. This proceeding called
                    forth further arguments from the theologian of Damascus, through whose influence
                    the iconoclasts were anathematized in such churches as were not too directly and
                    entirely under the political influence of Constantinople. At the same time (730)

                    important controversial letters in favour of images. They are preserved in the
                    <hi rend="italic">Acta</hi> of the second council of Nice. Apart from their
                    direct historical importance, they are of considerable interest as literary and
                    theological curiosities. To the objection which had of course been urged from
                    the decalogue, he replied that the prohibition there was directed simply against
                    the idolatry of Canaan, and could not have been intended in a sense inconsistent
                    with the fact that Moses had been commanded to make cherubim and the like.
                    Christ Himself was an image, the image of God. The charge that the iconoduli
                    prayed to stones, walls, and pictures was easily met; and the further difficulty
                    that six oecumenical councils had met and separated, but enjoined nothing about
                    images, it was held, told distinctly against the iconoclasts, for the same
                    councils had equally failed to urge upon men the duty of taking their necessary
                    food. Heedless of Gregory’s remonstrances, the emperor continued, during the
                    remaining twelve years of his life, to carry on the struggle with but little
                    effect; the religious use of images was too intimately interwoven, not only with
                    the church life, but also with the domestic habits of his people, to yield even
                    to the most determined efforts of an arbitrary despotism. In 741 Leo was
                    succeeded by Constantine Copronymus (741-775), who fully shared the iconoclastic
                    views of his father, and in 754 convoked a council, attended by three hundred
                    and thirty-eight bishops, but never recognized as oecumenical, which under his
                    influence declared all reverencers of images to be men who had lapsed into
                    idolatry; decreed that “Christ in His glorified humanity, though not
                    incorporeal, was yet exalted above all the limits and defects of a sensuous
                    nature, too exalted therefore to be figured by human art in an earthly material
                    after the analogy of any other human body”; and pronounced anathema on all who
                    attempted to express by visible colours the form of the Logos in His
                    incarnation, and on all who delineated dumb and lifeless pictures of the saints,
                    which could never serve any profitable end. All images whatsoever of sacred
                    persons or things were ordered to be ejected from Christian churches; and to set
                    them up either in public or in private buildings was forbidden under the gravest
                    ecclesiastical penalties. The stringency of these decrees was justified by
                    arguments drawn from reason and Scripture, as well as by appeals to such names
                    as those of Gregory, Chrysostom, Athanasius, Epiphanius, and Eusebius. The
                    attempt to enforce the decisions of the council as imperial laws was in many
                    instances marked by oppressiveness and cruelty, and the general feeling of the
                    community, fostered diligently by a numerous class of its most energetic and
                    pious members, the monks, continued unchanged in its aversion to iconoclasm;
                    and, although at the end of his reign Constantine succeeded in imposing upon
                    every citizen of Constantinople an oath never again to worship an image, there
                    can be little doubt that in a vast number of households secret leanings to image
                    worship had been intensified rather than weakened by repressive measures. During
                    the early part of the brief reign (775— 779) of Leo IV. Chazarus, the stringency
                    of the law was somewhat relaxed, until it was discovered that the empress
                    (Irene) was herself a secret iconolater, when she was brought into disgrace, and
                    numbers of her accomplices were seized and imprisoned. On the death of Leo,
                    Irene became regent for her infant son Constantine, and, as was to be expected,
                    used the power which she now possessed in favour of the cause she had long had
                    at heart. With the assistance of the monks, after an abortive attempt to hold a
                    synod at Constantinople in 786, there met at Nice in 787 a general council (the
                    seventh oecumenical), the proceedings of which are of considerable historical
                    importance. It was there decided that, not only the figure of the cross, but
                    also other holy images (Christ, the Virgin Mary, angels, and saints), whether
                    painted or executed in mosaic or other material, might be set up in churches,
                    placed on holy vessels and vestments, on walls and panels, in houses and by
                    highways, and were to be honoured with <hi rend="italic">ασπασμός</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">πpoσκυvησις,</hi> though not with λατp∈ια, which is given to the
                    divine nature alone. The decrees, which were signed by all present, were
                    afterwards solemnly ratified at a final session (the eighth) held in
                    Constantinople, and thus, after a struggle of sixty-one years, the worship of
                    images asserted in the Greek Church that ascendency which, with only one brief
                    interruption of a few years, it has ever since maintained.</p>
                <p>The decisions of this Eastern council were in full harmony with the personal
                    views and practices of the popes, who, however, were compelled to show
                    considerable moderation in the attitude they assumed. The Latin Church also, as
                    is shown by the writings of Agobard of Lyons and Claudius of Turin, contained
                    strongly iconoclastic elements, which, if full scope had been given them, might
                    conceivably have altered very considerably the current of Western opinion. On
                    political as well as on religious grounds, however, it was felt to be
                    inexpedient to push matters on either side to extremes; very important therefore
                    at this juncture was the step taken by the emperor Charlemagne in the
                    publication of his <hi rend="italic">De</hi><hi rend="italic">Impio Imaginum
                    Cultu Libri IV.</hi><hi rend="italic">,</hi> commonly called the <hi
                    rend="italic">Libri</hi><hi rend="italic">Caroliηi,</hi> in which, condemning
                    alike the fanaticism of iconoclasts and the superstition of iconoduli, he
                    maintained the right of images to exist for purposes of commemoration and
                    ornament (propter memoriam rerum gestarum et ornamentum). At the synod of
                    Frankfort-on-the-Main, held in 794, his general position was maintained, and
                    adoration of images <hi rend="italic">(adoratio et servitus imaginum)</hi> was
                    wholly condemned. Great injustice was done, however, to the fathers of the
                    second Nicene council when they were accused of maintaining that the same
                    worship ought to be given to images of saints as to the Holy Trinity,—a doctrine
                    which they had been at special pains to repudiate. The settlement which had been
                    obtained in 787 did not subsist entirely undisturbed even in the Eastern Church.
                    In 815, two years after Leo the Armenian had ascended the throne, a council
                    convoked by him at Constantinople formally abolished the decrees of Nice, and
                    again banished the images from the churches. The new controversy, with which the
                    name of Theodore of the Studium is still more prominently associated than was
                    that of John of Damascus with its previous phase, went on with vicissitudes very
                    similar to those which had formerly occurred during the reign of Leo and his
                    successors Michael (820-830) and Theophilus (830-842). At length, during the
                    regency of the empress Theodora, the decrees of Nice were reaffirmed by a synod
                    at Constantinople, and the banished images were triumphantly and finally
                    reintroduced into the metropolitan church on the day which on the first Sunday
                    in Lent is still celebrated throughout the Greek Church as a great festival
                    under the name of <hi rend="italic">εορτή</hi> or <hi rend="italic">πανήγνρις
                    της ορθοδοξίας.</hi> One incident in this second iconoclastic controversy had
                    been the mission of an embassy by Michael Balbus to Louis the Pious in 825. The
                    reply was given through the synod of Paris, held in that year: in open
                    disagreement with the opinions of Pope Hadrian I., the relatively neutral ground
                    taken up at the synod of Frankfort was maintained.</p>
                <p>Down to the close of this period the “images” spoken of in ecclesiastical
                    controversy are almost entirely pictures or mosaics,—the religious use of
                    sculptures, and particularly of statues <hi rend="italic">(αγάλματα,
                    ανδριάντες,</hi><hi rend="italic">στηλaι),</hi> being little known, and, so far
                    as known, disapproved. This distinction does not indeed appear in the actual
                    decrees of the council of Nice; but it is clearly drawn in the statements of the
                    patriarch Germanus and by Stephen Bostrenus, as quoted <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit12newyrich/page/n733/mode/1up"

                    ii.). Such remains of Christian antiquity as the statue of Hippolytus, recently
                    dug up at Ostia, and usually assigned to a date not later than the 5th century,
                    as also the sitting figure of St Peter, dating from the same period, now seen in
                    St Peter’s, Rome, have no immediate connexion with the subject of this article.
                    The same remark applies to the still earlier statue at Paneas referred to by
                    Eusebius <hi rend="italic">(H. E.,</hi> vii. 18), said to have been raised in
                    honour of Christ by the woman mentioned in Matt. ix. 20; if it was really
                    intended to represent Christ at all and not rather the emperor Hadrian, it was,
                    at all events, obviously no object of special veneration. About the 9th century,
                    however, “graven images” seem to have become more common. Thus in the treatise
                    <hi rend="italic">De</hi><hi rend="italic">Imaginibus</hi> (c. 31) of Agobard of
                    Lyons <hi rend="italic">(ob.</hi> 840), there is an obvious controversial
                    allusion to molten or moulded statues of angels or holy men. With the gradual
                    introduction of the architecture commonly known as Gothic, there came in a great
                    advance in plastic art. The new cathedrals gave scope for and even demanded a
                    wealth of decoration formerly unknown, until it seemed as if, not only the
                    entire Biblical history, but all the <hi rend="italic">Acta Sanctorum,</hi> were
                    to be artistically told in wood and stone. The earliest extant sculptures in
                    stone or stucco cannot be carried farther back than the 11th century. But the
                    discussion of their date and character belongs to the artistic rather than to
                    the religious side of the subject.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                <p>At the period of the Reformation it was unanimously felt by the reforming party
                    that, with the invocation of saints and the practice of reverencing their
                    relics, the adoration of images ought also as matter· of course to cease. The
                    leaders of the movement were not all, however, perfectly agreed on the question
                    as to whether these might not in some circumstances be retained in churches.
                    Luther, it is well known, had no sympathy with the iconoclastic outbreaks which
                    history mentions as having taken place with some frequency at this period; he
                    classed images in themselves as among the “adiaphora,” and condemned only their
                    cultus; so also the “Confessio Tetrapolitana” leaves Christians free to have
                    them or not, if only due regard be had to what is expedient and edifying. The
                    “Heidelberg Catechism,” on the other hand, emphatically declares that images are
                    not to be tolerated at all in churches. This position, which is that of all the
                    reformed churches, has an obvious connexion with their view as to the division
                    of the decalogue, they following Origen on this question while the Lutherans
                    adhere to the Philouic arrangement (see <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Decalogue).</hi></p>
                <p>At the council of Trent (session xxv.) the Church of Rome finally formulated the
                    doctrine on the subject of images which is still of authority within its
                    communion. That doctrine is avowedly based on the decrees of the second council
                    of Nice. It is declared that images of Christ, the Virgin Mary, and other saints
                    are to be set up and retained, especially in churches, and that “due” honour and
                    veneration are to be accorded them by kissing and prostration. Warnings are
                    appended, however, against their superstitious abuse somewhat in the spirit of
                    Gregory the Great’s letter and of the decision of the Frankfort synod.</p>
                <p>The Greek Church continues tenaciously to adhere to the decrees of the second
                    Nicene council, and has not yielded to any of the artistic impulses which have
                    elsewhere made themselves so powerfully felt. The sacred pictures which abound
                    everywhere, and are treated with extraordinary reverence and affection, are for
                    the most part very defective aesthetically. Indeed the preference seems to be
                    given to those executed in rude archaic style, and even now the painter of
                    pictures intended for religious uses must bear in mind the monk’s famous
                    criticism on Titian. Nude or incompletely draped figures are forbidden, and only
                    half lengths are permitted “ut omnis stultae cogitationis occasio tollatur.” No
                    representation of the Godhead or of the Trinity is attempted. Although it is in
                    the records of a Constantinopolitan council that the earliest extant notice of
                    the cruøifix occurs, that symbol is not now used in the East</p>
                <p>The literature of the subject is immense. The most important monographs are—from
                    the Catholic point of view, Maimbourg, <hi rend="italic">Histoire</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">de l'</hi><hi rend="italic">Hérésie des Iconoclastes</hi> (Paris,
                    1679-82); from the Protestant, Daillé, <hi rend="italic">De</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Imaginibus</hi> (Leyden, 1642), and Spanheim, <hi rend="italic"
                    >Historia Imaginum restituta</hi> (Leyden, 1686). For the acts of the councils,
                    Labbé or Mansi must be consulted; the learned compilation of Goldast, <hi
                    rend="italic">Imperialia decreta</hi><hi rend="italic">de</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >cultu imaginum in utroque imperio promulgata collecta et illustrata</hi>
                    (Frankfort, 1608), will also be found useful. Compare Schlosser, <hi

                    rend="italic">Kaiser</hi> (Frankfort, 1812). The sections relating to image

                    rend="italic">Cone. Trid.,pa,rs</hi> 4) are characterized by learning and
                    moderation. The whole subject is treated, of course, in all the church
                    histories; with most fulness and insight in that of Neander. The iconoclastic
                    controversy is dealt with also in the histories of Gibbon and Milman. Copious
                    archaeological details are also given in Augusti’s <hi rend="italic"
                    >Denkwürdigkeiten,</hi> vol. xii. (Leipsic, 1831). (J. S. BL.)</p>
