                    October 1753. She was the daughter of a farmer at Standingfield, near Bury St
                    Edmunds, Suffolk, her maiden name being Simpson. On account of the death of her
                    father in her eighth year, she and her sisters never enjoyed the advantages of
                    school training or of any regular supervision in their studies, but they
                    nevertheless seem to have acquired at an early period refined and literary
                    tastes. A favourite amusement of the family was readings, chiefly of a dramatic
                    kind, and Elizabeth, notwithstanding that she was afflicted with an impediment
                    of speech, which drove her into solitude, soon conceived a strong desire, not
                    only to see the great world, but to become an actress. After making an attempt
                    with little success to secure an engagement in a Norwich theatre, she in April
                    1772 left secretly for London, where she made the acquaintance of several
                    managers and actors, but with no better fortune. In June she, however, married
                    Mr Inchbald, a comedian in Drury Lane Theatre, and in September following she
                    made her debut as an actress in the character of Cordelia, her husband taking
                    the part of Lear. For several years she acted along with her husband in the
                    provinces, but notwithstanding her great beauty and her good mental aptitude for
                    acting, the impediment in her speech, by rendering rapidity and ease of
                    utterance impossible, prevented her from attaining to more than very moderate
                    excellence. After the death of her husband in 1778 she continued for some time
                    on the stage, but her success as a dramatic author led her to retire in 1789.
                    She died at Kensington, August 1, 1821.</p>
                <p>Mrs Inchbald’s plays amount to nineteen in all. Some of them were for a time very
                    successful, especially <hi rend="italic">Wives as they were and Maids as they
                    are.</hi> Among the others may be mentioned <hi rend="italic">Such Things Are;
                    The Married Man; The Wedding Day; The Midnight Hour; Everyone has his
                    Fault</hi>; and <hi rend="italic">Lovers’ Vows.</hi> She also edited a
                    collection of the <hi rend="italic">British Theatre,</hi> with biographical and
                    critical remarks, 25 vols., 1806-1809; a <hi rend="italic">Collection of
                    Farces,</hi> 7 vols., 1809; and <hi rend="italic">The Modern Theatre,</hi> 10
                    vols., 1809. Her fame, however, now rests chiefly on her two novels, <hi
                    rend="italic">A Simple Story,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Nature and Art.</hi>
                    These works possess many minor faults and inaccuracies, but on the whole their
                    style is easy, natural, and graceful; and if they are tainted in some degree by
                    a morbid and exaggerated sentiment, and display none of that faculty of creation
                    possessed by the best writers of fiction, the pathetic situations, and the deep
                    and pure feeling pervading them, secured for them a wide but now a waning
                    popularity. Some time before her death Mrs Inchbald destroyed an autobiography
                    for which she had been offered £1000 by Phillips the publisher; but her <hi
                    rend="italic">Memoirs,</hi> compiled by J. Boaden, chiefly from her private
                    journal, appeared in 1833 in two volumes. An interesting account of Mrs Inchbald
                    is contained in <hi rend="italic">Records of a Girlhood,</hi> by Frances Ann
                    Kemble, 1878.</p>
