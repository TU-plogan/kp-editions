                <p><label type="entry">IDAHO</label>, a north-western territory of the United
                    States, was originally a part of Oregon, from which it was separated in 1863. It
                    lies on the Pacific slope, with the exception of a small portion in its
                    south-eastern corner, which is drained into the Great Salt Lake of Utah. It is
                    bounded on the N. by British Columbia and N.E. by Montana; on the E. by Wyoming;
                    on the S. by Utah and Nevada; and on the W. by Oregon and Washington. The
                    boundaries are the meridians (111° and 117° W. long.) and the 42d and 49th
                    parallels of N. lat., except that in the N.E. the Bitterroot range separates the
                    territory from Montana, and the Snake river forms part of the western limit. The
                    area of the territory is imperfectly known, but may be set down approximately at
                    86,300 square miles. The mean elevation is about 4700 feet. The lowest point,
                    which is on Snake river, at the mouth of the Clearwater, is about 1000 feet
                    above the sea, while the highest mountains rise nearly to 10,000 feet. The
                    surface is very diversified; the northern portion is largely mountainous, with
                    several fine broad valleys. In the southern portion a large area within the
                    great bend of the Snake river is occupied by an immense plain of basalt. South
                    of the Snake the country is an alternation of broad valleys and narrow abrupt
                    mountain ranges.</p>
                <p>The principal mountains are the Bitterroot and Salmon River chains, with their
                    spurs and subordinate ranges. They attain a height of from 8000 to nearly 10,000
                    feet. The Snake River plain lies south of these mountains, extending east and
                    west nearly across the territory. This is a field of basalt, seamed and
                    crevassed, with little vegetation, and that consisting principally of <hi
                    rend="italic">Artemisia.</hi> The soil here is a shifting sand; and there is
                    little surface water, as the streams sink and flow underneath.</p>
                <p>The principal river is the Snake, the south fork of the Columbia, It is a rapid
                    stream with numerous falls, three of which, the American, Shoshone, and Salmon
                    or Fishing, are very considerable. It is navigable only in its lower course.
                    Several of the branches of the Snake, the Salmon, Clearwater, and Spokane, are
                    large streams, but are not navigable, and are of value only for irrigation and
                    mining purposes.</p>
                <p>The climate, like that of other portions of the northwestern United States, is
                    characterized by great aridity of atmosphere and slight rainfall In the south
                    the aridity is such that large areas are almost desert; but in the mountainous
                    regions of the north the rainfall is much greater, and agricultural operations
                    can be carried on to some extent without irrigation. The northern part, being
                    principally mountainous, is covered with forests of conifers, chiefly species of
                    pine, spruce, fir, and tamarack. In the open valleys the vegetation consists
                    mainly of the varl··us kinds of grasses known collectively as “bunch grass.” On
                    the Snake River plains there is little vegetable growth <pb break="no"

                    the country south aud east of the Snake is covered with this and with grasses,
                    with a little scattered timber <hi rend="italic">{Coniferoe</hi> and aspens) on
                    the mountains. A rough estimate gives as the area covered by forest 40,000
                    square miles, by useful grasses 25,000 square miles, and by <hi rend="italic"
                    >Artemisia</hi> 21,300 square miles.</p>
                <p>Though the bison formerly ranged over this whole region, it is now practically
                    extinct. The moose is still occasionally seen, and, rarely the Rocky Mountain
                    goat <hi rend="italic">{Aploceras</hi><hi rend="italic">montanus').</hi> The
                    wapiti, the mountain sheep <hi rend="italic">{Ovis montana),</hi> and various
                    species of deer are still abundant in the mountains, while the antelope or
                    pronghorn abounds in the plains. Grizzly, black, and cinnamon bears, the
                    American panther, the wild cat, and the wolverine are not unfrequeutly met with
                    in the unsettled regions. Among the smaller quadrupeds, the prairie dog and
                    gopher are abundant in the valleys and on the plains. Birds of many species are
                    plentiful, especially in the mountain regions. Of reptiles, several species of
                    rattlesnakes and lizards, including horned toads <hi rend="italic"
                    >{Phryηosoma),</hi> are characteristic of the arid plains, where they are
                    numerous.</p>
                <p>The southern portion of this territory has been the scene of comparatively recent
                    volcanic action, which has covered enormous areas with basalt. The mountains of
                    this portion are mainly of the Silurian and Carboniferous ages. The ranges of
                    the northern portion are known to be mainly Eozoic; but the geology of that
                    section has yet to be investigated.</p>
                <p>The administration of the territory is in the hands of a governor, secretary, and
                    chief justice, all appointed by the president of the United States, and a
                    treasurer, comptroller, and superintendent of public instruction, who, as well
                    as the members of the two houses of the legislature, are elected by the people.
                    The territory is represented in Congress by a delegate, also elective. The
                    population in 1880 was 32,946, distributed thus in the several counties :—</p>

                <p>The principal settlements are Malade, Boisé (the capital of the territory),
                    Idaho, Buenavista, and Silver City.</p>
                <p>The agricultural, grazing, and mining interests of Idaho are but commencing their
                    development. In the valleys of the southern portion the Mormons are raising
                    abundant crops of cereals, with the aid of irrigation. In the valleys of the
                    lower Snake, the Boisé, Clearwater, Salmon, and Spokane rivers, wheat, oats,
                    rye, and other grains are cultivated to some extent. Large portions of the
                    territory are well adapted for grazing, and this is now being turned to
                    account.</p>
                <p>The mineral wealth has not yet, owing to difficulty of transportation, been
                    developed to any great extent: but it is known to be important. Gold and silver
                    are found, the former both in vein and in placer deposits. The principal vein
                    deposits now being worked are in the Salmon River and Owyhee mountains. Placers
                    have been worked in nearly every county of the territory, and have paid well.
                    During the year 1880 many new and rich deposits have been discovered in the Wood
                    River district, in the Salmon River mountains, and there has been a considerable
                    influx of mining population.</p>
                <p>The Utah and Northern Railroad crosses the south eastern portion of the
                    territory, from Utah to Montana.</p>
                <p>The total number of Indians in Idaho is about 6000, consisting of the tribes
                    known as the Nez Percé, Bannack, Shoshone, Coeur d’Alène, Spokane, Pend’
                    Oreille, and Kootenai. They are under the control of the Government, and most
                    are settled on reservations. <hi rend="smallcaps">(h. g.*)</hi> IDIOCY. See <hi
