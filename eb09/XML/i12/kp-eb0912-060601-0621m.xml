                <p><label type="entry">IBIS</label>, one of the most sacred birds of the ancient
                    Egyptians, which in modern times was identified by Bruce <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Travels, V.</hi> p. 173, pl.) with the <hi rend="italic">Abou-Hannes</hi> or
                    “Father John” of the Abyssinians, and in 1790 received from Latham <hi

                    >Tantalus eethiοpicus.</hi> This determination was placed beyond all question by
                    Cuvier <hi rend="italic">(Ann. du Museum,</hi> iv. pp. 116-135) and Savigny <hi

                    removal of the bird from the Linnaean genus <hi rend="italic">Tantalus</hi> to
                    be necessary, and, Lacépède having some years before founded a genus <hi
                    rend="italic">Ibis,</hi> it was transferred thither, and is now generally known
                    as <hi rend="italic">I.</hi><hi rend="italic">oethiopica,</hi> though some speak
                    of it as <hi rend="italic">I.</hi><hi rend="italic">religiosa.</hi> No useful
                    purpose would be served by dwelling on the vain attempts of older writers to
                    discover what the much venerated bird was, or on the other synonyms applied to
                    it by later ornithologists, some of whom (and among them the most recent) have
                    shewn little acquaintance with the literature of the subject. Nor can the Ibis
                    be here treated from a mythological or antiquarian point of view. Savigny’s
                    memoir above noticed contains a great deal of very interesting matter on the
                    subject. Wilkinson <hi rend="italic">(Ancient Egyptians,</hi> ser. 2, ii. pp.
                    217-224) has thereto added some of the results of modern research, and latest of
                    all Mr Renouf in his <hi rend="italic">Hibbert Lectτιres</hi> concisely explains
                    the origin of the myth.</p>
                <p>The Ibis is chiefly an inhabitant of the Nile basin in Nubia, from Dongola
                    southward, as well as of Kordofan and Sennaar; whence (according to Savigny,
                    whose opportunities for observation seem to have been greater than those enjoyed
                    by any European since his time) about midsummer, as the river rises, it moves
                    northwards to Egypt, and reaches the delta,<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    not unknown elsewhere among migratory birds. In Lower Egypt it bears the name of
                    <hi rend="italic">Abou-mengel,</hi> or “Father of the Sickle,” from the form of
                    its bill, but it does not stay long in that country, disappearing by all
                    accounts when the inundation has subsided. Hence doubtless arises the fact that
                    almost all European travellers have failed to meet with it there,<note

                    years ago <hi rend="italic">(Ibis,</hi> 1859, p. 51), that the Buff-backed

                    dragomans to do duty for the “Sacred Ibis,” and this seems to be no novel
                    practice, since by it, or something like it, Hasselqvist was misled, and through

                    which frequent the country in winter, and consequently writers have not been

                    The old story told to Herodotus of its destroying snakes is, according to
                    Savigny, devoid of truth,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"
                    ><p>The suggestion that the “flying serpents” whose remains were seen by
                    Herodotus were locusts is perhaps plausible, but there is considerable
                    difficulty in accepting it.</p></note> and that naturalist found, from
                    dissection of the examples he obtained, that its usual food was freshwater
                    univalve mollusks; but Cuvier asserts that he discovered partly digested remains
                    of a snake in the stomach of a mummied Ibis which he examined, and there can be
                    little doubt that insects and crustaceans, to say nothing of other living
                    creatures, enter on occasion into the bird’s diet.</p>
                <p>Tire Ibis is somewhat larger than a Curlew, <hi rend="italic">Numenius
                    arquata,</hi> which bird it in appearance calls to mind, with a much stouter
                    bill and stouter legs. The head and greater part of the neck are bare and black.
                    The plumage is white, except the primaries which are black, and a black plume,
                    formed by the secondaries, tertials, and lower scapulars, and richly glossed
                    with bronze, blue, and green, which curves gracefully over the hind-quarters.
                    The bill and feet are also black. The young lack the ornamental plume, and in
                    them the head and neck are clothed with short black feathers, while the bill is
                    yellow. The nest is placed in bushes or high trees, the bird generally building
                    in companies, and in the middle of August Von Heuglin <hi rend="italic"

                    error—especially among painters—that this bird was the Sacred Ibis of the
                    Egyptians. It was of course utterly unknown in the Old World until the discovery
                    of the New.</p></note><hi rend="italic">Eudocimus ruber,</hi> of America; but
                    here there is only room to mention more particularly the Glossy Ibis, <hi
                    rend="italic">Plegadis falciηellus,</hi> a species of very wide distribution in
                    both hemispheres, being found throughout the West Indies, Central and the
                    south-eastern part of North America, as well as in many parts of Europe (whence
                    it not unfrequently strays to the British islands), Africa, Asia, and Australia.
                    This bird, which is no doubt the second kind of Ibis spoken of by Herodotus, is
                    rather smaller than the Sacred Ibis, and mostly of a dark chestnut colour with
                    brilliant green and purple reflexions on the upper parts, exhibiting, however,
                    when young little of this glossiness. One of the most remarkable things about
                    this species is that it lays eggs of a deep sea-green colour, having wholly the
                    character of Heron’s eggs, and it is to be noticed that it often breeds in
                    company with Herons, while the eggs of all other Ibises whose eggs are known
                    resemble those of the Sacred Ibis. Congeneric with the Glossy Ibis, some three
                    or four other species, all from South America, have been described; but the
                    propriety of deeming them distinct is questioned by some authorities.</p>
                <p>Much as the Ibises resemble the Curlews externally, there is no real affinity
                    between them. The <hi rend="italic">Ibididoe</hi> are more nearly related to the
                    Storks, <hi rend="italic">Ciconiidoe,</hi> and still more to the Spoonbills, <hi
                    rend="italic">Plataleidoe,</hi> with which latter many systematists consider
                    them to form one group, the <hi rend="italic">Herni-glottides</hi> of Nitzsch.

                    the Curlews are Schizognathous. The true Ibises above spoken of are also to be
                    clearly separated from the Wood-Ibises, <hi rend="italic">Tantalidae,</hi> of
                    which there are four or five species, by several not unimportant structural
                    characters, which cannot here be particularized for want of space. Fossil
