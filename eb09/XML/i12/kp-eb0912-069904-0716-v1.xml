                    (1759-1814), a Ger man actor and dramatic author, was born in Hanover on the
                    19th of April 1759. His father was registrar at the war office of Hanover, and
                    intended that his son should be a clergyman. Young Iffland, however, preferred
                    the stage to theology, anl at the age of eighteen went to Gotha in order to
                    prepare himself fur a theatrical career. At that time the greatest actor in
                    Germany was Eckhof, a man of undoubted genius, for whom Lessing repeatedly
                    expressed the warmest admiration in his <hi rend="italic">Hamburgische
                        Dramaturgie.</hi> Iffland was fortunate enough to receive instruction from
                    him in Gotha, and under his guidance made such rapid progress that he was able
                    in 1779 to accept an engagement at the theatre in Mannheim, then the most famous
                    of the German theatres. He soon stood high in his profession, and extended his
                    reputation by frequently appearing at the leading theatres in different parts of
                    the country. In 1796 he settled in Berlin, where he became director of the
                    national theatre of Prussia; and in 1811 he was made general director of all
                    representations before royalty. On the 22d of September 1814 he died. His plays
                    are almost entirely destitute of imagination; but they display a thorough
                    mastery of the technical necessities of the stage, and a remarkable power of
                    devising effective situations His best characters are simple and natural, fond
                    of domestic life, but too much given to the utterance of sentimental
                    commonplace. His best known plays are <hi rend="italic">Die</hi><hi

                    represented. Iffland was a dramatic critic as well as a dramatic author, and
                    German actors place high value on the reasonings and hints respecting their art
                    which are to be found in his <hi rend="italic">Almanachfur das Theater.</hi> As
                    an actor he fell far short of his master, Eckhof, whose style was marked by
                    spontaneity and passion, while Iffland’s acting always bore traces of elaborate
                    study. Hence he failed in great tragical parts; but he was unexcelled in his day
                    in the skill with which he interpreted dramatic conceptions representing the
                    course of ordinary middle class life. Within these limits he was almost equally
                    distinguished in his capacity for rendering comic and pathetic effects. In
                    1798-1802 Iffland issued <pb break="no"
