                <p><label type="entry">ICELAND</label><hi> ICELAND</hi> (in Danish, <hi
                    rend="italic">Island')</hi> is an island in the North Atlantic Ocean,
                    immediately to the south of the polar circle. It extends from 63° 23' to 66° 33'
                    N. lat., and from 13° 22’ to 24° 35'W. long. Its distance from the north of
                    Scotland is 500 miles, from Norway 600 miles, and from Greenland 250 miles. The
                    greatest length of the island is 300 miles, from east to west, and its greatest
                    breadth 200 miles. The area is estimated at 39,200 square miles, 7000 more than
                    that of Ireland.</p>
                <p>The geological formation of the island is throughout volcanic. It rests on a
                    foundation of palagonite, or palagonite tufa, called in Icelandic “môberg”; and
                    on this foundation are raised plateaus of basalts, and mountains of trachyte and
                    other volcanic ejections. The whole island seems to have been filled up by
                    volcanic agency. In some of the mountains the lavas occur in tolerably regular
                    parallel strata or terraces, separated here and there by layers containing
                    lignite, as in the similar volcanic plateaus of Faroe and Greenland.</p>
                <p>The whole of the south coast, from Hornafjöröur in the south-east to Reykjanes in
                    the south-west, is entirely unbroken by bays or firths. If such ever existed,
                    they have been filled up by the glaciers and the sand and mud carried down from
                    the volcanic ice-mountains situated close to the south coast. The coast-line is
                    not, however, a straight line, but a broad arch, as the land swells out in the
                    middle southwards to a considerable extent. On the north of Reykjanes a broad
                    bay called Faxafléi (Faxi’s Bay) cuts into the land; it is bounded on the north
                    side by Snaefellsnes, and has an area of 54 miles by 30 On the north side of
                    Snaefellsnes the long Breiöifjöröur (Broadfirth) nearly cuts off the north-west
                    peninsula from the rest of the island; it is 80 miles long and 40 broad. The
                    Breiöifjöröur is noted for its great number of small islands, most of them
                    inhabited, and all of them affording breeding places for the eider duck. To the
                    north of the Breiöifjöröur, innumerable bays cut into the peninsula at every
                    turn, giving it somewhat the look of the outstretched hand of a man; the longest
                    of these is ÎsafjarÔardjùp (Icefirthdeep), 45 miles long. On the north side of
                    the island, between Horn (Cape North) on the west and Melrakkaslétta (Fox Plain)
                    on the east, there are several large firths. Furthest to the west is Hûnaflôi
                    (Bearcubs’ Bay), about 60 miles long, which nearly meets the Breiöifjöröur
                    running in from the west; the tongue of land which separates them and connects
                    the north-west peninsula with the rest of the island is hardly 5 miles broad.
                    The other firths on the north side are Skagafjöröur, Eyafjöröur (Firth of the
                    Isles) 36 miles long, Skjälfandafjöröur, and Axarfjöröur (Axefirth). The
                    Melrakkaslétta is separated from Langanes, the north-east point of Iceland, by
                    the pistilfjöröur (Thistlefirth). The whole of the east coast of the island is
                    indented by numerous narrow firths like those found in the north-west peninsula,
                    but none of them are of any great length. Sailing round the island from point to
                    point, the distance is 900 miles, but if we follow the coast-line it is not less
                    than 2000 miles.</p>
                <p>The centre of the island is a table-land, or rather a broad flattened ridge,
                    sloping down to the north and the south, the average height of which above the
                    level of the sea is about 2000 feet. It consists of arid sands and rugged tracts
                    of lava, the most important of which bear the names of ÔdâÔahraun (the Lava of
                    Evil Deeds), Sprengisandur (Bursting Sand), and Stérisandur (Big Sand). This
                    wilderness is frequently broken by high and extensive ice-hills called jökull
                    (plur. jöklar). The ice hills rise to the greatest height in the south-east,
                    where the most extensive ice-field in the island, called Vatnajökull, covers
                    about 4000 square miles. The outliers of this ice-field come close down to the
                    water, hardly leaving room for passage between them and the sea; some of these
                    are the loftiest summits in the island, as Ôraefajôkull, which is 6466 feet
                    high. South of the west end of the Vatnajökull, called Skaptärjökull, stretches
                    an inhabited slope, interrupted by several small hills, and intersected by
                    considerable streams. The eastmost part is called SiÖa; then follow Landbrot,
                    MeÖal-land, and Alptaver. West of this the land rises again in the Myrdalsjökull
                    and the Eyafjallajökull, the latter being 5593 feet high, and here again the
                    mountains come close down to the sea. West of the Eyafjallajökull is the largest
                    plain in the island, stretching westward to the mountain chain terminating in
                    the low cape of Reykjanes, and backed on the north side by several isolated
                    mountains, among which the far-famed Hecla is prominent; its height approaches
                    5000 feet. This plain consists of stretches of grass land and marshes, affording
                    abundance of grass for pasture and haymaking.</p>
                <p>The southern and part of the eastern coasts of Faxafléi, as far as Reykjavik, are
                    very barren and desolate, being almost entirely rugged lava tracts; but the
                    lower parts of the hills then begin to be clothed with grass, affording pasture
                    for sheep, cattle, and horses. North of Reykjavik is a long and narrow firth
                    called HvalfjörÖur (Whalefirth), and further on a shorter one called
                    Borgarfjöröur (Burghfirth). Between the extremity of the latter and the central
                    highlands there is a large and fertile district, consisting of grassy valleys,
                    divided by low hills, and an extensive plain covered with marshy grasslands.
                    This district is a fair specimen of many of the inhabited parts of Iceland. The
                    level land, the valley bottoms along the river banks, and in many cases the
                    slopes of the hills, are covered with grass, but the soil is too frequently
                    boggy and marshy. The hills are partly covered with heather, and in a few places
                    with stunted dwarf birch. Districts similar in character to Borgarfjöröur are
                    the Dalir (Dales) on the south side of Breiöifjöröur, the Hûnavatnssÿsla on the
                    south side of Hûnaflôi, the Skagafjöröur, the FljétsdalshéraÔ on the east side
                    of the island, and the western half of the plain lying between Eyafjallajökull
                    and the Reykjanes range of mountains. The north-west peninsula consists, as
                    already stated, of narrow firths divided by high and narrow mountain ridges,
                    seldom lower than 2000 feet. In some places the top is a thin rocky edge; in
                    others it consists of sharp-pointed peaks, denuded of all vegetation. Even at a
                    considerable distance the different rocky strata may be distinguished. Sometimes
                    these hills, or rather cliffs, rise perpendicularly out of the water to a height
                    of a couple of thousand feet, affording breeding-places to an immense number of
                    sea-fowl. More frequently the lower parts of these razor-backed hills slope
                    towards the firths, the stony slopes being partly covered with grass or heather.
                    The farms are therefore found along the shores and in short valleys cutting into
                    the hills from the ends of the firths. The east coasts of Iceland present
                    exactly the same character as that of the north-west peninsula. From the end of
                    Eyafjöröur a long and fertile valley, bounded on both sides by lofty mountains,
                    runs due south into the country for about 25 miles. The north-east corner of the
                    island, called pingeyarsysla, has good sheep pasturage, although its hills and
                    slopes are covered with heather instead of grass to a greater extent than most
                    other districts of the island. It will thus be seen that the inhabited parts run
                    round the coasts, and from <pb break="no"

                    farthest inland being about 50 miles from the sea.</p>
                <p>As the snow-line is at an altitude of from 2500 to 3000 feet, all the highest
                    mountain-tops are cones covered with perpetual snow. Besides the ice-mountains
                    already mentioned, there are several on the western part of the central
                    highlands, such as Hofsjökull, Langjökull, Eiriksjökull, &amp;c.;
                    Snaefellsjôkull, at the point of the peninsula separating the Faxaflôi and
                    Breiftifjöröur, reaches the height of 4713 feet. All these mountains are
                    snow-capped. Most parts of the island are studded with hills ranging in height
                    from 2000 to 3000 feet. The tops are usually bare and rocky, but the slopes are
                    to some extent covered with grass and heather.</p>
                <p>Most of the mountains of Iceland have been volcanoes, and at least twenty-five of
                    them have been active within the historical period of the island, that is, the
                    last 1000 years. It was observed by Mackenzie that there are two volcanic
                    formations in the island, one consisting of flat sheets of basalt, the other of
                    more irregular hilly accumulations of trachyte, obsidian, ashes, and other
                    volcanic masses. The former of these, there can be little doubt, is of Tertiary
                    age—a part of the great Miocene volcanic plateaus, which on the one hand extend
                    southwards through the Faroe Islands and the west of Scotland to the north of
                    Ireland, and on the other stretch northwards and westwards far into Greenland.
                    The other volcanic masses are of recent date. Iceland has thus been the theatre
                    of volcanic activity at two widely separated periods, though we do not yet know
                    whether during the interval the activity was wholly dormant. Of the existing
                    volcanic mountains the best known is Hecla, from which eighteen eruptions have
                    been recorded; the last took place in 1845-46. The intervals between the
                    eruptions have varied greatly; sometimes it has remained quiet for six years
                    only, at other times for seventy-two years. As with most other volcanoes, the
                    height of this mountain varies with the eruptions. Thus before the eruption of
                    1845 its height was given on Gunlaugsson’s map as 4951 feet, while Kjerulf
                    measured the mountain in 1850, and found it to be only 4532 feet. The earliest
                    historical eruption, that of 1104, is celebrated as the “sand-rain winter,” the
                    second, in 1158, as the “great darkness,” from the quantity of ashes ejected.
                    One feature of the Icelandic eruptions, not from Hecla only, but from other
                    orifices in the island, has been the prodigious quantity of fine dust discharged
                    and the great distance to which this material has been carried. Thus in the year
                    1766 a column of ashes rose out of the crater of Hecla to a height of 16,000
                    feet into the air. Volcanic dust from the Icelandic vents has frequently been
                    borne by upper air currents so as to fall upon the Faroe Islands, and has even
                    been carried in considerable quantities as far as Norway on the one side and the
                    north of Scotland on the other. Next to Hecla, the Katla, or Kötlugjä, in
                    Myrdalsjökull may be mentioned; its last eruption (the thirteenth known) took
                    place in 1860. The most tremendous volcanic outbreak in Iceland was that which
                    took place in 1783 in or near the Skaptàrjôkull, on the north-west border of the
                    Vatnajökull. Two principal lava streams flowed from it: one of them was 50 miles
                    in length, from 12 to 15 miles in breadth, and 100 feet deep, and the other was
                    40 miles in length. It has been calculated that these two streams cover an area
                    of 420 square miles. This eruption destroyed directly or indirectly one-sixth of
                    the inhabitants of the whole island, or one-half of all the live stock. From
                    nearly all the outliers of the Vatnajökull eruptions now and then take place. To
                    the north of Vatnajökull a range of volcanic centres extends as far as Myvatn.
                    The last outbreak here took place in 1875, when fine volcanic dust was
                    discharged in great quantity, some of it being carried as far as Norway. The sea
                    around the coasts of Iceland has been frequently disturbed by volcanic
                    outbreaks, especially off Cape Reykjanes.</p>
                <p>On account of the same volcanic activity, hot springs are frequently met with
                    throughout the island. The common name for them in Icelandic is “hverr”
                    (cauldron). The chief of these hot springs is Geysir (Gusher). See <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Geysers.</hi></p>
                <p>The only mineral worked to any extent in Iceland is sulphur; the principal mines
                    are those of Krisuvik and Mÿvatn. Of the Iceland spar used for polarizing
                    optical instruments, only one mine has been worked, that of Helgusta5ir in the
                    east of the island. Limestone is found near Reykjavik, and has been worked a few
                    years. Ironore is found in many parts of the island, but not in paying
                    quantities, as suitable fuel is wanting. Aluminium occurs near Cape Reykjanes,
                    but no attempt has been made to work the mine. Coal has also been found in one
                    place, but has not been worked. There are considerable quantities of lignite,
                    called in Icelandic surtarbrandur, in the north-west peninsula; some successful
                    attempts have been made to use it as fuel, but it has not been worked to any
                    extent. Peat is found, and is used as fuel, in most parts of the island.</p>
                <p>Iceland is rich in streams and rivers, some of them carrying a large volume of
                    water; as, however, the fall is steep in every case, they are not navigable even
                    by small boats. The longest are pjérsâ, running southwards from the central
                    highlands, and Skjâlfandafljét and Jôkulsâ ά Fjöllum in the north-east, running
                    northward. The last-named river is 113 miles in length, the other two 108 miles
                    each. Of other rivers may be mentioned the Hvit⅛, part of which is called
                    Olfusâ, running nearly parallel with pjérsâ, Hvïtâ in BorgarfjörÖur, Blanda
                    running into Hûna-fléi, HéraSsvôtn in SkagafjörÖur, and Lagarfljét in the east.
                    There are several rivers named Hvit&lt;4 (white river), so called from their
                    milky waters, caused by the glacial •mixtures carried down from the highlands.
                    The principal waterfalls are—Skégafoss and Seljalandsfoss, south of
                    Eyafjallajökull, Godafoss in Skjâlfandafljét, and Dettifoss in Jôkulsâ â
                    Fjöllum. Of the lakes pingvallavatn, about 25 miles north-east of Reykjavik, and
                    Mÿvatn in the north-east of Iceland are the largest. The former is 25 miles in
                    circumference, and the latter 36 miles; its waters are studded with thirty-four
                    small islands, affording breeding-places to ∙a large number of water-fowl.</p>
                <p>The climate of Iceland is not nearly so severe as might be supposed from the
                    latitude. At Reykjavik the mean temperature of the year is 39° Fahr., of the
                    summer 53° and of the winter 29° 18'. The temperature of Akureyri is 32° for the
                    year, that of the summer 45° 5' and the winter 20° 7'. There is therefore great
                    difference between the north and the south of the island. Another difference may
                    also be noticed; while the climate of the south is wet and variable, that of the
                    north is dry and regular. The mean temperature of different years sometimes
                    varies as much as 10°, and the mean temperature of the same month has been known
                    to vary as much as 27°. One feature in the climate has been noticed by all
                    travellers, that is, the clearness and purity of the atmosphere, rivalling that
                    of Italy, mountains being seen distinctly at a distance of 100 miles. The
                    rainfall is considerable in the south and the east of the island, and
                    snow-storms and gales are frequent in winter. Thunderstorms occur mostly in
                    winter.</p>
                <p>No cereal is grown in Iceland, but in some places there is found a kind of wild
                    oats <hi rend="italic">(Avena αrtηαriα),</hi> called in Icelandic “melur.”
                    Potatoes, carrots, turnips, and several kinds of cabbage have lately been
                    cultivated with considerable success. The grasses, wild and cultivated, are of
                    the greatest importance to the inhabitants. The only trees found are the dwarf
                    birch, rarely higher than 12 feet, and <pb break="no"

                    Iceland is small and delicate, with bright bloom, the heaths being especially
                    admired. Wild crowberries and bilberries are the only kind of fruit found in the
                    island.</p>
                <p>The only wild animal in Iceland is the fox, of which both white and blue
                    varieties occur; they are hunted for their skins, and also because they often
                    attack the sheep. The domestic animals are the cow, the horse, the sheep, the
                    dog, and the cat. The cows are of a small breed, resembling English shorthorns
                    in general, and especially Alderneys. The horses are also of a small breed, the
                    average height being twelve hands; they are hardy and enduring; many of them are
                    never housed, and forage for themselves as best as they can throughout the
                    winter. They are exported to Great Britain in considerable numbers, for use in
                    the coal mines. The sheep generally are of nearly the same size as the Scotch
                    blackfaced sheep; they are not unfrequently sβv,n with three or four horns. The
                    genuine Iceland dog, with his pointed snout, short ears, curled tail, and short
                    legs, has some resemblance to the Esquimaux dog and the Scotch collie. Reindeer
                    were imported in the last century, but they fled to the mountains and became
                    wild; they are now nearly extinct. There are said to be ninety different species
                    of birds, fifty-four of them being water-fowl. The most remarkable of the birds
                    of prey are the Icelandic falcon <hi rend="italic">(Falco islandicus)</hi> and
                    the eagle. The only game bird is the ptarmigan, which is brown in summer and
                    white in winter. Of the water-fowl the eider duck is of the greatest importance
                    on account of its valuable down; the killing of it is therefore forbidden by
                    law. Immense numbers of gulls, puffins, and guillemots are seen near their
                    breeding places on the small islands and on the cliffs round the coasts. The
                    hooper, or whistling swan, is found in large numbers in Iceland. The sea round
                    the coast teems with cod, haddock, holibut, and the basking shark; the
                    fin-backed-whale and seals of various kinds are also met with, but in smaller
                    numbers. In the lakes and rivers salmon and trout are caught in considerable
                    quantities.</p>
                <p>As no corn is grown, there is no agriculture to speak of, and only a little spade
                    husbandry connected with the cultivation of kitchen gardens, where potatoes,
                    turnips, and carrots are grown. The area thus under cultivation covers,
                    according to the latest official returns, about 215 English acres throughout the
                    island. The cultivation of the soil in Iceland can hardly indeed be said to have
                    been attempted; such experiments, however, as have been made, have given good
                    hope of success. Around every farmhouse is a field called “tùn,” which is but
                    rarely enclosed or fenced. This is the only part of the land which is cultivated
                    at all, and all that is done there is to spread dung on the top of the soil in
                    autumn and scrape it off in spring. Even this most primitive cultivation makes
                    the grass twenty-five to fifty per cent, better than elsewhere. The haymaking
                    season extends from the middle of July to the 20th of September. The grass is
                    cut with small scythes, first in the home field, and then on the uncultivated
                    grass-lands belonging to the farms. Many of the fishermen hire themselves to the
                    farmers during the haymaking season; and during the fishing season the farmers
                    send their servants to the sea-coast to fish.</p>
                <p>According to the latest official returns the cattle in the island numbered
                    20,378, the horses (ponies) 31,312, and the sheep 415,339. It is obvious,
                    however, from the quantities of wool exported that the number of sheep must be
                    at least double that stated in the returns.</p>
                <p>The manufactures are confined to spinning, weaving, and knitting the wool of the
                    sheep. A sort of tweed, called in Icelandic “vaftmal,” is the principal clothing
                    of the inhabitants. The spinning of the yarn is done by the women in winter, and
                    almost every farm has an old-fashioned loom. In the north considerable
                    quantities of jackets and stockings are knitted and exported.</p>
                <p>The trade with Iceland is entirely in the hands of Danish traders and a few
                    Icelanders—who mostly reside in Copenhagen. It consists almost entirely in
                    exchange, or barter. The principal exports of the Icelanders are cod fish, about
                    6,000,000 ft&gt; annually; train oil, 9500 barrels; wool, 1,500,000 5); eider
                    down, 7000 lb; and feathers, 20,000 lb. Ponies are now exported to
                    Scotland,—about 2000 a year; and a few cargoes of live sheep have been sent over
                    during the last two years. All bread stuffs have to be imported, as well as
                    groceries, spirits, wines, and beer, tobacco, salt, building materials, and
                    other items. Since 1854 the trade has been open to all nations; but any vessel
                    trading with Iceland had to take out a sea pass at the cost of 2s. 3d. per ton
                    down to 1879, when this duty was abolished. On the other hand, a trifling duty
                    has been laid on spirits and tobacco.</p>
                <p>There being no roads in the island, but merely tracks trodden down by the feet of
                    the ponies, there are no carts nor carriages of any description. In the firths
                    boats are chiefly used for conveying goods and passengers; but all inland
                    communication and conveyance is by ponies. These hardy animals carry each a
                    burden of about 200 lb weight, under which they walk about 25 miles a day. All
                    travelling is also on ponies; two are considered necessary for every traveller,
                    and on them he can make from 30 to 40 miles a day.</p>
                <p>Formerly Iceland was divided into four quarters, the east, the south, the west,
                    and north. Now the north and the east are united under one governor, and the
                    south and the west under another. The island is further divided into 18 sÿslur
                    (counties), and these again into 169 hreppur (rapes) or poor law districts.
                    Ecclesiastically Iceland constitutes one bishopric, divided into 20 deaneries,
                    and these again into 290 parishes.</p>
                <p>Iceland is subject to the king of Denmark. According to the constitution granted
                    to Iceland in 1874, the king shares the legislative power with the Al-thing, an
                    assembly of 36 members, 30 of whom are elected by household suffrage, and 6
                    nominated by the king. The Al-thing meets every second year, and sits in two
                    divisions, the upper and the lower. The upper division consists of the 6 members
                    nominated by the king and 6 elected by the representatives of the people out of
                    their own body. The lower division consists of the remaining 24 representative
                    members.</p>
                <p>The secretary for Iceland, who resides in Copenhagen, is responsible to the king
                    and the Al-thing for the maintenance of the constitution, and he submits to the
                    king for confirmation the legislative measures proposed by the Al-thing. The
                    king appoints a governor-general, who is resident in the island and carries on
                    the government on the responsibility of the secretary in Copenhagen. Under the
                    governor-general (landshofδingi) are two under governors, one for the south and
                    west, another for the north and east. Under these are the sheriffs (sÿslumenn),
                    who act as tax gatherers, notaries public, and judges of first instance; the
                    sheriff has in every “hreppur” an assistant, called “hreppstjôri.” In every
                    hreppur there is also a representative committee, consisting of from three to
                    five members, who administer the poor laws, and look after the general concerns
                    of the hreppur. These committees are controlled by the committees of the sÿslur
                    (county boards), and these again are under the control of theamtsrAδ (quarter
                    board), consisting of three members.</p>
                <p>The administration of justice is carried out in the first instance by the
                    sheriffs. From the sheriff courts appeals lie to the superior court at
                    Reykjavik, consisting of three judges. Appeals may be taken in all criminal
                    cases and most civil cases from this court to the supreme court at
                    Copenhagen.</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit12newyrich/page/n636/mode/1up"

                <p>The state church of Iceland is the Lutheran; and all the Icelanders, without
                    exception, belong to it. One bishop and 141 clergymen minister to the spiritual
                    wants of the islanders. The bishop is appointed by the king. The parishes are
                    290, but the livings are only 141, from which it may be seen that many ministers
                    have to serve two, and some even three parishes. The king appoints some of the
                    ministers, and the governor-general others, with the advice of the bishop. The
                    ministers are paid partly from the revenues of church property, and partly from
                    tithes.</p>
                <p>The Icelanders have long been famous for their education and learning, and it is
                    no exaggeration to say that in no other country is such an amount of information
                    found among the classes which occupy a similar position. A child of ten unable
                    to read is not to be found from one end of the island to another. A peasant
                    understanding several languages is no rarity, and the amount of general
                    information which they possess might be envied by many who have had greater
                    facilities for acquiring knowledge. Till within the last few years there were no
                    elementary schools in the island; all children were taught by their parents or
                    near neighbours. Now a few elementary schools have been started, but their
                    number is still too small to make any general' difference in the education. For
                    classical and general education there is a college at Reykjavik, with seven
                    professors and about one hundred students. There is also a college for
                    ministers, with three professors. The general physician of the island, assisted
                    by two medical men, gives lectures to medical students; but those who propose to
                    enter the legal profession have to attend the university of Copenhagen.</p>
                <p>There is less difference in the material prosperity of the Icelanders than in
                    that of the inhabitants of more advanced countries. One does not find the abject
                    poverty so often seen in large towns and among the agricultural population of
                    some of the most civilized countries of Europe. On the other hand, wealthy men,
                    or owners of extensive properties, are unknown, the richest man in Iceland
                    deriving only £300 a year from his property. Although no abject poverty is seen,
                    there are more paupers comparatively than in more populous countries, and the
                    poor-rates in many parishes exceed all the other taxes put together. The
                    Icelanders are often too liberal in granting relief, which in many cases breeds
                    idleness, carelessness, and want of forethought. It is also to be noticed that
                    in few countries is it so easy to live with as little labour as in Iceland. On
                    account of the climate, out-of-door work cannot be conducted for more than five
                    months of the year at most, but even this time is not used with so much energy
                    and skill as it might be. The haymaking, carried on for two months in the year,
                    is the only work which is prosecuted with anything like energy. Fishing is
                    prosecuted not continuously but periodically. The want of activity among the
                    Icelanders is to be ascribed partly to their slow temperament, and partly to
                    their utter want of training. They are very fond of gathering any amount of
                    miscellaneous information, but their want of training prevents them from turning
                    it to practical account. There is no doubt that they are endowed with
                    intellectual faculties of a superior kind, and, with proper training, might make
                    far more of their country than they do at present. It appears that the island
                    could easily support eight times the number of the present population, if its
                    resources were properly developed. Crime is rare; and the moral character of the
                    Icelanders is about the same as that of the other countries of the north.</p>
                <p>The census of 1870 returned the population of the island as 69,763. In 1801 the
                    population was only 46,240; in 1880 it is estimated to have increased to 73,000.
                    The birth-rate is about 33 per thousand, and the death-rate 24. Nearly the whole
                    of the population live on isolated farms, the number of each family, including
                    servants, being on an average seven. The chief town or village is Reykjavik,
                    with about 2500 inhabitants. It is the seat of the governor-general, the bishop,
                    the colleges, and the superior court. In the north-west is ïsafjôriSur, with
                    about 400 inhabitants, and in the north Akureyri, with the same number. <hi

                <p>With its isolated situation, inclement climate, scant natural advantages, and
                    sparse population, Iceland is yet of high interest to the historian,
                    philologist, and <hi rend="italic">littérateur.</hi> To the first the excellence
                    and exactitude of its historical records, the curious phases of life to which
                    they bear witness, and the singular circumstances which have determined the
                    existence and life of the Teutonic community for a. thousand years apart from
                    the rest of the European family, are all attractive. By the philologist the
                    island is reverenced as the home of a tongue which (though like our own it has
                    suffered deep phonetic change) yet most nearly represents in a living form the
                    tongue of our earliest Teutonic forefathers. And by many more than these
                    students Iceland is fondly regarded as the land where, long before <pb
                    break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit12newyrich/page/n637/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0912-0637-0620"/> the “literary eras” of England or Germany, a
                    brilliant period of intellectual life produced and elaborated in its own
                    distinct form of expression a literature superior to any north of the Alps
                    before the Renaissance since the downfall of Old Rome in power, purity, and
                    life.</p>
                <p>To begin with history, in which we are chiefly concerned with the first and
                    fourth periods of the island’s inhabited existence, and first the “settlement.”
                    Shortly after the discovery of Iceland by the Scandinavian, c. 850 (it had long
                    been inhabited by a small colony of Irish Culdees), a stream of immigration set
                    in towards it, which lasted for sixty years, and resulted in the establishment
                    of some 4000 homesteads scattered round the habitable fringe about the great
                    bays and firths.</p>
                <p>In this immigration three distinct streams can be traced. (1) About 870-890 four
                    great noblemen from Norway, Ingolf, Ketil Haeng, Skalla-Grim, and Thorolf,
                    settled with their dependants in the south-west of the new found land. (2) In
                    890-900 there came from the Western Islands Queen Aud, widow of Olaf the White,
                    king of Dublin, preceded and followed by a number of her kinsmen and relations
                    (many like herself being Christians), Helgi Biolan, Biorn the Eastern, Helgi the
                    Lean, Ketil the Foolish, &amp;c., who settled the best land in the island (west,
                    north-west, and north), and founded families who long swayed its destinies.
                    Besides this most important immigration of all there came from the Western
                    Islands a fellowship of vikings seeking a free home in the north. They had
                    colonized the west in the viking times; they had “fought at Hafursfirth,”
                    helping their stay-at-home kinsmen against the centralization of the great
                    head-king, who, when he had crushed opposition in Norway, sailed after these
                    turbulent colonists across the North Sea, and followed up his victory by
                    compelling them to bow to his rule or fly again to fresh haunts whence they
                    could not so easily interfere with his projects. Such were Ingimund the Old,
                    Geirmund Hellskin, Thord Beardie (who had wed St Edmund’s grand-daughter), Audun
                    Shackle, Bryniulf the Old, Uni, to whom Harold promised the earldom of the new
                    land if he could make the settlers acknowledge him as king, a hopeless project,
                    and others by whom the north-west, north, and east were almost completely
                    “claimed.” (3) In 900-930 a few more incomers direct from Norway completed the
                    settlement of the south, north-east, and south-east. Among them were Earl
                    Hrollaug (half brother of Hrolf Ganger and of the first earl of Orkney), Hialti,
                    Hrafnkell Frey’s priest, and the sons of Asbiorn. Fully three quarters of the
                    land was settled from the west, and among these immigrants there was no small
                    proportion of Irish blood. In 1100 there were 4500 franklins, <hi rend="italic"
                    >i.e.,</hi> about 50,000 souls.</p>
                <p>The unit of Icelandic politics is the homestead with its franklinowner <hi
                    rend="italic">(buendi),</hi> its primal organization the hundred-moot <hi
                    rend="italic">(thing),</hi> its tie the <hi rend="italic">go&lt;forif</hi> or
                    chieftainship. The chief who had led a band of kinsmen and dependants to the new
                    land, taken a “claim” there, and parcelled it out freely among them, naturally
                    became their leader, presiding as priest at the temple feasts and sacrifices of
                    heathen times, acting as president and speaker of their moot, and as their
                    responsible representative towards the neighbouring chiefs and their clients. He
                    was not a feudal lord nor a local sheriff, for any franklin could change his
                    go^δort&gt; when he would, and the rights of “judgment by peers” were in full
                    use; moreover, the office could be bequeathed, sold, divided, or pledged by the
                    possessor; still the goδi had considerable power and influence as long as the
                    commonwealth lasted.</p>
                <p>At first there was no higher organization, but disputes between neighbouring
                    chiefs and their clients, and uncertainty as to the law, brought about the <hi
                    rend="italic">Constitution of Ulfiiot, c.</hi> 930, which appointed a central
                    moot for the whole island, the Al-thing, and a speaker to speak a single “law”
                    (principally that followed by the Gula-moot in Norway); the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Reforms of</hi><hi rend="italic">Thord</hi><hi rend="italic">Gellir,</hi> 964,
                    settling a fixed number of local moots and chieftaincies, dividing the island
                    into four quarters (thus characterized by Ari :—north, thickest settled, most
                    famous; east, first completely settled; south, best land and greatest chiefs;
                    west, remarkable for noble families), to each of which a headcourt, the
                    “quarter-court,” was assigned; and the <hi rend="italic">Innovations of
                    Skapti</hi> (ascribed in the saga to Niai) <hi rend="italic">the
                    Law-Speaker</hi> (d. 1030), who set up a “fifth court” as the ultimate tribunal
                    in criminal mattem, and strengthened the community against the chiefs. But here
                    constitutional growth ceased: the law-making body made few and unimportant
                    modifications of custom; the courts were still too weak for the chiefs who
                    misused and defied them; the speaker’s power was not sufficiently supported to
                    enable him to be any more than a highly respected lord chief justice, whereas he
                    ought to have become a <hi rend="italic">justiza</hi> if anarchy was to be
                    avoided; even the ecclesiastical innovations, while they secured peace for a
                    time, provoked in the end the struggles which put an end to the
                    commonwealth.</p>
                <p>Christianity was introduced <hi rend="italic">c.</hi> 1000. Tithes were
                    established in 1096, and an ecclesiastical code made <hi rend="italic">c.</hi>
                    1125.</p>
                <p>The first disputes about the jurisdiction of the clergy were moved by Gudmund in
                    the 13th century, bringing on a civil war, while the questions of patronage and
                    rights over glebe and mortmainland occupied Bishop Ami and his adversaries fifty
                    years afterwards, when the land was under Norwegian viceroys and Norwegian law.
                    For the civil wars of the 13th century broke down and exterminated the great
                    houses who had monopolized the chieftaincies and abused their power for their
                    own ends; and after violent straggles (in which the Sturlungs of the first
                    generation perished at Orlygstad, 1238, and Reykiaholt, 1241, while of the
                    second generation Thord Kakali was called away by the king in 1250, and Thorgils
                    Skardi slain in 1258) the submission of the island, quarter after quarter, took
                    place in 1262-64, under Gizur’s auspices, and the old Common Law was replaced by
                    the New Norse Code “Ironside” in 1271.</p>
                <p>The political life and law of the old days is abundantly illustrated in the sagas
                    (especially Eyrbyggia, Haensa-Thori, Reyk-daela, Hrafnkell, and Niala), the two
                    collections of law-scrolls <hi rend="italic">(Codex Regius, c.</hi> 1235, and
                    <hi rend="italic">Stadarhol's Book, c.</hi> 1271), the Libellus, the
                    Liber-fragments, and the Landnamabok of Ari, and the Diplomatarium. K. Maurer
                    has made the subject his own in his <hi rend="italic">Beiträge,</hi><hi

                <p>The mediaeval Icelandic church had two bishoprics, Skalholt (S.,W., and E.) 1056,
                    and Holar (N.) 1106, and about 175 parishes (two-thirds of which belonged to the
                    southern bishopric). They belonged to the metropolitan see of Bremen, then to
                    Lund, lastly to Nidaros, 1237. There were several religious foundations:
                    Thingore (founded 1133), Thwera (1155), Hitardale (&lt;,∙. 1166), Kirkby Nunnery
                    (1184), Stad Nunnery (1296), and Saurby <hi rend="italic">(c.</hi> 1200) were
                    Benedictine, while Ver (1168), Flatey after Holyfell (1172), Videy (1226),
                    Madderfield Priory (1296), and Skrid Priory (14th century) were Augustinian. The
                    bishops, elected by the people at the Al-thing till 1237, enjoyed considerable
                    power and influence, and were most of them distinguished men; two, Thorlak of
                    Skalholt and John of Holar, were publicly voted saints at the Al-thing after due
                    examination of their claims to that distinction, and one, Gudmund, received the
                    title of “Good” by decree of the bishop and chapter. Full details as to
                    ecclesiastical history will be found in the <hi rend="italic">Bishops'
                    Lives</hi> (edited by Dr Vigfusson).</p>
                <p>Iceland was not agricultural but pastoral, depending upon flocks and herds for
                    subsistence, for, though rye and other grain would grow in favoured localities,
                    the hay, self-sown, was the only regular crop. In some districts the fisheries
                    and fowling were of importance, but nine-tenths of the population lived by their
                    sheep and cattle, which gave them food, clothing, and such products for export
                    as enabled them to import wood for building, iron for tools, and a few luxuries,
                    as honey, wine, grain for brewing, and foreign clothes, fur, &amp;c. Life on
                    each homestead was regularly portioned out :—out-door occupations—fishing,
                    shepherding, fowling, and the important haymaking and fuel-gathering—occupying
                    the summer; while in-door business—weaving, tool-making, &amp;c., filled up the
                    long winter. The year was broken by the spring feasts and moots, the great
                    Al-thing meeting at midsummer, the marriage and arval gatherings after the
                    summer, and the long yule feasts at midwinter. There were but two degrees of
                    men, free and un free, though only the franklins had any political power; and,
                    from the very nature of the life, social intercourse was peculiarly unrestrained
                    and unfettered; go'δi and thrall lived the same lives, ate the same food, spoke
                    the same tongue, and differed little in clothing or habits. The poorest franklin
                    was the social equal of the proudest chief, and in a few generations the freed
                    man or landless dependant might become their peer in public estimation, provided
                    he got a homestead of his own. The thrall had a house of his own and was rather
                    villein or serf than slave, having rights and a legal price by law. During the
                    heathen days many of the great chiefs passed part of their lives in Norway at
                    the king’s court, blit after the establishment of Christianity in Iceland they
                    kept more at home, still visiting the Continent, however, for purposes of state,
                    suits with clergy, &amp;c. But the trade was from the first in foreign (Norse)
                    hands almost entirely.</p>
                <p>The introduction of a church system brought little change. The great families put
                    their members into orders, and so continued to enjoy the profits of the land
                    which they had given to the church; the priests married and otherwise behaved
                    like the franklins around them in every-day matters, farming, trading, going to
                    law like laymen; so that, in spite of the efforts of the more earnest church
                    reformers, the church was powerless to promote centralization against the feuds
                    and jealousies of the great houses.</p>
                <p>The old life in the commonwealth was turbulent and anarchic, but free and varied;
                    it produced men of mark, and fostered bravery, adventure, and progress. The
                    great chiefs were indeed only greater franklins; but their wealth and
                    comparative luxury gave them leisure and opportunities for culture which raised
                    them as examples and leaders above their fellows; the pride of birth preserved a
                    nobility of feeling and high standard of honour amid much of violence and
                    chicane. But all this now ceased, and there was left but a low dead level of
                    poor peasant proprietors without pride in the past, political interest in the
                    present, or ambition of the future, careless of all save how to live by as
                    little labour as possible, and pay as few taxes as they could to their foreign
                    rulers. The island received a foreign governor <hi rend="italic">(Earl,
                    Hirdstjori,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Stiptamtsrnadr</hi> as he has been
                    successively called), and was parcelled out into local counties <hi

                    >(syslwmadr)</hi> appointed by the king. A royal court took the place of the
                    Al-thing courts; <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0912-0638-0621"/> the local business of the local things was
                    carried out by the <hi rend="italic">{hreppstjori)</hi> bailiff, a subordinate
                    of the sheriff; and the go'δor'δ, things, quarter-courts, trial by jury,
                    &amp;c., were all completely swept away by these innovations, which have
                    continued with mere changes of detail till the present century. The power of the
                    crown was increased by the confiscation of the great Sturlung estates, which
                    were under-leased to farmers, while the early falling off of the Norse trade
                    threatened to deprive the island of the means of existence; for the great
                    epidemics and eruptions of the 14th century had gravely attacked its pastoral
                    wealth and ruined much of its pasture and fishery, for the time at least. The
                    union of the Three Crowns transferred the practical rule of Iceland to Denmark
                    in 1280, and the old Treaty of Union, by which the island had reserved its
                    essential rights, was disregarded by the absolute Danish monarchs; but, though
                    new taxation was imposed, it was rather their careless neglect than their too
                    active interference that damaged Iceland’s interests. But for an English trade,
                    which sprung up out of the half-smuggling, half-buccaneering enterprise of the
                    Bristol merchants, the island would have fared badly indeed, for during the
                    whole 15th century their trade with England, exporting sulphur, eider down
                    (which the English taught them the value of), wool, and salt stock-fish, and
                    importing as before wood, iron, honey, wine, grain, and flax goods, was their
                    only link with the outer world. This period of Iceland’s existence is torpid and
                    eventless: she had got peace but with few of its blessings; all spirit seemed to
                    have died with the commonwealth; even shepherding and such agriculture as there
                    had been sank to a lower stage; waggons, ploughs, and carts went out of use and
                    knowledge; architecture in timber became a lost art, and the fine carved and
                    painted halls of the heathen days were replaced by turf-walled barns half sunk
                    in the earth, and lasting at best a generation; the large decked luggers of the
                    old days gave way to small undecked fishing-boats; it is needless to add that
                    letters were neglected, and that all remembrance of the commonwealth perished
                    utterly.</p>
                <p>The Reformation here as elsewhere had a one-sided effect: it wakened men’s minds,
                    opening new vistas of hope and new fields of thought, but it left their bodies
                    and circumstances little changed, or, if at all, for the worse. Its necessary
                    complement, a social and political revolution, never came to Iceland. The Hanse
                    trade replaced the English for the worse; and the wretched Danish monopoly which
                    succeeded it when the Danish kings began to act again with vigour, under the
                    stimulus of European changes, was still less profitable. The glebes and hospital
                    lands were a fresh power in the hands of the crown, and the subservient Lutheran
                    clergy became the most powerful class in the island, while the bad system of
                    under-leasing at rackrent and short lease with unsecured tenant right extended
                    in this way over a great part, at least a quarter, of the better land, stopping
                    any possible progress. The details of the religious change are uninteresting:
                    nearly all who took active part in it on either side were men of low type, moved
                    by personal motives rather than religious zeal; and, though it should be noticed
                    that the fires of martyrdom were never lighted in Iceland, the story of the
                    easily accepted Reformation is not altogether a pleasant one. When it was once
                    accomplished, the little knot of able men who came to the front for two or three
                    generations, stirred by the new life that had been breathed into the age, did
                    nobly in preserving the records of the past for a later time to value and
                    appreciate, while Odd and Hallgrim exhibit the noblest impulses of their
                    time.</p>
                <p>A new plague, that of the English, Gascon, and Algerine pirates, marked the close
                    of the 16th century and opening of the 17th, causing widespread panic and some
                    devastation in 1579, 1613-16, and 1627. Nothing points more to the helplessness
                    of the natives’ condition than their powerlessness against these tiresome foes.
                    But the 18th century is the most gloomy in Iceland’s annals. Small-pox, famine,
                    sheep disease, and the awful eruptions of 1765 and 1783 follow each other in
                    terrible succession. Against such fearful visitations, which reduced the
                    population by about a fourth, little could be done, and when the only man who
                    might have roused the Icelanders from their misery, distress, and
                    impoverishment, thenoble and patriotic Eggert Olafsson, a hero of the old type,
                    was drowned in full career in 1768, it is hardly to be wondered at that things
                    grew from bad to worse, and that a listlessness and torpidity crept over the
                    national character, the effects of which it is only beginning to shake off. The
                    few literary men, whose work was done and whose books were published abroad,
                    were only concerned with the past, and Jon Widalin is the one man of mark,
                    beside Eggert Olafsson, who worked and wrote for his own generation.<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>For the periods succeeding
                    the union, Danish state papers and the <hi rend="italic">History</hi> of Finn
                    Jonsson are the best authority.</p></note></p>
                <p>Gradually the ideas which were agitating Europe crept through Scandinavia into
                    Iceland, and, now that scholars and travellers of mark and influence had drawn
                    attention to the island, its claims were more respectfully listened to. The
                    Continental system, which, by its leading to the blockade of Denmark, threatened
                    to starve Iceland, was neutralized by special action of the British Government.
                    Trade and fishery grew a little brisker, and at length the turn came.</p>
                <p>The rationalistic movement, an unlovely attempt at reform, headed by Magnus
                    Stephenson, a patriotic, narrow-minded lawyer, did little good as far as church
                    reform went, but was accompanied by a more successful effort to educate the
                    people by means of bringing within their reach the practical knowledge of the
                    day. A Useful Knowledge Society, such as Brougham delighted in, was formed and
                    did some honest work. Newspapers and periodicals were published, and the very
                    stir which the ecclesiastical disputes encouraged did good. When free trade
                    came, and when the free constitution ot Denmark had produced its legitimate
                    effects, the intelligent and able endeavours of a few patriots such as Jon
                    Sigurdsson were able to push on the next generation a step further, in spite of
                    such physical obstacles as the sheep disease. Questions of a modern political
                    complexion arose; the cattle export controversy and the great home rule struggle
                    began. The intelligence of a people whose love for knowledge and mental
                    attainments have always been high seconded its leaders well, and after thirty
                    years’ agitation home rule was conceded in 1874. The absolute <hi rend="italic"
                    >syshιmadr</hi> and <hi rend="italic">hirdstjori</hi> became popular officials
                    assisted by elected boards. The <hi rend="italic">Ad-thing,</hi> a mere council
                    of powerless delegates, was replaced by a representative assembly of two
                    chambers (composed of thirty members chosen by a a popular and wide suffrage,
                    and six crown nominees) with legislative powers, and other reforms were
                    comprised in this grant. Further political changes, such as the introduction of
                    a jury system to replace the Danish umpire-and-assessor procedure, are now being
                    considered by the liberal party. There are many peculiar circumstances present
                    in the condition of Iceland, the absence of towns, equality of society in a
                    sense which exists in no other European community, difficulty of communication,
                    and the intense conservatism and dislike of activity or change which must
                    necessarily characterize a community so long isolated and “forced into lazy
                    habits for lack of opportunity.” But that emigration should have begun, and
                    families left the old home for Canada and the United States to seek a better
                    climate, a richer soil, and the hopes of progress which are so distant athome,
                    is certainly remarkable; and, if the difficulties which must surround emigrants
                    who have never seen a road, a tree, or a plough, on their first taking up an
                    agricultural life, are overcome, the results may be very important to the mother
                    country.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Literature.</hi><hi rend="italic">Poetry.—</hi> Iceland has
                    always borne a high renown for song, but has never produced a poet of the
                    highest order, a fact for which one can only account by noticing that the
                    qualities which in other lands were most sought for and admired in poetry were
                    in Iceland lavished on the saga, a prose epic, and that Icelandic poetry is to
                    be rated very high for the one quality which its authors have ever aimed at—
                    melody of sound. To these generalizations there are but few exceptions, albeit,
                    in considering the history of this branch of Icelandic literature, we are at
                    once met by an apparent contradiction to them, a group of poems which possess
                    the very qualities of high imagination, deep pathos, fresh love of nature,
                    passionate dramatic power, and noble simplicity of language which Icelandic
                    poetry lacks. The solution is that these poems do not belong to Iceland at all.
                    They are the poetry of the “Western Islands.”</p>
                <p>It was among the Scandinavian colonists of the British coasts that in the first
                    generations after the colonization of Iceland therefrom a magnificent school of
                    poetry arose, to which we owe works that for power and beauty can be paralleled
                    in no Teutonic language till centuries after their date. To this school, which
                    is totally distinct from the Icelandic, ran its own course apart, and perished
                    before the 13th century, the following works belong (of their authors we have
                    scarcely a name or two; their dates can be rarely exactly fixed; but they lie
                    between the beginning of the 9th and the end of the 10th centuries), classified

                <p>The characteristics of this Western school are no doubt the result of the contact
                    of Scandinavian colonists of the viking-tide, living lives of the wildest
                    adventure, tossed by war and storm, with an imaginative and civilized race, that
                    exercised upon them a very strong and lasting influence (the effects of which
                    were also felt in Iceland, but in a different way). The frequent intermarriages
                    which mingled the best families of either race are sufficient proof of the close
                    communion of Northmen and Celts in the 9th and 10th centuries, while there are
                    in the poems themselves traces of Celtic mythology, language, and manners.<note

                <p>When one turns to the early poetry of the Scandinavian continent, preserved in
                    the nine-staves on the memorial stones of Sweden, Norway, and Denmark, in the
                    didactic <hi rend="italic">Havamal,</hi> the <hi rend="italic">Great Wolsung Lay
                    (j.e.,</hi> Sigurd II., Fafnis’s Lay, Sigrdrifa’s Lay), and <hi rend="italic"
                    >Hamdismal,</hi> all continental, and all entirely consonant to the remains of
                    our own Old English poetry in metre, feeling, and treatment, one can see that it
                    is with this school that the Icelandic “makers” are in sympathy, and that from
                    it their verse naturally descends. The only difference between them is that,
                    while the fundamental characteristics of shrewdness, plain straightforwardness,
                    and a certain stern way of looking at life are common to both, the Icelandic
                    school adds a complexity of structure and ornament, an elaborate mythological
                    and enigmatical phraseology, and a regularity of rhyme, assonance, luxuriance,
                    quantity, and syllabification, which it caught up from the Latin and Celtic
                    poets, and adapted with exquisite ingenuity to its own main object, that of
                    securing the greatest possible beauty of sound.</p>
                <p>The first generations of Icelandic poets were very remarkable men, and resemble
                    in many ways the later troubadours; the books of the kings and the sagas are
                    full of their strange lives. Men of good birth (nearly always, too, of Celtic
                    blood on one side at least), they leave Iceland young and attach themselves to
                    the kings and earls of the north, living in their courts as their henchmen,
                    sharing their adventures in weal and woe, praising their victories, and hymning
                    their deaths if they did not fall by their sides—men of quick passion, unhappy
                    in their loves, jealous of rival poets and of their own fame, ever ready to
                    answer criticism with a satire or with a sword-thrιιst, but clinging through all
                    to their art, in which they attained most marvellous skill.</p>
                <p>Such men were Egill, the foe of Eirik Bloodaxe and the friend of Aethelstan;
                    Kormak, the hot-headed champion; Eyvind, King Hakon’s poet, called Skaldspoiler,
                    because he copied in his dirge over that king the older and finer <hi
                    rend="italic">Eiriks-mal∙,</hi> Gunnlaug, who sang at Aethelred’s court, and
                    fell at the hands of a brother bard Hrafn; Hallfred, Olaf Tryggvason’s poet, who
                    lies in Iona by the side of Macbeth; Sighvat, Saint Olaf’s henchman, most
                    prolific of all his comrades; Thormod, Coalbrow’s poet, who died singing after
                    Sticklestad battle; Ref, Ottar the Black, Arnor the earls’ poet, and, of those
                    whose poetry was almost confined to Iceland, Gretti, Biorn the Hitdale champion,
                    and the two model Icelandic masters, Einar Skulason and Markus the Lawman, both
                    of the 12th century.</p>
                <p>It is impossible to do more here than mention the names of the most famous of the
                    long roll of poets which are noted in the works of Snorri and in the two <hi
                    rend="italic">Skalda-tal.</hi> It is evident that they must differ greatly in
                    style and tone, as they range from the rough and noble pathos of Egill, the
                    mystic obscurity of Kormak, the pride and grief of Hallfred, and the marvellous
                    fluency of Sighvat, to the florid intricacy of Einar and Markus.</p>
                <p>The art of poetry, which stood to the Icelanders in lieu of music, was, and is
                    still, much cultivated in the island; scarcely any prominent man but knew how to
                    turn a mocking or laudatory stanza, and down to the fall of the commonwealth the
                    accomplishment was in high request. In the literary age the chief poets belong
                    to the great Sturlung family, Snorri and his two nephews, Sturla and Olaf, the
                    White Poet, being the most famous “makers” of their day. Indeed, it is in
                    Snorri’s <hi rend="italic">Edda,</hi> a poetic grammar of a very perfect kind,
                    that the best examples of the whole of northern poetry are to be found. The last
                    part, <hi rend="italic">Hattalal,</hi> a treatise on metre, was written for Earl
                    Skuli about 1222, in imitation of Earl Rognvald and Hall’s <hi rend="italic"
                    >Hattalykill</hi><hi rend="italic">(Clavis</hi><hi rend="italic">metrica),</hi>
                    of 1150. The second part, <hi rend="italic">Skaldskapar-mal,</hi> a gradus of
                    synonyms and epithets, which contains over 240 quotations from 65 poets, and 10
                    anonymous lays—, a treasury of verse—was composed <hi rend="italic">c.</hi>
                    1230. The first part, an exquisite sketch of northern mythology, <hi
                    rend="italic">Gylfa-ginning,</hi> was probably prefixed to the whole later.<note

                    it does, to the pre-scientific age. Bunsen’s speculations at a later date are
                    entirely fanciful and visionary.</p></note> There is some of Sturla’s poetry in
                    his <hi rend="italic">Islendinga Saga,</hi> and verses of Snorri occur in the
                    <hi rend="italic">Grammatical Treatise</hi> on figures of speech, &amp;c., of
                    Olaf, which contains about one hundred and forty quotations from various
                    authors, and was written about 1250.</p>
                <p>Besides those sources, the <hi rend="italic">Kings’ Lives</hi> of Snorri and
                    later authors contain a great deal of verse by Icelandic poets. King Harold
                    Sigurdsson, who fell at Stamford Bridge 1066, was both a good critic and
                    composed himself. Many tales are told of him and his poet visitors and henchmen.
                    The Icelandic sagas also comprise much verse which is partly genuine, partly the
                    work of the 12th and 13th century editors. Thus there are genuine pieces in <hi
                    rend="italic">Nial’s Saga</hi> (chaps. 34, 78, 103, 126, 146), in <hi

                    >Sons’ Sagas</hi> there is good verse of a later poet, and in many sagas
                    worthless rubbish foisted in as ornamental wherever there was a chance of doing
                    so.</p>
                <p>To these may be added tw ι or three works of a semi-literary kind, composed by
                    learned men, net by heroes and warriors. Such are <hi rend="italic">Konunga-tal,
                    Hugsvinnsmal</hi> ( · paraphrase of Cato’s Distichs), <hi rend="italic">Merlin’s
                    Prophecy</hi> (paraphrased <hi rend="superscript"> r</hi> rom Geoffrey of
                    Monmouth by Gunnlaug the monk), <hi rend="italic">Jomsviking: -draρa</hi> (by
                    Bishop Ketil), and the <hi rend="italic">Islendinga-drapa,</hi> which has
                    preserved brief notices of several lost sagas concerning Icelandic worthies,
                    with which <hi rend="italic">Gudmundar∙ draρa,</hi> though of the 14th century,
                    may be also placed.</p>
                <p>Just as the change of law gave the death-blow to an already perishing
                    commonwealth, so the rush of mediaeval influence, which followed the union with
                    Norway, merely completed a process which had been in force since the end of the
                    11th century, when it overthrew the old Icelandic poetry in favour of the
                    Rimur.</p>
                <p>The introduction of the <hi rend="italic">Danz,</hi> ballads (or <hi
                    rend="italic">forrikvoedi,</hi> as they are now called) for singing, with a
                    burden, usually relating to a lovetale, which were immensely popular with the
                    people and performed by whole companies at weddings, yule feasts, and the like,
                    had relegated the regular Icelandic poetry to more serious events or to the more
                    cultivated of the chiefs. But these “jigs,” as the Elizabethans would have
                    called them, dissatisfied the popular ear in one way: they were, like our own
                    old ballads, which they closely resembled, in rhyme, but void of alliteration,
                    and accordingly they were modified and replaced by the “Rimur,” the staple
                    literary product of the 15th century. These were rhymed but also alliterative,
                    in regular form, with prologue or <hi rend="italic">mansong</hi> (often the
                    prettiest part of the whole), main portion telling the tale (mostly derived in
                    early days from the French romances of the Carlovingian, Arthurian, or
                    Alexandrian cycles, or from the mythic or skrok-sogur), and epilogue. Their
                    chief value to us lies in their having preserved versions of several French
                    poems now lost, and in their evidence as to the feelings and bent of Icelanders
                    in the “Dark Age” of the island’s history. The ring and melody which they all
                    possess is their chief beauty.</p>
                <p>Of the earliest, <hi rend="italic">Olafsrima,</hi> by Einar Gilsson (c. 1350),
                    and the best, the Aristophanic <hi rend="italic">Skida-rima</hi> (c. 1430), by
                    Einar Fostri, the names may be given. Rimur on sacred subjects was called
                    “Diktur”; of these, on the legends of the saints’ lives, many remain. The most
                    notable·of its class is the <hi rend="italic">Lilia</hi> of Eystein Asgrimsson,
                    a monk of Holyfell (c. 1350), a most “sweet sounding song.” 1 .ater the poems of
                    the famous John Arason, last Catholic bishop of Holar (c. 1530), <hi
                    rend="italic">Liomr</hi> (“Gleam”) and <hi rend="italic">Pislargrâtr</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">(“</hi> Passion-tears”b deserve mention.</p>
                <p>Taste has sunk since the old days; but still this Rimur poetry is popular and
                    genuine, and in such hard and evil days as came upon Iceland after the fall of
                    the old houses had destroyed such traditional history and civilization as had
                    fostered the saga, it is perhaps rather a wonder that the torch was still alight
                    than that its glimmer was feeble and smoky. Moreover, the very prosaic and
                    artificial verse of Sturla and the last of the old school certainly deserved the
                    oblivion which came over them, as a casual perusal of the stanzas scattered
                    through <hi rend="italic">Islendinga</hi> will surely prove. It is interesting
                    to notice that a certain number of <hi rend="italic">kenningar</hi> (poetical
                    paraphrases) have survived from the old school even to the present day, though
                    the mass of them have happily perished. The change in <hi rend="italic"
                    >ikae</hi><hi rend="italic">phonesis</hi><pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit12newyrich/page/n640/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0912-0640-0623"/> of the language is well illustrated by the new
                    metres as compared with the old Icelandic <hi rend="italic">Drott-kvoedi</hi> in
                    its varied forms. Most of the older Rimur and Diktur are as yet unprinted. Many
                    of the <hi rend="italic">fornkνaedi</hi> are printed in a volume of the old <hi

                <p>The effects of the Reformation was deeply felt in Icelandic literature, both
                    prose and verse. The name of Hallgrim Petersen, whose <hi rend="italic"
                    >Passion-hymns,</hi> “the flower of all Icelandic poetry,” have been the most
                    popular composition in the language, is foremost of all writers since the Second
                    Change of Faith. The gentle sweetness of thought, and the exquisite harmony of
                    wording in his poems, more than justify the popular verdict. His <hi
                    rend="italic">Hymns</hi> were finished in 1660, and published in 1666, two great
                    Protestant poets thus being contemporaries. A collection of Reformation hymns,
                    adapted, many of them, from the German, the <hi rend="italic">Holar-book,</hi>
                    had preceded them in 1619. There was a good deal of verse-writing of a secular
                    kind, far inferior in every way, during this period. In spite of the many
                    physical distresses that weighed upon the island, ballads <hi rend="italic"
                    >{fornkvaedi)</hi> were still written, ceasing about 1750, Rimur composed, and
                    more elaborate compositions published.</p>
                <p>The most notable names are those of the improvisatore Stephen the Blind; Thorlak
                    Gudbrandsson, author of <hi rend="italic">Ulfar-Rtrnur,</hi> d. 1707; John
                    Magnusson, who wrote <hi rend="italic">Hristajla,</hi> a didactic poem; Stefan
                    Olafsson, composer of Psalms, Rimur, &amp;c., d. 1688; Gunnar Pâlsson, the
                    author of <hi rend="italic">Gunnar slag,</hi> often printed with the Eddie
                    poems, c. 1791; ami the famous Eggert Olafsson, traveller, naturalist, and
                    patriot, whose untimely death in 1768 was a great loss to his country, which his
                    energy and talents might have roused from its torpor. His <hi rend="italic"
                    >Bιιnadar-balkr,</hi> a Géorgie written, like Tusser’s <hi rend="italic"
                    >Points,</hi> with a practical view of raising the state of agriculture, has
                    always been much prized. Paul Widalin’s ditties are very naive and clever.</p>
                <p>The Reformation had produced a real poet, but the material rise of Iceland has
                    not yet done so. Many have written, but few have shown any great talent; perhaps
                    the best has been Sigurd of Broadfirth, many of whose prettiest poems were
                    composed in Greenland, like those of Jon Biarnisson before him, <hi
                    rend="italic">c.</hi> 1750; John Thorlaksson’s translation of Milton’s great
                    epic into Eddie verse is praiseworthy in intention, but, as may be imagined,
                    falls far short of its aim. He also turned Pope’s <hi rend="italic">Essay on
                    Man</hi> and Klopstock’s <hi rend="italic">Messiah</hi> into Icelandic. Benedikt
                    Grondai tried the same experiment with Homer in his <hi rend="italic">Ilion's
                    Kυaedi, c.</hi> 1825. There is a fine prose translation of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Odyssey</hi> by Sweinbiorn Egillson, the lexicographer, both faithful and
                    poetic in high degree. Many poems of varying but little merit will be found in
                    the periodicals of this and last century, the serious verse being pseudo-classic
                    for the most part and falsetto in tone. The satiric verse, such as John
                    Thorlaksson’s on Magnus Stephenson’s projects and “reforms,” and the ditties on
                    all kinds of <hi rend="italic">sujets</hi><hi rend="italic">dl</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">occasion,</hi> are better, but much of their meaning is lost to a
                    stranger. With the latest school of poets who have begun to imitate foreign
                    metres (unalliterative) and to translate foreign poets, it is hardly worth while
                    to linger. A translation of Shakespeare and of several of Byron’s poems may be
                    noticed as curiosities. Of minor poetry there is still an abundant crop; even in
                    Gimli, the far-off Canadian colony, “In Memoriam” verses and wedding-hymns of
                    irreproachable form, but wooden thought, are printed and admired. That Iceland,
                    most idyllic of modern lands, is capable of supplying subject and material for
                    something higher than all this there is no doubt; but, before anything of real
                    worth can be written, the old stock-in-trade of worn-out mythology and
                    pseudo-patriotism must be thrown aside for ever.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">History and Biography.—ιhe</hi> real strength of Icelandic
                    literature is shown in its most indigenous growth, the “Saga.” This is, in its
                    purest form, the life of a hero, composed in regular form, governed by fixed
                    rules, and intended for oral recitation. It bears the strongest likeness to the
                    epic in all save its unversified form; in both are found, as fixed essentials,
                    simplicity of plot, chronological order of events, set phrases used even in
                    describing the restless play of emotion or the changeful fortunes of a fight or
                    a storm, while in both the absence of digression, cornment, or intrusion of the
                    narrator’s person is invariably maintained. The saga grew up in the quieter days
                    which folloλved the Change of Faith (1002), when the deeds of the great
                    families’ heroes were still cherished by their descendants, and the exploits of
                    the great kings of Norway and Denmark handed down with reverence from the mouths
                    of those that had fought and sung by their side. Telling of stories was a
                    recognized form of entertainment at all feasts and gatherings, and it was the
                    necessity of the reciter which gradually worked them into a regular form, by
                    which the memory was relieved and the artistic features of the story allowed to
                    be more carefully elaborated. That this form was so perfect must be attributed
                    to Irish influence, without which indeed there would have been a saga, but not
                    the same saga. It is to the west that the best sagas belong; it is to the west
                    that nearly every classic writer whose name we know belongs; and it is precisely
                    in the west that the admixture of Irish blood is greatest. In comparing the
                    Irish tales with the saga, there will be felt deep divergencies in matter,
                    style, and taste, the richness of one contrasting with the chastened simplicity
                    of the other; the one’s half-comic half-earnest bombast is wholly unlike the
                    other’s grim humour; the marvellous, so unearthly in the one, is almost credible
                    in the other; but in both are the keen grasp of character, the biting phrase,
                    the love of action, and the delight in blood which almost assumes the garb of a
                    religious passion.</p>
                <p>When the saga had been fixed by a generation or two of oral reciters, it was
                    written down; and this stereotyped the form, so that afterwards when literary
                    works were composed by learned men (such as Abbot Karl’s <hi rend="italic"
                    >Swcrri's Saga</hi> and Sturla’s <hi rend="italic">Islendingd)</hi> the same
                    style was adopted.</p>
                <p>Taking first the sagas relating to Icelanders, of which some thirty-five or forty
                    remain out of thrice that number, we find that they were first written dowm
                    between 1140 and 1220, in the generation which succeeded Ari and felt the
                    impulse his books Lad given to writing, on separate scrolls, no doubt mainly for
                    the reciter’s convenience; that they then went through all the different phases
                    which such popular compositions have to pass in all lands,—editing and
                    compounding (1220-1260), padding and amplifying(1260-130Q), and finally
                    collection in large MSS. (14th century). Sagas exist showing all these phases,
                    some primitive and rough, some refined and beautified, some again diluted and
                    weakened, according as their copyists have been faithful, artistic, or foolish;
                    for the first generation of MSS. have all perished. We have also complex sagas
                    put together in the 13th century out of the scrolls relating to a given
                    locality, such a group as still exists untouched in <hi rend="italic"
                    >Vap&gt;nfirdinga</hi> being fused into such a saga as <hi rend="italic"
                    >Niala</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Laxdaela.</hi> Of the authors nothing is known;
                    we can only guess that some belong to the Sturlung school. According to subject
                    they fall into two classes, those relating to the older generation before
                    Christianity and those telling of St Olaf’s contemporaries; only two fall into a
                    third generation.</p>
                <p>Beginning with the sagas of the west, most perfect in style and form, the
                    earliest in subject is that of <hi rend="italic">Gold-</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Thori</hi><hi rend="italic">(c.</hi> 930), whose adventurous career it relates;
                    <hi rend="italic">Hen-</hi><hi rend="italic">Thori'</hi><hi rend="italic">s
                    Saga</hi> tells of the burning of Blund-Ketil, a noble chief, an event which led
                    to Thord Gelli’s reforms next year (c. 964); <hi rend="italic">Gisli</hi> ’ <hi
                    rend="italic">s Saga</hi> (960-80) tells of the career and death of that
                    ill-fated outlaw; it is beautifully written, and the verses by the editor (13th
                    century) are good and appropriate; it has been Englished by Sir G. Dasent; <hi
                    rend="italic">Hord's Saga</hi> (980) is the life of a band of outlaws on
                    Whalesfirth, and especially of their leader Hord. Of later subject are the sagas
                    of <hi rend="italic">Havard</hi> and his revenge for his son, murdered by a
                    neighbouring chief (997-1002); of the <hi rend="italic">Heath Slaughter</hi>
                    (990-1014), a typical tale of a great blood feud, written in the most primitive
                    prose; of <hi rend="italic">Gunnlaug and Hrafn</hi> (980-1008), the rival poets
                    and their ill-starred love. The verse in this saga is important and interesting.
                    It has been Englished by Messrs Morris and Magnusson. To the west also belong
                    the three great complex sagas <hi rend="italic">Egla, Eyrbyggia,</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">Laxdaela.</hi> The first (870-980), after noticing the migration
                    of the father and grandfather of the hero poet Egill, and the origin of the feud
                    between them and the kings of Norway, treats fully of Egill’s career, his enmity
                    with Eirik Bloodaxe, his service with Aethelstan, and finally, after many
                    adventures abroad, of his latter days in Iceland at Borg, illustrating very
                    clearly what manner of men those great settlers and their descendants were, and
                    the feelings of pride and freedom which led them to Iceland. The style is that
                    of Snorri, who had himself dwelt at Borg, and Dr Vigfusson is inclined to refer
                    it to him. <hi rend="italic">Eyrbyggia</hi> (890-1031) is the saga of Politics,
                    the most loosely woven of all the compound stories. It includes a mass of
                    information on the law, religion, traditions, &amp;c., of the heathen days in
                    Iceland, and the lives of Eirik, the real discoverer of Greenland, Biorn of
                    Broadwick, a famous chief, and Snorri, the greatest statesman of his day. Dr
                    Vigfusson would ascribe its editing and completion to Sturla the Lawman, <hi
                    rend="italic">c.</hi> 1250. It is known to many Englishmen from Sir Walter
                    Scott’s paraphrase. <hi rend="italic">Laxdaela</hi> (910-1026) is the saga of
                    Romance. Its heroine Gudrun is the most famous of all Icelandic ladies. Her love
                    for Kiartan the poet, and his career abroad, his betrayal by his friend Bolli,
                    the sad death of Kiartan at his hands, the revenge taken' for him on Bolli,
                    whose slayers are themselves afterwards put to death, and the end of Gudπιn, who
                    becomes an anchorite after her stormy life, make up the pith of the story. The
                    contrast of the characters, the rich style and fine dialogue which are so
                    remarkable in this saga, have much in common with the best works of the Sturlung
                    school. Mr Morris’s <hi rend="italic">Lovers of</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Gïidrun</hi> is founded upon it.</p>
                <p>Of the north there are the sagas of <hi rend="italic">Kormak</hi> (930-60), most
                    primitive of all, a tale of a wild poet’s love and feuds, containing many:
                    notices of the heathen times; of <hi rend="italic">Waterdale</hi> (890-980),
                    relating to the settlement and the chief family in Waterdale; of <hi
                    rend="italic">Hallfred</hi> the Poet (996-1014), narrating his fortune at King
                    Olafs court, Lis love affairs in Iceland, and finally his death and burial at
                    Iona; of <hi rend="italic">Reek-dale</hi> (990), which preserves the lives of
                    Askell and his son Viga-Sk*uti; of <hi rend="italic">Swarf-dale</hi> (980-90), a
                    cnιel coarse story of the old days, with some good scenes in it, unfortunately
                    imperfect, chapters 1-10 being forged; of <hi rend="italic">Viga-Glum</hi>
                    (970-90), a fine story of a heathen hero, brave, crafty, and cruel; it has been
                    Englished by Sir Edmund Head. To the north also belong the sagas of <hi
                    rend="italic">Gretti</hi> the Strong (1010-31), the life and death of the most
                    famous of Icelandic outlaws<pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0912-0641-0624"/>, the real story of whose career is mixed up with
                    the mythical adventures of Beowulf, here put down to Gretti, and with late
                    romantic episodes and fabulous folk-tales (Dr Vigfusson would ascribe the best
                    parts of this saga to Sturla; its last editor, whose additions would be better
                    away, must have touched it up about 1300; Messrs Morris and Magnusson have
                    Englished it), and the stories of the <hi rend="italic">Lightwater Men</hi> and
                    <hi rend="italic">Liot O' Vall</hi> (1009-60). Gudmund the Mighty and his family
                    and neighbours are the heroes of these tales, which form a little cycle. The <hi
                    rend="italic">Banda-manna Saga</hi> (1050-60), the only comedy among the sagas,
                    is also a northern tale; it relates the struggles of a plebeian who gets a
                    chieftaincy against the old families of the neighbourhood, whom he successfully
                    outwits; <hi rend="italic">Ol-kofra Thattr</hi> is a later imitation of it in
                    the same humorous strain. The sagas of the north are rougher and coarser than
                    those of .the west, but have a good deal of individual character.</p>
                <p>Of tales relating to the east there survive the Weapon-firth cycle,—the tales of
                    <hi rend="italic">Thorstein the While</hi> (c. 900), of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Thorstein the Staffsmittcn</hi> (c. 985), Englished by Mr Morris, of <hi
                    rend="italic">Gunnar Thidrand's Bane</hi> (1000-1008), and of the <hi
                    rend="italic">Weapon-firth Men</hi> (975- 990), all relating to the family of
                    Hof and their friends and kin for several generations,—and the story of <hi
                    rend="italic">Hrafnkell Frey's Priest</hi> (c. 960), the most idyllic of sagas
                    and best of the eastern tales. Of later times there are <hi rend="italic"
                    >Droρlaug s Sons’ Saga</hi> (997-1007), written probably about 1110, and
                    preserved in the uncouth broken style of the original (a brother’s revenge for
                    his brother’s death is the substance of it; <hi rend="italic">Brand-krossa
                    Thattr</hi> is an appendix to it), and the tales of <hi rend="italic">Thorstein
                    Hall of. Side’s Son</hi> (c. 1014), and his brother <hi rend="italic"
                    >Thidrandi</hi> (c. 996), which belong to the cycle of <hi rend="italic">Hall o’
                    Side’s Saga,</hi> unhappily lost; they are weird tales of bloodshed and magic,
                    with idyllic and pathetic episodes.</p>
                <p>The sagas of the south are either lost or absorbed in that of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Nial</hi> (970-1014), a long and complex story into which are woven the tales
                    of <hi rend="italic">Gunnar, Nial,</hi> and parts of others, as <hi
                    rend="italic">Brian Boroimhe, Hall o' Side,</hi> &amp;c. It is, whether we look
                    at style, contents, or legal and historical weight, the foremost of all sagas.
                    It deals especially with law, the sole bond of a rough heathen community, and
                    contains in itself, as it were, at once the pith and the moral of all early
                    Icelandic history. Its hero Nial, type of the good lawyer, is contrasted with
                    its villain Mord, the ensample of cunning, chicane, and legal wrong-doing; and a
                    great part of the saga is taken up with the three cases and suits of the
                    divorce, the death of Hoskuld, and the burning of Nial, which are given with
                    great minuteness and care. The number and variety of its dramatis personae give
                    it the liveliest interest throughout. The women Hallgerda, Berg-thora, and
                    Ragnhild are as sharply contrasted as the men Gunnar, Skarphedin, Flosi, and
                    Kari. The pathos of such tragedies as the death of Gunnar and Hoskuld and the
                    burning is interrupted by the humour of the Al-thing scenes and the intellectual
                    interest of the legal proceedings. The plot dealing first with the life and
                    death of Gunnar, type of the chivalry of his day, then with the burning of Nial
                    by Flosi, and how it came about, and lastly with Kari’s revenge on the burners,
                    is the ideal saga-plot, and affords ample room for the finest treatment of
                    incident. The author must have been of the east, a good lawyer and genealogist,
                    and have composed it about 1250, to judge from various internal evidence. It has
                    been overworked by a later editor, c. 1300, who inserted many spurious verses.
                    It has been translated by Sir G. Dasent.</p>
                <p>Relating partly to Iceland, but mostly to Greenland and Wineland (N. America),
                    are the sagas of the <hi rend="italic">Floe-Men</hi> (985-90), a good story of
                    the adventures of Thorgils and of the struggles of shipwrecked colonists in
                    Greenland, a graphic and terrible picture; and of <hi rend="italic">Eirik the
                    Red</hi> (990-1000), two versions, one northern (Flatey-book), one western, the
                    better (in <hi rend="italic">Hawk’s Book,</hi> and AM. 557, translated by the
                    Rev. J. Sephton), the story of the discovery of Greenland and Wineland (America)
                    by the Icelanders at the end of the 9th century. Later are the story of <hi
                    rend="italic">Thormod and Thorgeir, the Foster Brethren</hi> (1015-30), a very
                    interesting story, told in a quaint romantic style, of Thorgeir, the reckless
                    henchman of King Olaf, and how his death was revenged in Greenland by his sworn
                    brother the true-hearted Thormod Coalbrow’s poet, who afterwards dies at
                    Sticklestad. The tale of <hi rend="italic">Einar Sookisson</hi> (c. 1125) may
                    also be noticed. The lost saga of <hi rend="italic">Poet</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Helgi,</hi> of which only fragments remain, was also laid in Greenland.</p>
                <p>Besides complete sagas, such as have been noticed, there are embedded in the <hi
                    rend="italic">Kings' Lives</hi> numerous small <hi rend="italic">thaettir</hi>
                    or episodes, small tales of Icelanders’ adventures, often relating to poets and
                    their lives at the kings’ courts; one or two of these seem to be fragments of
                    sagas now lost. Among the more notable are those of <hi rend="italic">Grm

                <p>The forged Icelandic sagas appear as early as the 13th century. They are very
                    poor, and either worked up on hints given in genuine stories, or altogether
                    apocryphal. Some of them have been composed within the present century.</p>
                <p>About the year of the battle of Hastings was born one of the blood of Queen Aud,
                    who founded the famous historical school of Iceland, and himself produced its
                    greatest monument in a work which can only be compared for value with the
                    English Domesday Book. Nearly all that we know of the heathen commonwealth may
                    be traced to the collections of Ari. It was he too that fixed the style in which
                    history should be composed in Iceland. It was he that secured and put into order
                    the vast mass of fragmentary tradition that was already dying out in his day.
                    And perhaps it is the highest praise of all to him that he wrote in his own
                    “Danish tongue,” and so ensured the use of that tongue by the learned and
                    cultured of after generations, when, had he chosen to imitate the learned of
                    other lands, not only would the freshness and life of the northern history as we
                    have it have been crushed out, but the vernacular literature (heightened and
                    purified by his influence as it has now been) would have sunk and disappeared.
                    Ari’s great works are <hi rend="italic">Konungabôk,</hi> or <hi rend="italic"
                    >The Book of Kings,</hi> relating the history of the kings of Norway from the
                    rise of the Yngling dynasty down to the death of Harald Sigιιrdsson in the
                    year-of his own birth. This book he composed from the dictation of old men such
                    as Odd Kolsson, who had preserved traditions in their family and got information
                    from contemporaries, from the genealogical poems, and from the various dirges,
                    battle-songs, and eulogia of the poets. It is most probable that he also
                    compiled shorter <hi rend="italic">Kings’ Books</hi> relating to Denmark and
                    perhaps to England. The <hi rend="italic">Konungabôk</hi> is preserved under the
                    <hi rend="italic">Kings’ Lives</hi> of Snorri, parts of it almost as they came
                    from Ari’s hands, for example, <hi rend="italic">Ynglinga</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">Harold Fairhair's Saga,</hi> and the prefaces stating the plan and
                    critical foundations of the work, parts of it only used as a framework for the
                    magnificent superstructure of the lives of the two Olafs, and of Harald Hardrada
                    and his nephew Magnus the Good. The best text of Ari’s <hi rend="italic"
                    >Konungabôk</hi><hi rend="italic">( Ynglinga,</hi> and the sagas down to but not
                    including Olaf Tryggvason’s) is that of Frisbôk.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Book of Settlements {Landnamab6k)</hi> is a most wonderful
                    performance, both in its scheme and carrying out. 11 is divided into five
                    parts,the first of which contains a brief account of the discovery of the
                    island; the other four, one by one taking a quarter of the land, describe the
                    name, pedigree, and history of each settler in geographical order, notice the
                    most important facts in the history of his descendants, the names of their
                    homesteads, their courts and temples, thus including mention of 4000 persons,
                    one-third of whom are women, and 2000 places. The mass of information contained
                    in so small a space, the clearness and accuracy of the details, the immense
                    amount of life which is somehow breathed into the whole, can hardly fail to
                    astonish the reader, when he reflects that this colossal task was sketched out
                    and accomplished by one man, for his collaborateur Kolskegg merely filled up his
                    plan with regard to part of the east coast, a district with which Ari in his
                    western home at Stad was little familiar. <hi rend="italic">Landnamabôk</hi> has
                    reached us in two complete editions, one edited by Sturla, who brought down the
                    genealogies to his own grandfather and grandmother, Sturla and Gudny, and one by
                    Hawk, who traces the pedigrees still later to himself.</p>
                <p>Ari also wrote a <hi rend="italic">Book of Icelanders</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >(Jslendirigabék,</hi><hi rend="italic">c.</hi> 1127), which has perished as a
                    whole, but fragments of it are embedded in many sagas and <hi rend="italic"
                    >Kings' Lives</hi>; it seems to have been a complete epitome of his earlier
                    works, together with an account of the constitutional history, ecclesiastical
                    and civil, of Iceland. An abridgment of the latter part of it, the little <hi
                    rend="italic">Libellus</hi><hi rend="italic">Islandorwm</hi> (to which the title
                    of the bigger <hi rend="italic">Liber—</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Islendingabék</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi> is often given), made by the
                    historian for his friends Bishops Ketil and Thorlak, for whom he wrote the <hi
                    rend="italic">Liber</hi> (c. 1137). This charming little book is, with the much
                    later collections of laws, our sole authority for the Icelandic constitution of
                    the commonwealth, but, “much as it tells, the lost <hi rend="italic">Liber</hi>
                    would have been of still greater importance.” <hi rend="italic"
                    >Kristni-Saga,</hi> the story of the christening of Iceland, is also a work of
                    Ari’s, “overlaid” by a later editor no doubt, but often preserving Ari’s very
                    words. This saga, together with several scattered talcs of early Christians in
                    Iceland before the Change of Faith (1002), may have made up a section of the
                    lost <hi rend="italic">Liber.</hi> Of the author of these works little personal
                    is known. He lived in quiet days a quiet life; but he shows himself in his
                    works, as Snorri describes him, “a man wise, of good memory, and a speaker of
                    the truth.” Surely, if Thucydides is justly accounted the first political
                    historian, Ari may be fitly styled the first of scientific historians.</p>
                <p>A famous contemporary and friend of Ari is Saemund (1056- 1133), a great scholar
                    and churchman, whose learning so impressed his age that he got the reputation of
                    a magician. He was the friend of Bishop John, the founder of the great
                    Odd-Verjar family, and the author of a <hi rend="italic">Book of Kings</hi> from
                    Harald Fairhair to Magnus the Good, in which he seems to have fixed the exact
                    chronology of each reign. It is most probable that he wιote in Latin. The idea
                    that he had anything to do with the poetic <hi rend="italic">Edda</hi> in
                    general, or the <hi rend="italic">Sun’s Song</hi> in particular, is of course
                    unfounded and modern.</p>
                <p>The flame which Ari had kindled was fed by his successors in the 12th century.
                    Eirik Oddsson (c. 1150) wrote the lives of Sigurd <pb break="no"

                    Karl Jonsson, abbot of Thingore the Benedictine minister, wrote (c. 1184) a <hi
                    rend="italic">Life of Swerri</hi> from the lips of that great king, a fine racy
                    biography, with a style and spirit of its own, <hi rend="italic"
                    >Böglunga-Sögur</hi> tell the story of the civil wars which followed Swerri’s
                    death. They are probably by a contemporary.</p>
                <p>The Latin <hi rend="italic">Lives of St Olaf,</hi> Odd’s in Latin (c. 1175),
                    compiled from original authorities, and the <hi rend="italic">Legendary
                    Life,</hi> by another monk whose name is lost, are of τhe mediaeval Latin school
                    of Saemund to which Gunnlaug belonged.</p>
                <p>Snorri was known to his contemporaries as a statesman and poet; to us he is above
                    all an historian. His position as a poet and his authorship of the prose <hi
                    rend="italic">Edda</hi> have been noticed above. Snorri was born in 1178, being
                    on his mother’s side spiting from the Myra family of Borg; he was brought up in
                    fosterage with Saemund’s great grandson Jon Loptsson, a great chief. His career
                    begins with his marriage, 1199, which made him a wealthy man. In 1205 he moved
                    from Borg to Reekholt. He was twice lawman, and twice visited Norway, where he
                    gained great influence with the king; but when the civil war broke out he sided
                    with Duke Skuli and disobeyed the king’s orders, whereupon letters were sent out
                    to his enemies to slay him (Skuli his patron having fallen), which command was
                    carried out on the night of 22d Sept. 1241, his own friends and kinsmen being
                    his murderers. Snorri wrote the <hi rend="italic">Lives of the Kings,</hi> from
                    Olaf Tryggvason to Sigurd the Crusader inclusive; and we have them substantially
                    as they came from his hand in the <hi rend="italic">Great King Olafs Saga,</hi>
                    which has been interpolated with thaettir and bits of other sagas in such a way
                    as that they can be easily omitted; <hi rend="italic">St Olafs Saga,</hi> as in
                    <hi rend="italic">Heimskringla</hi> and the Stockholm MS.; and the succeeding
                    <hi rend="italic">Kings’ Lives,</hi> as in Hulda and Hrokkinskiuna, in which,
                    however, a few episodes have been inserted.</p>
                <p>These works were no doubt indebted for their facts to Ari’s labours, and to sagas
                    written since Ari’s death; but the style and treatment of them are Snorri’s own.
                    The fine Thucydidean speeches, the dramatic power of grasping character, and the
                    pathos and poetry that ran through the stories, along with a humour such as is
                    shown in the <hi rend="italic">Edda,</hi> and a varied grace of style that never
                    flags or palls, make Snorri one of the greatest of historians.</p>
                <p>Here it should be noticed that <hi rend="italic">Heimskringla</hi> and its class
                    of MSS. <hi rend="italic">{Eirspennil, Jofraskinna, Gullinskinna, Fris-bok,</hi>
                    and <hi rend="italic">Kringlâ)</hi> do not give the full text of Snorri’s works.
                    They are abridgments made in Norway by Icelanders for their Norwegian patrons,
                    the <hi rend="italic">Life of St Olaf</hi> alone being preserved intact, for the
                    great interest of the Norwegians lay in him, but all the other <hi rend="italic"
                    >Kings' Lives</hi> being more or less cut down and mutilated, so that they
                    cannot be trusted for historic purposes; nor do they give a fair idea of
                    Snorri’s style. As Englishmen’s knowledge of these works is often derived from
                    Mr Laing’s translation of a Danish version of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Heimskringla</hi> (“Sea-Kings of Norway ”), this caution is needed.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Agrip</hi> is a 12th century compendium of the <hi
                    rend="italic">Kings’ Lives</hi> from Harold Fairhair to Swerri, by a scholastic
                    writer of the school of Saemund. As the only Icelandic abridgment of Norwegian
                    history taken not from Snorri but sources now lost, it is of worth. Its real
                    title is <hi rend="italic">Konunga-tal.</hi><hi rend="italic">Noregs
                    Konunga-tal,</hi> now called <hi rend="italic">Fagrskinna,</hi> is a Norse com
                    ρendium of the <hi rend="italic">Kings' Lives</hi> from Halfdan the Black to
                    Swerri’s accession, probably written for King Hakon, to whom it was read on his
                    deathbed. It is an original work, and contains much not found elsewhere. As
                    non-lcelandic it is only noticed here for completeness.</p>
                <p>Styrιni Karason, a contemporary of Snorri’s, dying in 1245, was a distinguished
                    churchman (lawman twice) and scholar. He wrote a <hi rend="italic">Life ofBt
                    Olaf,</hi> now lost; his authority is cited. He also copied out <hi
                    rend="italic">Landnarnabok</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Swerri’s Life,</hi> from
                    his MSS. of which our surviving copies were taken.</p>
                <p>Sturla, Snorri’s nephew, of whom more must be said below, wrote the <hi
                    rend="italic">Lives of Kings</hi><hi rend="italic">Hakon</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >and Magnus</hi> at the request of the latter, finishing the first c. 1265, the
                    latter c. 1280. <hi rend="italic">King Hakon's Life</hi> is preserved in full;
                    of the other only fragments remain. These are the last of the long and valuable
                    series of historic works which Ari’s labours began, from which the history of
                    Norway for 500 years must be gathered.</p>
                <p>A few' books relating the history of other Scandinavian realms will complete this
                    survey. In <hi rend="italic">Skioldunga-bok</hi> was told the history of the
                    early kings of Denmark, perhaps derived from Ari’s collections, and running
                    parallel to <hi rend="italic">Ynglinga.</hi> The earlier part .of it has
                    perished save a fragment <hi rend="italic">Sogn·brot,</hi> and citations and
                    paraphrases in Saxo, and the mythical <hi rend="italic">Ragnar</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Lodbrok's</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Gongu-Hrolfs Sagas</hi>; the
                    latter part, <hi rend="italic">Lives of Harold Blue-tooth and the Kings down to
                    Sweyn 11.,</hi> is still in existence and known as <hi rend="italic"
                    >Skiυldτιnga.</hi></p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Lives of St Knut and his Brethren</hi> are of later origin
                    and separate authorships, parallel to Snorri’s <hi rend="italic">Lives of the
                    great Norwegian Kings,</hi> but earlier in date. The <hi rend="italic">Lives of
                    King JValdirnar and his Son,</hi> written <hi rend="italic">c.</hi> 1185, by a
                    contemporary of Abbot Karl’s, are the last of this series. The whole were edited
                    and compiled into one book, often quoted as <hi rend="italic">Skioldunga,</hi>
                    by a 13th century editor, possibly Olaf, the White Poet, Sturla’s brother, guest
                    and friend of King Waldimar 11., as Dr Vigfusson has guessed. <hi rend="italic"
                    >Jornsvikinga Saga,</hi> the history of the pirates of Jom, down to Knut the
                    Great’s days, also relate to Danish history. Several versions of it exist.</p>
                <p>The complex work now known as <hi rend="italic">tøcneyinga</hi> is made up of the
                    <hi rend="italic">Earls' Saga,</hi> lives of the first great earls, Turf-Einar,
                    Thorfinn, &amp;e.; the <hi rend="italic">Life of St Magnus,</hi> founded partly
                    on Abbot Robert’s Latin life of him, c. 1150, an Orkney work, partly on Norse or
                    Icelandic biographies; a <hi rend="italic">Miracle-book</hi> of fhe same saint;
                    the <hi rend="italic">Lives of Earl Rognwald and, Sweyn</hi> the last of the
                    vikings, and a few episodes such as the <hi rend="italic">Burning of Bishop
                    Adam.</hi> A scholastic sketch of the rise of the Scandinavian empire,· the <hi
                    rend="italic">Foumlation of Norway,</hi> dating <hi rend="italic">c.</hi> 1120,
                    is prefixed to the whole. The Flatey-book text of this work has been translated
                    by Mr Hjaltalin in Mr Anderson’s <hi rend="italic">Orkneyinga Saga.</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Fwreyinga</hi> tells the tale of the conversion of the Faereys or
                    Faroes, and the lives of its chiefs Sigmund and Leif, composed in the 13th
                    century from their separate sagas by an Icelander of the Sturlung school.</p>
                <p>The saga has already been shown in two forms, its original epic shape and its
                    later development applied to the lives of Norwegian and Danish kings and earls,
                    as heroic but deeper and broader subjects than before. In the 13th century it is
                    put to a third use, to tell the plain story of men’s lives for their
                    contemporaries, after satisfying which demand it dies away for ever.</p>
                <p>These biographies are more literary and mediaeval and less poetic than the
                    Icelandic sagas and king’s lives; their simplicity, truth, realism, and purity
                    of style are the same. They run in two parallel streams, some being concerned
                    with chiefs and champions, some with bishops. The former, as more important,
                    will be taken first. They are mostly found embedded in the complex mass of
                    stories known as <hi rend="italic">Starlunga,</hi> from which Dr Vigfusson has
                    extricated them, and for the first time set them in order. Among them are the
                    sagas of <hi rend="italic">Thorgils and Hafiidi</hi> (1118-21), the feud and
                    peacemaking of two great chiefs contemporaries of Ari; of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Sturla</hi> (1150-83), the founder of the great Sturlung family, down to the
                    settlement of his great lawsuit by Jon Loptsson, who thereupon took his son
                    Snorri the historian to fosterage,—a humorous story but with traces of the
                    decadence about it, and glimpses of the evil days that were to come; of the <hi
                    rend="italic">Burning of 0nund</hi> (1185-1200), a tale of feud and fire-raising
                    in the north of the island, the hero of which, Gudmund Dyri, goes at last into a
                    cloister; of <hi rend="italic">Hrafn Sweinbiornsson</hi> (1190-1213), the
                    noblest Icelander of his day, warrior, leech, seaman, craftsman, poet, and
                    chief, whose life at home, travels and pilgrimages abroad (Hrafn was one of the
                    first to visit Becket’s shrine), and death at the hands of a foe whom he had
                    twice spared, are recounted by a loving friend in pious memory of his virtues,
                    c. 1220; of <hi rend="italic">Aaron Hiorleifsson</hi> (1200-55), a man whose
                    strength, courage, and adventures befit rather a henchman of Olaf Tryggvason
                    than one of King Hakon’s thaues (the beginning of the feuds that rise round
                    Bishop Gudmund are told here), of the <hi rend="italic">Swinefell-men</hi>
                    (1248-52), a pitiful story of a family feud in the far east of Iceland.</p>
                <p>But the most important" works of this class are the <hi rend="italic">Islendinga
                    Saga</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Thorgils Saga</hi> of Lawman Sturla. Sturla and
                    his brother Olaf were the sons of Thord Sturlason and his mistress Thora. He was
                    bora and brought up in prosperous times, when all was fair for the Sturlungs,
                    -but his manhood was passed in the midst of strife and war, in which his family
                    fell one by one, and he himself, though a peaceful man who cared little for
                    politics, was more than once forced to fly for his life. While in refuge with
                    King Magnus, in Norway, he wrote his two sagas of that king and his father.
                    After his first stay in Norway he came back in 1271, with the new Norse
                    law-book, and served a second time as lawman. The <hi rend="italic"
                    >Islendinga</hi> must have fieen the work of his later years, composed at Fairey
                    in Broadfirth, where he died, 30th July 1284, aged about seventy years. The saga
                    of <hi rend="italic">Thorgils Skardi</hi> (1252-61) seems to have been the first
                    of his works on Icelandic contemporary history; it deals with the life of his
                    own nephew, especially his career in Iceland from 1252 to 1258. The second part
                    of <hi rend="italic">Islendinga</hi> (1242-1262), which relates to the second
                    part of the civil war, telling of the careers of Thord Kakali, Kolbein the
                    Young, Earl Gizur, and Hrafn Oddsson. The end is imperfect, there being a blank
                    of some years before the fragmentary ending to which an editor has affixed a
                    notice of the author’s death. The first part of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Islendinga</hi> (1202-42) tells of the beginning and first part of the civil
                    wars, the lives of Snorri and Sighvat, Sturla’s uncles, of his cousin and
                    namesake Sturla Sighvats-son, of Bishop Gudmund, and Thorwald Gizursson,—the
                    fall of the Sturlungs, and with them the last hopes of the great houses to
                    maintain the commonwealth, being the climax of the story.</p>
                <p>Sturla’s power lies in his faithfulness to nature, minute observance of detail,
                    and purity of style. The great extent of his subject, and the difficulty of
                    dealing with it in the saga form, are most skilfully overcome; nor does he allow
                    prejudice or favour to stand in the way of the truth, a thing hard to avoid for
                    one writing of contemporary events in which his own kinsmen have been concerned.
                    He ranks below Ari in value and below Snorri in power; but no one else can
                    dispute his place in the first rank of Icelandic writers.</p>

                    >Hunger-waker,</hi> lives of the first five bishops of Skalholt, and biographies
                    of his patron <hi rend="italic">Bishop Paul,</hi> and also of <hi rend="italic"
                    >St Thorlak.</hi> They are full of interesting notices of social and church
                    life. Thorlak was a learned man, and had studied at Paris and Lincoln, which he
                    left in 1161. These lives cover the years 1056- 1193. The <hi rend="italic">Life
                    of St John,</hi> a great reformer, a contemporary of Thorodd, whom he employed
                    to build a church for him, is by another author (1052-1121). The <hi
                    rend="italic">Life of Gudmund,</hi> as priest, recounts the early life of this
                    Icelandic Becket till his election as bishop (1160-1202); his after career must
                    be sought out in <hi rend="italic">Islendinga.</hi> It is written by a friend
                    and contemporary. A later life by Arngrim, abbot of Thingore, written <hi
                    rend="italic">c.</hi> 1350, as evidence of his subject’s sanctity, tells a good
                    deal about Icelandic life, &amp;c. The <hi rend="italic">Lives of Bishops Arni
                    and Lawrence</hi> bring down our knowledge of Icelandic history into the 14th
                    century. The former work' is unhappily imperfect; it is the record of the
                    struggles of church and state over patronage rights and glebes, written c. 1315;
                    it now covers only the years 1269-91; a great many documents are given in it,
                    after the modern fashion. The latter, <hi rend="italic">Lawrence's Life,</hi> by
                    his disciple, priest Einar Haflidason, is a charming biography of a good and
                    pious man, whose chequered career in Norway and Iceland is picturesquely told
                    (1324-31). It is the last of the sagas. <hi rend="italic">Bishop Jon's
                    Table-Talk</hi> (1325-39) is also worth noticing; it contains many popular
                    stories which the good bishop, who had studied at Bologna and Paris, was wont to
                    tell to his friends.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Annals</hi> are now almost the sole material for Icelandic
                    history; they had begun earlier, but after 1331 they got fuller and richer, till
                    they end in 1430. The best are <hi rend="italic">Annales Regii,</hi> ending
                    1306, <hi rend="italic">Einar Haflidasons Annals,</hi> known as “Lawman’s
                    Annals,” reaching to 1392, and preserved with others in <hi rend="italic"
                    >Flatey-book,</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">New Annals,</hi> last of all. The
                    <hi rend="italic">Icelandic Diplomatarium,</hi> edited by Jon Sigurdsson,
                    contains what remains of deeds, inventories, letters, &amp;c., from the old
                    days, completing our scanty material for this dark period of the island’s
                    history.</p>
                <p>After the union and change of law genuine tradition died out with the great
                    houses, and the kings’ lives and biographies ceased to please. The ordinary
                    mediaeval literature reached Iceland through Norway, and every one began to take
                    delight in it and put it into a vernacular dress, so neglecting their own
                    classics that but for a few collectors like Lawman Hawk they would have perished
                    entirely.</p>
                <p>The Norwegian kings, Hakon Hakonson, <hi rend="italic">c.</hi> 1225, and Hakon
                    V., <hi rend="italic">c</hi><hi rend="italic">.</hi> 1305, employed Icelanders
                    at their courts in translating the French romances of the Alexander, Arthur, and
                    Charlemagne cycles. Some forty or fifty of these <hi rend="italic"
                    >Riddara-Sögur</hi> (Romances of Chivalry) still remain. They reached Iceland
                    and were eagerly read, many Rimur being founded on them. Norse versions of <hi
                    rend="italic">Mary of Brittany's Lays,</hi> the stories of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Brutus</hi> and of <hi rend="italic">Troy,</hi> and part of the <hi

                    >Speculum Regale,</hi> with its interesting geographical and social information,
                    is also Norse,· written <hi rend="italic">c.</hi> 1240, by a Halogalander. The
                    computistic and arithmetical treatises of Stiorn-Odd, Biarni the Number-skilled,
                    d. 1173, and Hawk the Lawman, d. 1334, and the geography of Ivar Bardsson, a
                    Norwegian, c. 1340, are of course of foreign origin. A few tracts on geography,
                    &amp;c., in Hawk’s book, and a <hi rend="italic">Guide to the Holy Land,</hi> by
                    Nicholas, abbot of Thwera, d, 1158, complete the list of scientific works.</p>
                <p>The stories which contain the last lees of the old mythology and pre-history seem
                    to be also non-Icelandic, but stuffed out and amplified by Icelandic editors,
                    who probably got the plots from the Western Islands. <hi rend="italic">Wolsunga
                    Saga</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Hervarar Saga</hi> contain quotations and

                    they enjoyed great popularity in the 15th century, and gave matter for many
                    Rimur. <hi rend="italic">Thidrek's Saga,</hi> a late version of the Wolsung

                <p>The mediaeval religious literature of Western Europe also reached and influenced

                    known as <hi rend="italic">Stiorιι,</hi> The Norse version of the famous <hi

                <p>The post-classical literature falls chiefly under three heads,— religious,
                    literary, and scientific. Under the first comes foremost the noble translation
                    of the New Testament by Odd Gottskalksson, son of the bishop of Holar. Brought
                    up in Norway, he travelled in Denmark and Germany, and took upon him the new
                    faith before he returned to Iceland, where he became secretary to Bishop 0gmund
                    of Skalholt. Here he began by translating the Gospel of Matthew into his
                    mother-tongue in secret. Having finished the remainder of the New Testament at
                    his own house at Olves, he took it to Denmark, where it was printed at Roskild
                    in 1540. Odd afterwards translated the Psalms, and several devotional works of
                    the day, Corvinus’s <hi rend="italic">Epistles,</hi> &amp;c. He was made lawman
                    of the north and west, and died from a fall in the Laxa in Kios, June 1556.
                    Three years after his death the first press was set up in Iceland by John
                    Matthewson, at Breidabolstad, in Hunafloe, and a <hi rend="italic">Gospel and
                    Epistle Book,</hi> according to Odd’s version, issued from it in 1562. In 1584
                    Bishop Gudbrand, who had brought over a splendid fount of type from Denmark in
                    1575 (which he completed with his own hands), printed a translation of the whole
                    Bible at Holar, incorporating Odd’s versions and some books (Proverbs and the
                    Son of Sirach, 1580) translated by Bishop Gizar, but supplying most of the Old
                    Testament himself. This fine volume has been the basis of every Bible issued for
                    Iceland till 1826, when it was replaced by a bad modern version. For beauty of
                    language and faithful simplicity of style the finer parts of this version,
                    especially the New Testament, have never been surpassed in any tongue; they
                    stand worthily beside the work of Tyndale, Luther, and Ulfila, foremost
                    monuments of the Teutonic tongues.</p>
                <p>The most notable theological work Iceland ever produced is the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Postill-Book</hi> of Bishop John Widalin (1666-1720), whose bold homely style
                    and stirring eloquence made “John’s Book,” as it is lovingly called, a favourite
                    in every household, till in the present century it has been replaced for the
                    worse by the more sentimental and polished Danish tracts and sermons.
                    Theological literature is very popular, and many works on this subject, chiefly
                    translations, will beffound in the lists of Icelandic bibliographers.</p>
                <p>The Renaissance of Iceland dates from the beginning of the 17th century, when a
                    school of antiquarians arose and betook themselves to the task of reconstructing
                    their country’s history from the remains their pious care gathered and
                    preserved. Arngrim Jonsson’s <hi rend="italic">Brevis</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Commentarius,</hi> 1593, and <hi rend="italic">Crymogoea,</hi> 1609, were the
                    first-fruits of this movement, of which Bishops Odd, Thorlak, and Bryniulf
                    (worthy parallels to Parker and Laud) were the wise and earnest supporters. The
                    first (d. 1630) collected much material for church history. The second (d. 1656)
                    saved <hi rend="italic">Sturlunga</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">Bishops'
                    Lives,</hi> encouraged John Egilsson to write his <hi rend="italic">New
                    Hunger-waker,</hi> lives of the bishops of the Dark Ages and Reformation, and
                    helped Biorn of Skardsa (d. 1655), a bold and patriotic antiquary (whose <hi
                    rend="italic">Annals</hi> continue Einar’s), in his researches. The last (d.
                    1675) collected a fine library of MSS., and employed the famous copyist John
                    Erlendsson, to whom and the bishop’s brother, John Gizurarsson (d. 1648), we are
                    much beholden for transcripts of many Jost MSS.</p>
                <p>Torfaeus (1636-1719) and Bartholin, a Dane (d. 1690), roused the taste for
                    northern literature in Europe, a taste which has never since flagged; and soon
                    after them Arni Magnusson transferred all that remained of vellum and good paper
                    MSS. in Iceland to Denmark, and laid the foundations of the famous library and
                    bequest, for which all Icelandic students are so much beholden. For over forty
                    years Arni stuck to his task, rescuing every scrap he could lay hands on from
                    the risks of the Icelandic climate and carelessness, and when he died in 1730,
                    aged fifty-seven, only one good MSS. remained in the island. Besides his
                    magnificent collection, there are a few MSS. of great value at Upsala, at
                    Stockholm, and in the old royal collection at Copenhagen. Those in the
                    university library in the latter city perished in the fire of 1728. Sagas were
                    printed at Upsala and Copenhagen in the 17th century, and the Arna-Magnaean fund
                    has been working since 1772. In that year appeared also the first volume of
                    Bishop Finn Johnsson’s <hi rend="italic">Historia Ecclesiastica</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Islandiae,</hi> a work of high value and much erudition,
                    containing not only ecclesiastical but civil and literary history, illustrated
                    by a well-chosen mass.of documents, 870-1740. It has been continued by Bishop P.
                    Peterson to modern times, 1740-1840. The results, however, of modern observers
                    and scholars must be sought for in the periodicals, <hi rend="italic">Safn,

                    Scandinavia and Germany who have thrown themselves so heartily into the work of
                    illustrating, publishing, and editing the sagas and poems (men like Munch,
                    Bugge, Bergmann, Mobius, and Maurer, to name only a few), can only be referred
                    to here.</p>
                <p>The first modern scientific work is the <hi rend="italic">Iter per</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">patriam</hi> of Eggert Olafsson and Biarni Paulsson, which gives a
                    careful and correct account of the physical peculiarities—fauna, flora,
                    &amp;c.—of the island as far as could be done at the date of its appearance,
                    1772. The island was first made known to “the world” by this book and by the
                    sketch of Unno von Troil, a Swede, who accompanied Sir Joseph Banks to Iceland
                    in 1772, and afterwards wrote a series of “letters” on the land and its
                    literature, &amp;c. This tour was the forerunner of an endless series of
                    “travels,” of which those of Hooker (1809), Mackenzie (1810), Henderson (1818),
                    Gaimard (1838-43), Paijkull (1867), and, lastly, that of Captain Burton, an
                    excellent account of the land and people, crammed with information of every kind
                    (1875), are the best.</p>
                <p>The maps by Olson and his colleagues, by Gunnlaugson, and by the French Admiralty
                    are good. Kälund’s work on the historical geography of the island is valuable
                    and interesting. <hi rend="italic">Safn</hi> and other periodicals above
                    mentioned contain many able papers on scientific and sociological matters.
                    Iceland is an interesting field for the pathologist and physician, and numerous
                    medical treatises, Icelandic and foreign, have attacked it. Dr Hjaltalin, the
                    present medical director, is perhaps the best modern authority.</p>
                <p>The cathedral high school merged into a college in 1801, which was fixed at
                    Bessastad during its palmiest days (1805-46), and is now at Reykjavik. Among its
                    lists of masters several distinguished names figure, for example, Sweinbiom
                    Egilsson, whose Homeric translations were issued as college “programs.” A law
                    school has been recently formed at Reykjavik and a technical school at
                    Mödruvellir. The museum and library, both at Reykjavik, still in the rudimentary
                    state, are to be newly housed and extended.</p>
                <p>Iceland is emphatically a land of proverbs, which occur on almost every page of
                    the dictionary, while of folk-tales, those other keys to the people’s heart,
                    there is plentiful store. Early work in this direction was done by Jon
                    Gudmundsson, Olaf the Old, and John Olafsson in the 17th century, who all put
                    traditions on paper, and their labours have been completed by the magnificent
                    collection of Jon Arħason (1862-64), who, inspired by the example of the Grimms,
                    spent great toil on his self-imposed task. Many tales are but weak echoes of the
                    sagas; many were family legends, many the old fairy tales we all know so well,
                    dressed in a fresh garb suited to their new northern home; but, besides all
                    these, there are a number of traditions and superstitions not found elsewhere,
                    the mass of which is of indigenous growth and origin. Some of Arnason’s
                    collections have been put into English by Messrs J. G. G. Powell and E.
                    Magnusson, and Sir G. Dasent.</p>
                <p>A few translations of popular and famous books, such as the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Arabian Nights,</hi> one or two classics, and a tale, <hi rend="italic">Piltr
                    og Stulka</hi> (“Lad and Lass ”), 1850, complete the notabilities of Icelandic
                    bibliography. Mr Lidderdale has prepared a list of Icelandic-printed books,
                    which it is hoped may be published; the excellent <hi rend="italic"
                    >Catalogus</hi> of Mobius is of use for dates, &amp;c., of editions.</p>
                <p>Unlike England and France, Iceland has had but one golden age of literature upon
                    which all her fame must rest. Of its creations it has been truly said that they
                    fill a place none others could take in the high ranks of Aryan classics. The
                    noblest of them are distinguished by pure and strict form, noble heroic subject,
                    and simple truthful self-control of style and treatment, free alike from
                    overwrought sentiment or extravagant passion, and raised equally above euphemism
                    and commonplace, but ever inspired by a weird Aeschylean power, grim and tender,
                    and splendid as that which breathes through those historical books of the Old
                    Testament, to which alone should the masterpieces of Iceland’s greatest writers
                    be compared.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Language.</hi></p>
                <p>The relations of Icelandic to the other Teutonic tongues may be best shown by a
                    chronological treatment. It presents the following anomalies :—on the one hand,
                    it has a highly inflexional grammar, a pure vocabulary, and a simple syntax,
                    points which would place it side by side with Gothic; but, on the other hand, it
                    shows such strong marks of contraction and such deep phonetic changes,
                    especially in the vowels, as can only be paralleled in the modern English. It is
                    further noteworthy for its unity or lack of dialectic variation, and possesses
                    exceptional advantages for the philologist in the complete series of documents
                    dating from the 11th century downwards m which its history may be most
                    accurately and minutely studied.</p>
                <p>There is little doubt but that the Teutonic tribes of the 4th century all spoke
                    one language, that, in fact, of which the remains of Ulfila (which may be
                    supplemented by a few inscriptions, such as those of the Golden Horn and the
                    earliest Danish rune-stones, and a few stray words preserved in classic authors)
                    afford us such a noble specimen. The first differentiation occurred when the
                    English colony separated in the 5th century from the parent stock, and,
                    following its own course of development, already by the time of Bede presented
                    many new and peculiar characteristics in form and vocabulary. With the changes
                    which produced the High German dialects it does not behove us to deal here, so
                    we may pass on to the Viking Tide (775-925), the results of which were felt over
                    a wide area, and are evidenced by the changes which gave to the tongue of those
                    tribes that took part in it a distinctly Scandinavian character.</p>
                <p>Just as the earlier movement left its mark in Old English, so this one is clearly
                    seen in the speech of the Scandinavian colonies of the West, especially in
                    Icelandic, but it is still well marked in the Eastern Scandinavian
                    dialects—Swedish, Danish, &amp;c., as the following points common to all east
                    and west, and marking them off clearly from all other Teutonic tongues, will
                    show strong stemcontraction reducing all words as far as possible to a trochaic
                    form; <hi rend="italic">i-umlaut</hi> carried out very fully and consistently;
                    the suffixing of the article; and a peculiar vocabulary which has ch&lt; sen out
                    of the common Teutonic stock certain words for daily use, rejecting others which
                    are common to all the other sister tongues— <hi rend="italic">e.g., eld</hi> for
                    <hi rend="italic">fire, ekkia</hi> for <hi rend="italic">widow, garnol</hi> for
                    <hi rend="italic">old, eigi</hi> for <hi rend="italic">not, ok</hi> for <hi
                    rend="italic">and,</hi><hi rend="italic">göra</hi> for <hi rend="italic">do,
                    taka</hi> for <hi rend="italic">niman, kc.</hi> The later-Danish rune-stones and
                    those of Sweden, published by Wimmer, Save, Dy beck, &amp;c., will be the best
                    documents for this stage of the Scandinavian tongue.</p>
                <p>We may now leave the Eastern Scandinavian dialects to follow their own course,
                    which has led them through a path not entirely dissimilar to that which English
                    has taken, and confine ourselves to the Western Colonial dialects. Those in
                    their earliest monuments, the rune-stones of Man, the coins of the “Danish”
                    kings and earls in Ireland and England, the lays of the Western poets in the <hi
                    rend="italic">Edda</hi> collection, and the earliest poetry of such Icelandic
                    bards as Egill and Kormak, exhibit certain idiosyncrasies which show them to
                    have already started on their own career. Such are the <hi rend="italic"
                    >u-umlaut,</hi> the loss of <hi rend="italic">w</hi> before <hi rend="italic"
                    >r</hi> and <hi rend="italic">l,</hi> the simplification of the vowel system
                    (all aggravations, as it were, of the Scandinavian peculiarities noticed above,
                    while their vocabulary is, as one would expect, affected by the introduction of
                    many English, Gaelic, and Latin words, especially those relating to ideas
                    unknown in earlier heathen days, ecclesiastical terms, &amp;c.). Of these
                    western colonies we are only concerned with the most important, Iceland; the
                    Orkneys and Hebrides have no. linguistic monuments later than the Edda lays of
                    the 10th and llth, and epigonic poetry and rhymed gradus-jingles of the 12th
                    century; the influence of the Danes on our dialects and book-English must be
                    left to English philologists; while in Ireland only a few personal and local
                    names now betray to the ear the former presence of the Ostman.</p>
                <p>The fact that one of the first Icelandic writers, <hi rend="italic">c.</hi> 1120,
                    Ari’s contemporary, Thorodd, is a grammarian, and one of no mean power, is our
                    greatest help towards ascertaining the phonesis of the tongue during the heroic
                    age; and his evidence is supplemented by the Icelandic poets, whose strict
                    adherence to metres, which depend for their effect on a delicate harmony of
                    sound and a rigid observance of quantity, is absolutely to be trusted. Thorodd’s
                    scheme for the proper phonetic representation of Icelandic (which the English
                    student may contrast with that of 0rm, our first spelling reformer) is briefly
                    as follows. The letters <hi rend="italic">b,c,df,g,l,m,n,p,r,s,t,</hi> are used
                    in their ordinary classic values (c always hard), the capitals <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">b,k,d,f, g,l,m,n,p,r,s,t,</hi> being employed for the doubled
                    letters <hi rend="italic">bb,</hi> &amp;c. (each consonant of these doubles was
                    of course separately and distinctly pronounced as in Italian now, and, as Mr A.
                    J. Ellis has proved, in Latin formerly); p is used as in Old English for <hi
                    rend="italic">th; h</hi> for the aspirate pure or combined <hi rend="italic">hl,
                    hn,</hi> &amp;c.; both these are of unvarying form; <hi rend="italic">X</hi> for
                    <hi rend="italic">cs, gs,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">η</hi> for <hi
                    rend="italic">ng</hi> can only be found in medial and final positions. Thus we
                    get twenty-eight consonants. The vowels, <hi rend="italic"
                    >a,e,i,o,u,y,ce,oe</hi> long and short, have their ordinary values [pal.
                    a,e,i,o,u,ι,E,ai and aa, <hi rend="italic">ce,</hi> &amp;c.], and to them
                    Thorodd has added <hi rend="italic">ao</hi><hi rend="smallcaps">[&lt;b]</hi>
                    long and short. All these vowels may also be nasalized, <hi rend="italic"
                    >à,ê,</hi> &amp;c., making twenty-seven in all; <hi rend="italic">i</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">u,</hi> whether consonantal or vocal, do not vary in form. The
                    following points characterize the tongue at this period;—adherence to <hi
                    rend="italic">o</hi> in the terminations, right employment of the subjunctive,
                    which has since gone completely out of use, retention of <hi rend="italic"
                    >s</hi> in inflexion and the substantive verb. Quantity was strictly observed in
                    speaking, and also accent, and no doubt people, as in Old England, spoke much
                    more clearly, slowly, and energetically than they do now. The introduction of
                    quantitative metres measured by syllables is no doubt to be ascribed to Celtic
                    influence, as are the line-rhymes and assonances and rhyme-endings, which, as
                    any reader of Snorri’s <hi rend="italic">Hatla-tal</hi> or Earl Rognwald’s <hi
                    rend="italic">Hatta∙lykill</hi> will see at the first glance, completely
                    separated Icelandic poetry from the original Teutonic metric of the Continental
                    nine-stones, of Beowulf, and of Havamal.</p>
                <p>Thorodd’s scheme was unfortunately never used in its strict completeness, but it
                    is partly employed in the following MSS., which are of the highest authority for
                    this era of the Icelandic :— <hi rend="italic">Elucidarius, c.</hi> 1130, ed.

                <p>The first era of change, ascribed by Dr Vigfusson to about the lifetime of
                    Snorri, is the mark left by the civil wars and the connexion with Norway (our
                    14th century Wars of the Roses transition is in many respects its parallel). It
                    is seen in the normal spelling of the editions of the sagas, &amp;c., and is
                    best exemplified by the famous AM. 132, c. 1300, and the <hi rend="italic"

                    >u-umlauted</hi><hi rend="italic">ά,</hi> the confusion of <hi rend="italic"
                    >oe</hi> and <hi rend="italic">oe, ae</hi> and <hi rend="italic">e, ao</hi> and
                    <hi rend="italic">eo</hi> (the latter of each couple prevailing), the hardening
                    of the dental finals and the blurring of <hi rend="italic">st, sk,</hi> &amp;c.
                    into <hi rend="italic">z.</hi> This stage of spelling and pronunciation is that
                    which should be adhered to in all works which must be printed in an uniform way,
                    dictionaries, grammars, classic editions, &amp;c. The student may be cautioned
                    not to take the vagaries of Norse scribes, or Noricized Icelanders (such as
                    Hawk) for important phonetic variations.</p>
                <p>The second era of change is that which accompanied the Reformation, and witnesses
                    to the mental and physical stir produced by that movement. It is only heard in
                    the spoken tongue (for all books, save a few printed during the last few years,
                    follow the normal type of the 14th and 15th century MSS. with few variations),
                    but it is none the less deep and important. Its leading features are the loss of
                    quantity and intonation, the confusion of the vowels <hi rend="italic">y</hi>
                    and <hi rend="italic">u,</hi><hi rend="italic">oe</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >ai,</hi><hi rend="italic">ey</hi> and <hi rend="italic">au, au</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">ά,</hi><hi rend="italic">ei i i</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >ey</hi><hi rend="italic">y y</hi> (the latter taking the sound of the former in
                    each case), the diphthongization of the long vowels <hi rend="italic">i,</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">ê, ô, u,</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi> all changes which from their
                    symmetry must have taken place at one date,—the differentiation of doubled and
                    touching consonants, <hi rend="italic">ll, nn, gn,</hi> &amp;c., and of final
                    <hi rend="italic">r.</hi> The vocabulary, which during the connexion with Norway
                    and England through the “Dark Age” had been enriched with many French and
                    English words, now received an important augmentation in a new religious
                    terminology from Germany, while the intercourse with Denmark began to leave its
                    mark in loan-words and Danicisms, the stock of which tended greatly to increase,
                    till a reaction arose in the present century, which, though excusable, has been
                    carried to laughable lengths. The metre of Icelandic poetry had begun to show
                    signs of mediaeval influence (of French origin) even before the death of Snorri,
                    as a ditty in <hi rend="italic">Sturlunga</hi> shows. During the Dark Age
                    theRimur metric system, depending largely on time-ending and burden for new
                    effects though still retaining line rhyme and alliteration (the latter being
                    absolutely essential), revolutionized poetry, and later the hymns of the
                    Reformation, shaking themselves free from the somewhat monotonous beat of the
                    Rimur, contain examples of many new and ingenious metres.</p>
                <p>The absence of dialects in Iceland results from the essential unity of life in
                    that island, and the lack of any of the conditions which during the Middle Ages
                    produced dialects in England, Germany, and France, such as town-life with its
                    guilds and varied interests, the great corporations, ecclesiastical, legal, and
                    medical, which by their necessary use of Latin cut off the most highly educated
                    classes from exercising any influence on the vernacular, and the caste
                    influences of chivalry, &amp;c., which sometimes, as in England, allowed the
                    upper classes to use a separate foreign language. In early times before the
                    Danish conquest there were no dialects, because, life being single, king and
                    serf, soldier and peasant, merchant and priest must live and speak alike. So we
                    see in our own days the newspaper, the state school, the railway, the
                    conscription, and the theatre, all tending to bring about in each great European
                    state a sameness of life, thought, and speech through every nook and corner of
                    its area.</p>
                <p>The general characteristics of the Icelandic tongue are those of a spoken speech,
                    <hi rend="italic">par excellence,—</hi> a pure and correct vocabulary well
                    suited to the every-day needs of a pastoral life, a pithy and homely vigour of
                    idiom (this shows especially in the saws and proverbs which often recall those
                    of Spain), a delicacy and regularity of syntax, which can express much with few
                    and simple means, and an accuracy of terminology well becoming a legal-minded
                    people. All these salient characters strike every observer, but the full beauty
                    and power of the tongue as a vehicle of the highest expression can only be
                    tested by a careful study of the masterpieces written in it. No one that has not
                    read the finest chapters of <hi rend="italic">Niala</hi> or <hi rend="italic"
                    >Olaf Tryggvasson's Life,</hi> the <hi rend="italic">Talcs</hi> of Snorri, or a
                    <hi rend="italic">Gospel</hi> in Odd’s translation, not to speak of other works
                    almost equally worthy of mention, can judge fairly of the capacity, force, and
                    sweetness of this most classic language.</p>
                <p>A few words are due to those whose labours have rendered the task of mastering it
                    easy and pleasant. The oldest philologist, Thorodd, has been noticed; an
                    anonymous grammarian of the next generation, <hi rend="italic">c.</hi> 1175,
                    attempted a classification of letters and sounds; Sturla’s brother Olaf, the
                    White Poet, applied the figures, &amp;c., of Donatus and Pιdscian to Icelandic,
                    in which task he was followed by a continuator. All these treatises were
                    published along with the <hi rend="italic">Thulur,</hi> rhymed glossaries
                    (compiled in the Western Islands, probably in the Orkneys), in vol. ii. of the
                    AM. edition of the <hi rend="italic">Edda,</hi> to a MS. of which they are found
                    affixed, Copenhagen, 1832.</p>
                <p>Of modern works, those of Rask, the founder of modern Icelandic philology,
                    Egillson, the learned author of the <hi rend="italic">Poetic Lexicon,</hi>
                    otherwise well known by his translation of Homer, and Fritzner, the first real
                    Icelandic lexicographer, deserve reverent mention. But for all practical
                    purposes their labours have been superseded and their designs fulfilled by Dr
                    Gudbrand Vigfusson, whose <hi rend="italic">Icelandic-English Dictionary,</hi>
                    Oxford, 1869-75, must, whether one looks to its scientific philology,
                    completeness, accuracy, or arrangement, be pronounced the best existing
                    dictionary of any Teutonic tongue. It comprises a grammar and phonology, &amp;c.
                    The university of Oxford has recently published, under the editorship of Messrs
                    Vigfusson and Powell, a very complete <hi rend="italic">Icelandic Prose
                    Reader.</hi> In the scattered opuscula of Dr Bugge, as well as in his notes to
                    the poetic <hi rend="italic">Edda,</hi> areto be found many interesting
                    “equations” and observations on the langauge and comparative mythology of
                    Scandinavia.</p>
                <p>To English philologists the study of Icelandic is of high importance, as bearing
                    upon the grammar and vocabulary of our most important dialect, the Northumbrian,
                    to a scientific knowledge of which it is absolutely necessary. A list of words
                    occurring in every-day English which we owe to the Scandinavian settlers of the
                    Danelaw will be found in the Oxford <hi rend="italic">Icelandic Reader.</hi> To
                    Irish scholars the old northern tongue is also of interest, as not only did
                    those who spoke it borrow much from their Celtic friends and foes, but there was
                    also a certain amount of reflex action which it would be desirable to fully
                    trace out. As the most regular and pure of the Teutonic dialects, its value to
                    the comparative philologist is sufficiently obvious. (F. Y. P.)</p>
