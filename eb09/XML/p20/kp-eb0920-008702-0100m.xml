                    Ptolemaeus)</hi></label>, celebrated as a mathematician, astronomer, and
                    geographer. He was a native of Egypt, but there is an uncertainty as to the
                    place of his birth; some ancient manuscripts of his works describe him as of
                    Pelusium, but Theodorus Meliteniota, a Greek writer on astronomy of the 12th
                    century, says that he was born at Ptolemais Hermii, a Grecian city of the
                    Thebaid. It is certain that he observed at Alexandria during the reigns of
                    Hadrian and Antoninus Pius, and that he survived Antoninus. Olympiodorus, a
                    philosopher of the Neoplatonic school who lived in the reign of the emperor
                    Justinian, relates in his scholia on the <hi rend="italic">Phaedo</hi> of Plato
                    that Ptolemy devoted his life to astronomy and lived for forty years in the
                    so-called ∏τ∈pα <hi rend="italic">τoυ Kavωβov,</hi> probably elevated terraces
                    of the temple of Serapis at Canopus near Alexandria, where they raised pillars
                    with the results of his astronomical discoveries engraved upon them. This
                    statement is probably correct; we have indeed the direct evidence of Ptolemy
                    himself that he made astronomical observations during a long series of years;
                    his first recorded observation was made in the eleventh year of Hadrian, 127 <hi

                    moon in that year Ptolemy, however, does not say, as in other similar cases, <hi

                    Antoninus, 151 A.D. Ptolemy, moreover, says, “We make our observations in the
                    parallel of Alexandria.” St Isidore of Seville asserts that he was of the royal
                    race of the Ptolemies, and even calls him king of Alexandria; this assertion has
                    been followed by others, but there is no ground for their opinion. Indeed
                    Fabricius shows by numerous instances that the name Ptolemy was common in Egypt.
                    Weidler, from whom this is taken, also tells us that according to Arabian
                    tradition Ptolemy lived to the age of seventy-eight years; from the same source
                    some description of his personal appearance has been handed down, which is
                    generally considered as not trustworthy, but which may be seen in Weidler, <hi

                    preface to Halma’s edition of the <hi rend="italic">Almagest,</hi> p. lxi.
                    Ptolemy’s work as a geographer is treated of below (p. 91 <hi rend="italic"
                    >sq.),</hi> and an account of the discoveries in astronomy of Hipparchus and
                    Ptolemy has been given in the article <hi rend="smallcaps">Astronomy.</hi> Their
                    contributions to pure mathematics have not yet been noticed in the present work.
                    Of these the chief is the foundation of trigonometry, plane and spherical,
                    including the formation of a table of chords, which served the same purpose as
                    our table of sines. This branch of mathematics was created by Hipparchus for the
                    use of astronomers, and its exposition was given by Ptolemy in a form so perfect
                    that for 1400 years it was not surpassed. In this respect it may be compared
                    with the doctrine as to the motion of the heavenly bodies so well known as the
                    Ptolemaic system, which was paramount for about the same period of time. There
                    is, however, this difference, that, whereas the Ptolemaic system was then
                    overthrown, the theorems of Hipparchus and Ptolemy, on the other hand, will be,
                    as Delambre says, for ever the basis of trigonometry. The astronomical and
                    trigonometrical systems are contained in the great work of Ptolemy Ή <hi

                    rend="italic">Syntaxis</hi> of Ptolemy was called Ό <hi rend="italic"
                    >μ'eyaς</hi><hi rend="italic">αστρονόμος</hi> to distinguish it from another
                    collection called Ό <hi rend="italic">μικρός αστρονόμος,</hi> also highly
                    esteemed by the Alexandrian school, which contained some works of Autolycus,
                    Euclid, Aristarchus, Theodosius of Tripolis, Hypsicles, and Menelaus. To
                    designate the great work of Ptolemy the Arabs used the superlative <hi
                    rend="italic">μeyiστη,</hi> from which, the article <hi rend="italic">al</hi>
                    being prefixed, the hybrid name <hi rend="italic">Almagest,</hi> by which it is
                    now universally known, is derived.</p>
                <p>We proceed now to consider the trigonometrical work of Hipparchus and Ptolemy. In
                    the ninth chapter of the first book of the <hi rend="italic">Almagest</hi>
                    Ptolemy shows how to form a table of chords. He supposes the circumference
                    divided into 360 equal parts (τμήματα), and then bisects each of these parts.
                    Further, he divides the diameter <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit20newyrich/page/n101/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0920-0101-0088"/> into 120 equal parts, and then for the
                    subdivisions of these he employs the sexagesimal method as most convenient in
                    practice, <hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> he divides each of the sixty parts of the
                    radius into sixty equal parts, and each of these parts he further subdivides
                    into sixty equal parts. In the Latin translation these subdivisions become
                    “partes minute primae” and “partes minute secundae,” whence our “minutes” and
                    “seconds” have arisen. It must not be supposed, however, that these sexagesimal
                    divisions are due to Ptolemy; they must have been familiar to his predecessors,
                    and were handed down from the Chaldaeans. Nor did the formation of the table of
                    chords originate with Ptolemy; indeed, Theon of Alexandria, the father of
                    Hypatia, who lived in the reign of Theodosius, in his commentary on the <hi
                    rend="italic">Almagest</hi> says expressly that Hipparchus had already given the
                    doctrine of chords inscribed in a circle in twelve books, and that Menelaus had
                    done the same in six books, but, he continues, every one must be astonished at
                    the ease with which Ptolemy, by means of a few simple theorems, has found their
                    values; hence it is inferred that the method of calculation in the <hi
                    rend="italic">Almagest</hi> is Ptolemy’s own.</p>
                <p>As starting-point the values of certain chords in terms of the diameter were
                    already known, or could be easily found by means of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Elements</hi><hi rend="italic">of</hi> Euclid. Thus the side of the hexagon, or
                    the chord of 60°, is equal to the radius, and therefore contains sixty parts.
                    The side of the decagon, or the chord of 36°, is the greater segment of the
                    radius cut in extreme and mean ratio, and therefore contains approximately 37
                    <hi rend="superscript"> p</hi> 4' 55" parts, of which the diameter contains 120
                    parts. Further, the square on the side of the regular pentagon is equal to the
                    sum of the squares on the sides of the regular hexagon and of the regular
                    decagon, all being inscribed in the same circle (Euch XIII. 10); the chord of
                    72° can therefore be calculated, and contains approximately 70 <hi
                    rend="superscript"> p</hi> 32' 3". In like manner, the square on the chord of
                    90°, which is the side of the inscribed square, is twice the square on the
                    radius; and the square on the chord of 120°, or the side of the equilateral
                    triangle, is three times the square on the radius; these chords can thus be
                    calculated approximately. Further, from the values of all these chords we can
                    calculate at once the chords of the arcs which are their supplements.</p>
                <p>This being laid down, we now proceed to give Ptolemy’s exposition of the mode of
                    obtaining his table of chords, which is a piece of geometry of great elegance,
                    and is indeed, as De Morgan says, “one of the most beautiful in the Greek
                    writers.”</p>
                <p>He takes as basis and sets forth as a lemma the well-known theorem, which is
                    called after him, concerning a quadrilateral inscribed in a circle: The
                    rectangle under the diagonals is equal to the sum of the rectangles under the
                    opposite sides. By means of this theorem the chord of the sum or of the
                    difference of two arcs whose chords are given can be easily found, for we have
                    only to draw a diameter from the common vertex of the two arcs the chord of
                    whose sum or difference is required, and complete the quadrilateral; in one case
                    a diagonal, in the other one of the sides is a diameter of the circle. The
                    relations thus obtained are equivalent to the fundamental formulae of our
                    trigonometry—</p>
                <p>sin (A + B)=sin A cos B 4-cos A sin B, sin (A - B)=sin A cos B - cos A sin B,
                    which can therefore be established in this simple way.</p>
                <p>Ptolemy then gives a geometrical construction for finding the chord of half an
                    arc from the chord of the arc itself. By means of the foregoing theorems, since
                    we know the chords of 72° and of 60°, we can find the chord of 12°; we can then
                    find the chords of 6°, 3°, l⅜ <hi rend="superscript"> 0</hi>, and three-fourths
                    of 1°, and lastly, the chords of 4⅜ <hi rend="superscript"> 0</hi>, 7⅜ <hi
                    rend="superscript"> o</hi>, 9°, lθ⅜°, &amp;c.,—all those arcs, namely, as
                    Ptolemy says, which being doubled are divisible by 3. Performing the
                    calculations, he finds that the chord of l⅛ <hi rend="superscript"> o</hi>
                    contains approximately l <hi rend="superscript"> p</hi> 34' 55", and the chord
                    of three-fourths of l <hi rend="superscript"> o</hi> contains 0? 47' 8". A table
                    of chords of arcs increasing by l⅜ <hi rend="superscript"> o</hi> can thus be
                    formed; but this is not sufficient for Ptolemy’s purpose, which was to frame a
                    table of chords increasing by half a degree. This could be effected if he knew
                    the chord of one-half of l <hi rend="superscript"> o</hi>; but, since this chord
                    cannot be found geometrically from the chord of l⅛ <hi rend="superscript">
                    o</hi>, inasmuch as that would come to the trisection of an angle, he proceeds
                    to seek in the first place the chord of l <hi rend="superscript"> o</hi>, which
                    he finds approximately by means of a lemma of great elegance, due probably to
                    Apollonius. It is as follows: If two unequal chords be inscribed in a circle,
                    the greater will be to the less in a less ratio than the arc described on the
                    greater will be to the arc described on the less. Having proved this theorem, he
                    proceeds to employ it in order to find approximately the chord of Γ, which he
                    does in the following manner—</p>
                <p>chord 60' 60 . 4 . , , <hi rend="subscript"> 0</hi> 4 , ,</p>
                <p>- <hi rend="subscript"> τ</hi>-—-j-7=7&lt; <hi rend="subscript"> τ</hi> =-,ι.e.,
                    <hi rend="italic superscript"> &lt;</hi><hi rend="italic">ö&gt;</hi><hi

                <p>-= ..chord 1 &gt;-= chord 90.</p>
                <p>chord 60' 60’ ’ 2’ 3</p>
                <p>For brevity we use modern notation. It has been shown that the chord of 45' is 0
                    <hi rend="superscript"> p</hi> 47' 8" q.p., and the chord of 90' is l <hi
                    rend="superscript"> p</hi> 34' 15" q.p.; hence it follows that approximately
                    chord 1° &lt; 1? 2' 50" 40'" and &gt; 1? 2' 50".</p>
                <p>Since these values agree as far as the seconds, Ptolemy takes l <hi
                    rend="superscript"> p</hi> 2' 50" as the approximate value of the chord of 1°.
                    The chord of 1’ being thus known, he finds the chord of one-half of a degree,
                    the approximate value of which is 0 <hi rend="superscript"> p</hi> 31' 25", and
                    he is at once in a position to complete his table of chords for arcs increasing
                    by half a degree. Ptolemy then gives his table of chords, which is arranged in
                    three columns; in the first he has entered the arcs, increasing by half-degrees,
                    from 0° to 180°; in the second he gives the values of the chords of these arcs
                    in parts of which the diameter contains 120, the subdivisions being sexagesimal;
                    and in the third he has inserted the thirtieth parts of the differences of these
                    chords for each half-degree, in order that the chords of the intermediate arcs,
                    which do not occur in the table, may be calculated, it being assumed that the
                    increment of the chords of arcs within the table for each interval of 30' is
                    proportional to the increment of the arc.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                <p>Trigonometry, we have seen, was created by Hipparchus for the use of astronomers.
                    Now, since spherical trigonometry is directly applicable to astronomy, it is not
                    surprising that its development was prior to that of plane trigonometry. It is
                    the subject-matter of the eleventh chapter of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Almagest,</hi> whilst the solution of plane triangles is not treated separately
                    in that work.</p>
                <p>To resolve a plane triangle the Greeks supposed it to be inscribed in a circle;
                    they must therefore have known the theorem—which is the basis of this branch of
                    trigonometry—The sides of a triangle are proportional to the chords of the
                    double arcs which measure the angles opposite to those sides. In the case of a
                    right-angled triangle this theorem, together with Euch I. 32 and 47, gives the
                    complete solution. Other triangles were resolved into right-angled triangles by
                    drawing the perpendicular from a vertex on the opposite side. In one place <hi
                    rend="italic">(Alm.,</hi> vi. c. 7; vol. i. p. 422, ed. Halma) Ptolemy solves a
                    triangle in which the three sides are given by finding the segments of a side
                    made by the perpendicular on it from the opposite vertex. It should be noticed
                    also that the eleventh chapter of the first book of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Almagest</hi> contains incidentally some theorems and problems in plane
                    trigonometry. The problems which are met with correspond to the following:
                    Divide a given arc into two parts so that the chords of the doubles of those
                    arcs shall have a given ratio; the same problem for external section. Lastly, it
                    may be mentioned that Ptolemy <hi rend="italic">(Alm.,</hi> vi. 7; vol. i.</p>

                <p>The foundation of spherical trigonometry is laid in chapter xi. on a few simple
                    and useful lemmas. The starting-point is the well-known theorem of plane
                    geometry concerning the segments of the sides of a triangle made by a
                    transversal: The segments of any side are in a ratio compounded of the ratios of
                    the segments of the other two sides. This theorem, as well as that concerning
                    the inscribed quadrilateral, was called after Ptolemy—naturally, indeed, since
                    no reference to its source occurs in the <hi rend="italic">Almagest.</hi> This
                    error was corrected by Mersenne, who showed that it was known to Menelaus, an
                    astronomer and geometer who lived in the reign of the emperor Trajan. The
                    theorem now bears the name of Menelaus, though most probably it came down from
                    Hipparchus; Chasles, indeed, thinks that Hipparchus deduced the property of the
                    spherical triangle from that of the plane triangle, but throws the origin of the
                    latter further back and attributes it to Euclid, suggesting that it was given in
                    his <hi rend="italic">Porisms.</hi><note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    theorem the basis of his theory of transversals in his essay on that subject. It
                    should be noticed that the theorem is not given in the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Almagest</hi> in the general manner stated above; Ptolemy considers two cases
                    only of the theorem, and Theon, in his commentary on the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Almagest,</hi> has added two more cases. The proofs, however, are general.
                    Ptolemy then lays down two lemmas: If the chord of an arc of a circle be cut in
                    any ratio and a diameter be drawn through the point of section, the diameter
                    will cut the arc into two parts the chords of whose doubles are in the same
                    ratio as the segments of the chord; and a similar theorem in the case when the
                    chord is cut externally in any ratio. By means of these two lemmas Ptolemy
                    deduces in an ingenious manner—easy to follow, but difficult to discover—from
                    the theorem of Menelaus for a plane triangle the corresponding theorem for a
                    spherical triangle: If the sides of a spherical triangle be cut by an arc of a
                    great circle, the chords of the doubles of the segments of any one side will be
                    to each other in a ratio compounded of the ratios of the chords of the doubles
                    of the segments of the other two sides. Here, too, the theorem is not stated
                    generally; two cases only are considered, corresponding to the two cases given
                    <hi rend="italic">in</hi><hi rend="italic">plano.</hi> Theon has added two
                    cases. The proofs are general. By means of this theorem four of Napier’s
                    formulae for the solution of right-angled spherical triangles can be easily <pb

                    each case when required applies the theorem of Menelaus for spherics directly.
                    This greatly increases the length of his demonstrations, which the modern reader
                    finds still more cumbrous, inasmuch as in each case it was necessary to express
                    the relation in terms of chords—the equivalents of sines—only, cosines and
                    tangents being of later invention.</p>
                <p>Such, then, was the trigonometry of the Greeks. Mathematics, indeed, has ever
                    been, as it were, the handmaid of astronomy, and many important methods of the
                    former arose from the needs of the latter. Moreover, by the foundation of
                    trigonometry, astronomy attained its final general constitution, in which
                    calculations took the place of diagrams, as these latter had been at an earlier
                    period substituted for mechanical apparatus in solving the ordinary
                    problems.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Comte, <hi

                    frequent examples and even a systematic use of the method of approximations,—the
                    basis, in fact, of all application of mathematics to practical questions. There
                    was a disinclination on the part of the Greek geometer to be satisfied with a
                    mere approximation, were it ever so close; and the unscientific <hi

                    knowledge which was indispensable for learning trigonometrical calculations.
                    Thus the development of the calculus of approximations fell to the lot of the
                    astronomer, who was both scientific and practical.<note anchored="true"

                <p>We now proceed to notice briefly the contents of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Almagest.</hi> It is divided into thirteen books. The first book, which may be
                    regar&lt;led as introductory to the whole work, opens with a short preface, in
                    which Ptolemy, after some observations on the distinction between theory and
                    practice, gives Aristotle’s division of the sciences and remarks on the
                    certainty of mathematical knowledge, “inasmuch as the demonstrations in it
                    proceed by the incontrovertible ways of arithmetic and geometry.” He concludes
                    his preface with the statement that he will make use of the discoveries of his
                    predecessors, and relate briefly all that has been sufficiently explained by the
                    ancients, but that he will treat with more care and development whatever has not
                    been well understood or fully treated. Ptolemy unfortunately does not always
                    bear this in mind, and it is sometimes difficult to distinguish what is due to
                    him from that which he has borrowed from his predecessors.</p>
                <p>Ptolemy then, in the first chapter, presupposing some preliminary notions on the
                    part of the reader, announces that he will treat in order—what is the relation
                    of the earth to the heavens, what is the position of the oblique circle (the
                    ecliptic), and the situation of the inhabited parts of the earth; that he will
                    point out the differences of climates; that he will then pass on to the
                    consideration of the motion of the sun and moon, without which one cannot have a
                    just theory of the stars; lastly, that he will consider the sphere of the fixed
                    stars and then the theory of the five stars called “planets.” All these things—
                    <hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> the phenomena of the heavenly bodies—he says he
                    will endeavour to explain in taking for principle that which is evident, real,
                    and certain, in resting everywhere on the surest observations and applying
                    geometrical methods. He then enters on a summary exposition of the general
                    principles on which his <hi rend="italic">Syntaxis</hi> is based, and adduces
                    arguments to show that the heaven is of a spherical form and that it moves after
                    the manner of a sphere, that the earth also is of a form which is sensibly
                    spherical, that the earth is in the centre of the heavens, that it is but a
                    point in comparison with the distances of the stars, and that it has not any
                    motion of translation. With respect to the revolution of the earth round its
                    axis, which he says some have held, Ptolemy, while admitting that this
                    supposition renders the explanation of the phenomena of the heavens much more
                    simple, yet regards it as altogether ridiculous. Lastly, he lays down that there
                    are two principal and different motions in the heavens—one by which all the
                    stars are carried from east to west uniformly about the poles of the equator;
                    the other, which is peculiar to some of the stars, is in a contrary direction to
                    the former motion and takes place round different poles. These preliminary
                    notions, which are all older than Ptolemy, form the subjects of the second and
                    following chapters. He next proceeds to the construction of his table of chords,
                    of which we have given an account, and which is indispensable to practical
                    astronomy. The employment of this table presupposes the evaluation of the
                    obliquity of the ecliptic, the knowledge of which is indeed the foundation of
                    all astronomical science. Ptolemy in the next chapter indicates two means of
                    determining this angle by observation, describes the instruments he employed for
                    that purpose, and finds the same value which had already been found by
                    Eratosthenes and used by Hipparchus. This “is followed by spherical geometry and
                    trigonometry enough for the determination of the connexion between the sun’s
                    right ascension, declination, and longitude, and for the formation of a table of
                    declinations to each degree of longitude. Delambre says he found both this and
                    the table of chords very exact.”<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>De Morgan, in Smith’s <hi rend="italic">Dictionary of Greek
                    and Roman Biography, s.v.</hi> “Ptolemaeus, Claudius.”</p></note></p>
                <p>In book ii., after some remarks on the situation of the habitable parts of the
                    earth, Ptolemy proceeds to make deductions from the principles established in
                    the preceding book, which he does by means of the theorem of Menelaus. The
                    length of the longest day being given, he shows how to determine the arcs of the
                    horizon intercepted between the equator and the ecliptic—the amplitude of the
                    eastern point of the ecliptic at the solstice—for different degrees of obliquity
                    of the sphere; hence he finds the height of the pole and reciprocally. From the
                    same data he shows how to find at what places and times the sun becomes vertical
                    and how to calculate the ratios of gnomons to their equinoctial and solstitial
                    shadows at noon and conversely, pointing out, however, that the latter method is
                    wanting in precision. All these matters he considers fully and works out in
                    detail for the parallel of Rhodes. Theon gives us three reasons for the
                    selection of that parallel by Ptolemy: the first is that the height of the pole
                    at Rhodes is 36°, a whole number, whereas at Alexandria he believed it to be 30°
                    58'; the second is that Hipparchus had made at Rhodes many observations; the
                    third is that the climate of Rhodes holds the mean place of the seven climates
                    subsequently described. Delambre suspects a fourth reason, which he thinks is
                    the true one, that Ptolemy had taken his examples from the works of Hipparchus,
                    who observed at Rhodes and had made these calculations for the place where he
                    lived. In chapter vi. Ptolemy gives an exposition of the most important
                    properties of each parallel, commencing with the equator, which he considers as
                    the southern limit of the habitable quarter of the earth. For each parallel or
                    climate, which is determined by the length of the longest day, he gives the
                    latitude, a principal place on the parallel, and the lengths of the shadows of
                    the gnomon at the solstices and equinox. In the next chapter he enters into
                    particulars and inquires what are the arcs of the equator which cross the
                    horizon at the same time as given arcs of the ecliptic, or, λvhich comes to the
                    same thing, the time which a given arc of the ecliptic takes to cross the
                    horizon of a given place. He arrives at a formula for calculating ascensional
                    differences and gives tables of ascensions arranged by 10° of longitude for the
                    different climates from the equator to that where the longest day is seventeen
                    hours. He then shows the use of these tables in the investigation of the length
                    of the day for a given climate, of the manner of reducing temporal<note

                    variable. These hours varied in length with the seasons; they were used in
                    ancient times and arose from the division of the natural day (from sunrise to
                    sunset) into twelve parts.</p></note> to equinoctial hours and <hi rend="italic"
                    >vice versa,</hi> and of the nonagesimal point and the point of orientation of
                    the ecliptic. In the following chapters of this book he determines the angles
                    formed by the intersections of the ecliptic—first with the meridian, then with
                    the horizon, and lastly with the vertical circle—and concludes by giving tables
                    of the angles and arcs formed by the intersection of these circles, for the
                    seven climates, from the parallel of Meroe (thirteen hours) to that of the mouth
                    of the Borysthenes (sixteen hours). These tables, he adds, should be completed
                    by the situation of the chief towns in all countries according to their
                    latitudes and longitudes; this he promises to do in a separate treatise and has
                    in fact done in his <hi rend="italic">Geography.</hi></p>
                <p>Book iii. treats of the motion of the sun and of the length of the year. In order
                    to understand the difficulties of this question Ptolemy says one should read the
                    books of the ancients, and especially those of Hipparchus, whom he praises “as a
                    lover of labour and a lover of truth <hi rend="italic">”</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >(άνδρί</hi><hi rend="italic">φιλoπδv(p τe δμx&gt;υ κal φιλdληθeι').</hi> He
                    begins by telling us how Hipparchus was led to discover the precession of the
                    equinoxes; he relates the observations which led Ärchus to his second great
                    discovery, that of the eccentricity solar orbit, and gives the hypothesis of the
                    eccentric by which he explained the inequality of the sun’s motion. Ptolemy
                    concludes this book by giving a clear exposition of the circumstances on which
                    the equation of time depends. All this the reader will find in the article <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Astronomy</hi> (vol. it p. 750). Ptolemy, moreover, applies
                    Apollonius’s hypothesis of the epicycle to explain the inequality of the sun’s
                    motion, and shows that it leads to the same results as the hypothesis of the
                    eccentric. He prefers the latter hypothesis as more simple, requiring only one
                    and not two motions, and as equally fit to clear up the difficulties. In the
                    second chapter there are some general remarks to which attention should be
                    directed. We find the principle laid down that for the explanation of phenomena
                    one should adopt the simplest hypothesis that it is possible to establish,
                    provided that it is not contradicted by the observations in any important
                    respect.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi

                    173.</p></note> We find in the same page another principle, or rather practical
                    injunction, that in investigations founded on observations where great delicacy
                    is required we should select those made at considerable intervals of time in
                    order that the errors arising from the imperfection which is inherent in all
                    observations, even in those made with the greatest care, may be lessened by
                    being distributed over a large number of years. In the same chapter we find also
                    the principle laid down that the object of mathematicians ought to be to
                    represent all the celestial phenomena by uniform and circular motions. This
                    principle is stated by Ptolemy in the manner which is unfortunately too common
                    with him,—that is to say, he does not give the least indication whence he
                    derived it. We know,' however, from Simplicius, on the authority of
                    Sosigenes,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>This
                    Sosigenes, as Th. H. Martin has shown, was not the astronomer of that name who

                    determined motions being assumed would fully account for the phenomena of the
                    motions of the planetary bodies ?” We know, too, from the same source that
                    Eudemus says in the second book of his <hi rend="italic">History of
                    Astronomy</hi> that “Eudoxus of Cnidus was the first of the Greeks to take in

                    proposed a geometrical hypothesis for explaining the periodic motions of the
                    planets—the famous system of concentric spheres. It thus appears that the
                    principle laid down here by Ptolemy can be traced to Eudoxus and Plato; and it
                    is probable that they derived it from the same source, namely, Archytas and the
                    Pythagoreans. We have indeed the direct testimony of Geminus of Rhodes that the
                    Pythagoreans endeavoured to explain the phenomena of the heavens by uniform and
                    circular motions.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"

                    the first and principal inequality of the moon, which quite corresponds to the
                    inequality of the sun treated of in the third book. As to the observations which
                    should be employed for the investigation of the motion of the moon, Ptolemy
                    tells us that lunar eclipses should be preferred, inasmuch as they give the
                    moon’s place without any error on the score of parallax. The first thing to be
                    determined is the time of the moon’s revolution; Hipparchus, by comparing the
                    observations of the Chaldaeans with his own, discovered that the shortest period
                    in which the lunar eclipses return in the same order was 126,007 days and 1
                    hour. In this period he finds 4267 lunations, 4573 restitutions of anomaly, and
                    4612 tropical revolutions of the moon less 7⅜ <hi rend="superscript"> o</hi>
                    q.p.; this quantity (7⅜ <hi rend="superscript"> o</hi>) is also wanting to
                    complete the 345 revolutions which the sun makes in the same time with respect
                    to the fixed stars. He concluded from this that the lunar month contains 29 days
                    and 31' 50" 8"' 20"" of a day, very nearly, or 29 days 12 hours 44' 3" 20"'.
                    These results are of the highest importance. (See <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Astronomy. )</hi> In order to explain this inequality, or the equation of the
                    centre, Ptolemy makes use of the hypothesis of an epicycle, which he prefers to
                    that of the eccentric. The fifth book commences with the description of the
                    astrolabe of Hipparchus, which Ptolemy made use of in following up the
                    observations of that astronomer, and by means of which he made his most
                    important discovery, that of the second inequality in the moon’s motion, now
                    known by the name of the “evection.” In order to explain this inequality he
                    supposed the moon to move on an epicycle, which was carried by an eccentric
                    whose centre turned about the earth in a direction contrary to that of the
                    motion of the epicycle. This is the first instance in which we find the two
                    hypotheses of eccentric and epicycle combined. The fifth book treats also of the
                    parallaxes of the sun and moon, and gives a description of an instrument—called
                    later by Theon the “parallactic rods ”—devised by Ptolemy for observing meridian
                    altitudes with greater accuracy.</p>
                <p>The subject of parallaxes is continued in the sixth book of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Almagest,</hi> and the method of calculating eclipses is there given. The
                    author says nothing in it which was not known before his time.</p>
                <p>Books vii., viii. treat of the fixed stars. Ptolemy verified the fixity of their
                    relative positions and confirmed the observations of Hipparchus with regard to
                    their motion in longitude, or the precession of the equinoxes. (See <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Astronomy.)</hi> The seventh book concludes with the catalogue
                    of the stars of the northern hemisphere. in which are entered their loncitudes.
                    latitudes, and magni tudes, arranged according to their constellations; and the
                    eighth book commences with a similar catalogue of the stars in the
                    constellations of the southern hemisphere. This catalogue has been the subject
                    of keen controversy amongst modern astronomers. Some, as Flamsteed and Lalande,
                    maintain that it was the same catalogue which Hipparchus had drawn up 265 years
                    before Ptolemy, whereas others, of whom Laplace is one, think that it is the
                    work of Ptolemy himself. The probability is that in the main the catalogue is
                    really that of Hipparchus altered to suit Ptolemy’s own time, but that in making
                    the changes which were necessary a wrong precession was assumed. This is
                    Delambre’s opinion; he says, “Whoever may have been the true author, the
                    catalogue is unique, and does not suit the age when Ptolemy lived; by
                    subtracting 2° 40' from all the longitudes it would suit the age of Hipparchus;
                    this is all that is certain.”<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    been remarked that Ptolemy, living at Alexandria, at which city the altitude of
                    the pole is 5° less than at Rhodes, where Hipparchus observed, could have seen
                    stars which are not visible at Rhodes; none of these stars, however, are in
                    Ptolemy’s catalogue. The eighth book contains, moreover, a description of the
                    milky way and the manner of constructing a celestial globe; it also treats of
                    the configuration of the stars, first with regard to the sun, moon, and planets,
                    and then with regard to the horizon, and likewise of the different aspects of
                    the stars and of their rising, culmination, and setting simultaneously with the
                    sun.</p>
                <p>The remainder of the work is devoted to the planets. The ninth book commences
                    with tvhat concerns them all in general. The planets are much nearer to the
                    earth than the fixed stars and more distant than the moon. Saturn is the most
                    distant of all, then Jupiter and then Mars. These three planets are at a greater
                    distance from the earth than the sun.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>This is true of their mean distances; but we know that Mars
                    at opposition is nearer to us than the sun.</p></note> So far all astronomers
                    are agreed. This is not the case, he says, with respect to the two remaining
                    planets, Mercury and Venus, which the old astronomers placed between the sun and
                    earth, whereas more recent writers<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>Eratosthenes, for example, as we learn from Theon of
                    Smyrna.</p></note> have placed them beyond the sun, because they were never seen
                    on the sun.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Transits of
                    Mercury and Venus over the sun’s disk, therefore, had not been
                    observed.</p></note> He shows that this reasoning is not sound, for they might
                    be nearer to us than the sun and not in the same plane, and consequently never
                    seen on the sun. He decides in favour of the former opinion, which was indeed
                    that of most mathematicians. The ground of the arrangement of the planets in
                    order of distance was the relative length of their periodic times; the greater
                    the circle, the greater, it was thought, would be the time required for its
                    description. Hence we see the origin of the difficulty and the difference of
                    opinion as to the arrangement of the sun, Mercury, and Venus, since the times in
                    which, as seen from the earth, they appear to complete the circuit of the zodiac
                    are nearly the same— a year.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    to him. From this system to that of Tycho Brahe there is, as Delambre observes,
                    only a single step.</p>
                <p>We have seen that the problem which presented itself to the astronomers of the
                    Alexandrian epoch was the following: it was required to find such a system of
                    equable circular motions as would represent the inequalities in the apparent
                    motions of the sun, the moon, and the planets. Ptolemy now takes up this
                    question for the planets; he says that ‘ ‘ this perfection is of the essence of
                    celestial things, which admit of neither disorder nor inequality,” that this
                    planetary theory is one of extreme difficulty, and that no one had yet
                    completely succeeded in it. He adds that it was owing to these difficulties that
                    Hipparchus—who loved truth above all things, and who, moreover, had not received
                    from his predecessors observations either so numerous or so precise as those
                    that he has left—had succeeded, as far as possible, in representing the motions
                    of the sun and moon by circles, but had not even commenced the theory of the
                    five planets. He was content, Ptolemy <pb break="no"

                    been made on them in a methodic order and to show thence that the phenomena did
                    not agree with the hypotheses of mathematicians at that time. He showed that in
                    fact each planet had two inequalities, which are different for each, that the
                    retrogradations are also different, whilst other astronomers admitted only a
                    single inequality and the same retrogradation; he showed further that their
                    motions cannot be explained by eccentrics nor by epicycles carried along
                    concentrics, but that it was necessary to combine both hypotheses. After these
                    preliminary notions he gives from Hipparchus the periodic motions of the five
                    planets, together with the shortest times of restitutions, in which, moreover,
                    he has made some slight corrections. He then gives tables of the mean motions in
                    longitude and of anomaly of each of the five planets,<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Delambre compares these mean motions with
                    those of our modern tables and finds them tolerably correct. By “motion in
                    longitude” must be understood the motion of the centre of the epicycle about the
                    eccentric, and by “anomaly” the motion of the star on its epicycle.</p></note>
                    and shows how the motions in longitude of the planets can be represented in a
                    general manner by means of the hypothesis of the eccentric combined with that of
                    the epicycle. He next applies his theory to each planet and concludes the ninth
                    book by the explanation of the various phenomena of the planet Mercury. In the
                    tenth and eleventh books he treats, in like manner, of the various phenomena of
                    the planets Venus, Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn.</p>
                <p>Book xii. treats of the stationary and retrograde appearances of each of the
                    planets and of the greatest elongations of Mercury and Venus. The author tells
                    us that some mathematicians, and amongst them Apollonius of Perga, employed the
                    hypothesis of the epicycle to explain the stations and retrogradations of the
                    planets. Ptolemy goes into this theory, but does not change in the least the
                    theorems of Apollonius; he only promises simpler and clearer demonstrations of
                    them. Delambre remarks that those of Apollonius must have been very obscure,
                    since, in order to make the demonstrations in the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Almagest</hi> intelligible, he (Delambre) was obliged to recast them. This
                    statement of Ptolemy is important, as it shows that the mathematical theory of
                    the planetary motions was in a tolerably forward state long before his time.
                    Finally, book xiii. treats of the motions of the planets in latitude, also of
                    the inclinations of their orbits and of the magnitude of these inclinations.</p>

                <p>Ptolemy concludes his great work by saying that he has included in it everything
                    of practical utility which in his judgment should find a place in a treatise on
                    astronomy at the time it was written, with relation as well to discoveries as to
                    methods. His work was justly called by him <hi rend="italic">Μαθηματική
                    Σύνταξις,</hi> for it was in fact the mathematical form of the work which caused
                    it to be preferred to all others which treated of the same science, but not by
                    “the sure methods of geometry and calculation.” Accordingly, it soon spread from
                    Alexandria to all places where astronomy was cultivated; numerous copies were
                    made of it, and it became the object of serious study on the part of both
                    teachers and pupils. Amongst its numerous commentators may be mentioned Pappus
                    and Theon of Alexandria in the 4th century and Proclus in the 5th. It was
                    translated into Latin by Boetius, but this translation has not come down to us.
                    The <hi rend="italic">Syntaxis</hi> was translated into Arabic at Baghdad by
                    order of the enlightened caliph Al-Mamùn, who was himself an astronomer, about
                    827 A.D., and the Arabic translation was revised in the following century by
                    Thàbit ibn Korra. The emperor Frederick II. caused the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Almagest</hi> to be translated from the Arabic into Latin at Naples about 1230.
                    In the 15th century it was translated from a Greek manuscript in the Vatican by
                    George of Trebizond. In the same century an epitome of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Almagest</hi> was commenced by Purbach (died 1461) and completed by his pupil
                    and successor in the professorship of astronomy in the university of Vienna,
                    Regiomontanus. The earliest edition of this epitome is that of Venice, 1496, and
                    this was the first appearance of the <hi rend="italic">Almagest</hi> in print.
                    The first complete edition of the <hi rend="italic">Almagest</hi> is that of P.
                    Liechtenstein (Venice, 1515),—a Latin version from the Arabic. The Latin
                    translation of George of Trebizond was first printed in 1528, at Venice. The
                    Greek text, which was not known in Europe until the 15th century, was first
                    published in the 16th by Simon Grynaeus, who was also the first editor of the
                    Greek text of Euclid, at Basel, 1538. This edition was from a manuscript in the
                    library of Nuremberg—where it is no longer to be found—which had been presented
                    by Regiomontanus, to whom it was given by Cardinal Bessarion. The last edition
                    of the <hi rend="italic">Almagest</hi> is that of Halma, Greek with French
                    translation, in two vols., Paris, 1813-16. On the manuscripts of the <hi

                    >Optics</hi> consists of five books, of which the fifth presents most interest:
                    it treats of the refraction of luminous rays in their passage through media of
                    different densities, and also of astronomical refractions, on which subject the
                    theory is more complete than that of any astronomer before the time of Cassini.

                    allusion to the <hi rend="italic">Almagest</hi> or to the subject of refraction
                    in the <hi rend="italic">Almagest</hi> itself; but his chief reason for doubting
                    its authenticity is that the author of the <hi rend="italic">Optics</hi> was a
                    poor geometer. (G. J. A.)</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Geography.</hi></p>
                <p>Ptolemy is hardly less celebrated as a geographer than as an astronomer, and his
                    great work on geography exercised as great an influence on the progress of that
                    science as did his <hi rend="italic">Almagest</hi> on that of astronomy. It
                    became indeed the paramount authority on all geographical questions for a period
                    of many centuries, and was only gradually superseded by the progress of maritime
                    discovery in the 15th and 16th centuries. This exceptional position was due in a
                    great measure to its scientific form, which rendered it very convenient and easy
                    of reference; but, apart from this consideration, it was really the first
                    attempt ever made to place the study of geography on a truly scientific basis.
                    The great astronomer Hipparchus had indeed pointed out, thrçe centuries before
                    the time of Ptolemy, that the only way to construct a really trustworthy map of
                    the Inhabited World would be by observations of the latitude and longitude of
                    all the principal points on its surface, and laying down a map in accordance
                    with the positions thus determined. But the materials for such a course of
                    proceeding were almost wholly wanting, and, though Hipparchus made some approach
                    to a correct division of the known world into zones of latitude, or “climata,”
                    as he termed them, trustworthy observations even of this character were in his
                    time very few in number, while the means of determining longitudes could hardly
                    be said to exist. Hence probably it arose that no attempt was made by succeeding
                    geographers to follow up the important suggestion of Hipparchus. Marinus of
                    Tyre, who lived shortly before the time of Ptolemy, and whose work is known to
                    us only through that writer, appears to have been the first to resume the
                    problem thus proposed, and lay down the map of the known world in accordance
                    with the precepts of Hipparchus. His materials for the execution of such a
                    design were indeed miserably inadequate, and he was forced to content himself
                    for the most part with determinations derived not from astronomical observations
                    but from the calculation of distances from itineraries and other rough methods,
                    such as still continue to be employed even by modern geographers where more
                    accurate <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit20newyrich/page/n105/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0920-0105-0092"/> means of determination are not available. The
                    greater part of the treatise of Marinus was occupied with the discussion of
                    these authorities, and it is impossible for us, in the absence of the original
                    work, to determine how far he had succeeded in giving a scientific form to the
                    results of his labours; but we are told by Ptolemy himself that he considered
                    them, on the whole, so satisfactory that he had made the work of his predecessor
                    the basis of his own in regard to all the countries bordering on the
                    Mediterranean, a term which would comprise to the ancient geographer almost all
                    those regions of which he had really any definite knowledge. With respect to the
                    more remote regions of the world, Ptolemy availed himself of the information
                    imparted by Marinus, but not without reserve, and has himself explained to us
                    the reasons that induced him in some instances to depart from the conclusions of
                    his predecessor. It is very unjust to term Ptolemy a plagiarist from Marinus, as
                    has been done by some modern authors, as he himself acknowledges in the fullest
                    manner his obligations to that writer, from whom he derived the whole mass of
                    his materials, which he undertook to arrange and present to his readers in a
                    scientific form. It is this form and arrangement that constitute the great merit
                    of Ptolemy’s work and that have stamped it with a character wholly distinct from
                    all previous treatises on geography. But at the same time it possesses much
                    interest, as showing the greatly increased knowledge of the more remote portions
                    of Asia and Africa which had been acquired by geographers since the time of
                    Strabo and Pliny.</p>
                <p>It will be convenient to consider separately the two different branches of the
                    subject,—(1) the mathematical portion, which constitutes his geographical
                    system, properly so termed; and (2) his contributions to the progress of
                    positive knowledge with respect to the Inhabited World.</p>
                <p>1. <hi rend="italic">Mathematical Geography.—</hi> As a great astronomer, Ptolemy
                    was of course infinitely better qualified to comprehend and explain the
                    mathematical conditions of the earth and its relations to the celestial bodies
                    that surround it than any preceding writers on the special subject of geography.
                    But his general views, except on a few points, did not "differ from those of his
                    most eminent precursors Eratosthenes and Strabo. In common with them, he assumed
                    that the earth was a globe, the surface of which was divided by certain great
                    circles—the equator and the tropics— parallel to one another, and dividing the
                    earth into five great zones, the relations of which with astronomical phenomena
                    were of course clear to his mind as a matter of theory, though in regard to the
                    regions bordering on the equator, as well as to those adjoining the polar
                    circle, he could have had no confirmation of his conclusions from actual
                    observation. He adopted also from Hipparchus the division of the equator and
                    other great circles into 360 parts or “degrees” (as they were subsequently
                    called, though the word does not occur in this sense in Ptolemy), and supposed
                    other circles to be drawn through these, from the equator to the pole, to which
                    he gave the name of “meridians.” He thus conceived the whole surface of the
                    earth (as is done by modern geographers) to be covered with a complete network
                    of “parallels of latitude” and “meridians of longitude,” terms which he himself
                    was the first extant writer to employ in this technical sense. Within the
                    network thus constructed it was the task of the scientific geographer to place
                    the outline of the world, so far as it was then known by experience and
                    observation.</p>
                <p>Unfortunately at the very outset of his attempt to realize this conception he
                    fell into an error which had the effect of vitiating all his subsequent
                    conclusions. Eratosthenes was the first writer who had attempted in a scientific
                    manner to determine the circumference of the earth, and the result at which he
                    arrived, that it amounted to 250,000 stadia or 25,000 geographical miles, was
                    generally adopted by subsequent geographers, including Strabo. Posidonius,
                    however, who wrote about a century after Eratosthenes, had made an independent
                    calculation, by which he reduced the circumference of the globe to 180,000
                    stadia, or less than three-fourths of the result obtained by Eratosthenes, and
                    this computation, on what grounds we know not, was unfortunately adopted by
                    Marinus Tyrius, and from him by Ptolemy. The consequence of this error was of
                    course to make every degree of latitude or longitude (measured at the equator)
                    equal to only 500 stadia (50 geographical miles), instead of its true equivalent
                    of 600 stadia. Its effects would indeed have been in some measure neutralized
                    had there existed a sufficient number of points of which the position was
                    determined by actual observation; but we learn from Ptolemy himself that this
                    was not the case, and that such observations for latitude were very few in
                    number, while the means of determining longitudes were almost wholly
                    wanting.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Hipparchus had
                    indeed pointed out long before the mode of determining longitudes by
                    observations of eclipses, but the instance to which he referred of the
                    celebrated eclipse before the battle of Arbela, which was seen also at Carthage,
                    was a mere matter of popular observation, of no scientific value. Yet Ptolemy
                    seems to have known of no other.</p></note> Hence the positions laid down by him
                    were really, with very few exceptions, the result of computations of distances
                    from itineraries and the statements of travellers, estimates which were liable
                    to much greater error in ancient times than at the present day, from the want of
                    any accurate mode of observing bearings, or portable instruments for the
                    measurement of time, while they had no means at all of determining distances at
                    sea, except by the rough estimate of the time employed in sailing from point to
                    point. The use of the log, simple as it appears to us, was unknown to the
                    ancients. But, great as would naturally be the errors resulting from such
                    imperfect means of calculation, they were in most cases increased by the
                    permanent error arising from the erroneous system of graduation adopted by
                    Ptolemy in laying them down upon his map. Thus, if he had arrived at the
                    conclusion from itineraries that two places were 5000 stadia from one another,
                    he would place them at a distance of 10° apart, and thus in fact separate them
                    by an interval of 6000 stadia.</p>
                <p>Another source of permanent error (though one of much less importance) which
                    affected all his longitudes arose from the erroneous assumption of his prime
                    meridian. In this respect also he followed Marinus, who, having arrived at the
                    conclusion that the Fortunate Islands (the Canaries) were situated farther west
                    than any part of the continent of Europe, had taken the meridian through the
                    outermost of this group as his prime meridian, from whence he calculated all his
                    longitudes eastwards to the Indian Ocean. But, as both Marinus and Ptolemy were
                    very imperfectly acquainted with the position and arrangements of the islands in
                    question, the line thus assumed was in reality a purely imaginary one, being
                    drawn through the <hi rend="italic">supposed</hi> position of the outer island,
                    which they placed 2⅜ <hi rend="superscript"> o</hi> west of the Sacred
                    Promontory (Cape St Vincent), which was regarded by Marinus and Ptolemy, as it
                    had been by all previous geographers, as the westernmost point of the continent
                    of Europe,—while the real difference between the two is not less than 9° 20.
                    Hence <hi rend="italic">all</hi> Ptolemy’s longitudes, reckoned eastwards from
                    this assumed line, were in fact about 7° less than they would have been if
                    really measured from the meridian of Ferro, which continued so long in use among
                    geographers in modern times. The error in this instance was the more unfortunate
                    as the longitude could not of course be really measured, or even calculated,
                    from this imaginary line, but was in reality calculated in both directions from
                    Alexandria, westwards as well as eastwards (as Ptolemy himself has done in his
                    eighth book) and afterwards <hi rend="italic">reversed,</hi> so as to suit the
                    supposed method of computation.</p>
                <p>It must be observed also that the equator was in like manner placed by Ptolemy at
                    a considerable distance from its true <hi rend="italic">geographical</hi>
                    position. The place of the equinoctial line on the surface of the globe was of
                    course well known to him as a matter of theory, but as no observations could
                    have been made in those remote regions he could only calculate its place from
                    that of the tropic, which he supposed to pass through Syene. And as he here, as
                    elsewhere, reckoned a degree of latitude as equivalent to 500 stadia, he
                    inevitably made the interval between the tropic and the equator too small by
                    one-sixth; and the place of the former on the surface of the earth being fixed
                    by observation he necessarily carried up the supposed place of the equator too
                    high by more than 230 geographical miles. But as he had practically no <hi
                    rend="italic">geographical</hi> acquaintance with the equinoctial regions of the
                    earth this error was of little importance.</p>
                <p>With Marinus and Ptolemy, as with all preceding Greek geographers, the most
                    important line on the surface of the globe for all practical purposes was the
                    parallel of 36° of latitude, which passes through the Straits of Gibraltar at
                    one end of the Mediterranean, and through the Island of Rhodes and the Gulf of
                    Issus at the other. It was thus regarded by Dicaearchus and almost all his
                    successors as dividing the regions around the inland sea into two portions, and
                    as being continued in theory along the chain of Mount Taurus till it joined the
                    great mountain range north of India; and from thence to the Eastern Ocean it was
                    regarded as constituting the dividing line of the Inhabited World, along which
                    its length must be measured. But it sufficiently shows how inaccurate were the
                    observations and how imperfect the materials at his command, even in regard to
                    the best known portions of the earth, that Ptolemy, following Marinus, describes
                    this parallel as passing through Caralis in Sardinia and Lilybaeum in Sicily,
                    the one being really in 39* 12' lat., the other in 37° 50'. It is still more
                    strange that he places so important and well known a city as Carthage 1° 20' <hi
                    rend="italic">south</hi> of the dividing parallel, while it really lies nearly
                    1° to the <hi rend="italic">north</hi> of it.</p>

                <p>The great problem that had attracted the attention and exercised the ingenuity of
                    all geographers from the time of Dicaearchus to that of Ptolemy was to determine
                    the length and breadth of the Inhabited World, which they justly regarded as the
                    chief subject of the geographer’s consideration. This question had been very
                    fully discussed by Marinus, who had arrived at conclusions widely different from
                    those of his predecessors. Towards the north indeed there was no great
                    difference of opinion, the latitude of Thule being generally recognized as that
                    of the highest northern land, and this was placed both by Marinus and Ptolemy in
                    63° lat., not very far beyond the true position of the Shetland Islands, which
                    had come in their time to be generally identified with the mysterious Thule of
                    Pytheas. The western extremity, as already mentioned, had been in like manner
                    determined by the prime meridian drawn through the <hi rend="italic"
                    >supposed</hi> position of the Fortunate Islands. But towards the south and east
                    Marinus gave an enormous extension to the continents of Africa and Asia, beyond
                    what had been known to or suspected by the earlier geographers, and, though
                    Ptolemy greatly reduced his calculations, he still retained a very exaggerated
                    estimate of their results.</p>
                <p>The additions thus made to the estimated dimensions of the known world were
                    indeed in both directions based upon a real extension of knowledge, derived from
                    recent information; but unfortunately the original statements were so perverted
                    by misinterpretation in applying them to the construction of a map as to give
                    results differing widely from the truth. The southern limit of the world as
                    known to Eratosthenes, and even to Strabo (who had in this respect no further
                    knowledge than his predecessor more than two centuries before), had been fixed
                    by them at the parallel which passed through the eastern extremity of Africa
                    (Cape Guardafui), or the Land of Cinnamon as they termed it, and that of the
                    Sembritae (corresponding to Sennaar) in the interior of the same continent. This
                    parallel, which would correspond nearly to that of 10° of <hi rend="italic"
                    >true</hi> latitude, they supposed to be situated at a distance of 3400 stadia
                    (340 geographical miles) from that of Meroe (the position of which was
                    accurately known), and 13,400 to the south of Alexandria; while they conceived
                    it as passing, when prolonged to the eastward, through the island of Taprobane
                    (Ceylon), which was universally recognized as the southernmost land of Asia.
                    Both these geographers were wholly ignorant of the vast extension of Africa to
                    the south of this line and even of the equator, and conceived it as trending
                    away to the west from the Land of Cinnamon and then to the north-west to the
                    Straits of Gibraltar. Marinus had, however, learned from itineraries both by
                    land and sea the fact of this great extension, of which he had indeed conceived
                    so exaggerated an idea that even after Ptolemy had reduced it by more than a
                    half it was still materially in excess of the truth. The eastern coast of Africa
                    was indeed tolerably well known, being frequented by Greek and Roman traders, as
                    far as a place called Rhapta, opposite to Zanzibar, and this is placed by
                    Ptolemy not far from its true position in 7° S. lat. But he added to this a bay
                    of great extent as far as a promontory called Prasum (perhaps Cape Delgado),
                    which he placed in 15⅛° S. lat. At the same time he assumed the position in
                    about the same parallel of a region called Agisymba, which was supposed to have
                    been discovered by a Roman general, whose itinerary was employed by Marinus.
                    Taking, therefore, this parallel as the limit of knowledge to the south, while
                    he retained that of Thule to the north, he assigned to the inhabited world a
                    breadth of nearly 80°, instead of less than 60°, which it had occupied on the
                    maps of Eratosthenes and Strabo.</p>
                <p>It had been a fixed belief with all the Greek geographers from the earliest
                    attempts at scientific geography not only that the length of the Inhabited World
                    greatly exceeded its breadth, but that it was more than twice as great,—a wholly
                    unfounded assumption, bιlt to which their successors seem to have felt
                    themselves bound to conform. Thus Marinus, while giving an undue extension to
                    Africa towards the south, fell into a similar error, but to a far greater
                    degree, in regard to the extension of Asia towards the east. Here also he really
                    possessed a great advance in knowledge over all his predecessors, the increased
                    trade with China for silk having led to an acquaintance, though of course of a
                    very vague and general kind, with the vast regions in Central Asia that lay to
                    the east of the Pamir range, which had formed the limit of the Asiatic nations
                    previously known to the Greeks. But Marinus had learned that traders proceeding
                    eastward from the Stone Tower—a station at the foot of this range—to Sera, the
                    capital city of the Seres, occupied seven months on the journey, and from thence
                    he arrived at the enormous result that the distance between the two points was
                    not less than 36,200 stadia, or 3620 geographical miles. Ptolemy, while he
                    justly points out the absurdity of this conclusion and the erroneous mode of
                    computation on which it was founded, had no means of correcting it by any real
                    authority, and hence reduced it summarily by one half. The effect of this was to
                    place Sera, the easternmost point on his map of Asia, at a distance of 45∣° from
                    the Stone Tower, which again he fixed, on the authority of itineraries cited by
                    Marinus, at 24,000 stadia or 60° of longitude from the Euphrates, reckoning in
                    both cases a degree of longitude as equivalent to 400 stadia, in accordance with
                    his uniform system of allowing 500 stadia to 1° of latitude. Both distances were
                    greatly in excess of the truth, independently of the error arising from this
                    mistaken system of graduation. The distances west of the Euphrates were of
                    course <hi rend="italic">comparatively</hi> well known, nor did Ptolemy’s
                    calculation of the length of the Mediterranean differ very materially from those
                    of previous Greek geographers, though still greatly exceeding the truth, after
                    allowing for the permanent error of graduation. The effect of this last cause,
                    it must be remembered, would unfortunately be cumulative, in consequence of the
                    longitudes being computed from a fixed point in the west, instead of being
                    reckoned east and west from Alexandria, which was undoubtedly the mode in which
                    they were really calculated. The result of these combined causes of error was to
                    lead him to assign no less than 180°, or 12 hours, of longitude to the interval
                    between the meridian of the Fortunate Islands and that of Sera, which really
                    amounts to about 130°.</p>
                <p>But in thus estimating the length and breadth of the known world Ptolemy attached
                    a very different sense to these terms from that which they had generally borne
                    with preceding writers. All former Greek geographers, with the single exception
                    of Hipparchus, had agreed in supposing the Inhabited World to be surrounded on
                    all sides by sea, and to form in fact a vast island in the midst of a
                    circumfluous ocean. This notion, which was probably derived originally from the
                    Homeric fiction of an ocean stream, and was certainly not based upon direct
                    observation, was nevertheless of course in accordance with the truth, great as
                    was the misconception it involved of the extent and magnitude of the continents
                    included within this assumed boundary. Hence it was unfortunate that Ptolemy
                    should in this respect have gone back to the views of Hipparchus, and have
                    assumed that the land extended indefinitely to the north in the case of Europe
                    and Scythia, to the east in that of Asia, and to the south in that of Africa.
                    His boundary-line was in each of these cases an arbitrary limit, beyond which
                    lay the Unknown Land, as he calls it. But in the last case he was not content
                    with giving to Africa an indefinite extension to the south: he assumed the
                    existence of a vast prolongation of the land to the east from its southernmost
                    known point, so as to form a connexion with the south-eastern extremity of Asia,
                    of the extent and position of which he had a wholly erroneous idea.</p>
                <p>In this last case Marinus had derived from the voyages of recent navigators in
                    the Indian Seas a knowledge of the fact that there lay in that direction
                    extensive lands which had been totally unknown to previous geographers, and
                    Ptolemy had acquired still more extensive information in this quarter. But
                    unfortunately he had formed a totally false conception of the bearings of the
                    coasts thus made known, and consequently of the position of the lands to which
                    they belonged, and, instead of carrying the line of coast northwards from the
                    Golden Chersonese (the Malay Peninsula) to China or the land of the Sinae, he
                    brought it down again towards the south after forming a great bay, so that he
                    placed Cattigara— the principal emporium in this part of Asia, and the farthest
                    point known to him—on a supposed line of coast, of unknown extent, but with a
                    direction from north to south. The hypothesis that this land was continuous with
                    the most southern part of Africa, so that the two enclosed one vast gulf, though
                    a mere assumption, is stated by him as definitely as if it was based upon
                    positive information; and it was long received by mediaeval geographers as an
                    unquestioned fact. This circumstance undoubtedly contributed to perpetuate the
                    error of supposing that Africa could not be circumnavigated, in opposition to
                    the more correct views of Strabo and other earlier geographers. On the other
                    hand, there can be no doubt that the undue extension of Asia towards the east,
                    so as to diminish by 50° of longitude the interval between that continent and
                    the western coasts of Europe, had a material influence in fostering the belief
                    of Columbus and others that it was possible to reach the Land of Spices (as the
                    East Indian islands were then called) by direct navigation towards the west.</p>
                <p>It is not surprising that Ptolemy should have fallen into considerable errors
                    respecting the more distant quarters of the world; but even in regard to the
                    Mediterranean and its dependencies, as well as the regions that surrounded them,
                    with which he was in a certain sense well acquainted, the imperfection of his
                    geographical knowledge is strikingly apparent. Here he had indeed some
                    well-established data for his guidance, as far as latitudes were concerned. That
                    of Massilia had been determined many years before by Pytheas within a few miles
                    of its true position, and the latitude of Rome, as might be expected, was known
                    with approximate accuracy. Those of Alexandria and Rhodes also were well known,
                    having been the place of observation of distinguished astronomers, and the
                    fortunate accident that the Island of Rhodes lay on the same parallel of
                    latitude with the Straits of Gibraltar at the other end of the sea enabled him
                    to connect the two by drawing the parallel direct from the one to the other. The
                    importance attached to this line (36° N. lat.) by all preceding geographers has
                    been already mentioned. Unfortunately Ptolemy, like his predecessors, supposed
                    its course to lie almost uniformly through the open sea, wholly ignoring the
                    great projection of the African coast towards <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit20newyrich/page/n107/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0920-0107-0094"/> the north from Carthage to the neighbourhood of
                    the straits. The erroneous position assigned to the former city has been already
                    adverted to, and, being supposed to rest upon astronomical observation,
                    doubtless determined that of all the north coast of Africa. The result was that
                    he assigned to the width of the Mediterranean from Massilia to the opposite
                    point of the African coast an extent of more than 1Γ of latitude, while it does
                    not really exceed 6⅛ <hi rend="superscript"> o</hi>.</p>
                <p>At the same time he was still more at a loss in respect of longitudes, for which
                    he had absolutely no trustworthy observations to guide him; but he nevertheless
                    managed to arrive at a result considerably nearer the truth than had been
                    attained by previous geographers, all of whom had greatly exaggerated the length
                    of the Inland Sea. Their calculations, like those of Marinus and Ptolemy, could
                    only be founded on the imperfect estimates of mariners; but unfortunately
                    Ptolemy, in translating the conclusions thus arrived at into a scientific form,
                    vitiated all his results by his erroneous system of graduation, and, while the
                    calculation of Marinus gave a distance of 24,800 stadia as the length of the
                    Mediterranean from the straits to the Gulf of Issus, this was converted by
                    Ptolemy in preparing his tables to an interval of 62°, or just about 20° beyond
                    the truth. Even after correcting the error due to his erroneous computation of
                    500 stadia to a degree, there remains an excess of nearly 500 geographical
                    miles, which was doubtless owing to the exaggerated estimates of distances
                    almost always made by navigators who had no real means of measuring them.</p>
                <p>Another unfortunate error which disfigured the eastern portion of his map of the
                    Mediterranean was the position assigned to Byzantium, which Ptolemy (misled in
                    this instance by the authority of Hipparchus) placed in the same latitude with
                    Massilia (43° 5'), thus carrying it up more than 2° above its true position.
                    This had the inevitable effect of transferring the whole of the Euxine Sea— with
                    the general form and dimensions of which he was fairly well acquainted—too far
                    to the north by the same amount; but in addition to this he enormously
                    exaggerated the extent of the Palus Maeotis (the Sea of Azoff), which he at the
                    same time represented as having its direction from south to north, so that by
                    the combined effect of these two errors he carried up its northern extremity
                    (with the mouth of the Tanais and the city of that name) as high as 54° 30', or
                    on the true parallel of the south shore of the Baltic. Yet, while he fell into
                    this strange misconception with regard to the great river which was universally
                    considered by the ancients as the boundary between Europe and Asia, he was the
                    first writer of antiquity who showed a clear conception of the true relations
                    between the Tanais and the Rha or Volga, which he correctly described as flowing
                    into the Caspian Sea. With respect to this last also he was the first geographer
                    after the time of Alexander to return to the correct view (already found in
                    Herodotus) that it was an inland sea, without any communication with the
                    Northern Ocean.</p>
                <p>With regard to the north of Europe his views were still very vague and imperfect.
                    He had indeed considerably more acquaintance with the British Islands than any
                    previous geographer, and even showed a tolerably accurate knowledge of some
                    portions of their shores. But his map was, in this instance, disfigured by two
                    unfortunate errors,—the one, that he placed Ireland (which he calls Ivernia)
                    altogether too far to the north, so that its southernmost portion was brought
                    actually to a latitude beyond that of North Wales; the other, which was probably
                    connected with it, that the whole of Scotland is <hi rend="italic">twisted
                    round,</hi> so as to bring its general extension into a direction from west to
                    east, instead of from south to north, and place the northern extremity of the
                    island on the same parallel with the promontory of Galloway. He appears to have
                    been embarrassed in this part of his map by his having adopted the conclusion of
                    Marinus—based upon what arguments we know not—that Thule was situated in 63°,
                    while at the same time he regarded it, in conformity with the received view of
                    all earlier geographers, as the most northern of all known lands. In accordance
                    with this same assumption Ptolemy supposed the northern coast of Germany, which
                    he believed to be the southern shore of the Great Ocean, to have a general
                    direction from west to east, while he placed it not very far from the true
                    position of that of the Baltic, of the existence of which as an inland sea he
                    was wholly ignorant, as well as of the vast peninsula of Scandinavia beyond it,
                    and only inserted the name of Scandia as that of an island of inconsiderable
                    dimensions. At the same time he supposed the coast of Sarmatia from the Vistula
                    eastwards to trend away to the north as far as the parallel of Thule; nor did he
                    conceive this as an actual limit, but believed the Unknown Land to extend
                    indefinitely in this direction, as also to the north of Asiatic Scythia.</p>
                <p>The enormous extent assigned by him to the latter region has been already
                    adverted to; but vague and erroneous as were his views concerning it, it is
                    certain that they show a much greater approximation to the truth than those of
                    earlier geographers, who possessed hardly a suspicion of the vast tracts in
                    question, which stretch across Central Asia from the borders of Sarmatia to
                    those of China. Ptolemy was also the first who had anything like a clear idea of
                    the chain to which he gave the name of Im aus, and correctly regarded as having
                    a direction across Scythia from south to north, so as to divide that great
                    region into two distinct portions which he termed Scythia intra Imaum and
                    Scythia extra lmaum, corresponding in some degree with those recognized in
                    modern maps as Independent and Chinese Tartary. The Imaus of Ptolemy corresponds
                    clearly to the range known in modern days as the Bolor or Pamir, which has only
                    been fully explored in quite recent times. It was, however, enormously
                    misplaced, being transferred to 140’ E. long., or 80° east of Alexandria, the
                    real interval between the two being little more than 40°.</p>
                <p>It is in respect of the southern shores of Asia that Ptolemy’s geography is
                    especially faulty, and his errors are here the more unfortunate as they were
                    associated with greatly increased knowledge in a general way of the regions in
                    question. For more than a century before his time, indeed, the commercial
                    relations between Alexandria, as the great emporium of the Roman empire, and
                    India had assumed a far more important character than at any former period, and
                    the natural consequence was a greatly increased geographical knowledge of the
                    Indian peninsula. The little tract called the <hi rend="italic">Periplus</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">of the Erythraean Sea,</hi> about 80 A. n., contains sailing
                    directions for merchants to the western ports of that country, from the mouth of
                    the Indus to the coast of Malabar, and correctly indicates that the coast from
                    Barygaza southwards had a general direction from north to south as far as the
                    extremity of the peninsula (Cape Comorin). We are utterly ignorant of the
                    reasons which induced Marinus, followed in this instance as in so many others by
                    Ptolemy, to depart from this correct view, and, while giving to the coast of
                    India, from the mouths of the Indus to those of the Ganges, an undue extension
                    in longitude, to curtail its extension towards the south to such an amount as to
                    place Cape Cory (the southernmost point of the peninsula) only 4° of latitude
                    south of Barygaza, the real intervals being more than 800 geographical miles,
                    or, according to Ptolemy’s system of graduation, 16° of latitude! This enormous
                    error, which has the effect of distorting the whole appearance of the south
                    coast of Asia, is associated with another equally extraordinary, but of an
                    opposite tendency, in regard to the neighbouring island of Taprobane or Ceylon,
                    the dimensions of which had been exaggerated by most of the earlier Greek
                    geographers; but to such an extent was this carried by Ptolemy as to extend it
                    through not less than 15° of latitude and 12° of longitude, so as to make it
                    about fourteen times as large as the reality, and bring down its southern
                    extremity more than 2° to the south of the equator.</p>
                <p>We have much less reason to be surprised at finding similar distortions in
                    respect to the regions beyond the Ganges, concerning which he is our only
                    ancient authority. During the interval which elapsed between the date of the <hi
                    rend="italic">Periplus</hi> and that of Marinus it is certain that some
                    adventurous Greek mariners had not only crossed the great Gangetic Gulf and
                    visited the land on the opposite side, to which they gave the name of the Golden
                    Chersonese, but they had pushed their explorations considerably farther to the
                    east, as far as Cattigara. It was not to be expected that these commercial
                    ventures should have brought back any accurate geographical information, and
                    accordingly we find the conception entertained by Ptolemy of these newly
                    discovered regions to be very different from the reality. Not only had the
                    distances, as was usually the case with ancient navigator’s in remote quarters,
                    been greatly exaggerated, but the want of accurate observations of bearings was
                    peculiarly unfortunate in a case where the real features of the coast and the
                    adjoining islands were so intricate and exceptional. A glance at the map
                    appended to the article <hi rend="smallcaps">Map</hi> (vol. xv. Plate VII.) will
                    at once show the entire discrepancy between the configuration of this part of
                    Asia as conceived by Ptolemy and its true formation. Yet with the materials at
                    his command we can hardly wonder at his not having arrived at a nearer
                    approximation to the truth. The most unfortunate error was his idea that after
                    passing the Great Gulf, which lay beyond the Golden Chersonese, the coast
                    trended away to the south, instead of towards the north, and he thus placed
                    Cattigara (which was probably one of the ports in the south of China) not less
                    than 8⅜ <hi rend="superscript"> o</hi> south of the equator. It is probable that
                    in this instance he was misled by his own theoretical conclusions, and carried
                    this remotest part of the Asiatic continent so far to the south with the view of
                    connecting it with his assumed eastward prolongation of that of Africa.</p>
                <p>Notwithstanding this last theoretical assumption Ptolemy’s map of Africa presents
                    a marked improvement upon those of Eratosthenes and Strabo. But his knowledge of
                    the west coast, which he conceived as having its direction nearly on a
                    meridional line from north to south, was very imperfect, and his latitudes
                    utterly erroneous. Even in regard to the Fortunate Islands, the position of
                    which was so important to his system in connexion with his prime meridian, he
                    was entirely misinformed as to their character and arrangement, and extended the
                    group through a space of more than 5° of latitude, so as to bring down the most
                    southerly of them to the real parallel of the Cape de Verd Islands.</p>
                <p>In regard to the mathematical construction, or, to use the modern phrase, the
                    projection of his maps, not only was Ptolemy <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit20newyrich/page/n108/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0920-0108-0095"/> greatly in advance of all his predecessors, but
                    his theoretical skill was altogether beyond the nature of the materials to which
                    he applied it. The methods by which he obviated the difficulty of transferring
                    the delineation of different countries from the spherical surface of the globe
                    to the plane surface of an ordinary map differed indeed but little from those in
                    use at the present day, and the errors arising from this cause (apart from those
                    produced by his fundamental error of graduation) were really of little
                    consequence compared with the defective character of his information and the
                    want of anything approaching to a survey of the countries delineated. He himself
                    was well aware of his deficiencies in this respect, and, while giving full
                    directions for the scientific construction of a general map, he contents himself
                    for the special maps of different countries with the simple method employed by
                    Marinus of drawing the parallels of latitude and meridians of longitude as
                    straight lines, assuming in each case the.proportion between the two, as it
                    really stood with respect to some one parallel towards the middle of the map,
                    and neglecting the inclination of the meridians to one another. Such a course,
                    as he himself repeatedly affirms, will not make any material difference within
                    the limits of each special map.</p>
                <p>Ptolemy’s geographical work was devoted almost exclusively to the mathematical
                    branch of his subject, and its peculiar arrangement, in which his results are
                    presented in a tabular form, instead of being at once embodied in a map, was
                    undoubtedly designed to enable the geographical student to construct his maps
                    for himself, instead of depending upon those constructed ready to his hand.
                    Tiιis purpose it has abundantly served, and there is little doubt that we owe to
                    the peculiar form thus given to his results their transmission in a
                    comparatively perfect condition to the present day. Unfortunately the specious
                    appearance of the results thus presented to us has led to a very erroneous
                    estimate of their accuracy, and it has been too often supposed that what was
                    stated in so scientific a form must necessarily be based upon scientific
                    observations. Though Ptolemy himself has distinctly pointed out in his first
                    book the defective nature of his materials and the true character of the data
                    furnished by his tables, few readers studied this portion of his work, and his
                    statements were generally received with the same undoubting faith as was justly
                    attached to his astronomical observations. It is only in quite recent times that
                    his conclusions have been estimated at their just value, and the apparently
                    scientific character of his work shown to be in most cases a specious edifice
                    resting upon no adequate foundations.</p>
                <p>There can be no doubt that the work of Ptolemy was from the time of its first
                    publication accompanied with maps, which are regularly referred to in the eighth
                    book. But how far those which are now extant represent the original series is a
                    disputed point. In two of the most ancient MSS. it is expressly stated that the
                    maps which accompany them are the work of one Agathodaemon of Alexandria, who
                    “drew them according to the eight books of Claudius Ptolemy.” This expression
                    might equally apply to the work of a contemporary draughtsman under the eyes of
                    Ptolemy himself, or to that of a skilful geographer at a later period, and
                    nothing is known from any other source concerning this Agathodaemon. The attempt
                    to identify him with a grammarian of the same name who lived in the 5th century
                    is wholly without foundation. But it appears, on the whole, most probable that
                    the maps appended to the MSS. still extant have been transmitted by
                    uninterrupted tradition from the time of Ptolemy.</p>
                <p>2. <hi rend="italic">Progress of Geographical Knowledge.—</hi> The above
                    examination of the methods pursued by Ptolemy in framing his general map of the
                    world, or according to the phrase universally employed by the ancients, the
                    Inhabited World (ή <hi rend="italic">οικουμένη),</hi> has already drawn
                    attention to the principal extensions of geographical knowledge since.the time
                    of Strabo.</p>
                <p>While anything like an accurate acquaintance was still confined to the limits of
                    the Roman empire and the regions that immediately adjoined it, with the addition
                    of the portions of Asia that had been long known to the Greeks, the geographical
                    horizon had been greatly widened towards the east by commercial enterprise, and
                    towards the south by the same cause, combined with expeditions of a military
                    character, but which would appear to have been dictated by a spirit of
                    discovery. Two expeditions of this kind had been carried out by Roman generals
                    before the time of Marinus, which, starting from Fezzan, had penetrated the
                    heart of the African continent due south as far as a tract called Agisymba,
                    “which was inhabited by Ethiopians and swarmed with rhinoceroses.” These
                    statements point clearly to the expeditions having traversed the great desert
                    and arrived at the Soudan or Negroland. But the actual position of Agisymba
                    cannot be determined except by mere conjecture. The absurdly exaggerated view
                    taken by Marinus has been already noticed; but, even after his estimate had been
                    reduced by Ptolemy by more than one-half, the position assigned by that author
                    to Agisymba was doubtless far in excess towards the south. But, while this name
                    was the only result that we know to have been derived from these memorable
                    expeditions, Ptolemy found himself in possession of a considerable amount of
                    information concerning the interior of northern Africa (from whence derived we
                    know not), to which nothing similar is found in any earlier writer.
                    Unfortunately this new information was of so crude and vague a character, and is
                    presented to us in so embarrassing a form, as to perplex rather than assist the
                    geographical student, and the statements of Ptolemy concerning the rivers Gir
                    and Nigir, and the lakes and mountains with which they were connected, have
                    exercised the ingenuity and baffled the sagacity of successive generations of
                    geographers in modern times to interpret or explain them. It may safely be said
                    that they present no resemblance to the real features of the country as known to
                    us by modern explorations, and cannot be reconciled with them except by the most
                    arbitrary conjectures.</p>
                <p>It is otherwise in the case of the Nile. To discover the source of that river had
                    been long an object of curiosity both among the Greeks and Romans, and an
                    expedition sent out for that purpose by the emperor Nero had undoubtedly
                    penetrated as far as the marshes of the White Nile; but we are wholly ignorant
                    of the sources from whence Ptolemy derived his information. But his statement
                    that the mighty river derived its waters from the confluence of two streams,
                    which took their rise in two lakes a little to the south of the equator, was
                    undoubtedly a nearer approach to the truth than any of the theories concocted in
                    modern times before the discovery in our own days of the two great lakes now
                    knoλvn as the Victoria and Albert Nyanza. He at the same time notices the other
                    arm of the river (the Blue Nile) under the name of the Astapus, which he
                    correctly describes as rising in another lake. In connexion with this subject he
                    introduces a range of mountains running from east to west, which he calls the
                    Mountains of the Moon, and which have proved a sad stumbling-block to
                    geographers in modem times, but may now be safely affirmed to represent the real
                    fact of the existence of snow-covered mountains (Kilimanjaro and Kenia) in these
                    equatorial regions.</p>
                <p>Much the same remarks apply to Ptolemy’s geography of Asia as to that of Africa.
                    In this case also he had obtained, as we have already seen, a vague knowledge of
                    extensive regions, wholly unknown to the earlier geographers, and resting to a
                    certain extent on authentic information, though much exaggerated and
                    misunderstood. But, while these informants had really brought home some definite
                    statements concerning Serica or the Land of Silk, and its capital of Sera, there
                    lay a vast region towards the north of the line of route leading to this far
                    eastern land (supposed by Ptolemy to be nearly coincident with the parallel of
                    40°) of which apparently he knew nothing, but which he vaguely assumed to extend
                    indefinitely northwards as far as the limits of the Unknown Land. The Jaxartes,
                    which ever since the time of Alexander had been the boundary of Greek geography
                    in this direction, still continued in that of Ptolemy to be the northern limit
                    of all that was really known of Central Asia. Beyond that he places a mass of
                    names of tribes, to which he could assign no definite locality, and mountain
                    ranges which he could only place at haphazard. The character of his information
                    concerning the south-east of Asia has been already adverted to. But, strangely
                    as he misplaced Cattigara and the metropolis of Sinae connected with it, there
                    can be no doubt that we recognize in this name (variously written Thinae and
                    Sinae) the now familiar name of China; and it is important to observe that he
                    places the land of the Sinae immediately south of that of the Seres, showing
                    that he was aware of the connexion between the two, though the one was known
                    only by land explorations and the other by maritime voyages.</p>
                <p>In regard to the better known regions of the world, and especially those
                    bordering on the Mediterranean, Ptolemy according to his own account followed
                    for the most part the guidance of Marinus. The latter seems to have relied to a
                    great extent on the work of Timosthenes (who flourished more than two centuries
                    before) in respect to the coasts and maritime distances. Ptolemy, however,
                    introduced many changes, some of which he has pointed out to us, though there
                    are doubtless many others which we have no means of detecting. For the interior
                    of the different countries the Roman roads and itineraries must have furnished
                    him with a mass of valuable materials which had not been available to earlier
                    geographers. But neither Marinus nor Ptolemy seems to have taken advantage of
                    this last resource to the extent that we should have expected, and the tables of
                    the Alexandrian geographer abound with mistakes—even in countries so well known
                    as Gaul and Spain— which might easily have been obviated by a more judicious use
                    of such Roman authorities.</p>
                <p>Great as are undoubtedly the merits of Ptolemy’s geographical work, it cannot be
                    regarded as having any claim to be a complete or satisfactory treatise upon this
                    vast subject. It was the work of an astronomer rather than a geographer, in the
                    highest sense of the term. Not only did its plan exclude all description of the
                    countries with which it dealt, their climate, natural productions, inhabitants,
                    and peculiar features, all of which are included in the domain of the modern
                    geographer, but even its physical geography strictly so called is treated in the
                    most irregular and perfunctory manner. While Strabo was fully alive to the
                    importance of the great rivers and mountain chains which (to use his own
                    expressive <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit20newyrich/page/n109/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0920-0109-0096"/> phrase) “geographize” a country, Ptolemy deals
                    with this part of his subject in so careless a manner as to be often worse than
                    useless. Even in the case of a country so well known as Gaul the few notices
                    that he gives of the great rivers that play so important a part in its geography
                    are disfigured by some astounding errors; while he does not notice any of the
                    great tributaries of the Rhine, though mentioning an obscure streamlet,
                    otherwise unknown, because it happened to be the boundary between two Roman
                    provinces.</p>
                <p>⅛e revival of the study of Ptolemy’s work after the Middle Ages and the influence
                    it exercised upon the progress of geography have been described in the article
                    <hi rend="smallcaps">Map</hi> (vol. xv. p. 520). His <hi rend="italic"
                    >Geographia</hi> was printed for the first time in a Latin translation,
                    accompanied with maps, in 1478, and numerous other editions followed in the
                    latter part of the 15th and earlier half of the 16th century, but the Greek text
                    did not make its appearance till 1533, when it was published at Basel in 4to,
                    edited by the celebrated Erasmus. All these early editions, however, swarm with
                    textual errors, ⅞nd are wholly worthless for critical purposes. The same may be
                    said of the edition of Bertius (Gr. and Lat., Leyden, 1618, typ. Elzevir), which
                    was long the standard library edition of the work. It contains a new set of maps
                    drawn by Mercator, as well as a fresh series (not intended to illustrate
                    Ptolemy) by Ortelius, the Roman Itineraries, including the Tabula Peutingeriana,
                    and much other miscellaneous matter. The first attempt at a really critical
                    edition was made by Wilberg and Grashof (4to, Essen, 1842), but this
                    unfortunately was never completed. The edition of Nobbe (3 vols. 18mo, Leipsic,
                    1843) presents the best Greek text of the whole work as yet available and has a
                    useful index. But by far the best edition, so far as completed, is that
                    published in Didot’s <hi rend="italic">Bibliotheca</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Classicorum</hi><hi rend="italic">Graecorum</hi> (Paris, 1883), edited by Dr C.
                    Miiller, with a Latin translation and a copious commentary, geographical as well
                    as critical. The first part, which is all that has yet appeared, contains only
                    the first three books, without the Prolegomena, which will be anxiously expected
                    by all students of Ptolemy. (E. H. B.)</p>
