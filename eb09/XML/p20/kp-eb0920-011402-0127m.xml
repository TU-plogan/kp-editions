                    repentance, that their souls are cleansed by purgatorial pains after death, and
                    for their relief from these the suffrages of the living —the sacrifice of the
                    mass, prayers, alms, and other offices of piety—are helpful. The second is that
                    of the council of Trent, which runs as follows:—“Since the Catholic Church,
                    instructed by the Holy Spirit from the sacred writings and the ancient tradition
                    of the fathers, hath taught in holy councils, and lastly in this oecumenical
                    council, that there is a purgatory, and that the souls detained there are
                    assisted by the suffrages of the faithful, but especially by the most acceptable
                    sacrifice of the mass, this holy council commands all bishops to have a diligent
                    care that the sound doctrine of purgatory delivered to us by venerable fathers
                    and sacred councils be believed, maintained, taught, and everywhere preached.”
                    This decree is to be read in the light of an earlier canon of the same council,
                    by which it is condemned as heretical to say that after the reception of the
                    grace of justification the guilt of the penitent sinner is so remitted, and the
                    penalty of eternal punishment so annulled, that no penalty of temporal
                    punishment remains to be paid either in this world or in the future in purgatory
                    before the kingdom of heaven can be opened. Thus the essential point of the
                    doctrine is that Christian souls having any sin upon them at the moment of death
                    pass into a state of expiatory suffering, in which they can be helped by the
                    prayers and other good works of living believers. And this is all that modern
                    Catholic theologians regard as being <hi rend="italic">de fide.</hi> It is
                    hardly necessary to say that the doctrine as popularly held and currently taught
                    is generally much more detailed and explicit. In view of some of these
                    developments, there is on all hands admitted to exist abundant room for the
                    admonition of the council of Trent, when it proceeded to warn the clergy to
                    exclude from popular addresses all the more difficult and subtle questions
                    relating to the subject, and such as do not tend to edification or make for
                    piety. “They must not allow uncertainties or things which have the appearance of
                    falsity to be given forth or handled, and they are to prohibit as scandalous and
                    offensive such things as minister to curiosity or superstition or savour of
                    filthy lucre. Let the bishops see to it that the prayers of the living—to wit,
                    the sacrifices, prayers, alms, and other works of piety which have been wont to
                    be rendered by believers for the departed—are done piously and devoutly,
                    according to the institutions of the church, and that those which are due by the
                    wills of testators or otherwise be not rendered in a perfunctory manner but
                    diligently and punctually, by priests and other ministers of the church who are
                    bound to this service.”</p>
                <p>Among the details of the doctrine, which have been the subject of much
                    speculation among Catholics, may be specified the questions relating to the
                    locality of purgatory and the nature and duration of its sufferings. On none of
                    these points has anything authoritative been delivered. It is of course
                    conceived of as having some position in space, and as being distinct from
                    heaven, the place of eternal blessedness, on the one hand, and from hell, the
                    place of eternal woe, on the other. But any theory as to its exact latitude and
                    longitude (such, for example, as underlies Dante’s description) must be regarded
                    as the effort merely of the individual imagination. As regards the nature of its
                    pains, there has been a constant disposition to interpret with strict literality
                    the expressions of Scripture as to the cleansing efficacy of fire, but the
                    possibility of interpreting them metaphorically has never been wholly lost sight
                    of. With respect to their duration, it must be inferred from the whole praxis of
                    indulgences as at present authorized by the church that the pains of purgatory
                    are measurable by years and days; but here also everything is left vague.</p>
                <p>The thesis of all Protestants, as against the Roman Catholic doctrine of
                    purgatory, is that “the souls of believers are at their death made perfect in
                    holiness and do immediately pass into glory.” Scripture authority is claimed on
                    both sides, but the argument, which is a somewhat complicated one and depends
                    mainly on the view arrived at as to the Scriptural doctrine of sin and
                    satisfaction, cannot be entered upon here. When the two doctrines are compared
                    in the light of ecclesiastical tradition it will be found that neither fully
                    coincides with the opinions somewhat vaguely held by the early fathers, whose
                    view of the intermediate state between death and the resurrection was largely
                    affected by the pre-Christian doctrine of Hades or Sheol. On the one hand,
                    Irenaeus <hi rend="italic">(Haer.,</hi> v. 31) regards as heretical the opinion
                    that the souls of the departed do immediately pass into glory; he argues that,
                    as Christ tarried for three days “in the lower <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit20newyrich/page/n128/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0920-0128-0115"/> parts of the earth,” so must the souls of His
                    disciples also go away into the invisible place allotted them by God, and there
                    remain until the resurrection, when, receiving their bodies and rising as their
                    Lord arose, they shall come into heaven and into the presence of God. On the
                    other hand, it is impossible to point out in any writing of the first four
                    centuries any passage which describes the state of any of the faithful departed
                    as one of acute suffering, although Tertullian’s belief that martyrs had the
                    exceptional privilege of being taken to “paradise” at once clearly shows that
                    for ordinary Christians the state after death was regarded rather as one of
                    expectancy than of enjoyment. Still less would it be possible to show that the
                    intermediate state was regarded by them as one in which satisfaction was made
                    for sin. Origen’s doctrine of <hi rend="italic">πυρ καθάρσων</hi> is intimately
                    connected with his doctrine of <hi rend="italic">apokatastasis</hi>; in his view
                    the application of purgatorial fire was not to take place until the last
                    judgment, nor was its efficacy to be limited to those who had closed their life
                    on earth as believers in Christ. In a different connexion Augustine, expounding
                    1 Cor. iii. 15 as referring more immediately to the purification of Christians
                    by means of the trials of the present life, goes on to speak of it as a
                    supposable thing that the process might be continued after death, but without
                    committing himself to the belief (“incredibile non est, et utrum ita sit quaeri
                    potest”). Gregory the Great was the first to formulate in express terms the
                    doctrine which afterwards became that of the whole Roman obedience “de quibusdam
                    levibus culpis esse ante judicium purgatorius ignis credendus est.” Such
                    utterances as this were never accepted by the Greek Church, which in its
                    doctrine of the intermediate state still occupies as nearly as possible the
                    standpoint of the ante-Nicene fathers.</p>
