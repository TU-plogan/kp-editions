                    now so far acquired a more definite meaning in its geometrical sense that it is
                    desirable to employ it in that sense alone. A pyramid therefore should be
                    understood as meaning a building bounded by a polygonal base and plane
                    triangular sides which meet in an apex. Such a form of architecture is only
                    known in Middle Egypt, and there only during the period from the IVth to the
                    XIIth Dynasty (before 2000 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi>)—having square bases
                    and angles of about 50°. In other countries various modifications of the
                    tumulus, barrow, or burial-heap have arisen which have come near to this type;
                    but these when formed of earth are usually circular, or, if square, have a flat
                    top, and when built of stone are always in steps or terraces. The imitations of
                    the true Egyptian pyramid at Abydos, Meroe, and elsewhere are puny hybrids,
                    being merely chambers with a pyramidal outside and porticos attached; and the
                    structures found at Cenchreae, or the monument of Caius Sestius at Rome, are
                    isolated and barren trials of a type which never could be revived: it had run
                    its course in a country and a civilization to which alone it was suitable.</p>
                <p>In the earliest monuments of Egypt there are three types, which were ruled by the
                    external shape. For the temples (such as those of the kings of the IVth Dynasty
                    at Gizeh) varied in shape according to their arrangements; but the pyramid, the
                    obelisk, and the mastaba<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"
                    ><p>An oblong building with sloping sides and flat top, which contained usually
                    the funeral chapel and place of offerings, and covered over the mouth of the
                    sepulchral pit.</p></note> are designs whose importance was outward; and these
                    types, which started apparently at the same epoch (the earliest actually dated
                    examples of each being all within the two reigns of Seneferu and Khufu), only
                    lasted during the life of that archaic system to which they belonged. The
                    pyramid type faded out in the middle kingdom (XIIth Dynasty); the obelisk was
                    adapted in later times to a different purpose, as a member of bilateral temple
                    decoration, instead of a solitary monument complete in itself and surrounded by
                    an enclosure, as it was in the old kingdom; and the mastaba gave way to the
                    rock-hewn chapel or the bastard pyramid.</p>
                <p>In considering the origin of the pyramid type there are three theories to be
                    dealt with—(1) that it is merely a higher and refined form of the tumulus; (2)
                    that it was derived from the mastaba; (3) that it was a fresh idea, an invention
                    <hi rend="italic">de novo.</hi> The objection to the first view is that there is
                    no graduated series of examples of lesser sizes before the large ones, possibly
                    not any before the very largest, and that tumulus or mound burial is unknown in
                    Egypt, ancient or modern; and to accept this view we must suppose that all the
                    earlier stages were wrought in another land, and that the pyramid-builders
                    migrated into Egypt when at the height of their architectural power. But their
                    history does not agree to this, and in no other land can we find their
                    training-ground. The second view is strongly suggested by the facts before us in
                    Egypt. The only buildings that have been reasonably supposed to be earlier than
                    the great pyramid are the two so-called pyramids of Sakkara and Medum. These
                    structures are not and never were true pyramids; they are mastabas added to by
                    successive accretions at various times, again and again finished off with a
                    polished casing, only to be afresh enlarged by coats of rough masonry and
                    another fine casing on the outside, until they have been extended upwards and
                    around into a great stepped mass of masonry (Petrie, <hi rend="italic">Pyramids,
                    d'c.,</hi> p. 147), the successive faces of which rise at the characteristic
                    mastaba angle of 75° (or 4 on 1). These buildings then present the outline of a
                    pyramidal pile, broken by successive steps, and it is but one stage further to
                    build in one smooth slope from base to top; such a form would readily be
                    designed when once it was intended to build a large mass complete at <pb
                    break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit20newyrich/page/n136/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0920-0136-0123"/> once on one uniform plan, as certainly was the
                    case for the largest pyramids. The third view has some support in the absence of
                    any datable pyramids before the largest and the second largest that ever
                    existed, and in the steady deterioration of work that is known to have taken
                    place. Remembering also what bold steps architecture has taken occasionally in
                    later times (as in the Pantheon and St Sophia) without a series of graduated
                    examples, we should not condemn this view too readily by <hi rend="italic">a
                    priori</hi> reasoning.</p>
                <p>It is certain that the pyramids were each begun with a definite design of their
                    size and arrangement; at least this is plainly seen in the two largest, where
                    continuous accretion (such as X∣epsius and his followers propound) would be most
                    likely to be met with. On looking at any section of these buildings it will be
                    seen how impossible it would have been for the passages to have belonged to a
                    smaller structure (Petrie, 165). The supposition that the designs were enlarged
                    so long as the builder’s life permitted was drawn from the compound mastabas of
                    Sakkara and Medum ∙, these are, however, quite distinct architecturally from
                    true pyramids, and appear to have been enlarged at long intervals, being
                    elaborately finished with fine casing at the close of each addition.</p>
                <p>Around many of the pyramids peribolus walls may be seen, and it is probable that
                    some enclosure originally existed around each of them. At the pyramids of Gizeh
                    the temples attached to these mausolea may be still seen. As in the private
                    tomb, the false door which represented the exit of the deceased person from this
                    world, and towards which the offerings were made, was always on the λvest wall
                    in the chamber, so the pyramid was placed on the west of the temple in which the
                    deceased king was worshipped. The temple being entered from the east (as in the
                    Jewish temples), the worshippers faced the west, looking toward the pyramid in
                    which the king was buried. Priests of the various pyramids are continually
                    mentioned during the old kingdom, and the religious endowments of many of the
                    priesthoods of the early kings were revived under the Egyptian renaissance of
                    the XXVIth Dynasty and continued during Ptolemaic times. A list of the
                    hieroglyphic names of nineteen of the pyramids which have been found mentioned
                    on monuments (mostly in tombs of the priests) is given in Lieblein’s <hi
                    rend="italic">Chr&lt;ynology,</hi> p. 32. The pyramid was never a family
                    monument, but belonged—like all other Egyptian tombs—to one person, members of
                    the royal family having sometimes lesser pyramids adjoining the king’s (as at
                    Khufu’s); the essential idea of the sole use of a tomb was so strong that the
                    hill of Gizeh is riddled with deep tomb-shafts for separate burials, often
                    running side by side 60 or 80 feet deep with only a thin wall of rock between;
                    and in one place a previous shaft has been partially blocked with masonry, So
                    that a later shaft could be cut partly into it, macled with it like a
                    twin-crystal.</p>
                <p>Turning now to the architecture of the buildings, their usual construction is a
                    mass of masonry composed of horizontal layers of rough-hewn blocks, with a small
                    amount of mortar; and this mass in the later forms became more and more rubbly,
                    until in the VIth Dynasty it was merely a cellular system of retaining walls of
                    rough stones and mud, filled up with loose chips, and in the XIIth Dynasty the
                    bulk was of mud bricks. Whatever was the hidden material, however, there was
                    always on the outside a casing of fine stone, elaborately finished, and very
                    well jointed; and the inner chambers were of similarly good work. Indeed the
                    construction was in all cases so far sound that, had it not been for the spite
                    of enemies and the greed of later builders, it is probable that every pyramid
                    would have been standing in good order at this day. The casings were not a mere
                    “veneer” or “film,” as they have been called, but were of massive blocks,
                    usually greater in thickness than in height, and in some cases (as at South
                    Dahshur) reminding the observer of horizontal leaves with sloping edges.</p>
                <p>Inside of each pyramid, always low down, and usually below the ground level, was
                    built a sepulchral chamber; this was reached in all cases by a passage from the
                    north, sometimes beginning in the pyramid face, sometimes descending into the
                    rock on which the pyramid was built in front of the north side. This chamber, if
                    not cut in the rock altogether (as in Menkaura’s), or a pit in the rock roofed
                    with stone (as in Khafra <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi> s), was built between
                    two immense walls which served for the east and west sides, and between which
                    the north and south sides and roofing stood merely in contact, but unbonded. The
                    gable roofing of the chambers was formed by great sloping cantilevers of stone,
                    projecting from the north and south walls, on which they rested without pressing
                    on each other along the central ridge; thus there was no thrust, nor were there
                    any forces to disturb the building; and it was only after the most brutal
                    treatment, by which these great masses of stone were cracked asunder, that the
                    principle of thrust came into play, though it had been provided for in the
                    sloping form of the roof, so as to delay as long as possible the collapse of the
                    chamber. This is best seen in the pyramid of Pepi (Petrie), opened from the top
                    right through the roof. See also the Abusir pyramids (Howard Vyse) and the
                    king’s and queen’s chambers of the great pyramid (Howard Vyse, Piazzi Smyth,
                    Petrie). The roofing is sometimes, perhaps usually, of more than one layer; in
                    Pepi’s pyramid it is of three layers of stone beams, each deeper than their
                    breadth, resting one on another, the thirty stones weighing more than 30 tons
                    each. In the king’s chamber (Gizeh) successive horizontal roofs were interposed
                    between the chamber and the final gable roof, and such may have been the case at
                    Abu Roash (Howard Vyse).</p>
                <p>The passages which led into the central chambers have usually some lesser chamber
                    in their course, and are blocked once or offener with massive stone
                    portcullises. In all cases some part, and generally the greater part, of the
                    passages slopes downwards, usually at an angle of about 26°, or 1 on 2. These
                    passages appear to have been closed externally with stone doors turning on a
                    horizontal pivot, as may be seen at South Dahshur, and as is described by Strabo
                    and others (Petrie). This suggests that the interiors of the pyramids were
                    accessible to the priests, probably for making offerings; the fact of many of
                    them having been forcibly entered otherwise does not show that no practicable
                    entrance existed, but merely that it was unknown, as, for instance, in the
                    pyramids of Khufu and Khafra, both of which were regularly entered in classical
                    times, but were forced by the ignorant Arabs.</p>
                <p>The pyramids of nearly all the kings of the IVth, Vth, and VIth Dynasties are
                    mentioned in inscriptions, and also a few of later times. The first which can be
                    definitely attributed is that of Khufu (or Cheops), called “the glorious,” the
                    great pyramid of Gizeh. Ratatef, who appears next to Khufu in the lists, is
                    unknown in other monuments; he is perhaps the same as Khnumu-Khufu, apparently a
                    co-regent of Khufu, who may have been buried in the so-called queen’s chamber of
                    the great pyramid. Khafra rested in the great pyramid, now known as the second
                    pyramid of Gizeh. Menkaura’s pyramid was called “the upper,” being at the
                    highest level on the hill of Gizeh. The lesser pyramids of Gizeh, near the great
                    and third pyramids, belong respectively to the families of Khufu and Khafra
                    (Howard Vyse). The pyramid of a Men(kal)ra at Abu Roash is probably also of this
                    period. The pyramid of Aseskaf, called “the cool,” is unknown, so also is that
                    of Userkaf of the Vth Dynasty, called the “holiest of buildings.” Sahura’s
                    pyramid, the north one of Abusir, was named “the rising soul,” much as
                    Neferkara’s (of unknown site) was named “of the soul.” Raenuser’s pyramid, “the
                    firmest of buildings,” is the middle pyramid of Abusir. The pyramid’of
                    Menkauhor, called “the most divine building,” is somewhere at Sakkara. Assa’s
                    pyramid is unidentified; it was “the beautiful.” Unas not onlv built the <pb

                    but had a pyramid called “the most beautiful of buildings” at Sakkara, which was
                    opened in 1881 (see <hi rend="italic">Recueil des Travaux,</hi> by Μ. Maspero,
                    iii., for those opened at Sakkara). In the VIth Dynasty the “pyramid of souls,”
                    built by Ati (Rauserka), is unknown. That of Teta, “the most stable of
                    buildings,” was opened at Sakkara in 1881, as well as that of Pepi (Ranieri),
                    “the firm and beautiful.” The pyramids of Raineren, “the beautiful rising,” and
                    of Neferkara, “the firm life,” are unknown. Haremsaf’s pyramid was opened at
                    Sakkara in 1881. Of the last two kings of the VIth Dynasty we know of no
                    pyramids. In the V∏th or VIΠth Dynasty most probably the brick pyramids of
                    Dahshur were erected. In the XIth Dynasty the pyramid, “the most glorious
                    building,” of Mentuhotep II. is mentioned, and the mud pyramid of one of the
                    Antef kings is known at Thebes. In the X∏th Dynasty the pyramids, the·“lofty and
                    beautiful” of Amenemhat I. and “the bright” of Usertesen II. are known in
                    inscriptions, while the brick pyramid .at Howara may be most probably assigned
                    to Amenemhat III., who appears to have built the adjoining temple.</p>
                <p>Of the architectural peculiarities of some particular pyramids some notice must
                    now be given. The great pyramid of Gizeh (Khufu’s) is very different in its
                    internal arrangements from any other known (see vol. ii. p. 385 <hi
                    rend="italic">sq.</hi> and vol. vii. p. 771 <hi rend="italic">sq.).</hi> The
                    greater number of passages and chambers, the high finish of parts of the work,
                    and the accuracy of construction all distinguish it. The chamber which is most
                    normal in its situation is the subterranean chamber; but this is quite
                    unfinished, hardly more than begun. The upper chambers, called the “king’s” and
                    “queen’s,” were completely hidden, the ascending passage to them having been
                    closed by plugging blocks, which concealed the point where it branched upwards
                    out of the roof of the long descending passage. Another passage, which in its
                    turn branches from the ascending passage to the queen’s chamber, was also
                    completely blocked up. The object of having two highly-finished chambers in the
                    mass may have been to receive the king and his co-regent (of whom there is some
                    historical evidence)j and there is very credible testimony to a sarcophagus
                    having existed in the queen’s chamber, as well as in the king’s chamber. On the
                    details of construction in the great pyramid it is needless to enter here; but
                    it may be stated that the accuracy of work is such that the four sides of the
                    base have only a mean error of six-tenths of an inch in length and 12 seconds in
                    angle from a perfect square.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                <p>The second pyramid of Gizeh has two separate entrances (one in the side, the
                    other in the pavement) and two chambers (one roofed with slabs, the other all
                    rock-hewn); these chambers, however, do not run into the masonry, the whole bulk
                    of which is solid so far as is known. This pyramid has a part of the original
                    casing on the top; and it is also interesting as having the workmen’s barracks
                    still remaining at a short distance on the west side, long chambers capable of
                    housing about 4000 men. The great bulk of the rubbish from the work is laid on
                    the south side, forming a flat terrace level with the base, and covering a steep
                    rock escarpment which existed there. The waste heaps from the great pyramid were
                    similarly tipped out over the cliff on its northern side. Thus the rubbish added
                    to the broad platform which set off the appearance of the pyramids; and it has
                    remained undisturbed in all ages, as there was nothing to be got out of it. The
                    third pyramid was cased around the base with red granite for the sixteen lowest
                    courses. The design of it has been enlarged at one bound from a small pyramid
                    (such as those of the family of Khufu) to one eight times the size, as it is at
                    present; the passages needed therefore to be altered. But there is no sign of
                    gradual steps of enlargement: the change was sudden, from a comparatively small
                    design to a large one. The basalt sarcophagus of this pyramid was ornamented
                    with the panel decoration found on early tombs, unlike the granite sarcophagi of
                    the two previous pyramids, which are plain. Unhappily it was lost at sea in
                    1838.</p>
                <p>Farther south are the pyramids of Abusir, the most complete account of which is
                    in the work of Colonel Howard Vyse. Next come those of Sakkara. The construction
                    of the step-pyramid or cumulative mastaba has been noticed above; its passages
                    are very peculiar and intricate, winding around the principal chamber, which is
                    in the centre, cut in the rock, very high, and with a tombchamber built in the
                    bottom of it, which is closed with a great plug of red granite, a circular
                    stopper· fitting into a neck in the chamber roof. A doorway faced with glazed
                    tiles bearing a king’s standard existed here; the tiles were taken to Berlin by
                    Lepsius. The other pyramids of Sakkara are of the VIth Dynasty, of Unas, Pepi,
                    Haremsaf, &amp;c. They are distinguished by the introduction of very long
                    religious texts, covering the whole inside of the chambers and passages; these
                    are carefully carved in small hieroglyphics, painted bright green, in the white
                    limestone. Beyond these come the pyramids of Dahshur, which are in a simple and
                    massive style, much like those of Gizeh. The north pyramid of Dahshur has
                    chambers roofed like the gallery in the great pyramid by successive overlappings
                    of stone, the roof rising to a great height with no less than eleven projections
                    on each side. The south pyramid of Dahshur has still the greater part of its
                    casing remaining, and is remarkable for being built at two different angles, the
                    lower part being at the usual pyramid angle, while the upper part is but 43°.
                    This pyramid is also remarkable for having a western passage to the chambers,
                    which was carefully closed up. Beyond the Memphitic group are the scattered
                    pyramids of Lisht, Illahun, and Howara, and the cumulative mastaba of Medum.
                    Illahun is built with a framework of stone filled up with mud bricks, and Howara
                    is built entirely of mud bricks, though doubtless cased with fine stone like the
                    other pyramids.</p>
                <p>Beyond these there are no true pyramids, but we will briefly notice those later
                    forms derived from the pyramid. At Abydos a large cemetery is covered with more
                    than a hundred mud-brick chambers, the outsides of which are sloped to the form
                    of an acute pyramid, and which have a door (or in later forms a large chamber)
                    projecting on one side. These differ from true pyramids in (1) having an
                    attachment more or less large on one face, (2) being always built on a square
                    plinth, (3) having the principal face generally south, and but rarely to the
                    north, (4) not being oriented, and (5) having the chambers occupying the greater
                    part of the structure. The sizes are about 18 feet wide and 24 high, with a
                    chamber 11 feet wide and 13 high, and in the later and less acute forms 20 feet
                    base and 21 in height (see Mariette, <hi rend="italic">Abydos,
                    Description</hi><hi rend="italic">des Fouilles,</hi> ii. 43). At Thebes are also
                    some similar structures belonging to the kings of the XIth Dynasty; the
                    tomb-chamber is, however, in the rock below. The size is not so insignificant,
                    but is under 50 feet square. These, like those at Abydos, are not oriented, and
                    have a horizontal entrance, quite unlike the narrow pipe-like passages sloping
                    down into the regular pyramids (see Mariette, in <hi rend="italic">Bib. Arch.
                    Trans.,</hi> iv. 193). In Ethiopia, at Gebel Barkal, are other so-called
                    pyramids of a very late date. They nearly all have porches; their simplicity is
                    lost amid very dubious decorations; and they are not oriented. They are all very
                    acute, and have flat tops as if to support some ornament. The sizes are but
                    small, varying from 23 to 88 feet square at Gebel Barkal and 17 to 63 feet
                    square at Meroe. The interior is solid throughout, the windows which appear on
                    the sides being useless architectural members (see Hoskin’s <hi rend="italic"
                    >Ethiopia,</hi> 148, &amp;c.). The structures sometimes called pyramids at
                    Biahmu in the Fay urn seem to have no possible claim to such a name, though they
                    are certainly of early work. Judging by the account of Herodotus (which seems
                    intended to apply to them), by the present name (Pharaoh’s thrones), and the
                    actual remains, it appears that they were two great enclosed courts with sloping
                    sides, in the centres of which were two seated statues raised on pedestals high
                    enough to be seen over the walls of the courts. This form would appear like a
                    pyramid with a statue on the top; and a rather similar case in early
                    construction is shown on the sculptures of the old kingdom. Obelisks then were
                    single monuments (not in pairs) and stood in the midst of a great courtyard with
                    sides sloping like a mastaba; such open courtyards on a small scale are found in
                    the mastabas at Gizeh, and are probably copied from the domestic architecture of
                    the time.</p>
                <p>On the vexed question of inscriptions on the pyramids it will suffice to say that
                    not one fragment of early inscription is known on the casing of any pyramid,
                    either <hi rend="italic">in situ</hi> or broken in pieces. Large quantities of
                    travellers’ “graffiti” doubtless existed, and some have been found on the casing
                    of the great pyramid; these probably gave rise to the accounts of inscriptions,
                    which are expressly said to have been in many different languages.</p>
                <p>The mechanical means employed by the pyramid-builders have been partly
                    ascertained. The hard stones, granite, diorite, and basalt were in all fine work
                    sawn into shape by bronze saws set with jewels (either corundum or diamond),
                    hollows were made (as in sarcophagi) by tubular drilling with tools like our
                    modern diamond rock-drills (which are but reinvented from ancient sources, see
                    <hi rend="italic">Engineering,</hi> xxxvii. 282), and small articles were turned
                    in lathes fitted with mechanical tool-rests and jewel-pointed tools. The details
                    of the questions of transport and management of the large stones remain still to
                    be explained.</p>
