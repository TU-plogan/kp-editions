                <p><label type="entry">PRUSSIA</label>, in the original and narrower sense of the
                    word, is a district in the north-eastern corner of the modern kingdom of the
                    same name, stretching along the Baltic coast for about 220 miles, and occupying
                    an area of upwards of 24,000 square miles. The eastern part of this territory
                    formed the duchy of Prussia, which was acquired by the electors of Brandenburg
                    in 1618, and furnished them with their regal title. The western part, which had
                    been severed from the eastern half and assigned to Poland in 1466, was not
                    annexed to Prussia until the partition of Poland in 1772, while the towns of
                    Dantsic and Thorn remained Polish down to 1793. In spite of the contrast between
                    the political and social conditions of the two districts, arising from the
                    difference of their history, they were united in 1824 to form a single province.
                    But, as might have been expected, the union did not work well, and it was
                    dissolved in 1878, giving place to the modem provinces of East and West Prussia.
                    The early history of the whole district is related under the kingdom of <hi

                    Prussia. It shares in the general characteristics of the great north German
                    plain, but, though low, its surface is by no means absolutely flat, as the
                    southern half is traversed by a low ridge or plateau (comp. <hi rend="smallcaps"

                    boundary of the province. This plateau, here named the Prussian Seenplatte, is
                    thickly sprinkled with small lakes, among which is the Spirding See, 46 square
                    miles in extent and the largest inland lake in the Prussian monarchy.</p>

                <p>The coast is lined with low dunes or sandhills, in front of which lie the large
                    littoral lakes or lagoons named the Frische Haff and the Kurische Haff. (See <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Germany.)</hi> The first of these receives the waters of the
                    Nogat and the Pregel, and the other those of the Memel or Niemen. East Prussia
                    is the coldest part of Germany, its mean annual temperature being about 44°
                    Fahr., while the mean January temperature of Tilsit is only 25°. The rainfall is
                    24 inches per annum. About half the province is under cultivation; 18 per cent,
                    is occupied by forests, and 23 per cent, by meadows and pastures. The most
                    fertile soil is found in the valleys of the Pregel and the Memel, but the
                    southern slopes of the Baltic plateau and the district to the north of the Memel
                    consist in great part of sterile moor, sand, and bog. The chief crops are rye,
                    oats, and potatoes, while flax is cultivated in the district of Ermland, between
                    the Passarge and the upper Alle. East Prussia is the headquarters of the
                    horse-breeding of the country and contains the principal Government stud of
                    Trakehnen; numerous cattle are also fattened on the rich pastures of the
                    river-valleys. The extensive woods in the south part of the province harbour a
                    fe∖v wolves and lynxes, and the elk is still preserved in the forest of
                    Ibenhorst, near the Kurische Haff. The fisheries in the lakes and haffs are of
                    some importance; but the only mineral product of note is amber, which is found
                    in the peninsula of Samland in greater abundance than in any other part of the
                    world. Manufactures are almost confined to the principal towns, though
                    linen-weaving is practised as a domestic industry. Commerce is facilitated by
                    canals connecting the Memel and Pregel and also the principal lakes, but is
                    somewhat hampered by the heavy dues exacted at the Russian frontier. A brisk
                    foreign trade is carried on through the seaports of Königsberg (140,909), the
                    capital of the province, and Memel (19,660), the exports consisting mainly of
                    timber and grain. In 1880 the population of East Prussia was 1,933,936,
                    including 1,654,510 Protestants, 250,462 Roman Catholics, and 18,218 Jews. The
                    Roman Catholics are mainly confined to the district of Ermland, in which the
                    ordinary proportions of the confessions are completely reversed. The bulk of the
                    inhabitants are of German blood, but there are 400,000 Protestant Poles
                    (Masurians or Masovians) in the south part of the province, and 150,000
                    Lithuanians in the north. As in other provinces where the Polish element is
                    strong, East Prussia is below the general average of the kingdom in education;
                    in 1883 fully 5⅛ per cent, of its recruits were unable to read or write. There
                    is a university at Königsberg.</p>

                    with an area of 9850 square miles, is bounded by the Baltic, East Prussia,
                    Poland, Posen, Brandenburg, and Pomerania. It resembles East Prussia in its
                    physical characteristics, but its fertility is somewhat greater and its climate
                    not quite so harsh. The Baltic plateau traverses the province from east to west,
                    reaching its culminating point in the Thurmberg (1090 feet), near Dantsic. Near
                    the middle of the province the range is interrupted by the valley of the
                    Vistula, beyond which it trends to the north and approaches the coast. The lakes
                    of West Prussia are nearly as numerous but not so large as those of the sister
                    province. The natural products are similar, and the manufactures are also almost
                    confined to the large towns. The cultivation of the common beet, for the
                    production of sugar, has been introduced, and several sugar refineries have been
                    erected. The valley of the Vistula, particularly the rich lowlands (<hi
                    rend="italic">Werder)</hi> of the delta, are very fertile, producing good crops
                    of wheat and pasturing large herds of horses, cattle, and sheep. The population
                    in 1880 was 1,405,898, consisting in almost equal proportions of Roman Catholics
                    and Protestants; there were 26,547 Jews and 490,000 Poles. The percentage of
                    illiterate recruits in 1882 was still higher than in East Prussia (7 <hi
                    rend="superscript"> -</hi> 97), but not so high as in Posen (9 <hi
                    rend="superscript"> -</hi> 75). The capital and principal town is Dantsic
                    (108,551), while Elbing (35,842) and Thorn (20,617) also carry on a considerable
                    trade.</p>
