                    π∙&gt;πn is properly the infinitive or <hi rend="italic">nomen verbi</hi> of ⅛∏,
                    a verb employed in the technical language of the temple service for the
                    execution of a jubilant song of praise to the accompaniment of music and the
                    blare of the priestly trumpets (1 Chron. xvi. 4 <hi rend="italic">sq.,</hi> xxv.
                    3; 2 Chron. v. 12 <hi rend="italic">sqf.</hi> The name is not therefore equally
                    applicable to all psalms, and in the later Jewish ritual the synonym <hi
                    rend="italic">hallel</hi> specially designates two series of psalms,
                    cxiii.-cxviii. and cxlv.-cl., of which the former was sung at the three great
                    feasts, the encaenia, and the new moon, and the latter at the daily morning
                    prayer. That the whole book is named “praises” is clearly due to the fact that
                    it was the manual of the temple service of song, in which praise was the leading
                    feature. But for an individual psalm the usual name is “liDTö (in the Bible only
                    in titles of psalms), which is applicable to any piece designed to be sung to a
                    musical accompaniment. Of this word ^αλ∕Λ&lt;⅛, “psalm,” is a translation, and
                    in the Greek Bible the whole book is called <hi rend="italic">ψaλpol</hi> or
                    ^αλτψHov.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Similarly in
                    the Syriac Bible the title is “mazmôrë.”</p></note> The title ¾i'aλ∕xoi or <hi
                    rend="italic">βcβλbs ψaλμωv</hi> is used in the New Testament (Luke xx. 42,
                    xxiv. 44; Acts i. 20), but in Heb. iv. 7 we find another title, namely “David.”
                    Hippolytus tells us that in his time most Christians said “the Psalms of David,”
                    and believed the whole book to be his; but this title and belief are both of
                    Jewish origin, for in 2 Mac. ii. 13 τα <hi rend="italic">τον Δαυίδ</hi> means
                    the Psalter, and the title of the apocryphal “Psalter of Solomon” implies that
                    the previously existing Psalter was ascribed to David. Jewish tradition does not
                    make David the author of all the psalms; but as he was regarded as the founder
                    and legislator of the temple psalmody (1 Chron., <hi rend="italic">ut sup.</hi>;
                    Ezra iii. 10; Neh. xii. 36, 45 <hi rend="italic">sq.;</hi> Ecclus. xlvii. 8 <hi

                    Abraham, Moses, Hernan, Jeduthun, Asaph, and the three sons of Korah. With this
                    it agrees that the titles of the psalms name no one later than Solomon, and even
                    he is not recognized as a psalmodist by the most ancient tradition, that of the
                    LXX., which omits him from the title of Ps. cxxvii, and makes Ps. lxxii. be
                    written not by but of him. The details of the tradition of authorship show
                    considerable variation; according to the Talmudic view Adam is author of the
                    Sabbath psalm, xcii., and Melchizedek of Ps. cx., while Abraham is identified
                    with Ethan the Ezrahite (Ps. lxxxix.). But, according to older Jewish tradition

                    by its title is Davidic, seems to have been given to Melchizedek to avoid the
                    dilemma of Matt, xxii. 41 <hi rend="italic">sq.</hi></p>
                <p>Origen’s rule accounts for all the psalms except i. and ii., which were sometimes

                    David (Acts iv. 25).</p>
                <p>The opinion of Jerome <hi rend="italic">(Praef. in Ps. Hebf</hi> and other
                    Christian writers that the collector of the Psalter was Ezra does not seem to
                    rest on Jewish tradition.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Nature and Origin of the Collection.—</hi> Whatever may be the
                    value of the titles to individual psalms, there can be no question that the
                    tradition that the Psalter was collected by David is not historical; for no one
                    doubts that some of the psalms date from after the Babylonian exile. The truth
                    that underlies the tradition is that the collection is essentially the hymn-book
                    of the second temple, and it was therefore ascribed to David, because it was
                    assumed, as we see clearly from Chronicles, that the order of worship in the
                    second temple was the same as in the first, and had David as its father: as
                    Moses completed the law of Israel for all time before the people entered Canaan,
                    so David completed the theory and contents of the temple psalmody before the
                    temple itself was built. When we thus understand its origin, the tradition
                    becomes really instructive, and may be translated into a statement which throws
                    light on a number of points connected with the book, namely, that the Psalter
                    was (finally, at least) collected with a liturgical purpose. Thus, though the
                    Psalms represent a great range of individual religious experience, they avoid
                    such situations and expressions as are too unique to be used in acts of public
                    devotion. Many of the psalms are doxologies or the like, expressly written for
                    the temple; others are made up of extracts from older poems in a way perfectly
                    natural in a hymn-book, but otherwise hardly intelligible. Such ancient hymns as
                    Exod. xv. 1 <hi rend="italic">sq.,</hi> Judges v., 1 Sam. ii. 1 <hi
                    rend="italic">sq.,</hi> are not included in the collection, though motives
                    borrowed from them are embodied in more modern psalms; the interest of the
                    collector, we see, was not historical but liturgical. Again, the temple, Zion,
                    the solemn feasts, are constantly kept in the foreground. All these points go to
                    show that the collection was not only used but actually formed for use in the
                    temple.</p>
                <p>The question now arises, Was the collection a single act or is the Psalter made
                    up of several older collections? And here we have first to observe that in the
                    Hebrew text the Psalter is divided into five books, each of which closes with a
                    doxology. The scheme of the whole is as follows :— Book I., Pss. L-xli.: all
                    these are ascribed to David except i., ii., X. (which is really part of ix. ),
                    xxxiii. (ascribed to David in LXX.); <hi rend="italic">doxology,</hi> xli. 13.
                    Book II., Pss. xlii.-lxxii.: of these xlii.-xlix. are ascribed to the Korahites
                    (xliii. being part of xlii.), 1. to Asaph, li,-lxxi. to David (except lxvi.,
                    lxvii., Ixxi. anonymous; in LXX. the last two bear David’s name), lxxii, to
                    Solomon; <hi rend="italic">doxology,</hi> lxxii. 18, 19 followed by the
                    subscription “The prayers of David the son of Jesse are ended.” Book HL, Pss.
                    lxxiιi,-lxxxix.: here lxxiii,- Ixxxiii. bear the name of Asaph, lxxxiv., lxxxv.,
                    Ixxxvii., Ixxxviii. that of the Korahites, lxxxvi. of David, Ixxxviii. of
                    Hernan, lxxxix. of Ethan; <hi rend="italic">doxology,</hi> Ixxxix. 52. Book IV.,
                    Pss. xc.-cvi.: all are anonymous except xc. (Moses), ci., ciii. (David),—LXX.
                    gives also civ. to David; here the doxology is peculiar, “Blessed be Jehovah God
                    of Israel from everlasting and to everlasting. <hi rend="italic">And let all the
                    people say Amen,</hi> Hallelujah.” Book V., Pss. cvii.-cl.: of these cviii.-cx.,
                    cxxii., cxxiv., cxxxi., cxxxiii., cxxxviii. - cxlv. are ascribed to David, and
                    cxxvii. to Solomon, and cxx.-cxxxiv. are pilgrimage psalms; LXX. varies
                    considerably from the Hebrew as to the psalms to be ascribed to David; the book
                    closes with a group of doxological psalms.</p>
                <p>The division into five books was known to Hippolytus, but a closer examination of
                    the doxologies shows that it does not represent the original scheme of the
                    Psalter; for, while the doxologies to the first three books are no part of the
                    psalms to which they are attached, but really mark the end of a book in a pious
                    fashion not uncommon in Eastern literature, that to book iv. with its rubric
                    addressed to the people plainly belongs to the psalm, or rather to its
                    liturgical execution, and does not therefore really mark the close of a <pb
                    break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit20newyrich/page/n43/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0920-0043-0030"/> collection once separate. In point of fact books
                    iv. and v. have so many common characters that there is every reason to regard
                    them as a single great group. Again, the main part of books ii. and iii. (Pss.
                    xlii.-lxxxiii.) is distinguished from the rest of the Psalter by habitually
                    avoiding the name Jehovah (the Lord) and using Elohim (God) instead, even in
                    cases like Ps. 1. 7, where “I am Jehovah thy God” of Exod. XX. 2 is quoted but
                    changed very awkwardly to “I am God thy God.” This is not due to the authors of
                    the individual psalms, but to an editor; for Ps. liii. is only another recension
                    of Ps. xiv., and Ps. lxx. repeats part of Ps. xl., and here Jehovah is six times
                    changed to Elohim, while the opposite change happens but once. The Elohim
                    psalms, then, have undergone a common editorial treatment distinguishing them
                    from the rest of the Psalter. And they make up the mass of books ii. and iii.,
                    the remaining psalms, lxxxiv.-lxxxix,, appearing to be a sort of appendix. But
                    when we look at the Elohim psalms more nearly we see that they contain two
                    distinct elements, Davidic psalms and psalms ascribed to the Levitical choirs
                    (sons of Korah, Asaph). The Davidic collection as we have it splits the
                    Levitical psalms into two groups and actually divides the Asaphic Ps. 1. from
                    the main Asaphic collection, lxxiii.- lxxxiii. This order can hardly be
                    original, especially as the Davidic Elohim psalms have a separate subscription
                    (Ps. lxxii. 20). But if we remove them we get a continuous body of Levitical
                    Elohim psalms, or rather two collections, the first Korahitic and the second
                    Asaphic, to which there have been added by way of appendix by a non-Elohistic
                    editor a supplementary group of Korahite psalms and one psalm (certainly late)
                    ascribed to David. The formation of books iv. and v. is certainly later than the
                    Elohistic redaction of books ii. and iii., for Ps. cviii. is made up of two
                    Elohim psalms (Ivii. 7-11, lx. 5-12) <hi rend="italic">in the Elohistic
                    form,</hi> though the last two books of the Psalter are generally Jehovistic. We
                    can thus distinguish the following steps in the redaction :—(a) the formation of
                    a Davidic collection (book i.) with a closing doxology; (δ) a second Davidic
                    collection (li.-lxii.) with doxology and subscription; (c) a twofold Levitical
                    collection (xlii.-xlix.; 1., lxxiii.-lxxxiii.); (rf) an Elohistic redaction and
                    combination of (ft) and (c); <hi rend="italic">(e)</hi> the addition of a
                    non-Elohistic supplement to <hi rend="italic">(d)</hi> with a doxology; (∕) a
                    collection later than (d), consisting of books iv., v. And finally the anonymous
                    psalms i., ii., which as anonymous were hardly an original part of book i., may
                    have been prefixed after the whole Psalter was completed. We see too that it is
                    only in the latest collection (books iv., v.) that anonymity is the rule, and
                    titles, especially titles with names, occur only sporadically. Elsewhere the
                    titles run in series and correspond to the limits of older collections.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Date of the Collection.—</hi> A process of collection which
                    involves so many stages must plainly have taken a considerable time, and the
                    question arises whether we can fix a limit for its beginning and end or even
                    assign a date for any one stage of the process. An inferior limit for the final
                    collection is given by the Septuagint translation. But this translation itself
                    was not written all at once, and its history is obscure; we only know from the
                    prologue to Ecclesiasticus that the Hagiographa, and doubtless therefore the
                    Psalter, were read in Greek in Egypt about 130 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> or
                    somewhat later.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>The text
                    of the passage is obscure and in part corrupt, but the Latin “cum multum
                    temporis ibi fuissem” probably expresses the author’s meaning. A friend has
                    suggested to the writer that for σ∙υγχpoj√&lt;rαs we ought perhaps to read <hi
                    rend="italic">συχνόν</hi><hi rend="italic">tyχρovισas.</hi></p></note> And the
                    Greek Psalter, though it contains one apocryphal psalm at the close, is
                    essentially the same as the Hebrew; there is nothing to suggest that the Greek
                    was first translated from a less complete Psalter and afterwards extended to
                    agree with the extant Hebrew. It is therefore reasonable to hold that the Hebrew
                    Psalter was completed and recognized as an authoritative collection long enough
                    before 130 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> to allow of its passing to the
                    Greek-speaking Jews in Alexandria. Beyond this the external evidence for the
                    completion of the collection does not carry us. It appears indeed from 1 Chron.
                    xvi., 2 Chron. vi. 41, 42, that various psalms belonging to books iv. and v.
                    were current in the time of the Chronicler,—that is, towards the close of the
                    Persian or more probably in the earlier part of the Greek period. But it is not
                    certain that the psalms he quotes (xcvi., cv., cvi., cxxxii.) already existed in
                    their place in our Psalter, or that Ps. cvi. even existed in its present form.
                    Turning now to internal evidence, we find the surest starting-point in the
                    Levitical psalms of the Elohistic collection. These, as we have seen, form two
                    groups, referred to the sons of Korah and to Asaph. At the beginning of the
                    Greek period or somewhat later Asaph was taken to be a contemporary of David and
                    chief of the singers of his time (Neh. xii. 46), or one of the three chief
                    singers belonging to the three great Levitical houses (1 Chron. xxv. 1 <hi
                    rend="italic">sq.).</hi> But the older history knows nothing of an individual
                    Asaph; at the time of the return from Babylon the guild of singers as a whole
                    was called Bnë Asaph (Ezra ii. 41), and so apparently it was in the time of
                    Nehemiah (Neh. xi. 22, Heb.).<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>The threefold division of the singers appears in the same

                    LXX. preferable. The first clear trace of the triple choir is therefore in Neh.
                    xii. 24, <hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> not earlier than Alexander the Great, with
                    whom Jaddua (ver. 22) was contemporary.</p></note> The singers or Asaphites are
                    at this time still distinguished from the Levites; the oldest attempt to
                    incorporate them with that tribe appears in Exod. vi. 24, where Abiasaph—that
                    is, the eponym of the guild of Asaphites—is made one of the three sons of Korah.
                    But when singers and Levites were fused the Asaphites ceased to be the only
                    singers, and ultimately, as we see in Chronicles, they were distinguished from
                    the Korahites and reckoned to Gershom (1 Chron. vi.), while the head of the
                    Korahites is Hernan, as in the title of Ps. lxxxviii. It is only in the appendix
                    to the Elohistic psalm-book that we find Heman and Ethan side by side with
                    Asaph, as in the Chronicles, but the body of the collection distinguishes
                    between two guilds of singers, Korahites and Asaphites, and is therefore as a
                    collection younger than Nehemiah, but presumably older than Chronicles with its
                    three guilds.</p>
                <p>The contents of the Korahite and Asaphic psalms give no reason to doubt that they
                    really were collected by or for these two guilds. Both groups are remarkable by
                    the fact that they hardly contain any recognition of present sin on the part of
                    the community of J ewish faith—though they do confess the sin of Israel in the
                    past—but are exercised with the observation that prosperity does not follow
                    righteousness either in the case of the individual (xlix., lxxiii.) or in that
                    of the nation, which suffers notwithstanding its loyalty to God, or even on
                    account thereof (xliv., lxxix.). Now the rise of the problems of individual
                    faith is the mark of the age that followed Jeremiah, while the confident
                    assertion of national righteousness under misfortune is a characteristic mark of
                    pious Judaism after Ezra, in the period of the law but not earlier. Malachi,
                    Ezra, and Nehemiah, like Haggai and Zechariah, are still very far from holding
                    that the sin of Israel lies all in the past. Again, a considerable number of
                    these psalms (xliv., lxxiv., lxxix., lxxx.) point to an historical situation
                    which can be very definitely realized. They are post-exile in their whole tone
                    and belong to a time when prophecy had ceased and the synagogue worship was
                    fully established (lxxiv. 8, 9). But the Jews are no longer the obedient <pb

                    xml:id="kp-eb0920-0044-0031"/> slaves of Persia; there has been a national
                    rising and armies have gone forth to battle. Yet God has not gone forth with
                    them: the heathen have been victorious, blood has flowed like water round
                    Jerusalem, the temple has been defiled, and these disasters assume the character
                    of a religious persecution. These details would fit the time of religious
                    persecution under Antiochus Epiphanes, to which indeed Ps. lxxiv. is referred
                    (as a prophecy) in 1 Mac. vii. 16. But against this reference there is the
                    objection that these psalms are written in a time of the deepest dejection and
                    yet are psalms of the temple choirs. Now when the temple was reopened for
                    worship after its profanation by Antiochus the Jews were victorious and a much
                    more joyous tone was appropriate. Besides, if the psalms are of the Maccabee
                    period, they can have been no original part of the Elohistic psalm-book, which
                    certainly was not collected so late. But there is one and only one time in the
                    Persian period to which they can be referred, viz., that of the great civil wars
                    under Artaxerxes III. Ochus (middle of 4th century <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >b.c.).</hi> See <hi rend="smallcaps">Persia,</hi> vol. xviii. p. 580, and <hi

                    involved in these and were severely chastised, and we know from Josephus that
                    the temple was defiled by the Persians and humiliating conditions attached to
                    the worship there. It would appear that to the Jews the struggle took a
                    theocratic aspect, and it is not impossible that the hopeful beginnings of a
                    national movement, which proved in the issue so disastrous, are reflected in
                    some of the other pieces of the collection.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>Ps. lxxxiii., in which Judah is threatened by the
                    neighbouring states acting with the support rather than under the guidance of
                    Asshur (the satrap of Syria?) is also much more easily understood under the
                    loose rule of Persia than under the Greeks, and the association of Tyre with
                    Philistia (as in lxxxvii. 4) agrees with Pseudo-Scylax (see vol. xviii. p. 809).
                    If this psalm has a definite historical background, which many critics doubt, it
                    must be later than the destruction of Sidon by Ochus. That it is not of the
                    Assyrian age is obvious from the mention of Arab tribes.</p></note> All this
                    carries the collection of the Elohistic psalm-book down to quite the last years
                    of the Persian period at the earliest, and with this it agrees—to name but one
                    other point—that the view of Israel’s past history taken in Ps. lxxviii., where
                    the final rejection of the house of Joseph is co-ordinated with the fall of
                    Shiloh and the rise of Zion and the Davidic kingdom, indicates a standpoint very
                    near to that of Chronicles. The fusion of the separate Korahite and Asaphic
                    psalm-books in a single collection along with the second group of Davidic psalms
                    may very probably be connected with the remodelling of the singers in three
                    choirs which Chronicles presupposes.</p>
                <p>Now books iv. and v. are, as we have seen, later than the Elohistic redaction of
                    books ii. and iii., so that the collection of the last part of the Psalter must,
                    if our argument up to this point is sound, be thrown into the Greek period, and
                    probably not the earliest part thereof. And this conclusion is borne out by a
                    variety of indications. First of all, the language of some of these psalms
                    clearly points to a very late date indeed.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>For details as to the linguistic phenomena of the Psalms,

                    belong to the very latest stage of Biblical Hebrew.</p></note> The Jews had even
                    in the time of Nehemiah (Neh. xiii. 24) been in danger of forgetting their own
                    tongue and adopting a jargon compounded with neighbouring idioms; but the
                    restorers of the law fought against this tendency with vigour and with so much
                    success that very tolerable Hebrew was written for at least a century longer.
                    But in such a psalm as cxxxix. the language is a real jargon, a mixture of
                    Hebrew and Aramaic, which, in a hymn accepted for use in the temple, shows the
                    Hebrew speech to have reached the last stage of decay. Again, though no part of
                    the Psalter shows clearer marks of a liturgical purpose, we find that in books
                    iv. and v. the musical titles have entirely disappeared. The technical terms,
                    that is, of the temple music which are still recognized by the Chronicler have
                    gone out of use, presumably because they were already become unintelligible, as
                    they were when the Septuagint version was made. This implies a revolution in the
                    national music which we can hardly explain in any other way than by the
                    influence of that Hellenic culture which, from the time of the Macedonian
                    conquest, began to work such changes on the whole civilization and art of the
                    East. Once more the general tone of large parts of this collection is much more
                    cheerful than that of the Elohistic psalm-book. It begins with a psalm (xc.)
                    ascribed in the title to Moses, and seemingly designed to express feelings
                    appropriate to a situation analogous to that of the Israelites when, after the
                    weary march through the wilderness, they stood on the borders of the promised
                    land. It looks back on a time of great trouble and forward to a brighter future.
                    In some of the following psalms there are still references to deeds of
                    oppression and violence, but more generally Israel appears as happy under the
                    law with such a happiness as it did enjoy under the Ptolemies during the 3d
                    century <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> The problems of divine justice are no
                    longer burning questions; the righteousness of God is seen in the peaceful
                    felicity of the pious (xci., xcii., &amp;c.). Israel, indeed, is still scattered
                    and not triumphant over the heathen, but even in the dispersion the Jews are
                    under a mild rule (cvi. 46), and the commercial activity of the nation has begun
                    to develop beyond the seas (cvii. 26 <hi rend="italic">sq.).</hi> The whole
                    situation and vein of piety here are strikingly parallel to those shown in
                    Ecclesiasticus, which dates from the close of the Ptolemaic sovereignty in
                    Palestine. But some of the psalms carry us beyond this peaceful period to a time
                    of struggle and victory. In Ps. cxviii. Israel, led by the house of Aaron— this
                    is a notable point—has emerged triumphant from a desperate conflict and
                    celebrates at the temple a great day of rejoicing for the unhoped-for victory;
                    in Ps. cxlix. the saints are pictured with the praises of God in their throat
                    and a sharp sword in their hands to take vengeance on the heathen, to bind their
                    kings and nobles, and exercise against them the judgment written in prophecy.
                    Such an enthusiasm of militant piety, plainly based on actual successes of
                    Israel and the house of Aaron, can only be referred to the first victories of
                    the Maccabees, culminating in the purification of the temple in 165 <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> This restoration of the worship of the national
                    sanctuary under circumstances that inspired religious feelings very different
                    from those of any other generation since the return from Babylon might most
                    naturally be followed by an extension of the temple psalmody; it certainly was
                    followed by some liturgical innovations, for the solemn service of dedication on
                    the twenty-fifth day of Chisleu was made the pattern of a new annual feast (that
                    mentioned in John x. 22). Now in 1 Mac. iv. 54 we learn that the dedication was
                    celebrated with hymns and music. In later times the psalms for the encaenia or
                    feast of dedication embraced Ps. XXX. and the <hi rend="italic">lιalld</hi> Pss.
                    cxiii.-cxviii. There is no reason to doubt that these were the very psalms sung
                    in 165 B.c., for in the title of Ps. xxx. the words “the song for the dedication
                    of the house,” which are a somewhat awkward insertion in the original title, are
                    found also in the LXX., and therefore are probable evidence of the liturgical
                    use of the psalm in the very first years of the feast. But no collection of old
                    psalms could fully suffice for such an occasion, and there is every reason to
                    think that the <hi rend="italic">lιalld,</hi> which especially in its closing
                    part contains allusions that fit no other time so well, was first arranged for
                    the same ceremony. The course of the subsequent history makes <pb break="no"

                    closed, as we have seen from the date of the Greek version that it must have
                    been, within a few years at most after this great event.<note anchored="true"

                    princely high priests became more and more divergent from the ideal of the pious
                    in Israel, and in the Psalter of Solomon we see religious poetry turned against
                    the lords of the temple and its worship. (See <hi rend="smallcaps">Messiah.
                    )</hi></p>
                <p>All this does not, of course, imply that there are not in books iv. and v. any
                    pieces older than the completion of books ii. and iii., for the composition of a
                    poem and its acceptance as part of the Levitical liturgy are not necessarily
                    coincident in date, except in psalms written with a direct liturgical purpose.
                    In the fifteen “songs of degrees” (Pss. cxx.-cxxxiv.) we have a case in point.
                    According to the Mishna <hi rend="italic">(Middoth,</hi> ii. 5) and other Jewish
                    traditions, these psalms were sung by the Levites at the Feast of Tabernacles on
                    the fifteen steps or degrees that led from the women’s to the men’s court. But
                    when we look at the psalms themselves we see that they must originally have been
                    a hymn-book, not for the Levites, but for the laity who came up to Jerusalem at
                    the great pilgrimage feasts; and the title of this hymn-book (which can be
                    restored from the titles derived from it that were prefixed to each song when
                    they were taken into the Levitical connexion) was simply “Pilgrimage
                    Songs.”<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>H⅛DΠ Ι"t^ (∏SjlO

                    than the exile; but some of them cannot well be so late as the formation of the
                    Elohistic psalm-book, and the simple reason why they are not included in it is
                    that they were hymns of the laity, describing with much beauty and depth of
                    feeling the emotions of the pilgrim when his feet stood within the gates of
                    Jerusalem, when he looked forth on the encircling hills, when he felt how good
                    it was to be camping side by side with his brethren on the slopes of Zion
                    (cxxxiii.), when a sense of Jehovah’s forgiving grace and the certainty of the
                    redemption of Israel triumphed over all the evils of the present and filled his
                    soul with humble and patient hope.</p>
                <p>The titles which ascribe four of the pilgrimage songs to David and one to Solomon
                    are lacking in the true LXX., and inconsistent with the contents of the psalms.
                    Better attested, because found in theLXX. as well as in the Hebrew, and
                    therefore probably as old as the collection itself, are the name of Moses in Ps.
                    xc. and that of David in Pss. ci., cii., cviii,-cx., cxxxviii.-cxlv. But where
                    did the last collectors of the Psalms find such very ancient pieces which had
                    been passed by by all previous collectors, and what criterion was there to
                    establish their genuineness? No canon of literary criticism can treat as
                    valuable external evidence an attestation which first appears so many centuries
                    after the supposed date of the poems, especially when it is confronted by facts
                    so conclusive as that Ps. cviii. is made up of extracts from Pss. lvii. and lx.
                    and that Ps. cxxxix. is marked by its language as one of the latest pieces in
                    the book. The only possible question for the critic is whether the ascription of
                    these psalms to David was due to the idea that he was the psalmist <hi
                    rend="italic">par excellence,</hi> to whom any poem of unknown origin was
                    naturally ascribed, or whether we have in some at least of these titles an
                    example of the habit so common in later Jewish literature of writing in the name
                    of ancient worthies. In the case of Ps. xc. it can hardly be doubted that this
                    is the real explanation, and the same account must be given of the title in Ps.
                    cxlv., if, as seems probable, it is meant to cover the whole of the great <hi
                    rend="italic">luιllel</hi> or <hi rend="italic">tehilla</hi> (Ps. cxlv.-cl.),
                    which must, from the allusions in Ps. cxlix., as well as from its place, be
                    almost if not quite the latest thing in the Psalter.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Davidic Psalms.—</hi> For the later stages of the history of
                    the Psalter we have, as has been seen, a fair amount of circumstantial evidence

                    their contents suggest for the collection of the Elohistic psalmbook and of
                    books iv. and v. confirm one another and are in harmony with such indications as
                    we obtain from external sources. But, in order to advance from the conclusions
                    already reached to a view of the history of the Psalter as a whole, we have
                    still to consider the two great groups of psalms ascribed to David in books i.
                    and ii. Both these groups appear once to have formed separate collections and in
                    their separate form to have been ascribed to David; for in book i. every psalm,
                    except the introductory poems i. and ii. and the late Ps. xxxiii., which may
                    have been added as a liturgical sequel to Ps. xxxii., bears the title “of
                    David,” and in like manner the group Pss. li.-lxxii., though it contains a few
                    anonymous pieces and one psalm which is either “of” or rather according to the
                    oldest tradition “for Solomon,” is essentially a Davidic hymn-book, which has
                    been taken over as a whole into the Elohistic Psalter, even the subscription
                    lxxii. 20 not being omitted. Moreover, the collectors of books i.-iii. knew of
                    no Davidic psalms outside of these two collections, for Ps. lxxxvi. in the
                    appendix to the Elohistic collection is merely a cento of quotations from
                    Davidic pieces with a verse or two from Exodus and Jeremiah. These two groups,
                    therefore, represented to the collectors the oldest tradition of Hebrew
                    psalmody; they are either really Davidic or they passed as such. This fact is
                    important; but its weight may readily be over-estimated, for the Levitical
                    psalms comprise poems of the last half-century of the Persian empire, and the
                    final collection of books ii. and iii. may fall a good deal later. Thus the
                    tradition that David is the author of these two collections comes to us, not
                    exactly from the time of thé Chronicler, but certainly from the time when the
                    view of Hebrew history which he expresses was in the course of formation. And it
                    is not too much to say that that view— which to some extent appears in the
                    historical psalms of the Elohistic Psalter—implies absolute incapacity to
                    understand the difference between old Israel and later Judaism and makes almost
                    anything possible in the way of the ascription of comparatively modern pieces to
                    ancient authors. Nor will it avail to say that this uncritical age did not
                    ascribe the Psalms to David but accepted them on the ground of older titles, for
                    it is hardly likely that each psalm in the Davidic collections had a title
                    before it was transferred to the larger Psalter; and in any case the titles are
                    manifestly the product of the same uncritical spirit as we have just been
                    speaking of, for not only are many of the titles certainly wrong but they are
                    wrong in such a way as to prove that they date from an age to which David was
                    merely the abstract psalmist, and which had no idea whatever of the historical
                    conditions of his age. For example, Pss. xx., xxi. are not spoken by a king but
                    addressed to a king by his people; Pss. v., xxvii. allude to the temple (which
                    did not exist in David’s time), and the author of the latter psalm desires to
                    live there continually. Even in the older Davidic psalm-book there is a whole
                    series of hymns in which the writer identifies himself with the poor and needy,
                    the righteous people of God suffering in silence at the hands of the wicked,
                    without other hope than patiently to wait for the interposition of Jehovah (Pss.
                    xii., xxv., xxxvii., xxxviii., &amp;c.). Nothing can be farther removed than
                    this from any possible situation in the life of the David of the books of
                    Samuel, and the case is still worse in the second Davidic collection, especially
                    where we have in the titles <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit20newyrich/page/n46/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0920-0046-0033"/> definite notes as to the historical occasion on
                    which the poems are supposed to have been written. To refer Ps. liii. to Doeg,
                    Ps. liv. to the Ziphites, Ps. lix. to David when watched in his house by Saul,
                    implies an absolute lack of the very elements of historical judgment. Even the
                    bare names of the old history were no longer correctly known when Abimelech (the
                    Philistine king in the stories of Abraham and Isaac) could be substituted in the
                    title of Ps. xxxiv. for Achish, king of Gath. In a word, the ascription of these
                    two collections to David has none of the characters of a genuine historical
                    tradition.</p>
                <p>At the same time it is clear that the two collections do not stand on quite the
                    same footing. The Elohistic redaction—the change in the names of God—extends
                    only to the second. Now the formation of the Elohistic Psalter must have been an
                    official act directed to the consolidation of the liturgical material of the
                    temple, and if it left one of the so-called Davidic collections untouched the
                    reason must have been that this collection had already a fixed liturgical
                    position. In other words, book i. is the oldest extant liturgy of the second
                    temple, while there is no evidence that the Davidic psalms of book ii. had a
                    fixed liturgical place till at least the close of the Persian period.</p>
                <p>And now the question arises: May we suppose that the oldest liturgy of the second
                    temple was also the liturgy of the temple of Solomon? We have it in evidence
                    that music and song accompanied the worship of the great sanctuaries of northern
                    Israel in the 8th century <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> (Amos v. 23), but from
                    the context it appears probable that the musicians were not officers of the
                    temple but rather the worshippers at large (compare Amos vi. 5). So it certainly
                    was in the days of David (2 Sam. vi. 5) and even of Isaiah (xxx. 29); the same
                    thing is implied in the song of Hezekiah (Isa. xxxviii. 20), and in Lam. ii. 7
                    the noise within the sanctuary on a feast-day which affords a simile for the
                    shouts of the victorious Chaldaeans suggests rather the untrained efforts of the
                    congregation than the disciplined music of a temple choir. The allusion to
                    “chambers of singers” in Ezek. xl. 44 is not found in the Septuagint text, which
                    is justified by the context, and the first certain allusion to a class of
                    singers belonging to the sacred ministers is at the return from Babylon (Ezra
                    ii. 41). The way in which these singers, the sons of Asaph, are spoken of may be
                    taken as evidence that there was a guild of temple singers before the exile; but
                    they cannot have been very conspicuous or we should have heard more of them. The
                    historical books, as edited in the captivity, are fond of varying the narrative
                    by the insertion of lyrical pieces, and one or two of these—the “passover song”
                    (Exod. xv.) and perhaps the song from the book of Jashar ascribed to Solomon
                    (see vol. xi. p. 598)—look as if they were sung in the first temple; but they
                    are not found in the Psalter, and, conversely, no piece from the Psalter is used
                    to illustrate the life of David except Ps. xviii., and it occurs in a section
                    which can be shown to be an interpolation in the original form of 2 Samuel.
                    These facts seem to indicate that even book i. of the Psalter did not exist when
                    the editing of the historical books was completed, and that in music as in other
                    matters the ritual of the second’ temple was completely reconstructed. Indeed
                    the radical change in the religious life of the nation caused by the captivity
                    could not fail to influence the psalmody of the sanctuary more than any other
                    part of the worship; the book of Lamentations marks an era of profound
                    importance in the religious poetry of Israel, and no collection formed before
                    these dirges were first sung could have been an adequate hymn-book for the
                    second temple. In point of fact the notes struck in the Lamentations and in Isa.
                    xl.-lxvi. meet our ears again in not a few psalms of book i., <hi rend="italic"
                    >e.g.,</hi> Pss. xxii., xxv., where the closing prayer for the redemption of
                    Israel in a verse additional to the acrostic perhaps gives, as Lagarde suggests,
                    the characteristic post-exile name Pedaiah as that of the author; Ps. xxxi.,
                    with many points of resemblance to Jeremiah; Pss. xxxiv., xxxv., where the
                    “servant of Jehovah” is the same collective idea as in DeuteroIsaiah; and Pss.
                    xxxviii., xli. The key to many of these psalms is that the singer is not an
                    individual but, as in Lam. iii., the true people of God represented as one
                    person; and only in this way can we do justice to expressions which have always
                    been a stumbling-block to those who regard David as the author. But, at the same
                    time, other psalms of the collection treat the problems of individual religion
                    in the line of thought first opened by Jeremiah. Such a psalm is xxxix., and
                    above all Ps. xvi. Other pieces, indeed, may well be earlier. When we compare
                    Ps. viii. with Job vii. 17, 18, we can hardly doubt that the psalm lay before
                    the writer who gave its expressions so bitter a turn in the anguish of his soul,
                    and Pss. xx., xxi. plainly belong to the old kingdom. But on the whole it is not
                    the pre-exilic pieces that give the tone to the collection; whatever the date of
                    this or that individual poem, the collection as a whole—whether by selection or
                    authorship—is adapted to express a religious life of which the exile is the
                    presupposition. Only in this way can we understand the conflict and triumph of
                    spiritual faith, habitually represented as the faith of a poor and struggling
                    band living in the midst of oppressors and with no strength or help save the
                    consciousness of loyalty to Jehovah, which is the fundamental note of the whole
                    book.</p>
                <p>Whether any of the older poems really are David’s is a question more curious than
                    important, as, at least, there is none which we can fit with certainty into any
                    part of his life. If we were sure that 2 Sam. xxii. was in any sense part of the
                    old tradition of David’s life, there would be every reason to answer the
                    question in the affirmative, as has been done by Ewald (see <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >David)</hi>; but the grave doubts that exist on this point throw the whole
                    question into the region of mere conjecture.</p>
                <p>The contents of book i. make it little probable that it was originally collected
                    by the temple ministers, whose hymn-book it ultimately became. The singers and
                    Levites were ill provided for, and consequently irregular in their attendance at
                    the temple, till the time of Nehemiah, who made it his business to settle the
                    revenues of the clergy in such a way as to make regular service possible. With
                    regular service a regular liturgy would be required, and in the absence of
                    direct evidence it may be conjectured that the adoption of the first part of the
                    Psalter for this purpose took place in connexion with the other far-reaching
                    reforms of Ezra and Nehemiah, which first gave a stable character to the
                    community of the second temple. In any case these psalms, full as they are of
                    spiritual elements which can never cease to be the model of true worship, are
                    the necessary complement of the law as published by Ezra, and must be always
                    taken along with it by those who would understand what Judaism in its early days
                    really was, and how it prepared the way for the gospel.</p>
                <p>The second Davidic collection, which begins with a psalm of the exile (Ps. li.;
                    see the last two verses), contains some pieces which carry us down to a date
                    decidedly later than that of Nehemiah. Thus Ps. lxviii. 27 represents the
                    worshipping congregation as drawn partly from the neighbourhood of Jerusalem and
                    partly from the colony of Galilee. In several psalms of this collection, as in
                    the Levitical psalms with which it is coupled, we see that the Jews have again
                    begun to feel themselves a nation and not a mere municipality, though they are
                    still passing through bitter struggles; and side by side with this there is a
                    development of Messianic hope, which in Ps. lxxii. takes a <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit20newyrich/page/n47/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0920-0047-0034"/> wide sweep, based on the vision of
                    Deutero-Isaiah. All these marks carry us down for this as for the other
                    collections of the Elohistic Psalter to the time when passive obedience to the
                    Achaemenians was interrupted. Several points indicate that the collection was
                    not originally formed as part of the temple liturgy. The title, as preserved in
                    the subscription to Ps. lxxii. 20, was not “Psalms” but “Prayers of David.”
                    Again, while the Levitical psalms were sung in the name of righteous Israel, of
                    which, according to the theory of the second temple, the priestly and Levitical
                    circles were the special holy representatives, these Davidic psalms contain
                    touching expressions of contrition and confession (li., lxv.). And, while there
                    are direct references to the temple service, these are often made from the
                    standpoint, not of the ministers of the temple, but of the laity who come up to
                    join in the solemn feasts or appear before the altar to fulfil their vows (Pss.
                    liv. 6, lv. 14, lxiii., Ixvi. 13, &amp;c.). Moreover, the didactic element so
                    prominent in the Levitical psalms is not found here.</p>
                <p>Such is the fragmentary and conjectural outline which it seems possible to supply
                    of the history of the two Davidic collections, from which it appears that the
                    name of David which they bear is at least so far appropriate as it marks the
                    generally non-clerical origin of these poems. But the positive origin of this
                    title must be sought in another direction and in connexion with book i. From the
                    days of Amos, and in full accordance with the older history, the name of David
                    had been connected with musical skill and even the invention of musical
                    instruments (Amos vi. 5). In the days of Nehemiah, though we do not hear of
                    psalms of David,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi
                    rend="italic">I.e.,</hi> not in the parts of the book of Nehemiah which are by
                    Nehemiah himself.</p></note> we do learn that instruments of the singers were
                    designated as Davidic, and the epithet “man of God <hi rend="superscript">
                    ,,</hi> (Neh. xii. 36) probably implies that agreeably with this David was
                    already regarded as having furnished psalms as well as instruments. But it was
                    because the temple music was ascribed to him that the oldest liturgy came to be
                    known in its totality as “Psalms of David,” and the same name was extended to
                    the lay collection of “Prayers of David,” while the psalms whose origin was
                    known because they had always been temple psalms were simply named from the
                    Levitical choirs, or at a later date had no title.</p>

                    it seems unnecessary to enter here upon the various conjectures that have been
                    made about them. The clearest point is that a number of the psalms were set to

                    ΠΠKTrSx (Al-taschith in E. V., Ps. lvii. <hi rend="italic">sq.</hi>), may be
                    probably identified with the vintage song, Isa. lxv. 8. The temple music was
                    therefore apparently based on popular melodies. A good deal is said about the
                    musical services of the Levites in Chronicles, both in the account given of
                    David’s ordinances and in the descriptions of particular festival occasions. But
                    unfortunately it has not been found possible to get from these accounts any
                    clear picture of the ritual or any certainty as to the technical terms used. By
                    the time of the Septuagint these terms were no longer understood; it is not
                    quite clear whether even the Chronicler understood them fully.</p>
                <p>The music of the temple attracted the attention of Theophrastus (ap. Porph., <hi
                    rend="italic">De</hi><hi rend="italic">Abst.,</hi> ii. 26), who was perhaps the
                    first of the Greeks to make observations on the Jews. His description of the
                    temple ritual is not strictly accurate, but he speaks of the worshippers as
                    passing the night in gazing at the stars and calling on God in prayer; his
                    words, if they do not exactly fit anything in the later ritual, are well fitted
                    to illustrate the original liturgical use of Pss. viii,, cxxxiv. Some of the
                    Jewish traditions as to the use of particular psalms have been already cited; it
                    may be added that the Mishna (<hi rend="italic">Tâmïd)</hi> assigns to the
                    service of the continual burnt-offering the following weekly cycle of
                    psalms,—(1) xxiv., (2) xlviii., (3) Ixxxii., (4) xciv., (5) lxxxi., (6) xciiL,
                    (Sabbath) xcii., as in the title. Many other details are given in the treatise
                    <hi rend="italic">SSftrïm,</hi> but these for the most part refer primarily to
                    the synagogue service after the destruction of the temple. For details on the
                    liturgical use of the Psalter in Christendom the reader may refer to Smith’s <hi
                    rend="italic">Diet. Chr. Ant.,</hi> s.v. “Psalmody.”</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Ancient Versions.</hi> —A. The oldest version, the LXX.,
                    follows a text generally closely corresponding to the Massoretic Hebrew, the
                    main variations being in the titles and in the addition (lacking in some MSS.)
                    of an apocryphal psalm ascribed to David when he fought with Goliath. Pss. ix.
                    and x. are rightly taken as one psalm, but conversely Ps. cxlvii. is divided
                    into two. The LXX. text has many “daughters," of which maybe noticed (a) the
                    Memphitic (ed. Lagarde, 1875); (ft) the old Latin, which as revised by Jerome in
                    383 after the current Greek text forms the <hi rend="italic">Psalterium</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Romanum,</hi> long read in the Roman Church and still used in St
                    Peter’s; (c) various Arabic versions, including that printed in the polyglotte
                    of Le Jay and Walton, and two others of the four exhibited together in Lagarde’s
                    <hi rend="italic">Psalterium, lob,</hi><hi rend="italic">Proverbia,
                    Arabice,</hi> 1876; on the relations and history of these versions, see G.
                    Hoffmann, in <hi rend="italic">Jenaer</hi><hi rend="italic">Literature.,</hi>
                    1876, art. 539; the fourth of Lagarde’s versions is from the Peshito. The
                    Hexaplar text of the LXX., as reduced by Origen into greater conformity with the
                    Hebrew by the aid of subsequent Greek versions,<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>See Field, <hi rend="italic">Origtnis
                    Hexapla,</hi> where the fragments of these versions are collected. That of

                    rend="italic">—</hi> that is, of Jerome’s second revision of the Psalter (385)
                    by the aid of the Hexaplar text; this edition became current in Gaul and
                    ultimately was taken into the Vulgate (e) of the Syro-Hexaplar version
                    (published by Bugati, 1820, and in facsimile from the famous Ambrosian MS. by
                    Ceriani, Milan, 1874). B. The Christian Aramaic version or Peshito (P’shittä) is
                    largely influenced by the LXX.; compare Baethgen, <hi rend="italic"
                    >Untersuchungen</hi><hi rend="italic">über</hi><hi rend="italic">die</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Psalmen nach der</hi><hi rend="italic">Peschita,</hi> Kiel, 1878
                    (unfinished). This version has peculiar titles taken from Eusebius and Theodore
                    of Mopsuestia (see Nestle, in <hi rend="italic">Theol. Literature.,</hi> 1876,
                    p. 283). C. The Jewish Aramaic version or Targum is probably a late work. The
                    most convenient edition is in Lagarde, <hi rend="italic">Hagiographa
                    Chaldaice,</hi> 1873. D. The best of all the old versions is that made by Jerome
                    after the Hebrew in 405. It did not, however, obtain ecclesiastical currency—
                    the old versions holding their ground, just as English churchmen still read the
                    Psalms in the version of the “Great Bible” printed in their Prayer Book. This
                    important version was first published in a good text by Lagarde, <hi
                    rend="italic">Psalterium iuxta</hi><hi rend="italic">Hebraeos Hieronymi,</hi>
                    Leipsic, 1874.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Exegetical Works.—</hi> While some works of patristic writers
                    are still of value for text criticism and for the history of early exegetical
                    tradition, the treatment of the Psalms by ancient and mediaeval Christian
                    writers is as a whole such as to throw light on the ideas of the commentators
                    and their times rather than on the sense of a text which most of them knew only
                    through translations. For the Psalms as for the other books of the Old Testament
                    the scholars of the period of the revival of Hebrew studies about the time of
                    the Reformation were mainly dependent on the ancient versions and on the Jewish
                    scholars of the Middle Ages. In the latter class Kimhi stands pre-eminent; to
                    the editions of his commentary on the Psalms enumerated in the article <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Kimhi</hi> must now be added the admirable edition of Dr
                    Schiller-Szinessy (Cambridge, 1883), containing unfortunately only the first
                    book of his longer commentary. Among the works of older Christian scholars since
                    the revival of letters, the commentary of Calvin (1557)—full of religious
                    insight and sound thought—and the laborious work of Μ. Geier (1668, 1681 <hi
                    rend="italic">et</hi><hi rend="italic">sxpius)</hi> may still be consulted with
                    advantage, but for most purposes Rosenmiiller’s <hi rend="italic">Scholia in
                    Pss.</hi> (2d ed., 1821-22) supersedes the necessity of frequent reference to
                    the predecessors of that industrious compiler. Of more recent works the freshest
                    and most indispensable are Ewald’s, in the first two half volumes of his <hi
                    rend="italic">Dichter des alten Bundes</hi> (2d ed., Göttingen, 1866; Eng. tr.,
                    1880), and Olshausen’s (1853). To these may be added (excluding general
                    commentaries on the Old Testament) the two acute but wayward commentaries of
                    Hitzig (1836, 1863-65), that of Delitzsch (1859-60, then in shorter form in
                    several editions since 1867; Eng. tr., 1871), and that of Hupfeld (2d ed. by
                    Riehm, 1867, 2 vols.). The last-named work, though lacking in original power and
                    clearness of judgment, is extremely convenient and useful, and has had an
                    influence perhaps disproportionate to its real exegetical merits. The question
                    of the text was first properly raised by Olshausen, and has since received
                    special attention from, among others, Lagarde <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Prophetie</hi><hi rend="italic">Chald.,</hi> 1872, p. xlvi. <hi rend="italic"
                    >sq.),</hi> Dyserinck (in the “scholia” to his Dutch translation of the Psalms,
                    <hi rend="italic">Theol. Tijdschr.,</hi> 1878, p. 279 <hi rend="italic"
                    >sq.),</hi> and Bickell <hi rend="italic">(Carmina</hi><hi rend="italic">V.
                    T.</hi><hi rend="italic">metrice,</hi> &amp;c., Innsbruck, 1882), whose critical
                    services are not to be judged merely by the measure of assent which his metrical
                    theories may command. In English we have, among others, the useful work of
                    Perowne (5th ed., 1883), that of Lowe and Jennings (2d ed., 1885), and the
                    valuable translation of Cheyne (1884). The mass of literature on the Psalms is
                    so enormous that no full list even of recent commentaries can be here attempted,
                    much less an enumeration of treatises on individual psalms and special critical
                    questions. For the latter Kuenen’s <hi rend="italic">Onderzoek,</hi> vol. iii.,
                    is, up to its date (1865), the most complete, and the new edition now in
                    preparation will doubtless prove the standard work of reference. As regards the
                    dates and historical interpretation of the Psalms, all older dis-eussions, even
                    those of Ewald, are in great measure antiquated by recent progress in Pentateuch
                    criticism and the history of the canon, and an entirely fresh treatment of the
                    Psalter by a sober critical commentator is urgently needed. (W. R. 8.)</p>
