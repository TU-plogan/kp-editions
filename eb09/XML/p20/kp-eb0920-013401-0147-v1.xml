                <p><label type="entry">PYROTECHNY</label> is the art of producing pleasing scenic
                    effects by means of fire. It is not held to include the manufacture of
                    inflammable and explosive substances for other purposes. The use of fireworks
                    for purposes of display is not a modern invention, for it appears to have
                    existed in China in very ancient times; but the secret of constructing them
                    remained unknown in Europe till about the 13th century, when the knowledge of
                        <hi rend="smallcaps">Gunpowder</hi><hi rend="italic">{q.v.')</hi> crept in
                    from the East. In modern times the art has been gradually improved by the work
                    of specialists, who have had the advantage of being guided by scientific
                    knowledge. The value of such knowledge to the pyrotechnist is extremely great;
                    for he must be governed by the principles of chemistry in the selection of his
                    materials, and his various contrivances for turning them to the best account are
                    subject to the laws of mechanics. As in all such cases, however, science is
                    useless without the aid of practical experience and acquired manual
                    dexterity.</p>
                <p>Many substances have a strong tendency to combine with oxygen, and will do so, in
                    certain circumstances, so energetically as to render the products of the
                    combination (which may be solid matter or gas) intensely hot and luminous. This
                    is the general cause of the phenomenon known as fire. Its special character
                    depends chiefly on the nature of the substances burned and on the manner in
                    which the oxygen is supplied to them. As is well known, our atmosphere contains
                    oxygen gas diluted with about four times its volume of nitrogen; and it is this
                    oxygen which supports the combustion of our coal and candles. But it is not
                    often that the pyrotechnist depends wholly upon atmospheric oxygen for his
                    purposes; for the phenomena of combustion in it are too familiar, and too little
                    capable of variation, to strike with wonder. Two cases, however, where he does
                    so may be instanced, viz., the burning of magnesium powder and of lycopodium,
                    both of which are used for the imitation of lightning in theatres. Nor does the
                    pyrotechnist resort much to the use of pure oxygen, although very brilliant
                    effects may be produced by burning various substances in glass jars filled with
                    the gas. Indeed, the art could never have existed in anything like its present
                    form had not certain solid substances become known which, containing oxygen in
                    combination with other elements, are capable of being made to evolve large
                    volumes of it at the moment it is required. The best examples of these solid <hi
                        rend="italic">oxidizing agents</hi> are nitrate of potash (nitre or
                    saltpetre) and chlorate of potash; and these are of the first importance in the
                    manufacture of fireworks. If a portion of one of these salts be thoroughly
                    powdered and mixed with the correct quantity of some suitable combustible body,
                    also reduced to powder, the resulting mixture is capable of burning with more or
                    less energy without any aid from atmospheric oxygen, since each small piece of
                    fuel is in close juxtaposition to an available and sufficient store of the gas.
                    All that is required is that the liberation of the oxygen from the solid
                    particles which contain it shall be started by the application of heat from
                    without, and the action then goes on unaided. This, then, is the funda- <pb

                <p>mental fact of pyrotechny,—that, with proper attention to the chemical nature of
                    the substances employed, solid mixtures <hi rend="italic">(compositions</hi> or
                        <hi rend="italic">fuses')</hi> may be prepared which contain within
                    themselves all that is essential for the production of fire.</p>
                <p>If nitre and chlorate of potash, with other salts of nitric and chloric acids and
                    a few similar compounds, be grouped together as oxidizing agents, most of the
                    other materials used in making firework compositions may be classed as <hi
                        rend="italic">oxidizable substances.</hi> Every composition must contain at
                    least one sample of each class: usually there are present more than one
                    oxidizable substance, and very often more than one oxidizing agent. In all cases
                    the proportions by weight which the ingredients of a mixture bear to one another
                    is a matter of much importance, for it greatly affects the manner and rate of
                    combustion. The most important oxidizable substances employed are charcoal and
                    sulphur. These two, it is well known, when properly mixed in certain proportions
                    with the oxidizing agent nitre, constitute gunpowder; and gunpowder plays an
                    important part in the construction of most fireworks. It is sometimes employed
                    alone, when a strong explosion is required; but more commonly it is mixed with
                    one or more of its own ingredients and with other matters. In addition to
                    charcoal and sulphur, the following oxidizable substances are more or less
                    employed :—many compounds of carbon, such as sugar, starch, resins, &amp;c.;
                    certain metallic compounds of sulphur, such as the sulphides of arsenic and
                    antimony; a few of the metals themselves, such as iron, zinc, magnesium,
                    antimony, copper. Of these metals iron (cast-iron and steel) is more used than
                    any of the others. They are all employed in the form of powder or small filings.
                    They do not contribute much to the burning power of the composition; but when it
                    is ignited they become intensely heated and are discharged into the air, where
                    they oxidize more or less completely and cause brilliant sparks and
                    scintillations.</p>
                <p>Sand, sulphate of potash, calomel, and some other substances, which neither
                    combine with oxygen nor supply it, are sometimes employed as ingredients of the
                    compositions in order to influence the character of the fire. This may be
                    modified in many ways. Thus the rate of combustion may be altered so as to give
                    anything from an instantaneous explosion to a slow fire lasting many minutes.
                    The flame may be clear, smoky, or charged with glowing sparks. But the most
                    important characteristic of a fire —one to which great attention is paid by
                    pyrotechnists— is its <hi rend="italic">colour,</hi> which may be varied through
                    the different shades and combinations of yellow, red, green, and blue. These
                    colours are imparted to the flame by the presence in it of the heated vapours of
                    certain metals, of which the following are the most important :—sodium, which
                    gives a yellow colour; calcium, red; strontium, crimson; barium, green; copper,
                    green or blue, according to circumstances. Suitable salts of these metals are
                    much used as ingredients of fire mixtures; and they are decomposed and
                    volatilized during the process of combustion. Very often the chlorates and
                    nitrates are employed, as they serve the double purpose of supplying oxygen and
                    of imparting colour to the flame.</p>
                <p>The number of fire mixtures actually employed is very great; for the requirements
                    of each variety of firework, and of almost each size of each variety, are
                    different. Moreover, every pyrotechnist has his own taste in the matter of
                    compositions. They are capable, however, of being classified according to the
                    nature of the work to which they are suited. Thus there are rocket-fuses,
                    gerbe-fuses, squib-fuses, star-compositions, &amp;c.; and, in addition, there
                    are a few which are essential in the construction of most fireworks, whatever
                    the main composition may be.</p>
                <p>Such are the <hi rend="italic">starting-powder,</hi> which first catches the
                    fire, the <hi rend="italic">bursting-powder,</hi> which causes the final
                    explosion, and the <hi rend="italic">guick-match</hi> (cotton-wick, dried after
                    being saturated with a paste of gunpowder and starch), employed for connecting
                    parts of the more complicated works and carrying the fire from one to another.
                    Of the general nature of fuses an idea may be had from the following two
                    examples, which are selected at hazard from among the numerous recipes for
                    making, respectively, tourbillion fire and green stars :—</p>

                <p>Although the making of compositions is of the first importance, it is not the
                    only operation with which the pyrotechnist has to do; for the construction of
                    the <hi rend="italic">cases</hi> in which they are to be packed, and the actual
                    processes of packing and finishing, require much care and dexterity. These cases
                    are made of paper or pasteboard, and are generally of a cylindrical shape. In
                    size they vary greatly, according to the effect which it is desired to produce.
                    The relations of length to thickness, of internal to external diameter, and of
                    these to the size of the openings for discharge, are matters of extreme
                    importance, and must always be attended to with almost mathematical exactness
                    and considered in connexion with the nature of the composition which is to be
                    used.</p>
                <p>There is one very important property of fireworks that is due more to the
                    mechanical structure of the cases and the manner in which they are filled than
                    to the precise chemical character of the composition, <hi rend="italic"
                        >i.e.,</hi> their power of <hi rend="italic">motion.</hi> Some are so
                    constructed that the piece is kept at rest and the only motion possible is that
                    of the flame and sparks which escape during combustion from the mouth of the
                    case. Others, also fixed, contain, alternately with layers of some more ordinary
                    composition, balls or blocks of a special mixture cemented by some kind of
                    varnish; and these <hi rend="italic">stars,</hi> as they are called, shot into
                    the air, one by one, like bullets from a gun, blaze and burst there with
                    striking effect. But in many instances motion is imparted to the firework as a
                    whole,—to the case as well as to its contents. This motion, various as it is in
                    detail, is almost entirely one of two kinds, — <hi rend="italic">rotatory</hi>
                    motion round a fixed point, which may be the centre of gravity of a single piece
                    or that of a whole system of pieces, and <hi rend="italic">free ascending</hi>
                    motion through the air. In all cases the cause of motion is the same, viz., that
                    large quantities of gaseous matter are formed by the combustion, that these can
                    escape only at certain apertures, and that a backward pressure is necessarily
                    exerted at the point opposite to them. When a large gun is discharged, it
                    recoils a few feet. Movable fireworks may be regarded as very light guns loaded
                    with heavy charges; and in them the recoil is therefore so much greater as to be
                    the most noticeable feature of the discharge; and it only requires proper
                    contrivances to make the piece fly through the air like a sky-rocket or revolve
                    round a central axis like a Catherine wheel. Beauty of motion is hardly less
                    important in pyrotechny than brilliancy of fire and variety of colour.</p>
                <p>The following is a brief description of some of the forms of firework most
                    employed <hi rend="italic">Fixed Fires.—Theatre fires</hi> consist of a slow
                    composition which may be heaped in a conical pile on a tile or a flagstone and
                    lit at the apex. They require no cases. Usually the fire is coloured,— green,
                    red, or blue; and beautiful effects are obtained by illuminating buildings with
                    it. It is also used on the stage; but, in that <pb break="no"
                        facs="ia:encyclopediabrit20newyrich/page/n149/mode/1up"
                        xml:id="kp-eb0920-0149-0136"/> case, the composition must be such as to give
                    no suffocating or poisonous fumes. <hi rend="italic">Bengal lights</hi> are very
                    similar, but are piled in saucers, covered with gummed paper, and lit by means
                    of pieces of match. <hi rend="italic">Marroons</hi> are small boxes wrapped
                    round several times with lind cord and filled with a strong composition which
                    explodes with a loud report. They are generally used in <hi rend="italic"
                        >batteries,</hi> or in combination with some other form of firework. <hi
                        rend="italic">Squibs</hi> are straight cylindrical cases about 6 inches
                    long, firmly closed at one end, tightly Picked with a strong composition, and
                    capped with touch-paper.</p>
                <p>sually a little bursting-powder is put in before the ordinary composition, so
                    that the fire is finished by an explosion. The character of the fire is, of
                    course, susceptible of great variation in colour, &amp;c. <hi rend="italic"
                        >Crackers</hi> are characterized by the cases being doubled backwards and
                    forwards several times, the folds being pressed close and secured by twine. One
                    end is primed; and when this is lit the cracker burns with a hissing noise, and
                    a loud report occurs every time the fire reaches a bend. If the cracker is
                    placed on the ground, it will give a jump at each report; so that it cannot
                    quite fairly be classed among the fixed fireworks. <hi rend="italic">Roman
                        candles</hi> are straight cylindrical cases filled with layers of
                    composition and <hi rend="italic">stars</hi> alternately. These stars are simply
                    balls of some special composition, usually containing metallic filings, made up
                    with gum and spirits of wine, cut to the required size and shape, dusted with
                    gunpowder, and dried. They are discharged like blazing bullets several feet into
                    the air, and produce a beautiful effect, which may be enhanced by packing stars
                    of differently coloured fire in one case. <hi rend="italic">Gerbes</hi> are
                    choked cases, not unlike Roman candles, but often of much larger size. Their
                    fire spreads like a sheaf of wheat. They may be packed with variously coloured
                    stars, which will rise 30 feet or more. <hi rend="italic">Lances</hi> are small
                    straight cases charged with compositions like those used for making stars. They
                    are mostly used in complex devices, for which purpose they are fixed with wires
                    on suitable wooden frames. They are connected by <hi rend="italic">leaders,
                        i.e,,</hi> by quick-match enclosed in paper tubes, so that they can be
                    regulated to take fire all at the same time, singly, or in detachments, as may
                    be desired. The devices constructed in this way are often of an extremely
                    elaborate character; and they include all the varieties of <hi rend="italic"
                        >lettered designs,</hi> of <hi rend="italic">fixed suns, fountains,
                        palm-trees, waterfalls, mosaic work, Highland tartan,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Rotating Fireworks.—Pin</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Catherine
                        wheels</hi> are long paper cases filled with a composition by means of a
                    funnel and packingwire and afterwards wound round a disk of wood. This is fixed
                    by a pin, sometimes vertically and sometimes horizontally; and the outer primed
                    end of the spiral is lit. As the fire escapes the recoil causes the wheel to
                    revolve in an opposite direction and often with considerable velocity. <hi
                        rend="italic">Pastiles</hi> are very similar in principle and construction.
                    Instead of the case being wound in a spiral and made to revolve round its own
                    centre point, it may be used as the engine to drive a wheel or other form of
                    framework round in a circle. Many varied effects are thus produced, of which the
                        <hi rend="italic">firewheel</hi> is the simplest. Straight cases, filled
                    with some fire-composition, are attached to the end of the spokes of a wheel or
                    other mechanism capable of being rotated. They are all pointed in the same
                    direction at an angle to the spokes, and they are connected together by leaders,
                    so that each, as it burns out, fires the one next it. The pieces may be so
                    chosen that brilliant effects of changing colour are produced; or various
                    fire-wheels of different colours may be combined, revolving in different planes
                    and different directions —some fast and some slowly. <hi rend="italic">Bisecting
                        wheels, plural wheels, caprice wheels, spiral wheels,</hi> are all more or
                    less complicated forms; and it is possible to produce, by mechanism of this
                    nature, a model in fire of the solar system.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Ascending Fireworks.—Tourbillions</hi> are fireworks so
                    constructed as to ascend in the air and rotate at the same time, forming
                    beautiful spiral curves of fire. The straight cylindrical case is closed at the
                    centre and at the two ends with plugs of plaster of Paris, the composition
                    occupying the intermediate parts. The fire finds vent by six holes pierced in
                    the case. Two of these are placed close to the ends, but at opposite sides, so
                    that one end discharges to the right and the other to the left; and it is this
                    which imparts the rotatory motion. The other holes are placed along the middle
                    line of ιvhat is the under-surface of the case when it is laid horizontally on
                    the ground; and these, discharging downwards, impart an upward motion to the
                    whole. A cross piece of wood balances the tourbillion; and the quick-match and
                    touch-paper are so arranged that combustion begins at the two ends
                    simultaneously and does not reach the holes of ascension till after the rotation
                    is fairly begun. The <hi rend="italic">sky-rocket</hi> is generally considered
                    the most beautiful of all fireworks; and it certainly is the one that requires
                    most skill and science in its construction. It consists essentially of two
                    parts,—the body and the head. The body is a straight cylinder of strong pasted
                    paper and is choked at the lower end, so as to present only a narrow opening for
                    the escape of the fire. The composition does not fill up the case entirely, for
                    a central hollow conical bore extends from the choked mouth up the body for
                    three quarters of its length. This is an essential feature of the rocket. It
                    allows of nearly the whole composition being fired at once; the result of which
                    is that an enormous quantity of heated gases collects in the hollow bore and the
                    gases, forcing their way downwards through the narrow opening, urge the rocket
                    up through the air. The top of the case is closed by a plaster-of-Paris plug. A
                    hole passes through this and is filled with a fuse, which serves to communicate
                    the fire to the head after the body is burned out. This head, which is made
                    separately and fastened on after the body is packed, consists of a short
                    cylindrical paper chamber with a conical top. It serves the double purpose of
                    cutting a way through the air and of holding the <hi rend="italic"
                        >garniture</hi> of stars, sparks, crackers, serpents, gold and silver rain,
                    &amp;c., which are scattered by bursting fire as soon as the rocket reaches the
                    highest point of its path. A great variety of beautiful effects may be obtained
                    by the exercise of ingenuity in the choice and construction of this garniture.
                    Many of the best results have been obtained by unpublished methods which must be
                    regarded as the secrets of the trade. The <hi rend="italic">stick</hi> of the
                    sky-rocket serves the purpose of guiding and balancing it in its flight; and its
                    size must be accurately adapted to the dimensions of the case. In <hi
                        rend="italic">winged</hi> rockets the stick is replaced by cardboard wings,
                    which act like the feathers of an arrow. A <hi rend="italic">girandole</hi> is
                    the simultaneous discharge of a large number of rockets (often from one hundred
                    to two hundred), which either spread like a peacock’s tail or pierce the sky in
                    all directions with rushing lines of fire. This is usually the final feat of a
                    great pyrotechnic display.</p>
