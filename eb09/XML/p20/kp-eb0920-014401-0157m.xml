                    these two species being found on the continent of India and in Ceylon, the
                    latter in the large islands of the Archipelago and in the Malayan Peninsula. In
                    Australasia and New Guinea similar snakes occur, but they are of much smaller
                    size and differ in essential structural characters from the rock-snakes. These
                    latter are among the largest of living reptiles; although their dimensions and
                    strength have been much exaggerated, specimens of 18 and 20 feet have been
                    brought to Europe, and reliable statements of the occurrence of individuals
                    which measured 30 feet are on record. Snakes of this size will easily overpower
                    and kill one of the small species of deer or antelopes which abound in their
                    native haunts, a sheep, or a good-sized dog; but the width of their mouth would
                    not permit them to swallow an animal larger than a half-grown sheep. The way in
                    which they seize and kill their prey does not differ from that observed in
                    numerous other non-venomous snakes: after having seized their victim, they
                    smother it by constriction, throwing several coils of the body over and round
                    it. In swallowing they always commence with the head; and, as they prey
                    exclusively on mammals and birds, the hairs and feathers offer a considerable
                    impediment to the passage through the narrow but distensible throat. The process
                    of deglutition is therefore slow, although facilitated by the great quantity of
                    saliva discharged over the body of the victim. During the time of digestion the
                    snake is very lazy, and unwilling to move and to defend itself when attacked. At
                    other times these animals are fierce enough, although always harmless to man if
                    left unmolested. In captivity they seem to become used to those who attend upon
                    them, but their apparent tameness is due rather to the depressing influence of a
                    colder climate than to a change of their naturally excitable temper. Rock-snakes
                    are mostly arboreal, and prefer localities in the vicinity of water to which
                    animals resort for the purpose of drinking. They move, climb, and swim with
                    equal facility. It has now been well established by observations on specimens in
                    a state of nature as well as in captivity that the female rock-snake incubates
                    her eggs for about two months, at the end of which period the young are hatched,
                    and probably remain under the protection of the mother for a few weeks longer.
                    The snake collects the eggs into a conical heap, round which she coils herself,
                    entirely covering them so that her head rests in the centre on the top of the
                    cone. In this position the animal remains without food throughout the whole
                    period of incubation, and an increase of the temperature between the coils of
                    the snake has been observed in every case.</p>
