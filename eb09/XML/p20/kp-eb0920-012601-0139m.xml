                    formed in 1790, two-thirds of it from Béarn and the rest from three districts of
                    Gascony—Navarre, Soule, and Labourd —which together constitute the Basque region
                    of France. The department lies between 42° 46' and 43° 36' N. lat. and between
                    0° 6' E. and 1° 47' W. long., and is bounded on the N. by Landes and Gers, on
                    the E. by Hautes-Pyrénées (which has two enclaves, forming five communes, within
                    this department), on the S. by Spain, and on the W.' by the ocean. The name is
                    due to the fact that the peaks of the Pyrenees on its southern frontier are
                    lower than in the neighbouring department. Their height increases gradually from
                    west to east. The peak of the Rhune, to the south of St Jean de Luz, rises only
                    to 2950 feet; and on the border of the Basque country, which occupies the
                    western half of the department, the mean height of the summits is not much
                    greater. The peak of Orhy alone, in the south of the valley of Mauléon, reaches
                    6618 feet. But beyond that of Anie (8215 feet), on the meridian of Orthez, which
                    marks the boundary of Béarn, much loftier elevations appear,—Mourrons (9760
                    feet), on the border of Hautes-Pyrénées, and the southern peak of Ossau (9465
                    feet). The frontier between France and Spain follows the crest-line of the main
                    range, except in a few cases mentioned below. The general direction of the
                    rivers of the department is towards the north-west, through a hilly country for
                    the most part wooded or vine-clad, except on the higher slopes, which are
                    grassy. The northern half of the department is covered with bracken or heath,
                    indicating the proximity of the “landes.” The streams almost all meet in the
                    Adour through the Gave de Pau, the Bidouze, and the Nive. In the north-east the
                    two Luys flow directly to the Adour, which they join in Landes. In the
                    south-west the Nivelle and the Bidassoa flow directly into the sea. The lower
                    course of the Adour forms the boundary between Basses-Pyrénées and Landes; it
                    enters the sea a short distance below Bayonne over a shifting bar, which has
                    often altered the position of its mouth. The Gave de Pau, a larger stream than
                    the Adour, passes Pau and Orthez, but its current is so swift that it is only
                    navigable for a few miles above its junction with the Adour. On the left it
                    receives the Gave d’Oloron, formed by the Gave d’Ossau, descending from the Pic
                    du Midi, and the Gave d’Aspe, which rises in Spain. The second important
                    affluent of the Gave de Pau, the Saison or Gave de Mauléon, descends from the
                    Pic d’Orhy. From the Pic des Escaliers, which rises above the forest of Iraty,
                    the Bidouze descends northwards; while the forest, though situated on the
                    southern slope of the chain, forms a part of French territory. The Nive, a
                    pretty river of the Basque country, takes its rise in Spain; after flowing past
                    St Jean Pied de Port, it joins the Adour at Bayonne. The Nivelle also belongs
                    only partly to France and ends its course at St Jean de Luz. The Bidassoa, which
                    is only important as forming part of the frontier, contains the île des Faisans,
                    where the treaty of the Pyrenees was concluded (1659), and debouches between
                    Hendaye (France) and Fontarabia (Spain).</p>
                <p>The climate of the department is essentially that of the Gironde in the
                    valleys,—mild and damp. The spring is rainy; the best seasons are summer and
                    autumn, the heat of summer being moderated by the sea. The winters are mild. The
                    very calm air of Pau (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Pau)</hi> agrees with invalids
                    and delicate constitutions. St Jean de Luz and Biarritz are much frequented by
                    winter visitors.</p>
                <p>The department is mainly agricultural, 287,719 of its inhabitants being dependent
                    on this industry (Reclus). In 1881, of a total area of 1,883,667 acres 129,132
                    were under wheat and produced 217,412 quarters; the other figures were—barley,
                    4188 acres, 7137 quarters; buckwheat, 455 acres, 761 quarters; oats, 12,800
                    acres, 22,327 quarters; maize, 161,736 acres, 354,055 quarters; meslin, 2600
                    acres, 3987; rye, 2308 acres, 3536; flax, 13,399 acres, 9348 quarters; potatoes,
                    7067 acres, 158,592 bushels; vineyards, 63,511 acres, 4,019,466 gallons of wine
                    (the most highly esteemed vintage being that of Jurançon). From 25,205 acres
                    were produced 642,760 bushels of dried vegetables, and 18,781 acres of chestnut
                    trees yielded 314,480 bushels of chestnuts. There are 163,613 acres of pastures
                    and grazing - lands, 132,342 of permanent meadows and orchards, 28,595 under
                    green crops, and 612,000 acres of waste lands. The live stock numbered 27,845
                    horses, 9110 mules, 15,409 asses, 139,818 horned cattle, 434,130 sheep (giving
                    300 tons of wool, worth £18,000), 78,310 pigs, 150,608 goats, and there were
                    16,000 hives of bees (producing 63 tons of honey and 16 of wax). One-half of the
                    386,000 acres of forest belongs to private persons, the other almost wholly to
                    the communes or the department, scarcely any woods belonging to the Government.
                    Forest management receives careful attention. The number of inhabitants employed
                    in manufactures was 67,455. There are mines of anthracite, copper, iron, lead,
                    zinc, silver, and kaolin in small quantity. The salt produced amounted to 9663
                    tons and is used partly for the famous Bayonne hams (so called, but really
                    prepared in the neighbourhood of Orthez). The department has valuable mineral
                    springs.</p>

                <p>The Eaux-Bonnes, hot and cold, containing sodium and sulphur, are employed
                    especially for disorders of the chest and respiratory organs. The Eaux-Chaudes,
                    of like composition, are efficacious in catarrh, rheumatism, and skin diseases.
                    Those of Cambo on the Nιve, some hot and sulphurous, some chalybeate and cold,
                    are much frequented by the Basques on the eve of St John. The waters of St
                    Christau, near Oloron, containing copper, are efficacious in skin diseases. The
                    manufactures of the department include woollen caps and sashes, the fez worn by
                    the people of the district, nets, Béarn linen, cord slippers, chocolate, and
                    there are also tanneries and flour-mills. The only shipping port is Bayonne,
                    which town is also the.meeting-place of the roads to St Sebastian and Pamplona
                    in Spain. Within the department there are 258 miles of Government roads and 7460
                    of departmental or parish roads. There are also 142 miles of railroad,
                    connecting Bayonne with Toulouse, Dax with Puyoo (for Pau), Bayonne with
                    Biarritz, Puyoo with St Palais, and Pau with Laruns (Eaux-Bonnes). The
                    population in 1881 was 434,366 (57 per square kilomètre), almost entirely
                    Catholic. There are five arrondissements—Pau, Bayonne, Oloron, Orthez
                    (population of town, 4657), and Mauléon (2038), divided into 40 cantons and 558
                    communes. Basses - Pyrénées constitutes the diocese of Bayonne, and is attached
                    to the superior court of Pau and belongs to the district of the 18th Army Corps
                    (Bordeaux).</p>
                <p>2. <hi rend="smallcaps">Hautes-Pyrénées,</hi> a department of southern France, on
                    the Spanish frontier, was formed in 1790, half of it being taken from Bigorre
                    and the remainder from Armagnac, Nébouzan, Astarac,and Quatre Vallées, districts
                    which all belonged to the province of Gascony. It lies between 42° 40' and 43°
                    37' N. lat. and between 19' W. and 39' E. long., and is bounded on the S. by
                    Spain, on the W. by Basses-Pyrénées, on the N.W. by Landes, on the N.E. by Gers,
                    and on the E. by Haute-Garonne. Except on the south its boundaries are
                    conventional. Some of the Pyrenean peaks in this department reach or exceed the
                    height of 10,000 feet, the Vignemale (10,820 feet) being the highest in French
                    territory. The imposing corries, with their glaciers and waterfalls, and the
                    pleasant valleys attract a large number of tourists, the most noted point being
                    the famous Gavarnie. The northern portion of the department consists of plains,
                    or rather fertile valleys, clothed with corn-fields, vineyards, and meadows. To
                    the north-east, however, the cold and wind-swept plateau of Lannemezan (about
                    2000 feet), the watershed of the streams that come down on the French side of
                    the Pyrenees, presents in its bleakness and barrenness a striking contrast to
                    the plain that lies below. The department is drained by three principal streams,
                    the Gave de Pau, the Adour, and the Neste, an affluent of the Garonne. The
                    sources of the first and third lie close together in the Cirque of Gavarnie and
                    on the slopes of Troumouse, whence they flow respectively to the north-west and
                    northeast. An important spur of the Pyrenees, which carries the Pic de
                    Néouvielle and the Pic du Midi de Bigorre, projects to the northward between
                    these two valleys. From the Pic du Midi the Adour descends, which, after
                    watering the pleasant valley of Campan, leaves the mountains at Bagnères and
                    then divides into a multitude of channels, which irrigate the rich plain of
                    Tarbes. Beyond Hautes-Pyrénées it receives on the right the Arros, which flows
                    through the department from south to north-north-west; on the left it receives
                    the Gave de Pau. This latter stream, rising in Gavarnie, is joined at Luz by the
                    Gave de Bastan from Néouvielle, and at Pierrefitte by the Gave de Cauterets, fed
                    by streams from the Vignemale. The Gave de Pau, after passing Argelès and the
                    grotto of Lourdes on its left and the chateau of Lourdes on its right, leaves
                    the mountains and turns sharply from north to north-north-west; it has a greater
                    volume of water than the Adour, but, being more of a mountain torrent, is
                    regarded as a tributary of the Adour, which is navigable in the latter part of
                    its course. The Neste d’Aure, descending from the peaks of Néouvielle and
                    Troumouse, receives the Neste de Louron from the pass of Clarabide at</p>
                <p>Arreau and flows northwards through a beautiful valley as far as Labarthe, where
                    it turns to the north-east; it is important as furnishing the plateau of
                    Lannemezan with a feeding canal, the waters of which are partly used for
                    irrigation and partly for supplying the streams that rise there and are dried up
                    in summer,—the Gers and the Balse, affluents of the Garonne. This latter only
                    touches the department. The climate of Hautes-Pyrénées, though very cold on the
                    highlands, is warm and moist in the plains, where there are hot summers, fine
                    autumns, mild winters, and rainy springs. The mean annual temperature is 68°
                    Fahr. On the plateau of Lannemezan, while the summers are dry and scorching, the
                    winters are very severe. A meteorological observatory has been built on the Pic
                    du Midi.</p>
                <p>Of the total area of 1,119,292 acres 259,334 are arable, 214,782 under wood,
                    160,624 pastures and grazing-lands, 76,015 permanent meadows and orchards, and
                    39,135 vineyards. The mountain slopes are covered with pasture to a height of
                    more than 6600 feet. In 1881 the live stock included 114,900 horned cattle (the
                    milch cows of Lourdes and the oxen of Tarbes being the most esteemed), 18,000
                    horses (mostly of the Tarbes breed crossed with Arab blood), 11,830 asses, 3200
                    mules (part of which are bred for Spain), 222,300 sheep, 74,800 pigs, and 8718
                    goats. The more important cereals are successively, as the elevation increases,
                    maize, wheat, and rye; in the mountain districts oats, barley, and buckwheat are
                    grown. In 1882 the harvest yielded 158,620 quarters of wheat, 197,931 of maize,
                    70,690 of rye, 47,586 of oats, 15,069 of barley, 27,586 of buckwheat, 61,241 of
                    meslin, and 1,793,104 bushels of potatoes. The formerly extensive forests have
                    suffered considerably from the weather and other causes. Vines, trained upon
                    trees as in Italy, yield on an average 2,464,000 gallons of wine annually. On
                    the lower slopes chestnut trees and fruit trees take the place of the vines.
                    There are various quarries of fine marbles, which are sawn and worked at
                    Bagnères, and numerous slate quarries. The mines of iron, nickel, lead, cobalt,
                    manganese, and zinc are worked only irregularly. There is no coal, but a few
                    hundred tons of peat are annually extracted. The mineral waters of
                    Hautes-Pyrénées are numerous and much resorted to. The principal in the valley
                    of the Gave de Pau are Cauterets (twenty-four hot springs containing sulphur and
                    sodium), St Sauveur (two springs with sulphur and sodium), and Baréges (twelve
                    hot springs with sulphur and sodium), and in the valley of the Adour Bagnères
                    (fifty-two hot or cold springs containing calcium sulphates, iron, and arsenic)
                    and Capvern near Lannemezan (two springs containing calcium sulphates). There
                    are 2 paper-mills employing 101 workmen, 28 spinning or weaving factories
                    employing 908 workmen (4000 spindles and 750 looms, of which 220 are
                    power-looms). The light woollen materials known under the name of “baréges” and
                    the knitted work of the department are widely known beyond its limits. A company
                    has been formed for establishing cheese - factories in the mountains, as in
                    Switzerland. There are also saw-mills, flour-mills, tanneries, and at Tarbes
                    very important artillery establishments and a bell-foundry.</p>
                <p>The passes <hi rend="italic">{ports)</hi> into Spain rise more than 6500 feet;
                    none of them are accessible to carriages, and only three—Gavarnie, Our-,
                    dissetou, and Plan—to beasts of burden. Within the department there are 222
                    miles of Government roads, 2837 miles of other roads, and 129 miles of railroad.
                    It is traversed from west to east by the line from Bayonne to Toulouse, which
                    has branches from Lourdes to Pierrefitte for Cauterets, from Tarbes to Bagnères
                    de Bigorre, and from Montrejeau to Bagnères de Luchon. It is crossed also by
                    lines from Tarbes to Bordeaux and from Tarbes to Agen, which separate at Vic de
                    Bigorre. The population in 1881 was 236,474. There are three arrondissements,
                    those of Tarbes (chief town), Argelès (town, 1682 inhabitants), and Bagnères de
                    Bigorre (7634 inhabitants), 26 cantons, 480 communes. Hautes-Pyrénées
                    constitutes the diocese of Tarbes, and is attached to the superior court of Pau
                    and to the 18th Army Corps (Bordeaux).</p>

                    small portions of Languedoc. It lies between 42° 20' and 42° 56' N. lat. and l

                    south-east that of the Albères (from 4000 to 5000 feet), which end in the sea at
                    Cape Cerbera. Deep and sheltered bays in this vicinity are succeeded farther
                    north by flat sandy beaches, along which lie lagoons separated from the sea by
                    belts of sand. The lagoon of St Nazaire is 5400 acres in extent, and that of
                    Leucate on the borders of Aude is 20,000 acres. Mont Canigou (9137 feet), though
                    not the highest mountain in the department, is the most remarkable, since it
                    stands out to almost its full height above the plain, and exhibits with great
                    distinctness the succession of zones of vegetation. From the base to a height of
                    1400 feet are found the orange, the aloe, the oleander, the pomegranate, and the
                    olive; the vine grows to the height of 1800 feet; next come the chestnut (2625
                    feet), the rhododendron (from 4330 to 8330 feet), pine (6400), and birch (6560);
                    while stunted junipers grow quite to the summit. The drainage of the department
                    is shared by the Tet, Tech, and Agly, which flow direct into the Mediterranean.
                    The Aude, the Ariége (an affluent of the Garonne), and the Sègre (an affluent of
                    the Ebro) also take their rise within the department and include a small part of
                    it in their respective basins. The Tet rises 9430 feet above the sea and
                    descends rapidly into a very narrow valley before it debouches at Hie (between
                    Brades and Perpignan) upon a large plain, where it flows over a wide pebbly bed
                    and supplies numerous canals for irrigation. It is nowhere navigable, and its
                    supply of water varies much with the seasons, all the more that it is not fed by
                    any glacier. The Agly, which passes Rivesaltes (famous for its wines), rises in
                    the Corbières, and serves almost exclusively for irrigation, though admitting of
                    navigation in the lower part of its course. The Tech, which after the Tet is the
                    most important river of the department, flows through Vallespir (<hi
                    rend="italic">Vallis aspera),</hi> which, notwithstanding its name, is a green
                    valley, clothed with wood and alive with industry; in its course the river
                    passes Prats de Mollo and Amélie-les-Bains, before reaching Arles and Céret. In
                    the lowlands the climate is entirely that of the Mediterranean, and the
                    productions are the same as those of Corsica or Sicily; Amélie-les-Bains is much
                    frequented on account of its mild climate and sheltered position. The
                    thermometer ranges from 85° to 95° Fahr, in summer, and in winter only
                    occasionally falls as low as 26° or 27°. The average number of rainy days in the
                    year is 70; the mean amount of the rainfall is 27 inches on the coast, but
                    increases towards the hills. The most common wind is the “tramontane” from
                    northnorth-west, as violent as the mistral of Provence and extremely parching.
                    The “marinada” blows from the south-south-east.</p>
                <p>Of a total area of 1,018,632 acres 211,960 are arable, 172,980 under vines,
                    167,740 under wood, 193,367 pasture-land, 27,305 meadow-land, and 148,270 barren
                    moors <hi rend="italic">(garrigues).</hi> In 1881 the live stock numbered 7287
                    horses, 6261 asses, 4373 mules, 17,768 horned cattle, 121,016 sheep (125 tons of
                    wool in 1878), 12,864 goats, 23,838 pigs, and fowls and game in abundance; there
                    were also 6163 beehives, yielding 24 tons of wax and 19 tons of honey known as
                    “miel de Narbonne.” Thirty tons of cocoons (silk) were produced in the same
                    year. The main source of wealth to the department is its wine, of which
                    48,840,000 gallons were produced in 1881; some kinds are strongly alcoholic and
                    others are in request as liqueur wines (Rivesaltes, Banyuls). The harvest of
                    1881 yielded 26,551 quarters of wheat, 3793 of meslin, 37,930 of rye, 6896 of
                    barley, 3448 of buckwheat, 34,480 of oats, 55,172 of maize, 1,655,168 bushels of
                    potatoes, 67,448 of dried vegetables, 22,640 of chestnuts, 110,336 of beetroot,
                    39 tons of hemp, 39 of flax, and 23,000 of olives. Market-gardening (artichoke,
                    asparagus, tomatoes, melons) and fruit culture (peaches, apricots, plums, pears,
                    quinces, pomegranates, almonds, apples, cherries, walnuts, chestnuts) yield
                    abundant returns. The woods produce timber for the cabinetmaker, cork, and bark
                    for tanning. In iron Pyrénées-Orientales is one of the richest departments in
                    France. The greater part of the ore is transported to Aveyron, Gard, or Allier;
                    but 25,000 tons are smelted in blast-furnaces and 1800 in Catalonian forges
                    within the department. In 1881 12,100 tons of pig-iron were produced. The
                    mineral resources of the department also include a bed of bismuth and mines of
                    copper and silver, while both the Tet and the Tech are to some extent
                    auriferous. A small amount of lignite is obtained (1639 tons), and various fine
                    marbles are abundant. Granite, slate, gypsum, and limestone are quarried. The
                    mineral waters are much resorted to. Amélie-les-Bains has twelve hot springs,
                    chalybeate or sulphurous. In the arrondissement of Céret there are also the
                    establishments of La-Preste-Ies-Bains, near Prats de Mollo, with hot sulphurous
                    springs, and of Boulou, the Vichy of the Pyrenees. Near Prades are the hot
                    sulphurous springs of Molitz, and a little north of Mont Canigou are the hot
                    springs of Vernet, containing sodium and sulphur. In the valley of the Tet the
                    sulphuros and alkaline springs of 01ette reach a temperature of 172° Fahr. The
                    baths of Escaldas near Montlouis are hot, sulphurous, and alkaline. There are
                    numerous tanneries, oil-works, distilleries, and saw-mills, and the manufactures
                    of the department include the making of corks, cigarette-paper, barrels, bricks,
                    woollen and other cloths, and “espadrilles” (a kind of shoe made of coarse cloth
                    with esparto soles). The ports of the department are Collioure, Port Vendres,
                    and Banyuls, with 371 vessels and a total tonnage of 3638 in 1882. Port Vendres
                    alone has any importance; in 1882 the ships entered numbered 380 (104,572 tons),
                    those which cleared 368 (95,931 tons). There are 67 miles of railway, consisting
                    of a portion of the line from Narbonne to Barcelona (Spain) by Perpignan, with
                    its branches from Perpignan to Prades; there are 208 mües of Government roads
                    and 2107 miles of other roads. The chief routes across the Pyrenees are from
                    Perpignan and Montlouis to Puycerda (Puigcerda) in the Spanish province of
                    Gerona, through the pass of La Perche, skirting in the French department an
                    enclave of Spanish territory. Three other roads run from Perpignan to Figueiras
                    (Figueras) through the passes of Perthus, Banyuls, and Balistres. In 1881 the
                    population of Pyrénées - Orientales amounted to 208,855, the majority of whom
                    were Catalans in speech and the rest Provençal. The chief towns of the three
                    arrondissements are <hi rend="smallcaps">Perpignan</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >(q∙υ.),</hi> Céret (3104 inhabitants), and Prades (3687); there are 17 cantons
                    and 231 communes. The department constitutes the diocese of Perpignan and is
                    attached to the superior court and army corps of Montpellier. (G. ME. )</p>
