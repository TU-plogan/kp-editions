                    the town, with its kremlin on a hill and several suburbs, occupies the right
                    bank of the river, to which the ruins of its old walls descend; the Zapskovie,
                    consisting of several suburbs, stretches along the same bank of the Velikaya
                    below its confluence with the Pskova; and the Zavelitchie occupies the left bank
                    of the Velikaya,—all three keeping their old historical names. The cathedral in
                    the kremlin has been four times rebuilt since the 12th century and contains some
                    very old shrines, as also the graves of the bishops of Pskoff and of several
                    princes, including those of Dovmont and Vsevolod. The church of Dmitrii
                    Solunskii also dates originally from the 12th century; there are others
                    belonging to the 14th and 15th. The Spaso-Mirojskii monastery, founded in 1156,
                    has many remarkable antiquities. The ruins of numerous rich and populous
                    monasteries in or near the town attest its former wealth and greatness. The
                    present town is ill built, chiefly of wood, and shows traces of decay. Many of
                    the inhabitants live by agriculture or gardening; the remainder are engaged in
                    loading and unloading merchandise on the Velikaya and at the railway station, in
                    combing flax, fishing, and domestic trades. The manufactures are unimportant.
                    Since the completion of the St Petersburg and Warsaw railway the trade of Pskoff
                    has increased. In 1880 the exports reached 99,000 cwts. on the Velikaya and
                    463,000 cwts. by rail; the imports were 125,700 cwts. on the Velikaya and
                    591,600 cwts. by rail. Pskoff has regular steam communication with Dorpat. The
                    population in 1882 was 21,170 (15,086 in 1866).</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">History.—</hi> Pskoff, formerly the sister republic of
                    Novgorod, and one of the oldest cities of Russia, maintained its independence
                    and its free institutions until the 16th century, being thus the last to be
                    brought under the rule of Moscow. Its annals, unquestionably the fullest and
                    liveliest of any in Russia, affirm that it already existed in the time of Rurik;
                    and Nestor mentions under the year 914 that Igor’s wife, Olga, was brought from
                    Pleskoff <hi rend="italic">(i.e.,</hi> Pskoff). It was quite natural that a
                    Russian fortified town should rise at the entrance of the Velikaya valley within
                    the earliest period of the Russian colonization of that region; the river had
                    from a remote antiquity been a channel for the trade of the south with the north
                    Baltic coast. Pskoff being an important strategic point, its possession was
                    obstinately disputed between the Russians and the Germans and Lithuanians, and
                    throughout the 11th and 12th centuries numerous battles were fought. At that
                    time the place had its own independent institutions; but, attacked as it was
                    from the west, it became in the 12th century a “prigorod” of the Novgorod
                    republic,—that is (so far as can be judged from the incomplete testimony of
                    historical documents), a city having its own free institutions, but included in
                    certain respects within the jurisdiction of the metropolis, and compelled in
                    time of war to march against the common enemy. Pskoff had, however, its own
                    prince <hi rend="italic">{defensor</hi><hi rend="italic">municipii)</hi>; and in
                    the second half of the 13th century Prince (Timotheus) Dovmont fortified it so
                    strongly, and was so successful in repelling its enemies, that the town acquired
                    much importance and asserted its independence of Novgorod, with which in 1348 it
                    concluded a treaty wherein the two republics were recognized as equals. The
                    institutions of Pskoff resembled those of Novgorod; it, in its turn, had several
                    prigorods, and its rule extended over the territory which now forms the
                    districts of Pskoff, Ostroff, Opotchka, and Gdoff. Within this territory the
                    “vyetche” or “forum” of Pskoff was sovereign, the vyetches of the subordinate
                    towns being supreme in their own municipal affairs. The city of Pskoff was
                    divided into several sections or “kontsy,” according to the prevalent
                    occupations of the inhabitants, and the kontsy were divided into “ulitsy”
                    (streets), which enjoyed extensive powers of self-government. The vyetche was
                    supreme in all affairs of general interest, as well as a supreme court of
                    justice, and the princes were elected by it; these last had to defend the city
                    and levied the taxes, which were assessed by twelve citizens, who combined to
                    some extent the functions of judges with those of a jury. Pskoff differed
                    widely, however, from Novgorod in the more democratic character of its
                    institutions; and, while the latter constantly showed a tendency to become an
                    oligarchy of the wealthier merchants, the former figured as a republic where the
                    influence of the poorer classes prevailed. Its trading associations, supported
                    by those of the labourers, checked the influence of the wealthier merchants.</p>
                <p>This struggle (of which the annals give a lively picture) continued throughout
                    the 14th and 15th centuries, resulting sometimes in armed riots. Notwithstanding
                    these conflicts Pskoff was a very wealthy city. Its strong walls, whose ruins
                    are still to be seen, its forty-two large and wealthy churches, built during
                    this period, as also its numerous monasteries and its extensive trade, bear
                    testimony to the wealth of the inhabitants, who then numbered about 60,000. The
                    “dyetinets” or fort, enclosed by a stone wall erected by Dovmont, stood on a
                    hill between the Pskova and the Velikaya, having within its walls the cathedral
                    of the Holy Trinity. Another stone wall enclosed the commercial part, the Kromy
                    (kremlin) or middle town. In 1465 the suburb Polonische became so prosperous
                    that it also was enclosed by a wall, and included within the circuit of the town
                    proper. Even the Zapskovie was enclosed by a wooden palisade in the 15th century
                    and later on by a stone wall; while the Zavelitchie was a busy centre of foreign
                    trade. As early as the 13th century Pskoff had become an important station for
                    the trade between Novgorod and Riga. A century later it entered the Hanseatic
                    League. Its merchants and trading associations had factories at Narva, Revel,
                    Riga, and exported flax, corn, tallow, skins, tar, pitch, honey, and timber for
                    shipbuilding, which were transported or shipped <hi rend="italic">via</hi> Lake
                    Peipus, the Narova, and the Embach to the ports on the Baltic and on the Gulf of
                    Finland. Silks, woollen stuffs, and all kinds of manufactured wares were brought
                    back in exchange and sold throughout northern Russia.</p>

                <p>Nevertheless, the continuous struggle between the “black” and “white” people (the
                    patricians and the plebeians) offered many opportunities to Moscoλv for
                    interference in the internal affairs of Pskoff, especially -with regard to the
                    election of the princes, which was often the occasion of severe conflicts. In
                    1399 the prince of Moscow arrogated the privilege of confirming the elected
                    prince of Γskoff in his rights; and though, fifty years later, Pskoff and
                    Novgorod concluded several defensive treaties against Moscow the fall of both
                    republics was inevitable, the poorer classes continuing to seek at Moscow a
                    protection against the oppression of the richer citizens. After the fall of
                    Novgorod (1475) Pskoff could no longer maintain its independence, and in 1510 it
                    was taken by Vasιlii Joannovitch. The vyetche was abolished and its bell taken
                    away, and a waywode was nominated by Moscow to govern the city. Moscow merchants
                    were settled at Pskoff, and put in possession of the fortunes of the forqιer
                    citizens. The conquered territory still maintained to some extént its
                    self-government, especially with re gard to trade, but the struggle between rich
                    and poor was aggravated by the intervention of foreigners. The “lutschiye ludi”
                    (wealthier merchants) prohibited the “malomotchnyie” (poorer merchants) from
                    entering into direct trade relations with foreigners, and compelled them to sell
                    their wares to themselves or to become their agents. These disputes furnished
                    Moscow at the end of the 17th century λvith a pretext for abolishing the last
                    vestiges of self-government at Pskoff, and for placing all affairs of local
                    administration in the hands of the Moscow waywodes. Thenceforward Pskoff fell
                    into rapid decay. It became a stronghold of Russia against Poland and was
                    besieged for seven months by Stephan Bathory during the Livonian War, and later
                    on by Gustavus Adolphus. Under Peteι I. it became a fortified camp, and its
                    walls were protected by earthworks. But it never recovered its former
                    importance, and is now one of the poorer cities of the empire. (P. A. K.)</p>
