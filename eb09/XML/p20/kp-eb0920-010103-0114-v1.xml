                            to these young birds, salted and dried, was applied on account of their

                            feathers, and being covered only with a sort of woolly black plumage. It
                            is right, however, to state that Caius expressly declares <hi

                            naturali voce pupin.” Prof. Skeat states that the word is a diminutive,
                            which favours the view that it was-originally used as a name for these
                            young birds. The parents were probably known by one or other of their

                    estimated annual value. A few years later (1484), either through the birds
                    having grown scarcer or money cheaper, only 50 Puffins are said <hi
                        rend="italic">{op. cit.,</hi> p. 196) to have been demanded. It is stated by
                    both Gesner and Caius that they were allowed to be eaten in Lent. Ligon, who in
                    1673 published a <hi rend="italic">History of the Island of Barbadoes,</hi>
                    speaks (p. 37) of the ill taste of Puffins “which we have from the isles of
                    Scilly,” and adds “this kind of food is only for servants.” Puffins used to
                    resort in vast numbers to certain stations on the coast, and are still plentiful
                    on some, reaching them in spring with remarkable punctuality on a certain day,
                    which naturally varies with the locality, and after passing the summer there,
                    leaving their homes with similar precision. They differ from most other <hi
                        rend="italic">Alcidae</hi> in laying their single egg (which is white with a
                    few grey markings when first produced, but speedily begrimed by the soil) in a
                    shallow burrow, which they either dig for themselves or appropriate from a
                    rabbit, for on most of their haunts rabbits have been introduced. Their plumage
                    is of a glossy black above—the cheeks grey, encircled by a black band—and pure
                    white beneath; their feet are of a bright reddish orange, but the most
                    remarkable feature of these birds, and one that gives them a very comical
                    expression, is their huge bill. This is very deep and laterally flattened, so as
                    indeed to resemble a coulter, as one of the bird’s common names expresses; but
                    moreover it is particoloured—blue, yellow, and red-—curiously grooved and still
                    more curiously embossed in places, that is to say during the breeding-season,
                    when the birds are most frequently seen. But it had long been known to some
                    observers that such Puffins as occasionally occur in winter (most often washed
                    up on the shore and dead) presented a beak very different in shape and size, and
                    to account for the difference was a standing puzzle. Many years ago· Bingley <hi
                        rend="italic">{North Wales,</hi> i. p. 354) stated that Puffins “are said to
                    change their bills annually.” The remark seems <pb break="no"

                    proved to be very near the truth, for after investigations carefully pursued

                    Shearwaters from the Isle of Man, prepared in like manner to young Puffins,
                    thought they were the birds mentioned by Gesner <hi rend="italic">{loc.
