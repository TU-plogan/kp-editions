                    were granted by the crown, at first in virtue of the general prerogative,
                    afterwards under the provisions of numerous statutes, the earliest dating from
                    1427 (6 Hen. VI. c. 5). The powers of the commissioners included the removal of
                    obstructions in rivers, the making of fosses and drains, &amp;c. Their
                    jurisdiction, where still existing, is expressly preserved in the modern Public
                    Health Acts. The indictment for nuisance still lies for many offences which are
                    now punishable in a summary manner under the powers of recent legislation. But
                    for a long time it was the only, not as now a concurrent, remedy. Its obvious
                    defect is that proceedings can only be taken after the mischief has been done.
                    Old examples of nuisances dangerous to health and punishable at common law are
                    the keeping of swine in a town, the dividing of a house in a town so that by
                    reason of overcrowding it would be more dangerous in time of sickness or plague,
                    and the carrying on of offensive trades, such as the melting of tallow. The
                    court leet seems to have had some jurisdiction in sanitary matters, confined to
                    the prevention of nuisances and the determination of the quality of provisions
                    within its local limits. At a comparatively early date statutes were passed
                    dealing with matters for which the common law had provided too cumbrous a remedy
                    The attention of parliament, though but to a slight extent, was directed to the
                    health of London as early as the Statute of the City of London in 1285 (13 Edw.
                    I. st. 5). The earliest legislative enactment affecting the public health
                    generally appears to be 12 Ric. II. c. 13, 1388, forbidding the deposit of
                    offensive matter in rivers and other waters, as well in the city of London as in
                    other cities. Acts of a similar character were from time to time passed to meet
                    particular offences, such as 4 and 5 Hen. VII. c. 3, by which no butcher was to
                    slaughter cattle in London or other walled towns. The plague called forth the
                    Act of 1 Jac. I. c. 31, which made it a capital offence for an infected person
                    to go abroad after being commanded by the proper authority to keep his house.
                    The Act for the rebuilding of London after the great fire, 19 Car. II. c. 3,
                    contained various provisions as to the height of houses, breadth of streets,
                    construction of sewers, and prohibition of noisome trades. In 1832 the fear of
                    cholera led to 2 Will. IV. c. 10, empowering the privy council to take certain
                    preventive measures against the spread of the disease. Numerous local Acts gave
                    the authorities of the more important towns power over the public health. To
                    this day London is governed by separate legislation. The Towns Improvement Act,
                    1847, contained provisions of a sanitary kind for incorporation in local Acts.
                    But it was not until as recently as 1848 that a general Public Health Act,
                    embracing the whole of England (except the metropolis), was passed. The Public
                    Health Act, 1848, created a general board of health as the supreme authority in
                    sanitary matters. The Local Government Act, 1858, amended the Act of 1848,
                    chiefly in the direction of greater local sanitary control. By an Act
                    immediately preceding the Act of 1858 the general board of health was superseded
                    partly by the home office, partly by the privy council. The Local Government
                    Board, the present central authority, was created in 1871 by 34 and 35 Viet, c.
                    70. The president of the Local Government Board is usually a member of the
                    cabinet. Numerous other Acts dealing with public health were passed from 1849 to
                    1874. Finally in 1875 the existing law was digested into the Public Health Act,
                    1875 (38 and 39 Vict. c. 55).<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                <p>The tendency of sanitary legislation has been to place local sanitary regulations
                    in the hands of the local authorities, subject to a general superintendence by a
                    Government department. The Act of 1875, which registers the results of this
                    tendency, is a consolidating not an amending Act, and did not materially alter
                    the law. It is impossible in this place to do more than give a short notice of
                    its comprehensive provisions. For the purposes of the Act England, except the
                    metropolis, is divided into urban and rural sanitary districts, subject
                    respectively to the jurisdiction of urban and rural sanitary authorities. The
                    urban authority is either the corporation of a borough, improvement
                    commissioners, or a local board, according to circumstances. A district becomes
                    subject to a local board at the instance of either the Local Government Board or
                    the owners and ratepayers of the district. The local board is elected by the
                    owners and ratepayers. It must be elected before 15th April in every year. The
                    members hold office for three years, one-third retiring every year. The Oxford
                    local board is governed by regulations peculiar to itself, giving the university
                    a large proportion of members. Rural districts are conterminous with poor-law
                    unions, exclusive of any urban district. The guardians of the poor form the
                    rural authority. There is a port sanitary authority in seaport towns. (See <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Quarantine.)</hi> The jurisdiction of a local authority is both
                    preventive and remedial. The matters falling under this jurisdiction include (1)
                    sewers, with certain exceptions, among which come sewers under the authority of
                    commissioners of sewers, (2) scavenging and cleansing streets, (3) water-supply,
                    (4) cellar-dwellings and lodging-houses, (5) nuisances,<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>The list of nuisances which may be dealt with
                    summarily under the Act is as follows :—“(1) any premises in such a state as to
                    be a nuisance or injurious to health; (2) any pool, ditch, gutter, watercourse,
                    privy, urinal, cesspool, drain, or ashpit so foul or in such a state as to be a
                    nuisance or injurious to health; (3) any animal so kept as to be a nuisance or
                    injurious to health; (4) any accumulation or deposit which is a nuisance or
                    injurious to health; (5) any house or part of a house so overcrowded as to be
                    dangerous or injurious to the health of the inmates, whether or not members of
                    the same family; (6) any factory, workshop, or bakeshop (not already under the
                    operation of any general Act for the regulation of factories or bakehouses) not
                    kept in a cleanly state, or not ventilated in such a manner as to render
                    harmless as far as practicable any gases, vapours, dust, or other impurities
                    generated in the course of the work carried on therein, that are a nuisance or
                    injurious to health, or so overcrowded while work is carried on as to be
                    dangerous or injurious to the health of those employed therein; (7) any
                    fireplace or furnace which does not, as far as practicable, consume the smoke
                    arising from the combustibles used therein, and which is used for working
                    engines by steam, or in any mill, factory, dyehouse, brewery, bakehouse, or
                    gaswork, or in any manufacturing or trade process whatsoever; (8) any chimney
                    (not being the chimney of a private dwelling-house) sending forth black smoke in
                    such quantity as to be a nuisance.’’ In relation to these statutory nuisances it
                    is provided that no penalty is to be inflicted in respect of any accumulation or
                    deposit if it is necessary for business purposes and if effectual means have
                    been taken for preventing injury therefrom to the public health, or in respect

                    and hospitals, (9) prevention of epidemic diseases, (10) mortuaries and (by the
                    Public Health Act, 1879) cemeteries, (11) highways, (12) streets, (13)
                    buildings, (14) lighting, (15) public pleasure-grounds, (16) markets and
                    slaughter-houses, (17) licensing of hackney carriages, horses, and boats. It is
                    to be noticed that jurisdiction in some of these cases is confined to an urban
                    authority. Contracts made by an urban authority, whereof the value or amount
                    exceeds £50, must be in writing, and sealed with the common seal of the
                    authority. Where the contract is of the value or amount of £100 or upwards
                    tenders for its execution must be invited. A local authority has power, subject
                    to the approval of the Local Government Board, to make bye-laws and impose
                    penalties for their breach. The authority must appoint a medical officer and an
                    inspector of nuisances; if an urban authority, it must in addition appoint a
                    surveyor, clerk, and treasurer. Officers may not contract with a local
                    authority. An urban authority has power to levy a general district rate, a
                    private improvement rate (an additional rate levied in return for some special
                    advantage beyond that obtained by the inhabitants in general), and (in certain
                    cases) a highway rate. The expenses of a rural authority are either general or
                    special, the latter being chiefly the expenses arising from sewerage and
                    water-supply. General expenses are defrayed out of a common fund raised out of
                    the poor rate. Special expenses are a charge upon the contributory places
                    benefited. A local authority may, with the sanction of the Local Government
                    Board, raise loans for the purposes of the Act. The loans are charged upon the
                    general district rate. Legal proceedings under the Act are generally summary.
                    Where proceedings are by action, one month’s notice of action must be given
                    where the cause of action is anything done, or intended to be done, or omitted
                    to be done under the provisions of the Act. The action must be brought within
                    six months after the accruing of the cause of action. The local authority and
                    its officers are protected from personal liability for matters done in pursuance
                    of the Act. An appeal from a court of summary jurisdiction lies to quarter
                    sessions. In cases where the local authority decides a question as to liability
                    to expenses, an appeal lies to the Local Government Board. The Local Government
                    Board has power to alter areas and unite districts, to direct inquiries in
                    relation to any matters concerning the public health in any place, to make
                    provisional orders, and to enforce performance of duty by a defaulting local
                    authority.</p>
                <p>In addition to the Public Health Act, 1875, there are various Acts incorporated
                    with that Act under the name of the “Sanitary Acts,” dealing with similar
                    subjects. These are the Bakehouse Regulation Act (1863), the Artisans and
                    Labourers Dwellings Act (1868), the Baths and Washhouses Acts, the Labouring
                    Classes Lodging-House Acts (1851, 1866, 1867). Since 1875 numerous Acts amending
                    and extending the Public Health Act have been passed, dealing with (among other
                    matters) riverpollution, water-supply, hospitals for infectious diseases,
                    nuisance arising from alkali-works, and lodging of fruitpickers. There is
                    besides a mass of legislation which in fact, if not in name, has for its object
                    the sanitary welfare of the people. It is sufficient to mention the Vaccination
                    Acts, the Factory Acts, the Artisans and Labourers Dwellings Acts subsequent to
                    1868, the Merchant Shipping Acts (insuring the carrying of medicines and
                    antiscorbutics on board ships, the provision of sleeping space for seamen, and
                    the inspection of seamen’s lodging-houses), the Adulteration Acts, and the
                    numerous Burial Acts. In many local Acts notification of infectious disease by
                    the medical man in attendance to the local authority is made compulsory, but the
                    legislature has not as yet adopted any general provision of the kind.</p>
                <p>The scientific aspect of public health does not fall within the scope of the
                    present article; it has been treated under the title <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Hygiene.</hi> It is sufficient to say here that the effect of the attention
                    which of late years has been given to the subject is seen in the reduction of
                    the death-rate from 22∙23 per thousand in the years 1841-51 to 21'27 for the
                    years 1871-81.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">London.—</hi> The metropolis is governed, by a series of
                    statutes, some peculiar to itself, others general Acts, repealed as to the rest
                    of England, but specially preserved as to the metropolis by the Public Health
                    Act, 1875. The limits of the metropolis for the purposes of public health depend
                    primarily upon the Metropolis Management Act, 1855 (18 and 19 Vict. c. 120, s.
                    250, schedules A and B). The local authorities are the metropolitan board of
                    works, the vestries and district boards, and (in the city of London) the
                    commissioners of sewers. Asylums and hospitals are administered by the
                    metropolitan asylums board. The water-supply is regulated by the Metropolis
                    Water Acts, 1852 and 1871, gas by the Metropolitan Gas Act, 1860.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Scotland.—</hi> Sanitary legislation occurs as early as the
                    reign of Alexander III. The <hi rend="italic">Statuta Gilde,</hi> c. 19, forbade
                    the deposit of dung or ashes in the street, market, or on the banks of the Tweed
                    at Berwick under a penalty of eight shillings. At a later date the Act of 1540,
                    c. 20, enacted that no flesh was to be slain in Edinburgh on the east side of
                    the Leith Wynd; that of 1621, c. 29, fixed the locality of fleshers and
                    candlemakers. The existing law of public health is contained in the Public
                    Health (Scotland) Act, 1867 (30 and 31 Vict. c. 101). The local authority is the
                    town council, the police commissioners or trustees, or the parochial board,
                    according to circumstances. There is no distinction of urban and rural
                    authority. The central authority is the board of supervision constituted by 8
                    and 9 Vict. c. 83. Proceedings by a local authority in cases of nuisance are by
                    summary petition to a sheriff or a justice (in some cases only to a sheriff)
                    upon requisition in writing under the hands of ten inhabitants. An appeal lies
                    in cases of sufficient value from the sheriff-substitute to the sheriff and from
                    the sheriff to the Court of Session. The list of nuisances in the Act differs,
                    but not materially, from that in the English Act. The powers of local
                    authorities in England and Scotland are very similar. There are no provisions as
                    to contracts by local authorities corresponding to those in the English Act.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Ireland.—</hi> Several Acts of the Irish parliament dealt with
                    specific nuisances, <hi rend="italic">e.g.,</hi> 5 Geo. III. c. 15, forbidding
                    the laying of filth in the streets of cities or county towns, and making
                    regulations as to sweeping and scavenging. There were also numerous private Acts
                    dealing with water-supply and the obstruction of watercourses. In 1878 the
                    existing legislation was consolidated by the Public Health (Ireland) Act, 1878
                    (41 and 42 Vict. c. 52), a close copy of the English Act of 1875. The list of
                    statutory nuisances is the same in both Acts. The urban authority is the
                    corporation, the commissioners, the municipal commissioners, or the town
                    commissioners, according to circumstances. Ireland has its own local government

                    February 1799 officers of the United States are bound to observe the health laws
                    of the States. A national board of health was created by the Act of 3d March
                    1879, c. 202. Its main duties are to give advice to local authorities and to
