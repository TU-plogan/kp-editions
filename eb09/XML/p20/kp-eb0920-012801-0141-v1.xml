                <p><label type="entry">PYRITES</label> (from <hi rend="italic">πvp,</hi> fire), a
                    name applied to the native bisulphide of iron, which occurs as a yellow metallic
                    mineral, sufficiently hard to emit sparks when struck with either flint or
                    steel. Nodules of pyrites are common in the lower beds of Chalk, and fragments
                    of these nodules have occasionally been found on prehistoric sites under
                    circumstances which suggest that the mineral was used as a fire-producing medium
                    at a very early period of human culture. Even in late historic time it was often
                    employed instead of flint, as in some of the old wheel-lock guns, whence it came
                    to be known in France as “pierre d’arquebuse.” It was afterwards found that
                    pyrites might be made available as a source of sulphur, oil of vitriol, and
                    other chemical products; and the mineral thus acquired such importance that in
                    1725 it was made the subject of a special treatise by Dr J. F. Henckel, of
                    Freiberg in Saxony. In 1757 an English translation of this work appeared under
                    the title of <hi rend="italic">Pyritologia; or a History of the Pyrites, the
                        Principal Body in the Mineral Kingdom.</hi></p>
                <p>By modern mineralogists the term “pyrites” has been extended to a number of
                    metallic sulphides, and it is therefore now used rather as a group-name than as
                    the specific designation of a mineral. Hence the typical pyrites is often
                    distinguished as “iron pyrites,” while other members of the group are known as
                    “copper pyrites,” “cobalt pyrites,” “arsenical pyrites,” &amp;c. When, however,
                    the term “pyrites” is used without any qualifying prefix it invariably denotes
                    the original iron pyrites, a mineral which is often known to miners as “mundic,”
                    and to mineralogists as “pyrite,” the final letter of the original word being
                    omitted to bring the spelling into harmony with that of the names of many other
                    minerals.</p>
                <p>Iron pyrites, though containing nearly half its weight of iron, is of no
                    importance as an ore of that metal; but the mineral is extensively worked for
                    the sake of the sulphur which it contains, whence it is sometimes known as
                    “sulphur ore.” Large quantities of this ore have been worked in the vale of
                    Avoca, in county Wicklow, Ireland. But by far the <pb break="no"

                <p>most important variety of the mineral is a “cupreous iron pyrites,” which for
                    many years past has been wrought on an enormous scale in Spain and Portugal.
                    This ore seems to be an intimate mixture of iron pyrites with a small quantity
                    of copper pyrites, the proportion of metallic copper being generally less than 3
                    per cent. Notwithstanding the poorness of the ore, the copper is profitably
                    extracted by wet processes. There is also present a small quantity of silver (20
                    to 35 dwt. per ton), with a trace of gold. The deposits of this cupreous pyrites
                    are of enormous magnitude, and occur at the junction of porphyritic rocks with
                    clay-slate of Devonian age. The principal Spanish mines are those of Rio Tinto,
                    Tharsis, and Calanas in the province of Huelva; whilst the most important of the
                    Portuguese mines is that of San Domingos in the province of Alemtejo. There is
                    ample proof that some of these pyritic deposits were worked by the ancient
                    Romans.</p>
                <p>The quantity of cupreous and other iron pyrites imported into Great Britain
                    during the year 1883—principally from Spain and Portugal, but partly from Norway
                    and elsewhere —was 601,288 tons, of the declared value of £1,356,083. But this
                    quantity had been exceeded in several previous years, notably in 1880 and 1877.
                    The quantity of iron pyrites raised in the United Kingdom in 1883 amounted to
                    27,672 tons, of the value (at the mine) of £17,467.</p>
