                    (1577-1626), compiler of works on travel and discovery, was born at Thaxted,
                    Essex, in 1577. He was educated at St John’s College, Cambridge, where he
                    graduated Μ. A. in 1600, and some time afterwards B.D., with which degree he was
                    also admitted at Oxford in 1615. In 1604 he was presented by James I. to the
                    vicarage of Eastwood, Essex, and in 1615 was collated to the rectory of St
                    Martin’s, Ludgate, London. He was also chaplain to Abbot, archbishop of
                    Canterbury. Some years before his ecclesiastical duties called him to London
                    Purchas had given over the care of his vicarage to his brother, and spent most
                    of his time in the metropolis in the compilation of his geographical works. In
                    1613 he published <hi rend="italic">Purchas, his Pilgrimage or Relations of the
                    World, and the Religions observed in all Ages,</hi> which reached a fourth
                    edition, much enlarged, in 1626; in 1619 <hi rend="italic">Purchas, his Pilgrim
                    or Microcosmus, or the</hi><hi rend="italic">Historie</hi><hi rend="italic">of
                    Man; relating the wanders of his Generation, varieties in his Degeneration, and
                    necessity of his Regeneration</hi>; and in 1625, in four volumes, <hi
                    rend="italic">Purchas, his Pilgrimes; or Relation of the World in Sea Voyages
                    and Lande Travels, by Englishmen and others.</hi> This last work was intended as
                    a continuation of Hakluyt’s <hi rend="italic">Voyages,</hi> and was partly
                    founded on MSS. left him by Hakluyt. The fourth edition of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Pilgrimage</hi> is usually catalogued as vol. v. of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Pilgrimes,</hi> but the two works are quite distinct, and essentially different
                    in character, as is indeed indicated in the names, the difference being thus
                    explained by Purchas himself: in the <hi rend="italic">Pilgrimage</hi> he makes
                    use of his own matter though borrowed, while in the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Pilgrimes</hi> the authors themselves act their own parts in their own words.
                    He was also the author of the <hi rend="italic">King’s Tower and Triumphal Arch
                    of London,</hi> a sermon on 2 Sam. xxii. 51, published in 1623. He died in
                    September 1626, according to some in a debtor’s prison, and although Anthony
                    Wood affirms that he died in his own house there can be no doubt that the
                    publication of his books had involved him in serious money difficulties.</p>
