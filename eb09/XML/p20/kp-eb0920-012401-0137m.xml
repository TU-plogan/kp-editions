                    Creus, or more properly Cape Cerbera, on the Mediterranean to the Bay of Biscay.
                    The length of the range is about 240 miles, the greatest breadth little more
                    than 50 miles (exclusive of the lower parallel ranges on the Spanish side), and
                    the area covered <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit20newyrich/page/n138/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0920-0138-0125"/> by it about 13,000 square miles. For the most
                    part the crest of the main chain constitutes the Franco-Spanish frontier; the
                    principal exception to this rule is formed by the valley of Aran, which,
                    belonging orographically to France but politically to Spain, is closed at the
                    head by a transverse ridge running north and south and connecting the eastern
                    and western halves of the chain.</p>
                <p>The whole range is remarkable for its regularity. The main chain is on the whole
                    easy to trace; its continuity is unbroken, and the variations in its height are
                    mostly confined within narrow limits. The same regularity is seen in the
                    arrangement of the valleys. Except that of Aran, all the principal valleys are
                    given off at right angles, or nearly so, like the pinnae of a fern-frond, on
                    both sides of the chain, and they are again subdivided by similar minor valleys
                    at right angles to them. In all these respects the Pyrenees contrast in a very
                    marked manner with the Alps. They have none of the great longitudinal valleys so
                    characteristic of the latter range, none of the great lakes by which such
                    valleys are occupied, and but few passes like those which are found in plenty
                    leading across the great chains of the Alps at a level much below that of the
                    adjoining peaks. In this last particular, indeed, the Pyrenees are conspicuously
                    deficient. Between the two extremities of the range, where the principal
                    highroads and the only railways run between France and Spain, there are only two
                    passes practicable for carriages,— the Col de la Perche between the valley of
                    the Tet and the valley of the Segre, and the Col de Somport or Port de Canfranc
                    (where it is now proposed to pierce the range by a railway tunnel) on the old
                    Roman road from Saragossa to Oloron.</p>
                <p>This latter pass marks the western extremity of what are known as the Central
                    Pyrenees, which extend eastwards to the valley of Aran and include the highest
                    summits of the whole range—Pic de Néthou or Maladetta (11,165 feet), Posets
                    (11,047 feet), Mont Perdu (10,994 feet, Reclus; other authorities, 11,430 feet).
                    In the Atlantic Pyrenees to the west of that pass the average height gradually
                    but steadily diminishes till we come to the Mediterranean, while in the Eastern
                    Pyrenees, with the exception of one break at the eastern extremity of the
                    Pyrénées Ariégeoises, the mean elevation is maintained with remarkable
                    uniformity, till at last a rather sudden decline occurs in the portion of the
                    chain known as the Albères.</p>
                <p>Narrow as the range is, the inclination of a straight line drawn from the base to
                    the crest on the French side is not more than 3°, or a rise of about 6 in 100.
                    On the Spanish side it is said to be somewhat steeper, but this has not been
                    definitely ascertained. This fact, however, gives no idea of the general
                    character of the Pyrenean slopes. The descent from the crest to the plains is
                    marked by a succession of terraces terminating in abrupt precipices. On the
                    French side a long cliff marks the northern limit of the chain for the greater
                    part of its length, and this feature is particularly well defined in the
                    department of Aude, where a steep precipice marks the division between the true
                    Pyrenees and the Corbières, a minor chain remarkable for the complexity of its
                    geological structure, stretching in that department from south-west to
                    north-east.</p>
                <p>Besides these longitudinal precipices marking the steps in the descent from the
                    summit-line to the plains, the transverse valleys almost everywhere form
                    profound ravines, at the bottom of which brawl the innumerable mountain-torrents
                    (“gaves,” as they are locally called) that form the principal feature in the
                    hydrography of the range. Frequently they form lofty cascades, surpassed in
                    Europe only by those of Scandinavia. The highest is that of Gavarnie at the head
                    of the Gave de Pau, 1515 feet high. The wildness which thus in general marks the
                    scenery of the Pyrenees is even greater on the Spanish than on the French
                    side.</p>
                <p>A peculiar and very striking feature in the Pyrenean valleys is the frequency
                    with which their upper end assumes the form of a semicircle of precipitous
                    cliffs. Such basins are called “cirques,” and the most noted is that at the head
                    of the valley just mentioned, the Cirque de Gavarnie. The origin of this form of
                    valley is still a matter of discussion among geologists. Geologically the
                    Pyrenees consist, like the Alps, of a core of granite overlaid by sedimentary
                    strata of various age down to the Tertiary period. The granite is exposed
                    chiefly in the east and centre, and appears in the west only in comparatively
                    small isolated patches. Above the granitic core Cambro-Silurian rocks are very
                    extensively developed, especially in the west, and it would appear that the
                    first upheaval on the site of the present Pyrenees took place after the
                    deposition of the rocks of this age, since those of the next epochs in
                    geological history, the Old Red Sandstone, the Carboniferous, and probably also
                    the Permian, are almost entirely unrepresented. The Secondary rocks down to the
                    Lower Cretaceous were deposited perfectly conformably upon one another, probably
                    against the slopes of a gentle ridge rising out of the water. Among these,
                    Triassic rocks occupy a considerable area in the west on both slopes of the
                    mountains; those of Jurassic age are likewise found on both slopes, but at
                    different points; while the Lower Cretaceous form an almost continuous band on
                    the north and one quite continuous on the south. After the deposition of the
                    last-mentioned strata a second upheaval took place, and then another period of
                    quiet deposition, during which the Upper Cretaceous and Eocene beds were laid
                    down, was brought to a conclusion by the grand upheaval which elevated the
                    Pyrenees into one of the great mountain-chains of Europe and imparted to them
                    the general outline of their present relief. The last deposits of the Eocene sea
                    in this quarter, represented on the French side by the conglomerates of
                    Palusson, have been raised by this upheaval up the slopes of the mountains, and
                    are succeeded by the Miocene· lacustrine molasse, which lies perfectly
                    horizontally at their base. The next and last upheaval was one that did not
                    affect the Pyrenees separately, but raised the whole area on which they stand,
                    causing the emergence from beneath the sea of the region of the Landes and
                    draining the lake that, washed the foot of the Pyrenees on the east, thus
                    establishing the present land connexion between France and the Iberian
                    Peninsula.</p>
                <p>The later rocks of the Pyrenees are to a large extent limestones, among which are
                    conspicuous the characteristic hippuritic limestone of the southern Chalk and
                    the nummulitic limestone of the southern Eocene. For the most part the highest
                    peaks belong to the granitic core of the mountains. But this is not always the
                    case. In some instances limestone rocks have been carried up to the very crest
                    of the mountains, as in Mont Perdu and in Marboré; the name of the latter,
                    meaning “marble,” indicates the nature of its constituent rock. Such limestone
                    summits have a characteristic square massive form, very different from the sharp
                    peaks of the granite and the schists. As in other limestone regions, caves are
                    numerous in the Pyrenees, and several of these are of great interest to
                    geologists and anthropologists on account of the traces of recent geological
                    changes observable in them, and the remains of early man, both Palaeolithic and
                    Neolithic, which they have yielded.</p>
                <p>The metallic ores of the Pyrenees are not in general of much importance, though
                    there are considerable iron mines at Vic de Sos in Ariége and at the foot of
                    Canigou in Pyrénées Orientales. Coaldeposits capable of being profitably worked
                    are situated chiefly on the Spanish slopes, but the French side has numerous
                    beds of lignite. Mineral springs are abundant and very remarkable, and specially
                    <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit20newyrich/page/n139/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0920-0139-0126"/> noteworthy are the hot springs, in which the
                    Alps, on the contrary, are very deficient. The latter, among which those of
                    Bagnères de Luchon and Eaux-Chaudes may be mentioned, are sulphurous and mostly
                    situated high, near the contact of the granite with the stratified rocks. The
                    lower springs, such as those of Bagnères de Bigorre (Hautes-Pyrénées), Rennes
                    (Aude), and Campagne (Aude), are mostly selenitic and not very warm.</p>
                <p>The amount of the precipitation, including rain and snow, is much greater in the
                    Western than in the Eastern Pyrenees, which leads to a marked contrast between
                    the two halves of the chain in more than one respect. In the first place, the
                    Eastern Pyrenees are without glaciers, the quantity of snow falling there being
                    insufficient to lead to their development. The glaciers are confined to the
                    northern slopes of the Central Pyrenees, and do not descend, like those of the
                    Alps, far down in the valleys, but have their greatest length in the direction
                    of the mountain-chain. They form in fact a narrow zone near the crest of the
                    highest mountains. Here, as in the other great mountain ranges of central
                    Europe, there are evidences of a much wider extension of the glaciers during the
                    Ice age. The case of the glacier in the valley of Argelès in the department of
                    Hautes-Pyrénées is the best-known instance. The snow-line is stated to lie in
                    different parts of the Pyrenees at from 8800 to 9200 feet above sea-level.</p>
                <p>A still more marked effect of the preponderance of rainfall in the western half
                    of the chain is seen in the aspect of the vegetation. The lower mountains in the
                    extreme west are very well wooded, but the extent of forest declines as we go
                    eastwards, and the Eastern Pyrenees are peculiarly wild and naked, all the more
                    since it is in this part of the chain that granitic masses prevail. There is a
                    change, moreover, in the composition of the flora in passing from west to east.
                    In the west the flora, at least in the north, resembles that of central Europe,
                    while in the east, though the difference of latitude is only about 1°, on both
                    sides of the chain from the centre whence the Corbières stretch north-eastwards
                    towards the central plateau of France it is distinctly Mediterranean in
                    character. The Pyrenees are relatively as rich in endemic species as the Alps,
                    and among the most remarkable instances of that endemism is the occurrence of
                    the . sole European species of <hi rend="italic">Dioscorea</hi> (yam), the <hi

                    Catalonia. The genus most abundantly represented in the range is that of the
                    saxifrages, several species of which are here endemic.</p>
                <p>In their fauna also the Pyrenees present some striking instances of endemism.
                    There is a distinct species of ibex <hi rend="italic">{Caprapyrenaica)</hi>
                    confined to the range, while the Pyrenean desman or ivater-mole <hi

                    some of the streams of the northern slopes of these mountains, the only other
                    member of this genus being confined to the rivers of southern Russia. Among the
                    other peculiarities of the Pyrenean fauna are blind insects in the caverns of
                    Ariége, the principal genera of which are <hi rend="italic">Anophthalm,us</hi>
                    and <hi rend="italic">Adelops.</hi></p>
