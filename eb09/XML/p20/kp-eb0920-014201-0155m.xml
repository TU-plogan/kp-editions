                    western regions of Europe, and especially the British Islands. The period at
                    which he lived cannot be accurately determined; but it is certain that he wrote,
                    not only before Eratosthenes, who relied much upon his authority, but before
                    Dicaearchus, who was a pupil of Aristotle, and died about 285 <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> Hence he may probably be regarded as about
                    contemporary with Alexander the Great. His work is now wholly lost, and appears
                    to have been consulted in the original by comparatively few ancient writers,
                    most of the <pb break="no"

                <p>Statements cited from it being confined to detached points, which may easily have
                    been derived at second or even third hand. We are hence left almost wholly in
                    the dark as to the form and character of the work itself, but the various titles
                    under which it is cited by later writers point rather to a geographical
                    treatise, in which he had embodied the results of his observations, than to a
                    continuous narrative of his voyage like that of a modern navigator.</p>
                <p>Some modern writers have supposed Pytheas to have been sent out at the public
                    expense, in command of an expedition organized by the republic of Massilia; but
                    there is no ancient authority for this, and the statement of Polybius, who had
                    unquestionably seen the original work, is express, that he had undertaken the
                    voyage in a private capacity and with limited means. All that we know concerning
                    the voyage of Pytheas (apart from such detached notices as those already
                    referred to) is contained in a brief passage of Polybius, cited by Strabo, in
                    which he tells us that Pytheas, according to his own statement, had not only
                    visited Britain but had personally explored a large part of it, and stated its
                    circumference at more than 40,000 stadia (4000 geographical miles). To this he
                    added the account of Thule (which he placed six days’ voyage to the north of
                    Britain) and the adjoining regions, in which there was no longer any distinction
                    between the air and earth and sea, but a kind of mixture of all three, forming a
                    substance resembling the gelatinous mollusc known as the <hi rend="italic">Pulmo
                    marinus,</hi> which rendered all navigation and progress in any other mode alike
                    impossible. This substance he had himself seen, but the other statements he
                    derived from hearsay. Returning from thence he visited the whole of the coasts
                    of Europe bordering on the ocean as far as the Tanais (Polyb. ap. Strab., ii. p.
                    104). This last sentence has led some modern writers to suppose that he made two
                    different voyages; but this is highly improbable, and the expressions of
                    Polybius certainly imply that his explorations in both directions, first towards
                    the north and afterwards towards the east, formed part of one and the same
                    voyage.</p>
                <p>The circumstance that the countries visited, and to a certain extent explored, by
                    Pytheas were not only previously unknown to the Greeks—except perhaps by vague
                    hearsay accounts received through the Phoenicians—but were not visited by any
                    subsequent authority during a period of more than two centuries led some of the
                    later Greek geographers altogether to disregard his statements, and even to
                    treat the whole story of his voyage as a fiction. Eratosthenes, indeed, who
                    wrote about a century after his time, was disposed to attach great value to his
                    authority, though doubting some of his statements; but Polybius, about half a
                    century later, involved the whole in one sweeping condemnation, treating the
                    work of Pytheas as a mere tissue of fables, like that of Euhemerus concerning
                    Panchaea; and even Strabo, in whose time the western regions of Europe were
                    comparatively well known, adopted to a great extent the same view with
                    Polybius.</p>
                <p>In modern times a more critical examination has arrived at a more favourable
                    judgment, and, though Gossellin in his <hi rend="italic">Recherches sur la
                    Géographie des Anciens</hi> (vol. iv. pp. 168-180) and Sir G. O. Lewis in his
                    <hi rend="italic">History of Ancient Astronomy</hi> (pp. 466-481) revived the
                    sceptical view, the tendency of modern critics has been rather to exaggerate
                    than to depreciate the value of what was really added by Pytheas to geographical
                    knowledge. The fact is that our information concerning him is so imperfect, and
                    the scanty notices preserved to us from his work at once so meagre and
                    discordant, that it is very difficult to arrive at anything like a sound
                    conclusion. It may, however, be considered as fairly established that Pytheas
                    really made a voyage round the western coasts of Europe, proceeding from Gades,
                    the great Phoenician emporium, and probably the farthest point familiar to the
                    Greeks, round Spain and Gaul to the British Islands, and that he followed the
                    eastern coast of Britain for a considerable distance to the north, obtaining
                    information as to its farther extension in that direction which led him greatly
                    to exaggerate its size. At the same time he heard vaguely of the existence of a
                    large island to the north of it—probably derived from the fact of the groups of
                    the Orkneys and Shetlands being really found in that position—to which he gave
                    the name of Thule. No ancient writer (except a late astronomer, who merely
                    refers to it in a passing notice and obviously at second hand) asserts that
                    Pytheas had himself visited Thule; his account of the Sluggish Sea beyond it
                    was, as stated by Polybius himself in the passage already cited, derived merely
                    from hearsay.</p>
                <p>But the most important statement made by Pytheas in regard to this unknown land
                    of Thule, and which has given rise to most controversy in modern times, was that
                    connected with the astronomical phenomena affecting the duration of day and
                    night in these remote arctic regions. Unfortunately the reports transmitted to
                    us at second hand in our existing authorities differ so widely that it is almost
                    impossible to determine what Pytheas himself really stated. It is, however,
                    probable that the version given in one passage by Pliny <hi rend="italic"
                    >(H.N.,</hi> iv. 16, 104) correctly represents his authority. According to this
                    he reported as a fact that at the summer solstice the days were twenty-four
                    hours in length, and conversely at the winter solstice the nights were of equal
                    duration. Of course this would be strictly true had Thule really been situated
                    under the arctic circle, which Pytheas evidently considered it to be, and his
                    skill as an astronomer would thus lead him to accept readily as a fact what he
                    knew (as a voyager proceeded onwards towards the north) must be true at some
                    point. But this statement certainly affords no evidence that he had himself
                    actually visited the mysterious land to which it refers. (See <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Thule.)</hi></p>
                <p>Still more difficult is it to determine the extent and character of Pytheas’s
                    exploration^ towards the east. The statement of Polybius that he proceeded along
                    the whole of the northern coasts of Europe as far as the Tanais is evidently
                    based upon the supposition that this would be a simple and direct course along
                    the coast of Germany and Scythia,—Polybius himself, in common with the other
                    Greek geographers till a much later period, being wholly ignorant of the vast
                    projection of the Cimbric peninsula, and the long circumnavigation that it
                    involved,—of all which no trace is found in the extant notices of Pytheas.
                    Notwithstanding this, some modern writers have supposed him to have entered the
                    Baltic and penetrated as far as the mouth of the Vistula, which he erroneously
                    supposed to be the Tanais. The only foundation for this highly improbable
                    assumption is to be found in the fact that in a passage cited by Pliny <hi
                    rend="italic">(H.N.,</hi> xxxvii. 2, 35) Pytheas is represented as stating that
                    amber was brought from an island called Abalus, distant a day’s voyage from the
                    land of the Guttones, a German nation who dwelt on an estuary of the ocean
                    called Mentonomus, 6000 stadia in extent. It was a production thrown up by the
                    waves of the sea, and was used by the inhabitants to burn instead of wood. It is
                    not improbable that the “estuary” here mentioned really refers to the Baltic,
                    the existence of which as a separate sea was unknown to all ancient geographers;
                    but the obscure manner in which it is indicated, as well as the inaccuracy of
                    the statements concerning the place from whence the amber was actually derived,
                    both point to the sort of hearsay accounts which Pytheas might readily have
                    picked up on the shores of the German Ocean, without proceeding farther than the
                    mouth of the Elbe, which is supposed by Ukert <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit20newyrich/page/n157/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0920-0157-0144"/> to have been the limit of his voyage in this
                    direction. It must be observed also that amber is found on the western coasts of
                    Germany, as well as in the Baltic, though not in equal abundance.</p>
                <p>It is a very singular fact that no mention is found in any ancient writer, in
                    connexion with the voyage of Pytheas, of the Cassiterides or Tin Islands, the
                    exploration of which might naturally have been supposed to have been one of the
                    chief objects of his voyage. It is indeed not impossible that the statements on
                    this subject preserved to us from Timaeus, who wrote less than a century after
                    him, were derived from Pytheas, though there is no proof of this. The trade with
                    those islands was probably at this period exclusively in the hands of the
                    Phoenicians, but we know that at a later time a considerable portion of the
                    supply was carried overland through Gaul to Massilia. Whether the voyage of
                    Pytheas had any effect in contributing to bring about the diversion of this
                    lucrative trade we have unfortunately no information.</p>
                <p>Whatever uncertainty still hangs around all that has been transmitted to us
                    concerning the actual explorations of Pytheas. it is certain that he had one
                    merit which distinguished him from almost all his contemporaries: he was a good
                    astronomer, and was one of the first who made observations for the determination
                    of latitudes, among others that of his native place Massilia, which he fixed
                    with remarkable accuracy, so that his result, which was within a few miles of
                    the truth, was adopted by Ptolemy, and became the basis of his map of the
                    Western Mediterranean. Pytheas was also the first among the Greeks who arrived
                    at any correct notion of the tides, and not only indicated their connexion with
                    the moon but pointed out their periodical fluctuations in accordance with the
                    phases of that luminary. Other observations concerning the manners and customs
                    of the inhabitants of these remote regions are ascribed to him that are
                    undoubtedly correct and tend strongly to prove that he had himself really
                    visited them. Among these are the gradual disappearance of various kinds of
                    grain as one advanced towards the north; the use of fermented liquors made from
                    corn and honey; and the habit of threshing out their corn in large covered
                    barns, instead of on open threshing-floors as in Greece and Italy, on account of
                    the want of sun and abundance of rain.</p>
                <p>The fragments of Pytheas have been collected by Arvedson (Upsala, 1824) and by
                    Fuhr (De <hi rend="italic">Pythea</hi><hi rend="italic">Massiliensi,</hi>
                    Darmstadt, 1835). Of the numerous treatises and dissertations on the subject see
                    for those of earlier date Ukert’s “Bemerkungen über Pytheas” (in vol. i. of his
                    <hi rend="italic">Geog.</hi> d. <hi rend="italic">Griechen</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >u.</hi><hi rend="italic">Körner,</hi> pp. 298-309), which contains an
                    .excellent summary of all that is known concerning the author and his work. The
                    question has been also discussed by Sir G. C. Lewis, in his <hi rend="italic"
                    >Historical Survey of the Astronomy</hi><hi rend="italic">of the Ancients</hi>
                    (pp. 466-480, London, 1862), by Mr Bunbury, in his <hi rend="italic">History of
                    Ancient Geography</hi> (vol. i. chap. xv. sect. 2), and by Mr Elton, in his <hi

                    1882). A very elaborate but prolix and somewhat confused investigation of the
                    whole subject will be found in Müllenhoff’s <hi rend="italic">Deutsche
                    Alterthums-</hi><hi rend="italic">kunde</hi> (vol. i. pp. 211-497, Berlin,
