                    rend="italic">Philosophical Transactions,</hi> Newton gave the results of
                    attempts to estimate the temperature of red-hot iron by noting the time it took
                    to cool to an observed temperature, assuming what has since been called Newton’s
                    Law of Cooling. The numerical results are given in terms of the degrees of a
                    linseed-oil thermometer constructed by Newton. Its zero was the temperature of
                    melting ice and its second fixed point the normal temperature of the human body,
                    denoted by 12°. About the same time Guillaume Amonton in Paris made somewhat
                    similar attempts to determine the temperature of the red-hot end of an iron bar,
                    using for reference a rudimentary air-thermometer—the first of its kind in which
                    the variation of atmospheric pressure was allowed for. Since the middle of the
                    last century the different methods and instruments suggested for measuring high
                    temperatures have been very numerous,—in fact the variation of almost every
                    physical property of substances which alter with change of temperature has been
                    utilized for this purpose. Measurements of the increase of pressure produced in
                    a quantity of gas while its volume remains constant or of the increase of volume
                    at constant pressure,· of the heat given out by a mass of metal in cooling to an
                    observed temperature, of the expansion of a metal or graphite bar or of a mass
                    of clay are those which have been most frequently employed; but, besides these,
                    the change in the electrical resistance of a wire, the saturation-pressure of
                    the steam of various liquids, the pressure of gas dissociated from various
                    solids, the electromotive force of a thermo-electric couple, the density of the
                    vapour of a liquid, the change of shape of a compound spiral of different
                    metals, have been used,— even the alteration in the wave-length of a note of
                    given pitch has been suggested as capable of being made use of for pyrometric
                    purposes. For reasons which will be given below, the numerical results obtained
                    by one or other of the numerous forms of the gas-thermometer have a more
                    definitely intelligible value. The gas-thermometer method and the calorimetric
                    method were both employed by Pouillet for the accurate measurement of high
                    temperatures before 1836.</p>
                <p>§ 2. The indications obtained by any of the numerous methods which have been
                    suggested are, as a rule, expressed in terms of Centigrade or Fahrenheit
                    degrees. This assignment of numbers presupposes not only a definition of
                    temperature by which the size of the degree is determined but also a physical
                    law which gives the relation between the measured interval of temperature and
                    the standard degree. The various definitions of the standard degree that might
                    be employed will be found in the article <hi rend="smallcaps">Heat,</hi> secs.
                    12, 24, 25, 30, 31, 32; and in sec. 35 of the same article the definition of the
                    absolute thermodynamic scale of temperatures is given. In the same article (sec.
                    38) it is shown that the “absolute temperature” of a liquid in thermal
                    equilibrium with its own vapour under a pressure <hi rend="italic">p</hi> may be

                    Sir W. Thomson, in the article mentioned (secs. 39-45), has described
                    arrangements for measuring the pressure of the saturated vapours of various
                    liquids which will give that measurement in a thoroughly satisfactory manner up
                    to, at any rate, some 600° C. For the higher temperatures mercury is the liquid
                    employed. There are, however, some experimental data still wanting before the
                    formula quoted above can be applied to the numerical calculation of the
                    temperature. These are (1) the density <hi rend="italic">p</hi> of the saturated
                    vapour corresponding to the series of pressures, and (2) the corresponding
                    latent heat <hi rend="italic">κ</hi> of vaporization. These constants have not
                    yet been actually observed. Instruments such as those figured in the article
                    cited can, however, be employed with convenience and accuracy as continuous
                    intrinsic thermoscopes, whose indications can supply a numerical measure of
                    temperature after an empirical graduation. When used thus they possess the
                    enormous advantage that the pressure of the saturated vapour at a definite
                    temperature is perfectly definite, so that a single observation of the pressure
                    is all that is necessary to determine the temperature, and the instrument can be
                    easily arranged, so that this observation is practically a very simple one. The
                    pressure of mercury vapour has already been determined by Régnault for
                    temperatures up to 550°. A thermoscopic method of pyrometry which is very
                    similar to the above was suggested by Lamy.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    dissociated from calcium carbonate. There is experimental evidence to show that
                    the pressure of the dissociated gas is definite at a definite temperature. The
                    recombination of the dissociated gas with the solid is, however, a slow process,
                    and the method has been pronounced by Weinhold<note anchored="true"

                    whether it is arranged to show the increase of pressure at constant volume or
                    the increase of volume at constant pressure, give for the temperature numerical
                    results which are practically identical with the corresponding numbers on the
                    absolute scale. It follows, therefore, that any two gas-thermometers, if
                    similarly graduated, would give identical indications for the same temperature,
                    no matter whether or not they are filled with the same kind of gas and whether
                    or not the quantities of the gases are such that the pressure in the two
                    thermometers is the same at any one temperature. This important property of
                    gas-thermometers has been experimentally verified by Régnault<note

                    different gases and at different pressures. For these reasons the readings of a
                    properly arranged gas-thermometer have justly come to be regarded as furnishing
                    the standard of temperature, at any rate outside the limits of the freezing and
                    boiling points, and indeed may now be regarded as the temperature standard for
                    scientific purposes throughout the whole range. The Kew standards are calibrated
                    mercury-in-glass thermometers whose fixed points are repeatedly redetermined.
                    Such instruments will not agree exactly with the gas-thermometer except at the
                    freezing-point and boiling-point. Comparisons have been made between various
                    mercury-thermometers and air-thermometers by Régnault<note anchored="true"

                    by different observers are not entirely concordant; but it is needless here to
                    discuss them, for, whatever may be the divergence between the mercury and air
                    thermometers in the freezingpoint and boiling-point, the method of measuring
                    higher temperatures by continuing the scale of a mercury-thermometer beyond
                    those limits is altogether untrustworthy in consequence of the very wide
                    divergence between different mercury-thermometers at the same temperature,
                    amounting sometimes to 10° or more<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>See <hi rend="smallcaps">Heat,</hi> sec. 26.</p></note> at a
                    temperature of 300°. The air-thermometer readings must therefore be regarded as
                    the standard at any rate for temperatures beyond the boiling-point.</p>
                <p>The general principle employed in the use of the gasthermometer is as follows.

                    to graduate the instrument and the third to measure the temperature. If the
                    thermometer has been filled with gas of a perfectly definite kind— <hi

                    this account, the value of which is derived from independent observations of the

                    employment of this property of gases to measure high temperatures are very
                    numerous. We give details of a few of them.</p>
                <p>(1) <hi rend="italic">The Constant-Pressure Method.—</hi> The following is a very
                    simple and practical plan of employing the method for obtaining a reading of the
                    temperature. A glass or porcelain bulb, provided with a fine neck, is very
                    carefully dried and filled with perfectly dry air; it is then exposed to the
                    source of the heat whose temperature is to be investigated in such a manner that
                    the point of the neck just projects from the furnace. "When the equilibrium of
                    temperature is reached, the neck is hermetically sealed by a blowpipe or
                    oxy-hydrogen flame, and the bulb is withdrawn and allowed to cool, and weighed.
                    The neck is then immersed in water or mercury and the point broken off. In
                    consequence of the previous expansion of the air the pressure in the interior is
                    much less than the atmospheric pressure, and the liquid consequently enters the
                    bulb. When so much has entered that the pressure is the same inside and out (the
                    difficulty of the comparative opacity of the porcelain is not insurmountable),
                    the end is closed by a small piece of wax, and the bulb removed and weighed,
                    with the liquid it contains. The bulb is then completely filled with the liquid,
                    and weighed a third time. The difference between the third and first weighings
                    gives a value <hi rend="italic">υ</hi><hi rend="italic subscript"> t</hi> of
                    formula (2), which only requires correction for the expansion of the envelope,
                    while the difference between the second and first weighings gives a value of the
                    volume from which <hi rend="italic">v</hi><hi rend="italic subscript"> 0</hi>
                    and ι&gt; <hi rend="subscript"> 100</hi> can be calculated, using the known co
                    efficient of expansion of air, and thus all the requisite data for the
                    determination of <hi rend="italic">t</hi> are obtained. This method was used by
                    Régnault<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi
                    rend="italic">Mém.</hi><hi rend="italic">de VInst.,</hi> xxi.</p></note> to
                    determine the coefficient of expansion of air, and has since been described as
                    “a new pyrometer.”</p>
                <p>In the process just described the volume of the residual gas is measured; its
                    pressure, after cooling, may be measured instead, by an arrangement which was
                    suggested by Régnault. The bulb is provided with a long fine neck, to the end of
                    which a tap is fitted and so arranged that it can be easily connected with a
                    manometer. The bulb is exposed to the high temperature, the tap being left open,
                    and when the final temperature is reached the tap is closed and the bulb allowed
                    to cool; it is then connected with the manometer, and, if the tap be a three-way
                    tap, drilled as shown in fig. 1, it is easy to expel all the air from the bulb
                    side of the manometer, between the mercury surface and the tap. The residual
                    pressure is then measured by the manometer. A correction is required for the
                    expansion of the bulb and for the part of the connecting tube not exposed to the
                    high temperature. Instead of measuring the volume of the residual gas in the
                    manner thus described, Deville and Troost<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p><hi rend="italic">Comptes Rendus,</hi> xc. 727,
                    773.</p></note> have pumped the hot air out of the porcelain bulb by means of a
                    Sprengel pump, and measured the volume of air delivered by the pump. On this
                    plan a series of observations can be made at the same temperature, a three-way
                    tube with suitable taps serving to put the bulb alternately in connexion with a
                    vessel to supply dry air and with the pump. Crafts and Meier<note

                    xc. 606.</p></note> have obtained results by sweeping out the air with a current
                    of hydrochloric-acid gas, which was separated from the air it carried by being
                    passed through water.</p>

                    wrought-iron tube of known capacity is permanently fixed in the furnace; it is
                    filled with pure dry hydrogen by passing a current of the gas through it for
                    some time. The current of gas is then stopped, and after the gas has attained
                    the temperature of the furnace it is swept out by a current of <hi rend="italic"

                    increase in weight, and from this observation the density of the hydrogen in the
                    wrought-iron tube is calculated. An arrangement of taps makes the observation a
                    very easy one when the apparatus is once set up. The formula (2) requires in
                    this case to be slightly modified. Thus let <hi rend="italic">d</hi><hi

                <p>(2) The formula shows how the temperature of air in any experiment may be
                    determined when its density at that temperature is observed. It is sometimes
                    more convenient to determine instead the density of some vapour which at
                    ordinary temperatures would be a solid or a liquid, and to deduce from that
                    observation the density of air at the corresponding temperature. Thus, suppose
                    that the density δ&lt; (expressed in grammes per cc.) of the vapour of any given
                    liquid or solid is observed, and that independent observations show that the
                    specific gravity of the vapour, referred to air at the same temperature and
                    pressure, is &lt;r, then we have <hi rend="italic">d</hi><hi rend="italic

                    quantities in equation (3) are obtained. It will be noticed that the value of
                    <hi rend="italic">σ,</hi> the specific gravity of the vapour, is to be derived
                    from independent observations. Apart from direct experimental evidence in any
                    particular case, there is the generally accepted theory, based on the law of
                    Avogadro, that the specific gravity of a gas or vapour referred to hydrogen at
                    the same temperature and pressure is represented by half the number expressing
                    the molecular weight of the substance of which the vapour is composed. For
                    elements, with few exceptions (of which mercury is one), the ratio of the atomic
                    weights gives the specific gravity referred to hydrogen at the same temperature
                    and pressure. At any rate, if there are sufficient data for us to regard <hi
                    rend="italic">σ</hi> as known, we may evidently deduce the value of <hi

                    for the purpose of determining the temperature. The process is as follows. A
                    quantity of mercury is placed in a wrought-iron flask provided with a perforated
                    lid as shown in fig. 2, No. 1. The flask is then exposed to the temperature to
                    be measured, and when thermal equilibrium is attained the small lid is slid
                    along so that the neck is closed. The flask is then taken out and allowed to
                    cool. The mercury is collected and weighed; the volume of the flask is
                    determined and corrected for the expansion of the iron; and these two
                    observations determine the density of mercury (in grammes per cc.) at the
                    temperature in question. The specific gravity<note anchored="true"

                    same temperature and pressure is known to be 6'92. A porcelain flask with a ball
                    stopper, shown in fig. 2, No. 2, may be used instead of the iron flask.</p>

                    Régnault employed mercury. Some iodine was contained in a porcelain flask of
                    about 300 cc. capacity, with a fine neck, which just protruded from the source
                    of heat and was loosely closed by means of a stopper; when the temperature was
                    reached and the iodine completely volatilized, the stopper was fused on to the
                    nozzle by means of an oxy-hydrogen blowpipe. The mass of the iodine remaining in
                    the flask was determined by weighing, after it had cooled; the volume of the
                    flask had been previously determined; thus the density of the iodine vapour
                    could be found. A correction of the volume of the flask was necessary in
                    consequence of the expansion of the Bayeux porcelain of which it was composed.
                    This was obtained from independent observations of the linear elongation of a
                    rod of porcelain for temperatures up to 1500°; their results gave a coefficient
                    of cubical expansion of 0'0000108 between 0° and the boiling-point of cadmium
                    (856°), 0'0000108 between 0° and thθ melting-point of silver (1000°), from
                    0Ό00016 to 0Ό00017 between 1000° and 1400°, reaching Ό00020 towards 1500°. The
                    specific gravity of iodine vapour was taken to be 8716, referred to air at the
                    same temperature and pressure; this assumption was justified by additional
                    observations with air and by using the number in a determination of the density
                    of steam at the boiling-point of mercury.</p>

                    the barometric height is dispensed with. Various other suggestions have been
                    made for securing the same object.</p>
                <p>The most convenient form of the instrument for general use is Jolly’s (described
                    in PoggendorfFs <hi rend="italic">Jubelband,</hi> p. 82,1874), and represented
                    in fig. 3. The two vertical tubes of the manometer are connected by an
                    india-rubber tube properly strengthened by a cotton covering, and they can be
                    made to slide vertically up and down a wooden pillar which supports them; they
                    are provided with clamps for fixing them in any position and a tangent screw for
                    fine adjustment. The connexion between the bulb and the manometer is made by
                    means of the convenient three-way tap described above. The scale of the
                    instrument is engraved on the back of a strip of plane mirror before silvering,
                    and the divisions are carried sufficiently far across the scale for the
                    reflexions of the two surfaces of the mercury to be visible behind the scale.
                    Parallax can thus be avoided and an accurate reading obtained without the
                    necessity of using a kathetometer. In order to allow for the expansion of the
                    glass of the reservoir a weight-thermometer bulb is supplied with the
                    instrument, made from another specimen of the same kind of glass, and the
                    relative expansion of the mercury and the glass can thus be determined by the
                    observer himself. The volume of the air-bulb and that of the capillary tube and

                    terminates in an open vessel of mercury, and thus the pressure of the gas can be

                <p>§ 4. The results obtained by any of the air-pyrometric methods just described may
                    be employed to express directly the temperature of the pyrometer in numbers
                    agreeing closely with the thermodynamic scale. The other instruments to which we
                    now turn our attention can only be regarded as intrinsic thermoscopes, which, in
                    order to give intelligible numerical results, must be graduated by direct
                    comparison with an air-thermometer. Some of them may indeed be used by
                    extrapolation to give a numerical measure of temperatures outside the practical
                    range of the air-thermometer, employing for that purpose a formula verified for
                    temperatures within the range. A case in point is the determination of the
                    temperature of fusion of platinum by the calorimetric method described below.
                    These intrinsic thermoscopes are frequently much more convenient in practice
                    than any of the modifications of the air-pyrometer.</p>

                    He formed a series of definite percentage alloys of silver and gold and of gold
                    and platinum. The melting-points of these alloys give a series of fixed
                    temperatures lying between the melting-points of silver and gold and of gold and
                    platinum respectively. An observation is taken by exposing in the furnace, upon
                    a small cupel, a set of small flattened specimens of the alloys, not necessarily
                    larger than pin heads, and noticing which of them are fused.</p>

                    alloys which make it unadvisable to use the same specimen more than once. A

                    hoops or gallipots of clay—indicated the temperature by their tint much in the

                <p>§ 6. <hi rend="italic">The Calorimetric Method.—</hi> This is a very convenient
                    method and is often practically employed for measuring the temperature of
                    furnaces. The observation consists in determining the amount of heat given out
                    by a mass of platinum, copper, or wrought-iron on cooling in water from the high
                    temperature. The theory is simple. Let <hi rend="italic">m</hi> be the capacity
                    for heat of the calorimeter and of the water contained in it, <hi rend="italic"
                    >Μ</hi> the mass of metal, <hi rend="italic">T</hi> the temperature required,
                    <hi rend="italic">t</hi> the initial temperature of the water in the
                    calorimeter, <hi rend="italic">θ</hi> the final temperature of the water after
                    the introduction of the metal, and <hi rend="italic">κ</hi> the <hi

                    between the temperatures occurring in the experiment, must be determined by

                <p>There are two obvious sources of error of considerable amount in the use of the
                    calorimeter for pyrometrical purposes, viz., (1) the liability of the metal to
                    lose heat during its passage from the furnace to the calorimeter, and (2) the
                    evaporation of water from the calorimeter. With the small mass of platinum
                    generally used, the former source of error is likely to be very important, for
                    the temperature of a mass of 50 grammes of mercury at 100° C. may fall a full
                    degree in being carried to a calorimeter 3 feet away. It does not appear that
                    any estimates of the amount of loss which may be so produced in calorimetric
                    determinations have been published; but in order to reduce the loss

                    filled with water. This is provided with a broad tube passing nearly to the

                    pyrometric methods to which we have space to refer are those which depend on the
                    continuous variation of some property of a body with variation of temperature.
                    Each instrument of this kind requires graduation by direct or indirect
                    comparison with an air-thermometer. The methods may be grouped under three,
                    heads,—(1) the expansion of a rod of metal or earthenware; (2) the variation of
                    electrical resistance of a wire; (3) the electromotive force of a thermoelectric
                    junction.</p>
                <p>(1) <hi rend="italic">Expansion of Metals and Earthenware.—</hi> The necessity
                    for the measurement of high temperatures has been most felt perhaps in pottery
                    manufacture, and in consequence many attempts have been made by potters to
                    establish a system of pyrometry based on the permanent contraction which clay
                    undergoes when exposed to a high temperature. The action of Wedgwood’s pyrometer
                    described in the <hi rend="italic">Phil. Trans.,</hi> 1782, 1784, and 1786,
                    depends on this property of clay. The linear contraction of a clay cylinder was
                    measured by means of a metal groove with plane sides inclined to each other at a
                    small angle, and the temperature was estimated numerically by comparing the
                    contraction with that produced by a known difference of temperature. The results
                    were not very satisfactory, since the clay would contract the same amount by
                    long-continued heating at a lower temperature as by a short exposure to a higher
                    one. Wedgwood’s estimate of the melting-point of cast iron was 20,577° Fahr.</p>
                <p>The measurement of temperature by the expansion of a metal rod has been very
                    frequently attempted. The first instrument to which the name of “pyrometer” was
                    given was of this kind, and was devised by Muschenbroek, and others were devised
                    in the early part of the century by Des Aguliers, Ellicot, Graham, Smeaton,
                    Ferguson, Brogniart, Laplace, and Lavoisier, and later by Pouillet. We may say
                    here that the only acccurate methods of measuring the extremely minute
                    elongations of metal rods are those in which the expansion is referred by some
                    optical arrangement to a scale kept quite uninfluenced by the source of heat
                    which causes the expansion. In this respect Pouillet’s method of employing the
                    expansion of a rod is superior to those previously employed.</p>
                <p>The relative expansion of a metal in an earthenware socket was employed by
                    Daniell in his well-known pyrometer. The relative expansion was indicated by an
                    index of porcelain which was pushed forward when the bar expanded and left
                    behind when it contracted, so that after the apparatus had cooled the expansion
                    could be measured at leisure by the scale provided; due allowance was made for
                    the expansion of the index itself. Quite recently the expansion of graphite has
                    been employed for pyrometry by Steinle and Harting.<note anchored="true"

                    possible to obtain trustworthy measurements of temperature from an instrument
                    depending on the relative expansion of solid bodies.</p>
                <p>An ingenious application of the relative expansion of gold, silver, and platinum
                    was introduced by Bréguet. Very narrow strips of the three metals are fastened
                    together to form a compound ribbonspiral, and to the end of the spiral is
                    attached a needle, which, as the temperature changes, moves over a graduated
                    circle. The instrument, of course, requires empirical graduation. A modification
                    of it is sometimes used to measure the temperature of the hot blast of an iron
                    furnace.</p>
                <p>(2) <hi rend="italic">Variation of Electrical Resistance.—</hi> A pyrometric
                    method founded on the variation of the electrical resistance of a platinum wire
                    has been practically carried out by Siemens, and was described by him in the
                    Bakerian lecture <hi rend="italic">(Proc. Roy. Soc.,</hi> 1871). “Assuming a
                    dynamical law, according to which the electrical resistance increases according
                    to the velocity with which the atoms are moved by heat, a parabolic ratio of
                    increase of resistance with increase of temperature follows, and in adding to
                    this the coefficients (representing linear expansion and an ultimate minimum
                    resistance) the resistance <hi rend="italic">r</hi> for any temperature is
                    expressed by the general formula <hi rend="italic">r=aT^ + βT+y,</hi> which is
                    found to agree very closely both with the experimental data at low temperatures
                    supplied by Dr Matthiessen and with the experimental results varying up to 1000°
                    C.” The details of the experimental verification are not given in the abstract
                    of the lecture, nor are the numerical values of the constants for platinum. But
                    Weinhold gives the information, obtained by letter from the lecturer, that <hi
                    rend="italic">T</hi> is the absolute temperature, and the numerical values of
                    the constants— α = 0 039369, /3=0’00216407, γ= -0’24127.</p>
                <p>The experimental arrangement for practical purposes of the in strument as
                    supplied by Messrs Siemens Brothers is exceedingly convenient It is shown in

                    rend="italic">BBC</hi> are bound together in one cable, so that they have the
                    same resistance; thus the observed variation in the ratio of the resistances may
                    be regarded as entirely due to the variation in the resistance of <hi
                    rend="italic">P.</hi> The height of the liquids in the two voltameters can be
                    adjusted by the short glass tubes <hi rend="italic">S, S'</hi> sliding
                    vertically on the wooden support to which the voltameters are attached. They are
                    connected by means of india-rubber tubing with the voltameters. The commutator
                    <hi rend="italic">BBC</hi> is used to reverse the direction of the current every
                    ten seconds during the observation, which lasts long enough to give a sufficient
                    supply of gas in the voltameter tubes. By this artifice the error due to
                    variation in the polarization of the electrodes is avoided.</p>
                <p>The voltametric arrangement for comparing the resistances simplifies very greatly
                    the apparatus required. In a laboratory the resistances may be, of course, more
                    accurately compared by means of resistance-coils and a galvanometer. For
                    technical purposes the temperatures up to 1400° are reduced from the
                    observations by means of a very convenient slide rule. For temperatures beyond
                    1400° the calculation has to be gone through. The experimental data upon which
                    the verification of the formula and the determination of the constants rest are
                    not very numerous. Besides the measurements of Siemens referred to above, there
                    is an experimental comparison by Weinhold of the results obtained from the
                    instrument and those of an air-thermometer. For these observations the iron
                    cover of the coil was removed. The results up to 500°, which in each case are
                    the mean of from five to ten observations, show an agreement within 9°; those
                    between 500° and 1000°, comprising one observation at each of six temperatures,
                    three of these between 531° and 553° and three between 933° and 992°, show
                    differences of about + 26° at the lower limit and - 53° at the upper. The
                    arrangement for comparing the resistances was found to be satisfactory and
                    sufficiently sensitive. Specimens of this instrument were also submitted to
                    experiment by a committee of the British Association <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Report,</hi> 1874), but their attention was confined to the resolution of the
                    question whether the platinum coil gave the same resistance after being
                    repeatedly heated and cooled. It was found that <pb break="no"

                    carefully protected by a platinum sheath.</p>

                    and from the well-known effect of slight differences in the physical state or
                    composition of the metals used, that it is in every case necessary for the
                    observer with a thermo-junction to conduct his own comparison with an
                    air-thermometer or other standard method.</p>
                <p>§ 8. The application of the variation in the wave-length of sound to the
                    measurement of the density of air and consequent determination of the
                    temperature has been suggested by Cagnard de Latour, Damon-Ferrand, Mayer, and
                    Chautard. The method is liable to difficulties which need not be detailed here,
                    but which are obviously sufficient to cause the experiments to be regarded
                    rather as scientific curiosities than as pyrometric measurements.</p>
                <p>§ 9. Hitherto we have confined our attention to the question whether any
                    instrument described is capable of giving trustworthy indications of the
                    temperature of the instrument itself; in order to be satisfied as to whether
                    they fulfil their object, we have still to consider whether they can be easily
                    made to take up the temperature of the body or enclosure under investigation.
                    This is a very difficult question, and it seems doubtful whether with such an
                    instrument as Siemens’s electrical pyrometer, of which the coil is contained in
                    a massive sheath of iron connected to about 6 feet of stout iron tube, thermal
                    equilibrium between the coil and the enclosure is possible. We have not space to
                    discuss the matter, but it seems not unlikely that the differences which still
                    exist between the results of different observers may be due to the method of
                    exposure of the pyrometer. In connexion with this the researches of
                    Régnault<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi
                    rend="italic">Mém.</hi><hi rend="italic">de l'Γnst.,</hi> xxvi. p.
                    513.</p></note> with reference to the determination of the boiling-point of
                    mercury and sulphur are very important. He observed that his thermometers, when
                    exposed directly to the steam, indicated too high a temperature, and that it was
                    therefore necessary for the socket enclosing the thermometer to dip into the
                    liquid to such an extent that the surface of the liquid was above the level of
                    the top of the thermometer bulb. Whether or not this may account for some of the
                    differences between the results obtained for the boiling-point of zinc by
                    Deville and Troost and by E. Becquerel and Violle it is difficult to say.</p>

                <p>§ 10. Perhaps the most important modern attempts at the development of pyrometry
                    are those connected with the identification of the law connecting the
                    temperature of a body with the amount and nature of the energy which it
                    radiates. On such attempts depends the possibility of measuring the temperature
                    of a hot body by means of the light it emits. This is evidently a most desirable
                    object, since, if that were possible, one of the great difficulties of
                    pyrometry—the bringing of the measuring instrument to the temperature of the
                    body under investigation—would immediately disappear. At present, however, there
                    is no general agreement among scientific men as to the form the relation takes.
                    We cannot here do more than refer to the “Report on Spectrum Analysis,” in the
                    British Association’s <hi rend="italic">Reports</hi> for 1881 and 1884, for
