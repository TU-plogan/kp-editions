                    Psychology.</hi><hi rend="subscript"> I</hi></p>
                <p>N the several natural sciences the scope and subjectmatter of each are so evident
                    that little preliminary discussion on this score is called for. It is easy to
                    distinguish the facts dealt with in a treatise on light from those that belong
                    to one on sound; and even when the need arises to compare the results of two
                    such sciences— as in the case, say, of light and electricity—there is still no
                    difficulty,—apart, of course, from any which the imperfect state of the sciences
                    themselves may occasion. Theoretically, a standpoint is attainable from which
                    this comparison can be made, in so far, say, as the facts of both sciences can
                    be expressed in terms of matter and motion. But with psychology, however much it
                    is freed from metaphysics, all this is different. It is indeed ordinarily
                    assumed that its subject-matter can be at once defined: “It is what you can
                    perceive by consciousness or reflexion or the internal sense,” says one, “just
                    as the subject-matter of optics is what you can perceive by sight.” Or,
                    “psychology is the science of the phenomena of mind,” we are told again, “and is
                    thus marked off from the physical sciences, which treat only of the phenomena of
                    matter.” But, whereas nothing is simpler than to distinguish between seeing and
                    hearing, or between the phenomena of heat and the phenomena of gravitation, a
                    very little reflexion may convince us that we cannot in the same fashion
                    distinguish internal from external sense, or make clear to ourselves what we
                    mean by phenomena of mind as distinct from phenomena of matter.</p>
                <p>Let us begin with the supposed differentia of internal and external; and first of
                    all what are we to understand by an inner sense? To every sense there
                    corresponds a sense-organ; the several senses are distinct and independent, so
                    that no one sense can add to or alter the materials of another; and each is <hi
                    rend="italic">sui generis</hi> as regards quality,—the possession of five
                    senses, <hi rend="italic">e.g.,</hi> furnishing no data as to the character of a
                    possible sixth. Moreover, sense-impressions are passively received and occur in
                    the first instance without regard to the feeling or volition of the recipient
                    and without any manner of relation to the ‘ ‘ contents of consciousness” at the
                    moment. Now such a description will apply but very partially to the so-called
                    “internal sense.” We can imagine consciousness without self-consciousness, still
                    more without introspection, much as we can imagine sight without taste or smell.
                    But this does not entitle us to speak of self-consciousness as a sense. For we
                    do not by means of it passively receive impressions differing from all previous
                    presentations, as the sensations of colour for one couched differ· from all he
                    has experienced before: the new facts consist rather in the recognition of
                    certain relations among pre-existing presentations, <hi rend="italic">i.
                    e.,</hi> are due to our mental activity and not to a special mode of what has
                    been called our sensitivity. For when we taste we cannot hear that we taste,
                    when we see we cannot smell that we see; but when we taste we may be conscious
                    that we taste, when we hear we may be conscious that we hear. In this way all
                    the objects of the external senses are recognized as having new relations by the
                    miscalled “internal sense.” Moreover, the facts so ascertained are never
                    independent of feeling and volition and of the contents of consciousness at the
                    time, as true sensations are. Also if we consult the physiologist we learn that
                    there is no evidence of any organ or “centre” that could be regarded as the
                    “physical basis” of this inner sense; and, if self-consciousness alone is
                    temporarily in abeyance and a man merely “beside himself,” such state of
                    delirium has little analogy to the functional blindness or deafness that
                    constitutes the temporary suspension of sight or hearing.</p>
                <p>To the conception of an internal perception or observation the preceding
                    objections do not necessarily apply,—that is to say, this conception may be so
                    defined that they need not. But then in proportion as we escape the charge of
                    assuming a special sense which furnishes the material for such perception or
                    observation, in that same proportion are we compelled to seek for some other
                    mode of distinguishing its subject-matter. For, so far as the mere mental
                    activity of perceiving or observing is concerned, it is not easy to see any
                    essential difference in the process whether what is observed be psychical or
                    physical. It is quite true that the so-called psychological observation is more
                    difficult, because the facts observed are often less definite and less
                    persistent, and admit less of actual isolation than physical facts do; but the
                    process of recognizing similarities or differences, the dangers of
                    mal-observation or non-observation, are not materially altered on that account.
                    It may be further allowed that there is one difficulty peculiarly felt in
                    psychological observation, the one most inaccurately expressed by saying that
                    here the observer and the observed are one. But this difficulty is surely in the
                    first instance due to the very obvious fact that our powers of attention are
                    limited, so that we cannot alter the distribution of attention at any moment
                    without altering the contents of consciousness at that moment. Accordingly,
                    where there are no other ways of surmounting this difficulty, the psychological
                    observer must either trust to representations at a later time, or he must
                    acquire the power of taking momentary glances at the psychological aspects of
                    the phase of consciousness in question. And this one with any aptitude for such
                    studies can do with so slight a diversion of attention as not to disturb very
                    seriously either the given state or that which immediately succeeds it. But very
                    similar difficulties have to be similarly met by physical observers in certain
                    special cases, as, <hi rend="italic">e.g.,</hi> in observing and registering the
                    phenomena of solar eclipse; and similar aptitudes in the distribution of
                    attention have to be acquired, say, by extempore orators or skilful surgeons.
                    Just as little, then, as there is anything that we can with propriety call an
                    inner sense, just so little can we find in the process of inner perception any
                    satisfactory characteristic of the subject-matter of psychology. The question
                    still is: What is it that is perceived or observed? and the readiest answer of
                    course is: Internal experience as distinguished from external, what takes place
                    in the mind as distinct from what takes place without.</p>
                <p>This answer, it must be at once allowed, is adequate for most purposes, and a
                    great deal of excellent psychological work has been done without ever calling it
                    in question. But the distinction between internal and external experience is not
                    one that can be drawn from the standpoint of psychology, at least not at the
                    outset. From this standpoint it appears to be either (1) inaccurate or (2) not
                    extra - psychological. As to (1), the boundary between the internal and the
                    external was, no doubt, originally the surface of the body, with which the
                    subject or self was identified; and in this sense the terms are of course
                    correctly used. For a thing may, in the same sense of the word, be in one space
                    and therefore not in <hi rend="italic">—i.e.,</hi> out of—another; but we
                    express no intelligible relation if we speak of two things as being one in a
                    given room and the other in last week. Any one is at liberty to say if he choose
                    that a certain thing is “in his mind”; but if in this way he distinguishes it
                    from something else not in his mind, then to be intelligible this must imply one
                    of two statements,—either that the something else is actually or possibly in
                    some other mind, or, his own mind being alone considered, that at the time the
                    something else does not exist at all. Yet, evident as it seems that the
                    correlatives in and not-in must both apply to the same category, whether space,
                    <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit20newyrich/page/n51/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0920-0051-0038"/> time, presentation (or non-presentation) to a
                    given subject, and so forth, we still find psychologists more or less
                    consciously confused between “internal,” meaning “presented” in the
                    psychological sense, and “external,” meaning not “not-presented” out corporeal
                    or offener extra-corporeal. But (2), when used to distinguish between
                    presentations (some of which, or some relations of which with respect to others,
                    are called “internal,” and others or other relations, “external ”), these terms
                    are at all events accurate; only then they cease to mark oif the psychological
                    from the extra-psychological, inasmuch as psychology has to analyse this
                    distinction and to exhibit the steps by which it has come about. But we have
                    still to examine whether the distinction of phenomena of Matter and phenomena of
                    Mind furnishes a better dividing line than the distinction of internal and
                    external.</p>
                <p>A phenomenon, as commonly understood, is what is manifest, sensible, evident, the
                    implication being that there are eyes to see, ears to hear, and so forth,—in
                    other words, that there is presentation to a subject; and wherever there is
                    presentation to a subject it will be allowed that we are in the domain of
                    psychology. But in talking of physical phenomena we, in a way, abstract from
                    this fact of presentation. Though consciousness should cease, the physicist
                    would consider the sum total of objects to remain the same: the orange would
                    still be round, yellow, and fragrant as before. For the physicist—whether aware
                    of it or not—has taken up a position which for the present may be described by
                    saying that phenomenon with him means appearance or manifestation, or—as we had
                    better say—object, not for a concrete individual, but rather for what Kant
                    called <hi rend="italic">Bexcusstsein</hi><hi rend="italic">überhaupt,</hi> or,
                    as some render it, the objective consciousness, <hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> for
                    an imaginary subject freed from all the limitations of actual subjects save that
                    of depending on “sensibility” for the material of experience. However, this is
                    not all, for, as we shall see presently, the psychologist also occupies this
                    position; at least if he does not, his is not a true science. But further, the
                    physicist leaves out of sight altogether the facts of attention, feeling, and so
                    forth, all which actual presentation entails. From the psychological point of
                    view, on the other hand, the removal of the subject removes not only all such
                    facts as attention and feeling, but all presentation or possibility of
                    presentation whatever. Surely, then, to call a certain object, when we abstract
                    from its presentation, a material phenomenon, and to call the actual
                    presentation of this object a mental phenomenon,. is a clumsy and confusing way
                    of representing the difference between the two points of view. For the terms
                    “material” and “mental” seem to imply that the two so-called phenomena have
                    nothing in common, whereas the same object is involved in both, while the term
                    “phenomenon” implies that the point of view is in each case the same, when in
                    truth what is emphasized by the one the other ignores.</p>
                <p>Paradoxical though it may be, we must then conclude that psychology cannot be
                    defined by reference to a special subject-matter as such concrete sciences, for
                    example, as mineralogy and botany can; and, since it deals in some sort with the
                    whole of experience, it is obviously not an abstract science, in any ordinary
                    sense of that term. To be characterized at all, therefore, apart from
                    metaphysical assumptions, it must be characterized by the standpoint from which
                    this experience is viewed. It is by way of expressing this that widely different
                    schools of psychology define it as subjective, all other positive sciences being
                    distinguished as objective. But this seems scarcely more than a first
                    approximation to the truth, and, as we have seen incidentally, is apt to be
                    misleading. The distinction rather is that the standpoint of psychology is what
                    is sometimes termed “individualistic,” that of the so-called objectsciences
                    being “universalistic,” both alike being objective in the sense of being true
                    for all, consisting of what Kant would call judgments of experience. For
                    psychology is not a biography in any sense, still less a biography dealing with
                    idiosyncrasies, and in an idiom having an interest and a meaning for one subject
                    only, and incommunicable to any other. Locke, Berkeley, and Hume have been of
                    late severely handled because they regarded the critical investigation of
                    knowledge as a psychological problem, and set to work to study the individual
                    mind simply for the sake of this problem. But none the less their standpoint was
                    the proper one for the science of psychology itself; and, however surely their
                    philosophy was foredoomed to a collapse, there is no denying a steady
                    psychological advance as we pass from Locke to Hume and his modern
                    representatives. By “idea” Locke tells us he means “whatsoever is the object of
                    the understanding when a man thinks” <hi rend="italic">(i.e.,</hi> is
                    conscious), and having, as it were, shut himself within such a circle of ideas
                    he finds himself powerless to explain his knowledge of a world that is
                    independent of it; but he is able to give a very good account of some of these
                    ideas themselves. He cannot justify his belief in the world of things whence
                    certain of his simple ideas “were conveyed” anymore than Robinson Crusoe could
                    have explored the continents whose products were drifted to his desert island,
                    though he might perhaps survey the island itself well enough. Berkeley
                    accordingly, as Professor Fraser happily puts it, abolished Locke’s hypothetical
                    outer circle. Thereby he made the psychological standpoint clearer than
                    ever—hence the truth <hi rend="italic">of</hi> Hume’s remark, that Berkeley’s
                    arguments “admit of n&lt;? answer”; at the same time the epistemological problem
                    was as hopeless as before—hence again the truth of Hume’s remark that those
                    arguments “produced no conviction.” Of all the facts with which he deals, the
                    psychologist may truly say that their <hi rend="italic">esse</hi> is <hi
                    rend="italic">percipi,,</hi> inasmuch as all his facts are facts of
                    presentation, are ideas in Locke’s sense, or objects which imply a subject.
                    Before we became conscious there was no world for us; should our consciousness
                    cease, the world for us ceases too; had we been born blind, the world would for
                    us have had no colour; if deaf, it would have had no sounds; if idiotic, it
                    would have had no meaning. Psychology, then, never transcends the limits of the
                    individual; even the knowledge that there is a real world, as common-sense
                    assumes, is, when psychologically regarded, an individual’s knowledge, which had
                    a beginning and a growth, and can have an end. In fact, for the psychologist it
                    is not essentially knowledge, but presentations, partly possible, partly actual,
                    in the mind of A, B, or C; just as this page is for the printer essentially
                    “copy,” and only for the reader essentially “discourse.” But what the
                    psychologist has to say about knowledge is, of course, itself knowledge, <hi
                    rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> assuming it to be correct; the knowledge about which he
                    knows is, however, for him not primarily knowledge, but “states of
                    consciousness.”</p>
                <p>But now, though this Berkeleyan standpoint is the standpoint of psychology—as we
                    find it occupied, say, by J. S. Mill and Dr Bain—psychology is not pledged to
                    the method employed by Berkeley and by Locke. Psychology may be individualistic
                    without being confined exclusively to the introspective method. There is nothing
                    to hinder the psychologist from employing materials furnished by his
                    observations of other men, of infants, of the lower animals, or of the insane;
                    nothing to hinder him taking counsel with the philologist or even the
                    physiologist, provided always he can show the psychological bearings of those
                    facts which are not directly psychological. Nor, again, are we bound, because we
                    take the individualistic standpoint as psychologists, to accept the
                    philosophical conclusions that have been reached from it, unless, indeed, we
                    hold that it is the right point of view for philosophical speculation. A
                    psychologist <hi rend="italic">may</hi> be an idealist in Berkeley’s sense or in
                    Fichte’s, but he need not; he is just as free, if he see reason, to call
                    himself, after Hamilton, a natural realist; only psychology will afford him no
                    safe warrant for the realism part of it. The standpoint of psychology, then, is
                    individualistic; by whatever methods, from whatever sources its facts are
                    ascertained, they must—to have a psychological import—be regarded as having
                    place in, or as being part of, <hi rend="italic">some one's consciousness.</hi>
                    In this sense, <hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> as presented to an individual, “the
                    whole choir of heaven and furniture of earth” may belong to psychology, but
                    otherwise they are psychological nonentities. The problem of psychology, in
                    dealing with this complex subject-matter, is in general—first, to ascertain its
                    constituent <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit20newyrich/page/n52/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0920-0052-0039"/> elements, and secondly, to ascertain and explain
                    the laws of their combination and interaction.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">General Analysis of Mind; its Ultimate Constituents.</hi></p>
                <p>As to the first, there is in the main substantial agreement: the elementary facts
                    of mind cannot, it is held, be expressed in less than three propositions,—I feel
                    somehow, I know something, I do something. But here at once there arises an
                    important question, viz., What are we to understand by the subject of these
                    propositions? Nobody nowadays would understand it to imply that every psychical
                    fact must be ascertained or verified by personal introspection; perhaps no
                    modern writer ever did understand this; at any rate to do so is to confound the
                    personal with the psychological. We are no more confined to our own immediate
                    observations here than elsewhere; but the point is that, whether seeking to
                    analyse one’s own consciousness or to infer that of a lobster, whether
                    discussing the association of ideas or the expression of emotions, there is
                    always an individual mind or self or subject in question. It is not enough to
                    talk of feelings or volitions: what we mean is that some individual, man or
                    worm, feels, wills, acts—thus or thus. Obvious as this may seem, it has been
                    frequently either forgotten or gainsaid. It has been forgotten among details or
                    through the assumption of a medley of faculties, each treated as an individual
                    in turn, and among which the real individual was lost. Or it has been gainsaid,
                    because to admit that all psychological facts pertain to a psychological subject
                    seemed to carry with it the admission that they pertained to a particular
                    spiritual substance, which was simple, indestructible, and so forth; and it was
                    manifestly desirable to exclude such assumptions from psychology, <hi
                    rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> from a science which aims only at a scientific
                    exposition of what can be known and verified by observation. But, however much
                    assailed or disowned, the conception of a mind or conscious subject is to be
                    found implicitly or explicitly in all psychological writers whatever,—not more
                    in Berkeley, who accepts it as a fact, than in Hume, who accepts it as a
                    fiction. This being so, we are far more likely to reach the truth eventually if
                    we openly acknowledge this inexpugnable assumption, if such it prove, instead of
                    resorting to all sorts of devious periphrases to hide it. Now wherever the word
                    <hi rend="italic">Subject,</hi> or its derivatives, occurs in psychology we
                    might substitute the word Ego and analogous derivatives, did such exist. But
                    Subject is almost always the preferable term; its impersonal form is an
                    advantage, and it readily recalls its modern correlative Object. Moreover, Ego
                    has two senses, distinguished by Kant as pure and empirical, the latter of which
                    is, of course, an object, while the former is subject always. By pure Ego or
                    Subject it is proposed to denote the simple fact that everything mental is
                    referred to a Self. This psychological conception of a self or subject, then, is
                    after all by no means identical with the metaphysical conceptions of a soul or
                    mind-atom, or of mind-stuff not atomic; it may be kept as free from metaphysical
                    implications as the conception of the biological individual or organism with
                    which it is so intimately connected.</p>
                <p>The attempt, indeed, has frequently been made to resolve the former into the
                    latter, and so to find in mind only such an individuality as has an obvious
                    counterpart in this individuality of the organism, <hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi>
                    what we may call an objective individuality. But such procedure owes all its
                    plausibility to the fact that it leaves out of sight the difference between the
                    biological and the psychological standpoints. All that the biologist means by a
                    dog is “the sum of the phenomena which make up its corporeal existence.”<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Professor Huxley, <hi
                    rend="italic">Hume</hi> (English Men of Letters series), p. 171.</p></note> And,
                    inasmuch as its presentation to any one in particular is a point of no
                    importance, the fact, of presentation at all may be very well dropped out of
                    account. Let us now turn to mind: Why should we not take this word or “the word
                    ‘soul’ simply as a name for the series of mental phenomena which make up an indi
                    vidual mind ?”<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Professor
                    Huxley, <hi rend="italic">op. cit.,</hi> p. 172.</p></note> Surely the moment we
                    try distinctly to understand this question we realize that the cases are
                    different. “Series of mental phenomena” for whom? For any passer-by such as
                    might take stock of our biological dog? No, obviously only for that individual
                    mind itself; yet that is supposed to be made up of, to be nothing different
                    from, the series of phenomena. Are we, then, (1) quoting J. S. Mill’s words, “to
                    accept the paradox that something which <hi rend="italic">ex hypothesi</hi> is
                    but a series of feelings, can be aware of itself as a series ?”<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi rend="italic">Examination
                    of Sir W. Hamilton's Philosophy,</hi> ch. xii. <hi rend="italic"

                    are mutually phenomenal, much as A may look at B, who was just now looking at A?
                    Or (3) finally, shall we say that a large part of the so-called series, in fact
                    every term but one, is phenomenal for the rest—for that one?</p>
                <p>As to the first alternative, paradox is too mild a word for it; even
                    contradiction will hardly suffice. It is as impossible to express “being aware
                    of” by one term as it is to express an equation or any other relation by one
                    term: what knows can no more be identical with what is known than a weight with
                    what it weighs. If a series of feelings is what is known or presented, then what
                    knows, what it is presented to, cannot be that series of feelings, and this
                    without regard to the point Mill mentions, viz., that the infinitely greater
                    part of the series is either past or future. The question is not in the first
                    instance one of time or substance at all, but simply turns upon the fact that
                    knowledge or consciousness is unmeaning except as it implies something knowing
                    or conscious of something. But it maybe replied :—Granted that the formula for
                    consciousness is something doing something, to put it generally; still, if the
                    two somethings are the same when I touch myself or when I see myself, why may
                    not agent and patient be the same when the action is knowing or being aware of;
                    why may I not know myself—in fact, do I not know myself? Certainly not; agent
                    and patient never are the same in the same act; the conceptions of self-caused,
                    selfmoved, self-known, <hi rend="italic">et</hi><hi rend="italic">id genus
                    omne,</hi> either connote the incomprehensible or are abbreviated
                    expressions—such, <hi rend="italic">e.g.,</hi> as touching oneself when one’s
                    right hand touched one’s left.</p>
                <p>And so we come to the second alternative :—As one hand washes the other, may not
                    different members of the series of feelings be subject and object in turn?
                    Compare, for example, the state of mind of a man succumbing to temptation (as he
                    pictures himself enjoying the coveted good and impatiently repudiates scruples
                    of conscience or dictates of prudence) with his state when, filled with remorse,
                    he sides with conscience and condemns this “former self,”—the “better self”
                    having meanwhile become supreme. Here the cluster of presentations and their
                    associated sentiments and motives, which together play the rôle of self in the
                    one field of consciousness, have —only momentarily it is true, but still
                    have—for a time the place of not-self; and under abnormal circumstances this
                    partial alternation may become complete alienation, as in what is called ‘ ‘
                    double consciousness.” Or again, the development of self-consciousness might be
                    loosely described as taking the subject or self of one stage as an object in the
                    next,—self being, <hi rend="italic">e.g.,</hi> first identified with the body
                    and afterwards distinguished from it. But all this, however true, is beside the
                    mark; and it is really a very serious misnomer, —though the vagueness of our
                    psychological terminology seems to allow it—to do, as <hi rend="italic"
                    >e.g.,</hi> Mr Spencer does—represent the development of self-consciousness as a
                    “differentiation of subject and object.” It is, if anything, a differentiation
                    of object and object, <hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> in plainer words, it is a
                    differentiation among presentations— a differentiation every step of which
                    implies just that relation to a subject which it is supposed to supersede.</p>
                <p>There still remains an alternative, which, like the first, may be expressed in
                    the words of J. S. Mill, viz., “the alternative of believing that the Mind or
                    Ego is something different from any series of feelings or possibilities of
                    them.” To admit this, of course, is to admit the necessity of distinguishing
                    between Mind or Ego, meaning the unity or continuity of consciousness as a
                    complex of presentations, and Mind or Ego as the subject to which this complex
                    is presented. In dealing with the body from the ordinary biological standpoint
                    no such necessity arises. But, whereas there the individual organism is spoken
                    of unequivocally, in psychology, on the other hand, the individual mind may mean
                    either (i.) the series of feelings or “mental phenomena” above referred to; or
                    (ii.) the subject of these feelings for whom they are phenomena; or (iii.) the
                    subject of these feelings or phenomena + the series of feelings or phenomena
                    themselves, the two being in that relation to each other in which alone the one
                    is subject and the other a series of feelings, phenomena, or objects. It is in
                    this last sense that Mind is used in empirical psychology, its exclusive use in
                    the first sense being favoured only by those who shrink from the speculative
                    associations connected with its exclusive use in the second. But psychology is
                    not called upon to transcend the relation of subject to object or, as we may
                    call it, the fact of presentation. On the other hand, as has been said, the
                    attempt to ignore one term of the relation is hopeless; and equally hopeless,
                    even futile, is the <pb break="no"

                <p>We might now proceed to inquire more closely into the character and relations of

                    “capacities,” “functions,” &amp;c.</p></note> of this subject, which are
                    commonly held to be the invariable constituents of psychical life and broadly
                    distinguished as cognitions, feelings, and conations. But we should be at once
                    confronted by a doctrine much in vogue at present, which, strictly taken,
                    amounts almost to a denial of this tripartite classification of the facts of
                    mind—the doctrine, viz., that <hi rend="italic">feeling</hi> alone is
                    primordial, and invariably present wherever there is consciousness at-all. Every
                    living creature, it is said, feels, though it may never do any more; only the
                    higher animals, and these only after a time, learn to discriminate and identify
                    and to act with a purpose. This doctrine, as might be expected, derives its
                    plausibility partly from the vagueness of psychological terminology, and partly
                    from the intimate connexion that undoubtedly exists between feeling and
                    cognition on the one hand and feeling and volition on the other. As to the
                    meaning of the term, it is plain that further definition is requisite for a word
                    that may mean (a) a touch, as feeling of roughness; (ό) an organic sensation, as
                    feeling of hunger; (c) an emotion, as feeling of anger; (d) feeling proper, as
                    pleasure or pain. But, even taking feeling in the last, its strict sense, it has
                    been maintained that all the more complex forms of consciousness are resolvable
                    into, or at least have been developed from, feelings of pleasure and pain. The
                    only proof of such position, since we cannot directly observe the beginnings of
                    conscious life, must consist of considerations such as the following. So far as
                    we can judge, we find feeling everywhere; but, as we work down wards from higher
                    to lower forms of life, the possible variety and the definiteness of
                    sense-impressions both steadily diminish. Moreover, we can directly observe in
                    our own organic sensations, which seem to come nearest to the whole content of
                    infantile and molluscous experience, an almost entire absence of any assignable
                    <hi rend="italic">quale.</hi> Finally, in our senseexperience generally, we find
                    the element of feeling at a maximum in the lower senses and the intellectual
                    element at a maximum in the higher. But the so-called intellectual senses are
                    the most used, and use we know blunts feeling and favours intellection, as we
                    see in chemists, who sort the most filthy mixtures by smell and taste without
                    discomfort. If, then, feeling predominates more and more as we approach the
                    beginning of consciousness, may we not say that it is the only <hi rend="italic"
                    >sine qua non</hi> of consciousness? Considerations of this kind, however
                    impressive when exhibited at length, are always liable to be overturned by some
                    apparently unimportant fact which may easily be overlooked. Two lines, <hi
                    rend="italic">e.g.,</hi> may get nearer and nearer and yet will never meet, if
                    the rate of approach is simply proportional to the distance. A triangle may be
                    diminished indefinitely and yet we cannot infer that it becomes eventually all
                    angles, though the angles get no less and the sides do. Now, before we decide
                    that pleasure or pain alone may constitute a complete state of mind, it may be
                    well to inquire: What is the connexion between feelings of pleasure and pain and
                    the two remaining possible constituents of consciousness, as we can observe them
                    now? And this is an inquiry which will help us towards an answer to our main
                    question, namely, that concerning the nature and connexions of what are commonly
                    regarded as the three ultimate facts of mind.</p>
                <p>Broadly speaking, in any state of mind that we can directly observe, what we find
                    is (1) that we are aware of a certain change in our sensations, thoughts, or
                    circum stances, (2) that we are pleased or pained with the change, and (3) that
                    we act accordingly. We never find that feeling directly alters— <hi
                    rend="italic">i.e.</hi><hi rend="italic subscript"> i</hi> without the
                    intervention of the action to which it prompts—either our sensations or
                    situation, but that regularly these latter with remarkable promptness and
                    certainty alter it. We have not first a change of feeling, and then a change in
                    our sensations, perceptions, and ideas; but, these changing, change of feeling
                    follows. In short, feeling appears frequently to be an effect, which therefore
                    cannot exist without its cause, though in different circumstances the same cause
                    may produce a different amount or even a different state of feeling. Turning
                    from what we may call the receptive phase of consciousness to the active or
                    appetitive phase, we find in like manner that feeling is certainly not, in such
                    cases as we can clearly observe, the whole of consciousness at any moment. True,
                    in common speech we talk of liking pleasure and disliking pain; but this is
                    either tautology, equivalent to saying, we are pleased when we are pleased and
                    pained when we are pained, or else it is an allowable abbreviation, and means
                    that we like pleasurable <hi rend="italic">objects</hi> and dislike painful <hi
                    rend="italic">objects,</hi> as when we say, we like feeling warm and dislike
                    feeling hungry. And feeling warm or feeling hungry, we must remember, is not
                    pure feeling in the strict sense of the word. Such states admit, if not of
                    description, yet at least of identification and distinction as truly as colours
                    and sounds do. Within the limits of our observation, then, we find that feeling
                    accompanies some more or less definite presentation which for the sake of it
                    becomes the object of appetite or aversion; in other words, feeling implies a
                    relation to a pleasurable or painful presentation, that, as cause of feeling and
                    end of the action to which feeling prompts, is doubly distinguished from it.
                    Thus the very facts that lead us to distinguish feeling from cognition and
                    conation make against the hypothesis that consciousness can ever be all
                    feeling.</p>
                <p>But, as already said, the plausibility of this hypothesis is in good part due to
                    a laxity in the use of terms. Most psychologists before Kant, and English
                    psychologists even to the present day, speak of pleasure and pain as sensations.
                    But it is plain that pleasure and pain are not simple ideas, as Locke called
                    them, in the sense in which touches and tastes are,—that is to say, they are
                    never like these localized or projected, nor elaborated in conjunction with
                    other sensations and movements into percepts or intuitions of the external. This
                    confusion of feeling with sensations is largely consequent on the use of one
                    word pain for certain organic sensations and for the purely subjective state.
                    But, to say nothing of the fact that such pains are always more or less
                    definitely localized,—which of itself is so far cognition,—they are also
                    distinguished as shooting, burning, gnawing, &amp;c. &lt;fcc., all which
                    symptoms indicate a certain objective quality. Accordingly all the more recent
                    psychologists have been driven by one means or another to recognize two
                    “aspects” (Bain), or “properties” (Wundt), in what they call a sensation, the
                    one a “sensible or intellectual” or “qualitative,” the other an “affective” or
                    “emotive,” aspect or property. The term “aspect” is figurative and obviously
                    inaccurate; even to describe pleasure and pain as properties of sensation is a
                    matter open to much question. But the point which at present concerns us is
                    simply that when feeling is said to be the primordial element in consciousness
                    more is usually included under feeling than pure pleasure and pain, viz., some
                    characteristic or quality by which one pleasurable or painful sensation is
                    distinguishable from another. No doubt, as we go downwards in the chain of life
                    the qualitative or objective elements in the so-called sensations become less
                    and less definite; and at the same time organisms with well-developed
                    sense-organs give place to others <pb break="no"

                    But there is no ground for supposing even the amoeba itself to be affected in
                    all respects the same whether by changes of temperature or of pressure or by
                    changes in its internal fluids, albeit all of these changes will further or
                    hinder its life and so presumably be in some sort pleasurable or painful. On the
                    whole, then, there are grounds for saying that the endeavour to represent all
                    the various facts of consciousness as evolved out of feeling is due to a hasty
                    striving after simplicity, and has been favoured by the ambiguity of the term
                    feeling itself. If by feeling we mean a certain subjective state varying
                    continuously in intensity and passing from time to time from its positive phase
                    (pleasure) to its negative phase (pain), then this purely pathic state implies
                    an agreeing or disagreeing something which psychologically determines it. If, on
                    the other hand, we let feeling stand for both this state and the cause of it,
                    then, perhaps, a succession of such “feelings” may make up a consciousness; but
                    then we are including two of our elementary facts under the name of one of them.
                    <hi rend="italic">The, simplest form of psychical life, therefore, involves not
                    only a subject feeling but a subject having qualitatively distinguishable
                    presentations which are the occasion of its feeling.</hi></p>
                <p>We may now try to ascertain what is meant by cognition as an essential element in
                    this life, or, more exactly, what we are to understand by the term <hi
                    rend="italic">presentation.</hi> It was an important step onwards for psychology
                    when Locke introduced that “new way of ideas” which Stillingfleet found
                    alternately so amusing and so dangerous. By idea Locke tells us he meant true
                    appearances in men’s minds, or “whatsoever is the immediate object of
                    perception, thought, or understanding”; and it was so far a retrograde step when
                    Hume restricted the term to certain only of these appearances or objects, or
                    rather to these appearances or objects in a certain state, viz., as reproduced
                    ideas or images. And, indeed, the history of psychology seems to show that its
                    most important advances have been made by those who have kept closely to this
                    way of ideas; the establishment of the laws of association and their many
                    fruitful applications and the whole Herbartian psychology may suffice as
                    instances (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Herbart).</hi> The truth is that the use of
                    such a term is itself a mark of an important generalization, one which helps to
                    free us from the mythology and verbiage of the “faculty-psychologists.” All that
                    variety of mental facts which we speak of as sensations, perceptions, images,
                    intuitions, concepts, notions, have two characteristics in common :—(1) they
                    admit of being more or less attended to, and (2) can be reproduced and
                    associated together. It is here proposed to use the term presentation to connote
                    such a mental fact, and as the best English equivalent for what Locke meant by
                    idea and what Kant and Herbart called a Vorstellung.</p>
                <p>A presentation has then a twofold relation,—first, directly to the subject, and
                    secondly, to other presentations. By the first is meant the fact that the
                    presentation is attended to, that the subject is more or less conscious of it:
                    it is “in his mind” or presented. As presented to a subject a presentation might
                    with advantage be called an object, or perhaps a psychical object, to
                    distinguish it from what are called objects apart from presentation, <hi
                    rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> conceived as independent of any particular subject.
                    Locke, as we have seen, did so call it; still, to avoid possible confusion, it
                    may turn out best to dispense with the frequent use of object in this sense. But
                    on one account, at least, it is desirable not to lose sight altogether of this
                    which is after all the stricter as well as the older signification of object,
                    namely, because it enables us to express definitely, without implicating any
                    ontological theory, what we have so far seen reason to think is the fundamental
                    fact in psychology. Instead of depending mainly on that vague and treacherous
                    word “consciousness,” or committing ourselves to the position that ideas are
                    modifications of a certain mental substance and identical with the subject to
                    which they are presented, we may leave all this on one side, and say that ideas
                    are objects, and the relation of objects to subjects—that whereby the one is
                    object and the other subject—is presentation. And it is because only objects
                    sustain this relation that they may be spoken of simply as presentations.</p>
                <p>It will be convenient here to digress for a moment to take account of an
                    objection that is sure to be urged, viz., that sensations at all events ought
                    not to be called objects, that they are “states of the subject” and that this is
                    a deliverance of common sense, if anything is. Now if by this be meant (L) that
                    sensations are <hi rend="italic">metaphysically</hi> subjective modifications in
                    an idealistic sense, there is no need at this stage either to assert or deny
                    that. But if the meaning be (ii.) that sensations are <hi rend="italic"
                    >presented</hi> as modes of the subject, such a position is due to a confusion
                    between the subject proper or pure Ego and that complex presentation or object,
                    the empirical, or as we might call it the biotic, Ego. A self-conscious subject
                    may not only have a sensation but may recognize it as its own,—recognize a
                    certain connexion, that is to say, between the sensation and that presentation
                    of the empirical self which self-consciousness implies. But such reference only
                    renders more obvious the objective nature of a sensation, in the psychological
                    sense of the term objective. Or, again, the meaning may be (iii.) that a subject
                    whose presentations were all sensations would know nothing of the difference
                    between subject and object. In this objection there is a lurking confusion
                    between the standpoint of a given experience and the standpoint of its
                    exposition. The true way, surely, to represent the bare fact of sensation is not
                    to attempt to reproduce an experience as yet confined to sensations, but to
                    describe such experience as a scientific psychologist would do if we could
                    imagine him a spectator of it. The infant who is delighted by a bright colour
                    does not of course conceive himself as face to face with an object; but neither
                    does he conceive the colour as a subjective affection. We are bound to describe
                    his state of mind truthfully, but that is no reason for abandoning terms which
                    have no counterpart in his consciousness, when these terms are only used to
                    depict that consciousness to us. As to the objection (iv.) that, when all is
                    said and done, sensations are <hi rend="italic">conceived</hi> by common sense
                    as modifications of self, whether so presented or not, it may be granted that it
                    appears so at first blush, but not when common sense is more closely examined.
                    The fact is we are here upon what has been called “the margin of psychology,”
                    where our ordinary thinking brings into one view what science has to be at great
                    pains to keep distinct. Though it is scientifically a long way round from a fact
                    of mind to the corresponding fact of body, yet it is only on careful reflexion
                    that we can distinguish the two in those cases in which our practical interests
                    have closely associated them. Such a case is that of sensation. The ordinary
                    conception of a sensation coincides, no doubt, with the definition given by
                    Hamilton and Mansel :— “Sensation proper is the consciousness of certain
                    affections of our body as an animated organism”; and it is because in ordinary
                    thinking we reckon the body as part of self that we come to think of sensations
                    as subjective modifications. But, when considerations of method compel us to
                    eliminate physiological implications from the ordinary conception of a
                    sensation, we are able here to distinguish the conscious subject and the
                    “affections” of which it is conscious as clearly as we can distinguish subject
                    and object in other cases of presentation. On the whole, then, we may conclude
                    that there is nothing either in the facts or in oιir necessary conceptions of
                    them to prevent us from representing whatever admits of psychical reproduction
                    and association, no matter how simple it be, as an object presented to a
                    subject.</p>
                <p>As to the subjective relation of objects, the relation of presentation itself, we
                    have merely to note that on the side of the subject it implies what, for want of
                    a better word, may be called <hi rend="italic">attention,</hi> extending the
                    denotation of this term so as to include even what we ordinarily call
                    inattention. Attention so used will thus cover part of what is meant by
                    consciousness,—so much of it, that is, as answers to being mentally active,
                    active enough at least to <hi rend="italic">“receive</hi> impressions.”
                    Attention on the side of the subject implies intensity on the side of the
                    object: we might indeed almost call intensity the matter of a presentation,
                    without which it is a nonentity.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    attention called voluntary we are aware (1) that concentration of attention
                    increases or its abstraction diminishes the intensity of a presentation in
                    circumstances where physically and physiologically there is nothing to prevent
                    the intensity of the presentation from continuing uniform. Again, (2) in
                    circumstances when psychologically we are aware of no previous change in the
                    distribution of attention, we find the intensity of a presentation increased or
                    diminished if certain physical concomitants of the presentation <hi
                    rend="italic">(e.g.,</hi> stimulus, nervous process, &amp;c.) are increased or
                    diminished. Thus, though this is a point we-could hardly establish without the
                    aid of psychophysics, we may conclude that the intensity of a presentation may
                    be altered from two sides; that it depends, in other words, partly upon what we
                    may perhaps call its physical intensity and partly on the amount of attention it
                    receives.</p>
                <p>Some further exposition of the connexion between subjective attention and
                    objective intensity is perhaps desirable here, where we are seeking to get a
                    general view of the essential facts of mind and their relations, rather than
                    later on, when we shall be more concerned with details. We are aware in ordinary
                    life that the intensity of any given sensation depends upon certain physical
                    quantities, varying directly in some proportion as these vary. Hence, since our
                    habitual standpoint is the physical not the psychological, we conceive sensory
                    objects as having an intensity <hi rend="italic">per se</hi> apart from the
                    attention that their presentation secures. From the physical standpoint indeed
                    it is manifest that no other conception is compatible with a scientific
                    treatment of phenomena. Subjective sources of variation are supposed to be
                    eliminated: the general mind to which, according to the physicist’s conception
                    of a phenomenon, that phenomenon is implicitly supposed to be presented is a
                    mind in which there is no feeling to produce variations of attention, or to
                    favour aesthetic combinations of objects. Attention is thus assumed to be
                    constant, and all variations in intensity to be objectively determined. But
                    psychologically we cannot assume this. In any given presentation there is, it
                    must be admitted, no immediate evidence that the intensity of the object is a
                    function of two variables,—(1) what we have called its physical or absolute
                    intensity and (2) the intensity of attention. Still there are facts which
                    justify this conclusion. That the intensity of the presentation varies with the
                    absolute intensity of the object, attention remaining constant, is a proposition
                    not likely to be challenged. What has to be shown is that the intensity of
                    presentations varies with the attention, all else remaining constant. Assuming
                    that voluntary and noa-voluntary attention are fundamentally the same, this
                    amounts to showing (1) that concentration of attention upon some objects
                    diminishes the intensity of presentation of others in the same field, whether
                    the concentration be voluntary or nonvoluntary, <hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> due
                    to a shock; and (2) that, even though only within narrow limits, increasing
                    attention voluntarily has the same effect on the presentation as increasing the
                    objective intensity from the physical side. The narrowness of these
                    limits—practically an all-important fact—is theoretically no objection. It would
                    not be difficult psychologically to account for our inability to concentrate
                    attention indefinitely: that we can concentrate it at all is enough to show that
                    there is a subjective as well as an objective factor in the intensity of a
                    presentation. Any fuller consideration of the connexion between attention and
                    presentations may be deferred.</p>
                <p>The inter-objective relations of presentations, on which their second
                    characteristic, that of revivability and asso-ciability depends, though of the
                    first importance in themselves, hardly call for examination in a general
                    analysis like the present. But there is one point still more fundamental that we
                    cannot wholly pass by: it is—in part at any rate—what is commonly termed the
                    unity or continuity of consciousness. From the physical standpoint and in
                    ordinary life we can talk of objects that are isolated and independent and in
                    all respects distinct individuals. The screech of the owl, for example, has
                    physically nothing to do with the brightness of the moon: either may come or go
                    without changing the order of things to which the other belongs. But
                    psychologically, for the individual percipient, they are parts of one whole:
                    special attention to one diminishes the intensity of presentation of the other
                    and the recurrence of the one will afterwards entail the re-presentation of the
                    other also. Not only are they still parts of one whole, but such distinctness as
                    they have at present is the result of a gradual differentiation. It is quite
                    impossible for us now to imagine the effects of years of experience removed, or
                    to picture the character of our infantile presentations before our interests had
                    led us habitually to concentrate attention on some, and to ignore others, whose
                    intensity thus diminished as that of the former increased. In place of the many
                    things which we can now see and hear, not merely would there then be a confused
                    presentation of the whole field of vision and of a mass of undistinguished
                    sounds, but even the difference between sights and sounds themselves would be
                    without its present distinctness. Thus the further we go back the nearer we
                    approach to a total presentation having the character of one general <hi
                    rend="italic">continuum</hi> in which differences are latent. There is, then, in
                    psychology, as in biology, what may be called a principle of “progressive
                    differentiation or specialization” · and this, as well as the facts of
                    reproduction and association, forcibly suggests the conception of a certain
                    objective continuum forming the background or basis to the several relatively
                    distinct presentations that are elaborated out of it—the equivalent, in fact, of
                    that unity and continuity of consciousness which has been supposed to supersede
                    the need for a conscious subject.</p>
                <p>There is one class of objects of special interest even in a general survey, viz.,
                    movements or motor presentations. These, like sensory presentations, admit of
                    association and reproduction, and seem to attain to such distinctness as they
                    possess in adult human experience by a gradual differentiation out of an
                    original diffused mobility which is little besides emotional expression. Of
                    this, however, more presently. It is primarily to such dependence upon feeling
                    that movements owe their distinctive character, the possession, that is, under
                    normal circumstances, of definite and assignable psychical antecedents, in
                    contrast to sensory presentations, which enter the field of consciousness <hi
                    rend="italic">ex</hi><hi rend="italic">abrupto.</hi> We cannot psychologically
                    explain the order in which particular sights and sounds occur; but the movements
                    that follow them, on the other hand, can be adequately explained only by
                    psychology. The twilight that sends the hens to roost sets the fox to prowl, and
                    the lion’s roar which gathers the jackals scatters the sheep. Such diversity in
                    the movements, although the sensory presentations are similar, is due, in fact,
                    to what we might call the principle of “subjective or hedonic selection ”—that,
                    out of all the manifold changes of sensory presentation which a given individual
                    experiences, only a few are the occasion of such decided feeling as to become
                    objects of possible appetite (or aversion). The representation of what interests
                    us comes to be associated with the representation of such movements as will
                    secure its realization, so that— although no concentration of attention will
                    secure the requisite intensity to a pleasurable object present only in idea—we
                    can by what is strangely like a concentration of attention convert the idea of a
                    movement into the fact, and by means of the movement attain the coveted
                    reality.</p>
                <p>And this has brought us round naturally to what is perhaps the easiest way of
                    approaching the question: What is a <hi rend="italic">conation</hi> or <hi
                    rend="italic">action</hi><hi rend="italic superscript"> r</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >l</hi> In ordinary voluntary movement we have first of all an idea or
                    re-presentation of the movement, and last of all the actual movement itself,—a
                    new presentation which may for the present be described as the filling out of
                    the re-presentation,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>On
                    the connexion of presentations and re-presentations, see p. 59 below.</p></note>
                    which thereby attains that intensity, distinctness, and embodiment we call
                    reality. How does this change come about? The attempt has often been made to
                    explain it by a reference to the more uniform, and apparently simpler, case of
                    reflex <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit20newyrich/page/n56/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0920-0056-0043"/> action, including under this term what are called
                    sensorimotor and ideo-motor actions. In all these the movement seems to be the
                    result of a mere transference of intensity from the associated sensation or idea
                    that sets on the movement. But, when by some chance or mischance the same
                    sensory presentation excites two alternative and conflicting motor ideas, a
                    temporary block, it is said, occurs; and, when at length one of these nascent
                    motor changes finally prevails and becomes real, then we have the state of mind
                    called volition.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Compare
                    Spencer’s <hi rend="italic">Principles of Psychology,</hi> i. 496.</p></note>
                    But this assumption that sensory and motor ideas are associated before volition,
                    and that the volition begins where automatic or reflex action ends, is due to
                    that inveterate habit of confounding the psychical and the physical which is the
                    bane of modern psychology. How did these particular sensory and motor
                    presentations ever come to be associated? It is wholly beside the mark to answer
                    that they are <hi rend="italic">“organically determined</hi> psychical changes.”
                    In one respect all psychical changes alike are organically determined, inasmuch
                    as all alike—so far, at least, as we at all know or surmise—have organic
                    concomitants. In another respect no psychical changes are organically
                    determined, inasmuch as physical events and psychical events have no common
                    factors. Now the only psychological evidence we have of any very intimate
                    connexion between sensory and motor representations is that furnished by our
                    acquired dexterities, <hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> by such movements as Hartley
                    styled secondary automatic. But then all these have been preceded by volition:
                    as Mr Spencer says, “the child learning to walk wills each movement before
                    walking it.” Surely, then, a psychologist should take this as his typical case
                    and prefer to assume that all automatic actions that come within his ken at all
                    are in this sense secondarily automatic, <hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> to say
                    that either in the experience of the individual or of his ancestors volition, or
                    something analogous to it, preceded habit.</p>
                <p>But, if we are thus compelled by a sound method to regard sensori-motor actions
                    as degraded or mechanical forms of voluntary actions, instead of regarding
                    voluntary actions as gradually differentiated out of something physical, we have
                    not to ask: What happens when one of two alternative movements is executed? but
                    the more general question: What happens when any movement is made in consequence
                    of feeling? It is obvious that on this view the simplest <hi rend="italic"
                    >definitely purposive</hi> movement must have been preceded by some movement
                    simpler still. For any distinct movement purposely made presupposes the ideal
                    presentation, before the actual realization, of the movement. But such ideal
                    presentation, being a re-presentation, equally presupposes a previous actual
                    movement of which it is the so-called mental residuum. There is then, it would
                    seem, but one way left, viz., to regard those movements which are immediately
                    expressive of pleasure or pain as primordial, and to regard the so-called
                    voluntary movements as elaborated out of these. The vague and diffusive
                    character of these primitive emotional manifestations is really a point in
                    favour of this position. For such “diffusion” is evidence of an underlying
                    continuity of motor presentations parallel to that already discussed in
                    connexion with sensory presentations, a continuity which, in each case, becomes
                    differentiated in the course of experience into comparatively distinct and
                    discrete movements and sensations respectively.<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>It maybe well to call to mind here that Dr
                    Bain also has regarded emotional expression as a possible commencement of
                    action, but only to reject it in favour of his own peculiar doctrine of
                    “spontaneity,” which, however, is open to the objection that it makes movement
                    precede feeling instead of following it—an objection that would be serious even
                    if the arguments advanced to support his hypothesis were as cogent as only Dr
                    Bain takes them to be. Against the position maintained above he objects that
                    “the emotional wave almost invariably affects a whole group of movements,” and
                    therefore does not furnish the ‘ <hi rend="italic">‘ isolated</hi> promptings
                    that are desiderated in the case of the will” <hi rend="italic">{Mental and
                    Moral Science,</hi> p. 323). But to make this objection is to let heredity count
                    for nothing. In fact, wherever a variety of isolated movements is physically
                    possible, there also we always find corresponding instincts, ‘ that untaught
                    ability to perform actions,” to use Dr Bain’s own language, which a minimum of
                    practice suffices to perfect.</p></note></p>
                <p>But, whereas we can only infer, and that in a very roundabout fashion, that our
                    sensations are not absolutely distinct but are parts of one massive sensation,
                    as it were, we are still liable under the influence of strong emotion directly
                    to experience the corresponding continuity in the case of movement. Such
                    motor-continuum we may suppose is the psychical counterpart of that permanent
                    readiness to act, or rather that continual nascent acting, which among the older
                    physiologists was spoken of as “tonic action”; and as this is now known to be
                    intimately dependent on afferent excitations so is our motor consciousness on
                    our sensory. Still, since we cannot imagine the beginning of life but only life
                    begun, the simplest picture we can form of a concrete state of mind is not one
                    in which there are movements before there are any sensations or sensations
                    before there are any movements, but one in which change of sensation is followed
                    by change of movement, the link between the two being a change of feeling.</p>
                <p>Having thus simplified the question, we may now ask again: How is this change of
                    movement through feeling brought about? The answer, as already hinted, appears
                    to be: By a change of attention. We learn from such observations as
                    psychologists describe under the head of fascination, imitation, hypnotism,
                    &amp;c., that the mere concentration of attention upon a movement is often
                    enough to bring the movement to pass. But, of course, in such cases there is
                    neither emotional experience nor volition in question; such facts are only cited
                    to show the connexion between attention and movements. Everybody too has often
                    observed how the execution of any but mechanical movements arrests attention to
                    thoughts or sensations, and <hi rend="italic">vice versa.</hi> Let us suppose,
                    then, that we have at any given moment a certain distribution of attention
                    between sensory and motor presentations; a change in that distribution means a
                    change in the intensity of some or all of these, and change of intensity in
                    motor presentations means change of movement. Such changes are, however, quite
                    minimal in amount so long as the given presentations are not conspicuously
                    agreeable or disagreeable. As soon as they are, we find pleasure to lead at once
                    to concentration of attention on the pleasurable object; so that pleasure is not
                    at all so certainly followed by movement as we find pain to be, save of course
                    when movements are themselves the pleasurable objects and are executed, as we
                    say, for their own sakes. In fact, pleasure would seem rather to repress
                    movement, except so far as it is coincident either with a more economic
                    distribution, or with a positive augmentation, of the available attention; and
                    either of these, on the view supposed, would lead to increased but indefinite
                    <hi rend="italic">(i.e.,</hi> playful) movement. Pain, on the other hand, is
                    much more closely connected with movement, and movement too which for obvious
                    reasons much sooner acquires a purposive character. Instead of voluntary
                    concentration of attention upon a painful presentation we find attention to such
                    an object always involuntary; in other words, attention is, as it were,
                    excentrated, dispersed, or withdrawn. If, therefore, the painful presentation is
                    a movement, it is suspended; if it is a sensation, movements are set up which
                    further distract attention, and some of which may effect the removal of the
                    physical source of the sensation.</p>

                <p>Of the three phases, thus logically distinguishable, the first and the third
                    correspond in the main with the receptive and active states or powers of the
                    older psychologists. The second phase, being more difficult to isolate, was long
                    overlooked; or, at all events, its essential characteristics were not distinctly
                    marked: it was either confounded with (1), which is its cause, or with (3), its
                    effect. But perhaps the most important of all psychological distinctions is that
                    which traverses both the old bipartite and the prevailing tripartite
                    classification, viz., that between the subject, on the one hand, as acting and
                    feeling, and the objects of this activity on the other. Such distinction lurks
                    indeed under such terms as faculty, power, consciousness, but they tend to keep
                    it out of sight. With this distinction clearly before us—instead of crediting
                    the subject with an indefinite number of faculties or capacities, we must seek
                    to explain not only reproduction, association, agreement, difference, &lt;fcc.,
                    but all varieties of thinking and acting by the laws pertaining to ideas or
                    presentations, leaving to the subject only the one power of variously
                    distributing that attention upon which the intensity of a presentation in part
                    depends. Of this single subjective activity what we call activity in the
                    narrower sense (as, <hi rend="italic">e.g.,</hi> purposive movement and
                    intellection) is but a special case, although a very important one.</p>
                <p>According to this view, then, <hi rend="italic">presentations, attention,</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">feeling,</hi> are not to be regarded as three co-ordinate genera,
                    each a distinguishable “state of mind or consciousness,” <hi rend="italic"
                    >i.e.,</hi> as being all alike included under this one supreme category. There
                    is, as Berkeley long ago urged, no resemblance between activity and an idea <hi
                    rend="italic">; nor</hi> is it easy to see anything common to pure feeling and
                    an idea, unless it be that both possess intensity. Classification seems, in
                    fact, to be here out of place. Instead, therefore, of the one <hi rend="italic"
                    >sumrnuτn genus,</hi> state of mind or consciousness, with its three co-ordinate
                    subdivisions—cognition, emotion, conation—our analysis seems to lead us to
                    recognize three distinct and irreducible facts—attention, feeling, and objects
                    or presentations—as together, in a certain connexion, constituting one concrete
                    state of mind or <hi rend="italic">psychosis.</hi> Of such concrete states of
                    mind we may then say there are two forms, more or less distinct, corresponding
                    to the two ways in which attention may be determined and the two classes of
                    objects attended to in each, viz., (1) the <hi rend="italic">sensory</hi> or <hi
                    rend="italic">receptive state,</hi> when attention is non-voluntarily
                    determined, <hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> where feeling follows the act of
                    attention; and</p>
                <p>(2) the <hi rend="italic">motor</hi> or <hi rend="italic">active state,</hi>
                    where feeling precedes the act of attention, which is thus determined
                    voluntarily.</p>
                <p>To say that feeling and attention are not presentations will seem to many an
                    extravagant paradox. If all knowledge consists of presentations, it will be
                    said, how come we to know anything of feeling and attention if they are not
                    presented? We know of them indirectly through their effects, not directly in
                    themselves. This is, perhaps, but a more concrete statement of what philosophers
                    have very widely acknowledged in a more abstract form since the days of
                    Kant<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Compare “Gefühle

                    subjective being presented. It is in the main clearly put in the following
                    passage from Hamilton, who, however, has not had the strength of his convictions
                    in all cases:—“The peculiarity of feeling, therefore, is that there is nothing
                    but what is subjectively subjective; there is no object different from self,—no
                    objectification of any mode of self. We are, indeed, able to constitute our
                    states of pain and pleasure into objects of reflexion, but, in so far as they
                    are objects of reflexion, they are not feelings but only reflex' cognitions of
                    feelings.”<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi
                    rend="italic">Lectures on Metaphysics,</hi> ii. p. 432.</p></note> But this last
                    sentence is not, perhaps, altogether satisfactory. The meaning seems to be that
                    feeling ‘ ‘ can only be studied through its reminiscence,” which is what
                    Hamilton has said elsewhere of the “phaenomena of consciousness " generally. But
                    this is a position hard to reconcile with the other, viz., that feeling and
                    cognition are generically distinct. How can that which was not originally a
                    cognition become such by being reproduced? The statements that feeling is
                    “subjectively subjective,” that in it “there is no object different from self,”
                    are surely tantamount to saying that it is not presented; and what is not
                    presented cannot, of course, be re-presented. Instead, therefore, of the
                    position that feeling and attention are known by being made objects of
                    reflexion, it would seem we can only maintain that we know <hi rend="italic"
                    >of</hi> them by their effects, by the changes, <hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi>
                    which they produce in the character and succession of our presentations.<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>But, while we cannot say that
                    we know what attention and feeling are, inasmuch as they are not presented,
                    neither can we with any propriety maintain that we are ignorant of them,
                    inasmuch as they are by their very nature unpresentable. As Ferrier contends,
                    “we can be ignorant only of what can possibly be known; in other words, there
                    can be ignorance only of that of which there can be knowledge” <hi rend="italic"

                    rend="italic">sq.∖</hi> The antithesis between the objective and the subjective
                    factors in presentation is wider than that between knowledge and ignorance,
                    which is an antithesis pertaining to the objective side alone.</p></note> We
                    ought also to bear in mind that the effects of attention and feeling cannot be
                    known without attention and feeling: to whatever stage we advance, therefore, we
                    have always in any given “state of mind” attention and feeling on the one side,
                    and on the other a presentation of objects. Attention and feeling seem thus to
                    be ever present, and not to admit of the continuous differentiation into parts
                    which gives to presentations a certain individuality, and makes their
                    association and reproduction possible.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Theory of Presentations.</hi></p>
                <p>Having now ascertained what seem to be the essential elements in any state of
                    mind, we may next proceed to examine these several elements separately in more
                    detail. It will be best to begin with that which is both the clearest in itself
                    and helps us the most to understand the rest, viz., the objects of attention or
                    consciousness, <hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> presentations. And this exposition
                    will be simplified if we start with à supposition that will enable us to leave
                    aside, at least for the present, the difficult question of heredity.</p>
                <p>We know that in the course of each individual’s life there is more or less of
                    progressive differentiation or development; we know too that the same holds
                    broadly of a race; and it is believed to hold in like manner of the evolution of
                    the animal kingdom generally. It is believed that there has existed a series of
                    sentient individuals beginning with the lowest form of life and advancing
                    continuously up to man. Some traces of the advance already made may be
                    reproduced in the growth of each human being now, but for the most part such
                    traces have been obliterated. What was experience in the past has become
                    instinct in the present. The descendant has no consciousness of his ancestors’
                    failures when performing by “an <pb break="no"

                    found out. But if we are to attempt to follow the genesis of mind from its
                    earliest dawn it is the primary experience rather than the eventual instinct
                    that we have first of all to keep in view. To this end, then, it is proposed to
                    assume that we are dealing with one individual which has continuously advanced
                    from the beginning of psychical life, and not with a series of individuals of
                    which all save the first have inherited certain capacities from its progenitors.
                    The life-history of such an imaginary individual, that is to say, would
                    correspond with all that was new, all that could be called evolution or
                    development, in a certain typical series of individuals each of whom advanced a
                    certain stage in mental differentiation. On the other hand, from this history
                    would be omitted that inherited reproduction of ancestral experience, or
                    tendency to its reproduction, by which alone, under the actual conditions of
                    existence, progress is possible.</p>
                <p>If an assumption of this kind had been explicitly avowed by the psychologists who
                    have discussed the growth of experience in accordance with the evolution
                    hypothesis, not a few of the difficulties in the way of that hypothesis might
                    have been removed. That individual minds make some advance in the complexity and
                    distinctness of their presentations between birth and maturity is an obvious
                    fact; heredity, though a less obvious fact, is also beyond question. Using
                    Locke’s analogy of a writing-tablet—or let us say an etching-tablet—by way of
                    illustration, we may be sure that every individual started with some features of
                    the picture completely preformed, however latent, others more or less clearly
                    outlined, and others again barely indicated, while of others there is as yet
                    absolutely no trace. But the process of reproducing the old might differ as
                    widely from that of producing the new as electrotyping does from engraving.
                    However, as psychologists we know nothing directly about it; neither can we
                    distinguish precisely at any link in the chain of life what is old and
                    inherited—original in the sense of Locke and Leibnitz—from what is new or
                    acquired —original in the modern sense. But we are bound as a matter of method
                    to suppose all complexity and differentiation among presentations to have been
                    originated, <hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> experimentally acquired, at some time
                    or other. So long, then, as we are concerned primarily with the progress of this
                    differentiation we may disregard the fact that it has not actually been, as it
                    were, the product of one hand dealing with one <hi rend="italic">tabula
                    rasa</hi> but of many hands, each of which, starting with a reproduction of what
                    had been wrought on the preceding tabulae, put in more or fewer new touches
                    before devising the whole to a successor who would proceed in like manner.</p>
                <p>What is implied in this process of differentiation or mental growth and what is
                    it that grows or becomes differentiated <hi rend="italic">Ί</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">—</hi> these are the questions to which we must now attend.
                    Psychologists have usually represented mental advance as consisting
                    fundamentally in the combination and recombination of various elementary units,
                    the so-called sensations and primitive movements, or, in other words, in a
                    species of “mental chemistry.” If we are to resort to physical analogies at
                    all—a matter of very doubtful propriety—we shall find in the growth of a seed or
                    an embryo far better illustrations of the unfolding of the contents of
                    consciousness than in the building up of molecules: the process seems much more
                    a segmentation of what is originally continuous than an aggregation of elements
                    at first independent and distinct. Comparing higher minds or stages of mental
                    development with lower—by what means such comparison is possible we need not now
                    consider— we find in the higher conspicuous differences between presentations
                    which in the lower are indistinguishable or absent altogether. The worm is aware
                    only of the difference between light and dark. The steel-worker sees half a
                    dozen tints where others see only a uniform glow. To the child, it is said, all
                    faces are alike; and throughout life we are apt to note the general, the points
                    of resemblance, before the special, the points of difference.<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>This last statement is apt to
                    mislead by implying an active comparison of several objects; but that absence or
                    confusion of differences which hides the many is really very different from the
                    detection of resemblances which makes the many one.</p></note> But, even when
                    most definite, what we call a presentation is still part of a larger whole. It
                    is not separated from other presentations, whether simultaneous or successive,
                    by something which is not of the nature of presentation, as one island is
                    separated from another by the intervening sea, or one note in a melody from the
                    next by an interval of silence. In our search for a theory of presentations,
                    then, it is from this “unity of consciousness” that we must take our start.
                    Working backwards from this as we find it now, we are led alike by particular
                    facts and general considerations to the conception of a <hi rend="italic"
                    >totum,</hi><hi rend="italic">objectiυum</hi> or objective continuum which is
                    gradually differentiated, thereby becoming what we call distinct presentations,
                    just as with mental growth some particular presentation, clear as a whole, as
                    Leibnitz would say, becomes a complex of distinguishable parts. Of the very
                    beginning of this continuum we can say nothing: absolute beginnings are beyond
                    the pale of science. Actual presentation consists in this continuum being
                    differentiated; and every differentiation constitutes a new presentation. Hence
                    the commonplace of psychologists :—We are only conscious as we are conscious of
                    change.</p>
                <p>But “change of consciousness” is too loose an expression to take the place of the
                    unwieldy phrase differentiation of a presentation-continuum, to which we have
                    been driven. For not only does the term “consciousness” confuse what exactness
                    requires us to keep distinct, an activity and its object, but also the term
                    “change” fails to express the characteristics which distinguish presentations
                    from other changes. Differentiation implies that the simple becomes complex or
                    the complex more complex; it implies also that this increased complexity is due
                    to the persistence of former changes; we may even say such persistence is
                    essential to the very idea of development or growth. In trying, then, to
                    conceive our psychological individual in the earliest stages of development we
                    must not picture it as experiencing a succession of absolutely new sensations,
                    which, coming out of nothingness, admit of being strung upon the “thread of
                    consciousness” like beads picked up at random, or cemented into a mass like the
                    bits of stick and sand with which the young caddis covers its nakedness. The
                    notion, which Kant has done much to encourage, that psychical life begins with a
                    confused manifold of sensations not only without logical but without
                    psychological unity is one that becomes more inconceivable the more closely we
                    consider it. An absolutely new presentation, having no sort of connexion with
                    former presentations till the subject has synthesized it with them, is a
                    conception for which it would be hard to find a warrant either by direct
                    observation, by inference from biology, or in considerations of an <hi
                    rend="italic">a priori</hi> kind. At any given moment we have a certain whole of
                    presentations, a “field of consciousness” psychologically one and continuous; at
                    the next we have not an entirely new field but a partial change within this
                    field. Many who would allow this in the case of representations, <hi
                    rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> where idea succeeds idea by the workings of
                    association, would demur to it in the case of primary presentations or
                    sensations. “For,” they would say, “may not silence be broken by a clap of
                    thunder, and have not the blind been made to see <hi rend="italic">1”</hi> To
                    <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit20newyrich/page/n59/mode/1up"

                    discussion, and to answer them may serve to make it clearer. Where silence can
                    be broken there are representations of preceding sounds and in all probability
                    even subjective presentations of sound as well; silence as experienced by one
                    who has heard is very different from the silence of Condillac’s statue before it
                    had ever heard. The question is rather whether such a conception as that of
                    Condillac’s is possible; supposing a sound to be, qualitatively, entirely
                    distinct from a smell, could a field of consciousness consisting of smells be
                    followed at once by one in which sounds had part? And, as regards the blind
                    coming to see, we must remember not only that the "blind have eyes but that they
                    are descended from ancestors who could see. What nascent presentations of sight
                    are thus involved it would be hard to say; and the problem of heredity is one
                    that we have for the present left aside.</p>
                <p>The view here taken is (1) that at its first appearance in psychical life a new
                    sensation or so-called elementary presentation is really a partial modification
                    of some preexisting presentation, which thereby becomes as a whole more complex
                    than it was before; and (2) that this complexity and differentiation of parts
                    never become a plurality of discontinuous presentations, having a distinctness
                    and individuality such as the atoms or elementary particles of the physical
                    world are supposed to have. Beginners in psychology, and some who are not
                    beginners, are apt to be led astray by expositions which begin with the
                    sensations of the special senses, as if these furnished us with the type of an
                    elementary presentation. The fact is we never experience a mere sensation of
                    colour, sound, touch, and the like; and what the young student mistakes for such
                    is really a perception, a sensory presentation combined with various sensory and
                    motor presentations and with representations—and having thus a definiteness and
                    completeness only possible to com} Jex presentations. Moreover, if we could
                    attend to a pure sensation of sound or colour by itself, there is much to
                    justify the suspicion that even this is complex and not simple, and owes to such
                    complexity its clearly marked specific quality. In certain of our vaguest and
                    most diffused organic sensations, in which we can distinguish little besides
                    variations in intensity and massiveness, there is probably a much nearer
                    approach to the character of the really primitive presentations.</p>
                <p>The importance of getting a firm grasp of this conception of a
                    presentation-continuum as fundamental to the whole doctrine of presentations
                    will justify us in ignoring a little longer the details of actual mental
                    development and regarding it first from this more general point of view. In a
                    given sensation, more particularly in our organic sensations, we can distinguish
                    three variations, viz., variations of quality, of intensity, and of what Dr Bain
                    has called massiveness, or, as we will say, extensity. This last characteristic,
                    which everybody knows who knows the difference between the ache of a big bruise
                    and the ache of a little one, between total and partial immersion in a bath, is,
                    as we shall see later on, an essential element in our perception of space. But
                    it is certainly not the whole of it, for in this experience of massive sensation
                    alone it is impossible to find other elements which an analysis of spatial
                    intuition unmistakably yields. Extensity and extension, then, are not to be
                    confounded. Now we find, even at our level of mental evolution, that an increase
                    in the intensity of a sensation is apt to entail an increase in its extensity
                    too; this is still more apparent in the case of movements, and especially in the
                    movements of the young. In like manner we observe a greater extent of movement
                    in emotional expression when the intensity of the emotion increases. Even the
                    higher region of imagination is no exception, as is shown by the whirl and
                    confusion of ideas incident to delirium, and, indeed, to all strong excitement.
                    But this “diffusion” or “radiation,” as it has been called, diminishes as we
                    pass from the class of organic sensations to the sensations of the five senses,
                    from movements expressive of feeling to movements definitely purposive, and from
                    the tumult of ideas excited by passion to the steadier sequences determined by
                    efforts to think. Increased differentiation seems, then, to be intimately
                    connected with increased “restriction.” The causal relations of the two must be
                    largely matter of conjecture and cannot be fully discussed here. Probably there
                    may be found certain initial differentiations which for psychology are ultimate
                    facts that it cannot explain. But, such differentiations being given, then it
                    may be safely said that, in accordance With what we have called the principle of
                    subjective selection (see p. 42), attention would be voluntarily concentrated
                    upon some of them and voluntary movements specially connected with these. To
                    such subjectively initiated modifications of the presentationcontinuum,
                    moreover, we may reasonably suppose “restriction” to be in large measure due.
                    But increased restriction would render further differentiation of the given
                    presentation possible and so the two processes might supplement each other. But,
                    be their interaction what it may, these processes have now proceeded so far that
                    at the level of human consciousness we find it hard to form any tolerably clear
                    conception of a field of consciousness in which an intense sensation, no matter
                    what, might diffuse over the whole. Colours, <hi rend="italic">e.g.,</hi> are
                    with us so distinct from sounds that—except as regards the drain upon
                    attention—there is nothing in the intensest colour to affect the simultaneous
                    presentation of a sound. But at the beginning whatever we regard as the earliest
                    differentiation of sound might have been incopresentable with the earliest
                    differentiation of colour, if sufficiently diffused, just as now a field of
                    sight all blue is incopresentable with one all red. Or, if the stimuli
                    appropriate to both were active together, the resulting sensation might have
                    been what we should describe as a blending of the two, as purple is a blending
                    of red and violet. Now, on the other hand, colours and sounds are necessarily so
                    far localized that we are directly aware that the eye is concerned with the one
                    and the ear with the other. This brings to our notice a fact so ridiculously
                    obvious that it has never been deemed worthy of mention, and yet it has
                    undeniably important bearings—the fact, viz., that certain sensations or
                    movements are an absolute bar to the simultaneous presentation of other
                    sensations or movements. We cannot see an orange as at once yellow and green,
                    though we can feel it at once as both smooth and cold <hi rend="italic">;
                    we</hi> cannot open and close the same hand at the same moment, but we can open
                    one hand while closing the other. Such incopresentability or contrariety is thus
                    more than mere difference, and occurs only between presentations belonging to
                    the same sense or to the same group of movements. Strictly speaking, it does not
                    always occur even then; for red and yellow, hot and cold, are presentable
                    together provided they have certain other differences which we shall meet again
                    presently as differences of local sign.</p>
                <p>In the preceding paragraphs we have had occasion to distinguish between the
                    presentation-continuum or whole field of consciousness, as we may for the
                    present call it, and those several modifications within this field which are
                    ordinarily spoken of as presentations, and to which—now that their true
                    character as parts is clear—we too may confine the term. But it will be well in
                    the next place, before inquiring more closely into their characteristics, to
                    consider for a moment that persistence of preceding modifications which the
                    differentiation of the presentationcontinuum<pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit20newyrich/page/n60/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0920-0060-0047"/> implies. This persistence is best spoken of as
                    retentiveness; it is sometimes confounded with memory, though this is something
                    much more complex and special. Betentiveness is both a biological and a
                    psychological fact; memory is exclusively the latter. In memory there is
                    necessarily some contrast of past and present, in retentiveness nothing but the
                    persistence of the old. If psychologists have erred in regarding the
                    presentations in consciousness together as a plurality of units, they have erred
                    in like manner concerning the persisting residua of such presentations. As we
                    see a certain colour or a certain object again and again, we do not go on
                    accumulating images or representations of it, which are somewhere crowded
                    together like shades on the banks of the Styx; nor is such colour, or whatever
                    it be, the same at the hundredth time of presentation as at the first, as the
                    hundredth impression of a seal on wax would be. There is no such constancy or
                    uniformity in mind. Obvious as this must appear when we pause to think of it,
                    yet the explanations of perception most iri vogue seem wholly to ignore it. Such
                    explanations are far too mechanical and, so to say, atomistic; but we must fall
                    back upon the unity and continuity of our presentation-continuum if we are to
                    get a better. Suppose that in the course of a few minutes we take half a dozen
                    glances at a strange and curious flower. We have not as many complex
                    presentations which we might symbolize as <hi rend="italic">F</hi><hi
                    rend="italic subscript"> l</hi><hi rend="italic">, F</hi><hi rend="italic
                    subscript"> 2</hi><hi rend="italic">, F</hi><hi rend="italic subscript">
                    3</hi><hi rend="italic">.</hi> But rather, at first only the general outline is
                    noted, next the disposition of petals, stamens, &amp;c., then the attachment of
                    the anthers, form of the ovary, and so on; that is to say, symbolizing the whole
                    flower as <hi rend="italic">[p' (a b) s' (c</hi> √) o' <hi rend="italic">(f
                    ^)],</hi> we first apprehend say [p'.. s'. . o'], then <hi rend="italic">[p' (a
                    b) s'..</hi> o'.J, or <hi rend="italic">[ρ</hi> ’ <hi rend="italic">(a . .) s'
                    (c</hi>. .) o' (∕..)], and so forth. It is because the earlier apprehensions
                    persist that the later are an advance upon them and an addition to them. There
                    is nothing in this process properly answering to the reproduction and
                    association of ideas: in the last and complete apprehension as much as in the
                    first vague and inchoate one the flower is there as a primary presentation.
                    There is a limit, of course, to such a procedure, but the instance taken, we may
                    safely say, is not such as to exceed the bounds of a simultaneous field of
                    consciousness. Now the question is: Ought we not to assume that such increase of
                    differentiation through the persistence of preceding differentiations holds of
                    the contents of consciousness as a whole? Here, again, we shall find
                    limitations,—limitations too of great practical importance; for, if
                    presentations did not pale as well as persist, and if the simpler presentations
                    admitted of indefinite differentiation, mental advance— unless the field of
                    consciousness, t.e., the number of presentations to which we could attend
                    together, increased without limit—would be impossible. But, allowing all this,
                    it is still probably the more correct and fundamental view to suppose that, in
                    those circumstances in which we now have a sensation of, say, red or sweet,
                    there was in the primitive consciousness nothing but a vague modification, which
                    persisted; and that on a repetition of the circumstances this persisting
                    modification was again further modified. The whole field of consciousness would
                    thus, like a continually growing picture, increase indefinitely in complexity of
                    pattern, the earlier presentations not disappearing, like the waves of yesterday
                    in the calm of to-day, but rather lasting on, like old scars that show beneath
                    new ones.</p>
                <p>There is yet one more topic of a general kind calling for attention before we
                    turn to the consideration of particular presentations—the hypothesis of
                    unconscious mental modifications, as it has been unfortunately termed,—the
                    hypothesis of subconsciousness, as we may style it to avoid this contradiction
                    in terms. It is a fact easily verified, that we do not distinguish or attend
                    separately to presentations of less than a certain assignable intensity. On
                    attaining this intensity presentations are said to pass over the threshold of
                    consciousness, to use Herbart’s now classic phrase. What are we to say of them
                    before they have attained it? After they have attained it, any further increase
                    in their intensity is certainly gradual; are we then to suppose that before this
                    their intensity changed instantly from zero to a finite quantity, and not rather
                    that there was also a subliminal stage where too it only changed continuously?
                    The latter alternative constitutes the hypothesis of subconsciousness. According
                    to this hypothesis, a presentation does not cease to be so long as it has any
                    intensity, no matter how little. We can directly observe that an increase in the
                    intensity of many complex presentations brings to light details and differences
                    before imperceptible; since these details are themselves presentations, they
                    have been brought by this increase from the subconscious stage into the field of
                    consciousness. Similarly, presentations not separately distinguishable, because
                    of too close a proximity in time, become distinguishable when the interval
                    between them is such as to allow of a separate concentration of attention upon
                    each. Again, we find that presentations “revived” or re-presented after their
                    disappearance from the field of consciousness appear fainter and less distinct
                    the longer the time that has elapsed between their exits and their re-entrances.
                    Nobody hesitates to regard such obliviscence as a psychological fact; why, then,
                    should we hesitate to suppose that presentations, even when no longer intense
                    enough directly to influence attention, continue to be presented, though with
                    ever lessening intensity?</p>
                <p>On the whole we seem justified in assuming three grades of consciousness thus
                    widely understood—(1) a centre or focus of consciousness within (2) a wider
                    field, any part of which may at once become the focus. Just as in sight,
                    surrounding the limited area of distinct vision on which the visual axes are
                    directed, there is a wider region of indirect vision to any part of which those
                    axes may be turned either voluntarily or by a reflex set up by the part itself,
                    as happens, <hi rend="italic">e.g.,</hi> with moving objects quite on the margin
                    of vision. But in describing (3) subconsciousness as the third grade, this
                    simile, due to Wundt, more or less forsakes us. Presentations in
                    subconsciousness have not the power to divert attention, nor can we voluntarily
                    concentrate attention upon them. Before either can happen the subconscious
                    presentations must cross the threshold of consciousness, and so cease to be
                    subconscious; and this, of course, is far from being always possible. Now in the
                    case of sight an object may fail to catch the eye, either because, though within
                    the field of sight, it is too far away to make a distinct impression or because
                    it is outside the field altogether. But we cannot conveniently interpret
                    “threshold of consciousness” in keeping with the latter alternative; mere
                    accretion from without is a conception as alien to psychology as it is to
                    biology. We must make the best we can of a <hi rend="italic">totum</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">objectivum</hi> differentiated within itself, and so are confined
                    to the first alternative. Our threshold must be compared to the surface of a
                    lake and subconsciousness to the depths beneath it, and all the current
                    terminology of presentations rising and sinking implies this or some similar
                    figure.</p>
                <p>This hypothesis of subconsciousness has been strangely misunderstood, and it
                    would be hard to say at whose hands it has suffered most, those of its exponents
                    or those of its opponents. In the main it is nothing more than the application
                    to the facts of presentation of the law of continuity, its introduction into
                    psychology being due to Leibnitz, who first formulated that law. Half the
                    difficulties in the way of its acceptance are due to the manifold ambiguities of
                    the word consciousness. With Leibnitz consciousness was not coextensive with all
                    psychical life, but only with certain <pb break="no"

                    late, however, the tendency has been to make consciousness cover all stages of
                    mental development and all grades of presentation, so that a presentation of
                    which there is no consciousness resolves itself into the manifest contradiction
                    of an unpresented presentation—a contradiction not involved in Leibnitz’s
                    “unapperceived perception.” Moreover, the active form of the word “conscious”
                    almost unavoidably suggests that an “unconscious mental modification” must be
                    one in which that subjective activity, variously called consciousness,
                    attention, or thinking, has no part But such is not the meaning intended when it
                    is said, for example, that a soldier in battle is often unconscious of his
                    wounds or a scholar unconscious at any one time of most of the knowledge “hidden
                    in the obscure recesses of his mind.” There would be no point in saying a
                    subject is not conscious of objects that are not presented at all; but to say
                    that what is presented lacks the intensity requisite in the given distribution
                    of attention to change that distribution appreciably is pertinent enough.
                    Subconscious presentations may tell on conscious life—as sunshine or mist tells
                    on a landscape or the underlying writing on a palimpsest —although lacking
                    either the differences of intensity or the individual distinctness requisite to
                    make them definite features. Even if there were no facts to warrant this
                    conception of a subliminal presentation of impressions and ideas it might still
                    claim an <hi rend="italic">a priori</hi> justification. For to assume that there
                    can be no presentations save such as pertain to the complete and perfect
                    consciousness of a human being is as arbitrary and as improbable as it would be
                    to suppose—in the absence of evidence to the contrary—that there was no vision
                    or audition save such as is mediated by human eyes and ears. Psychological
                    magnification is not more absurd than physical, although the processes in the
                    two cases must be materially different; but of course in no case is
                    magnification possible without limit. The point is that, while we cannot fix the
                    limit at which the subconscious becomes the absolutely unconscious, it is only
                    reasonable to expect beforehand that this limit is not just where our powers of
                    discrimination cease.</p>
                <p>Over and above hindrances to its acceptance which may be set down to the
                    paradoxical and inaccurate use of the word unconsciousness, there are two
                    material difficulties which prevent this hypothesis from finding favour. First,
                    the prevailingly objective implications of language are apt to make us assume
                    that, as a tree remains the same thing whether it is in the foreground of a
                    landscape or is lost in the grey distance, so a presentation must be a something
                    which is in itself the same whether above the threshold of consciousness or
                    below, if it exist, that is, in this lower degree at all. But it must be
                    remembered that we are not now dealing with physical things but with
                    presentations, and that to these the Berkeleyan <hi rend="italic">dictum</hi>
                    applies that their <hi rend="italic">esse</hi> is <hi rend="italic"
                    >percipi,</hi> provided, of course, we give to <hi rend="italic">percipi</hi>
                    the wide meaning now assigned to consciousness. The qualitative differences of
                    all presentations and the distinctness of structure of such as are complex both
                    diminish with a diminution of intensity. In this sense much is latent or
                    “involved” in presentations lying below the threshold of consciousness that
                    becomes patent or “evolved” as they rise above it. But, on the other hand, the
                    hypothesis of subconsciousness does not commit us to the assumption that all
                    presentations are by their very nature imperishable: while many modifications of
                    consciousness sink only into obliviscence, many, we may well suppose, lapse into
                    complete oblivion and from that there is no recall. Secondly, to any one
                    addicted to the atomistic view of presentations just now referred to it may well
                    seem incredible that all the incidents of a long lifetime and all the items of
                    knowledge of a well-stored mind that may possibly recur—“the infinitely greater
                    part of our spiritual treasures,” as Hamilton says—can be in any sense present
                    continuously. The brunt of such an objection is effectually met by the fact that
                    the same presentation may figure in very various connexions, as may the same
                    letter, for example, in many words, the same word in many sentences. We cannot
                    measure the literature of a language by its vocabulary, nor may we equate the
                    extent of our spiritual treasures as successively unfolded with the psychical
                    apparatus, so to say, into which they resolve.<note anchored="true"

                <p>The attempt has more than once been made to avoid the difficulties besetting
                    subconsciousness by falling back on the conceptions of faculties, capacities, or
                    dispositions. Stored-up knowledge, says J. S. Mill, “is not a mental state but a
                    capability of being put into a mental state”; similarly of the cases which
                    Hamilton records, “in which the extinct memory [?] of whole languages was
                    suddenly restored,” he says, “it is not the mental impressions that are latent
                    but the power of reproducing them.” But surely the capability of being put into
                    a mental state is itself a mental state and something actual, and is, moreover,
                    a different something when the state to be reproduced is different. If not, how
                    is such capability ever exerted? Even where the capability cannot be consciously
                    exerted, must there not still be something actual to justify the phrase latent
                    power? The “exaltation” of delirium may account for the intensification but not
                    for the contents of the “extinct memories” which its unwonted glow reveals. It
                    seems extraordinary that Mill of all men, and in psychology of all subjects,
                    should have supposed such merely formal conveniences as these conceptions of
                    faculties and powers could ever dispense us from further inquiry. It might be
                    urged in Mill’s defence that he <hi rend="italic">has</hi> investigated further
                    and concludes that the only distinct meaning he can attach to unconscious mental
                    modification is that of unconscious modification of the nerves—a modification of
                    the nerves, that is to say, without any psychical accompaniment. But, while we
                    can frequently understand a psychical fact better if we can understand its
                    physical counterpart, a physiological explanation can never take the place of a
                    psychological explanation. If all we have to deal with are nervous modifications
                    which have no psychical concomitants, then so far there is nothing psychological
                    to explain; but, if there really is anything calling for psychological
                    explanation—and this Mill does not deny—then physical accompaniments must admit
                    of psychical interpretation if they are to be of any avail. And in fact,
                    although Mill professes to recognize only unconscious modifications of nerves,
                    he finds a psychological meaning for these by means of his “mental chemistry,”—a
                    doctrine which has done its work and which we need not here discuss.</p>
                <p>The exposition of subconsciousness given by Wundt is in the main an advance on
                    that of Mill and calls for brief notice. Presentations, says Wundt,<note

                    are not substances but functions, whose physiological counterparts in like
                    manner are functional activities, viz., of certain arrangements of nerve-cells.
                    Consciousness of the presentation and the nervous activity cease together, but
                    the latter leaves behind it a molecular modification of the nervous structure
                    which becomes more and more permanent with exercise, and is such as to
                    facilitate the recurrence of the same functional activity. A more precise
                    account of these after-effects of exercise is for the present unattainable;
                    nevertheless Wundt regards it as obvious that they are no more to be compared to
                    the activity to which they predispose than the molecular arrangement of chlorine
                    and nitrogen in nitric chloride is to be compared to the explosive decomposition
                    that ensues if the chloride is slightly disturbed. <hi rend="italic"
                    >Mutatis</hi><hi rend="italic">mutandis,</hi> on the psychological side the only
                    actual presentations are those which we are conscious of as such; but
                    presentations that vanish out of consciousness leave behind psychical
                    dispositions tending to renew them. The essential difference is that, whereas we
                    may some day know the nature of the physical disposition, that of the psychical
                    disposition must of necessity be for ever unknown, for the threshold of
                    consciousness is also the limit of internal experience. The theory thus briefly
                    summarized seems in some respects arbitrary, in some respects ambiguous. It is
                    questionable, for instance, whether the extremely meagre information that
                    physiologists at present possess at all compels us to assume that the “physical
                    disposition” of Wundt cannot consist in a continuous but much fainter discharge
                    of function. At all events it is quite beside the mark to urge, as he does, that
                    the effect of training a group of muscles is not shown in the persistence of
                    slight movements during intervals of apparent rest.<note anchored="true"

                    molecular motions. And it is certain that psychologically we can be conscious of
                    the idea of a movement without the movement actually ensuing, yet only in such
                    wise that the idea is more apt to pass over into action the intenser it is, and
                    often actually passes over in spite of us. Surely there must be some functional
                    activity answering to this conscious presentation, and if this amount of
                    activity is possible without movement why may not a much less amount be
                    conceived possible too? Again, what meaning can possibly be attached to a
                    psychical disposition which is the counterpart, not of physical changes, but of
                    an arrangement of molecules? Compared with such an inconceivable unknown, the
                    perfectly conceivable hypothesis of infinitesimal presentations so faint as to
                    elude discrimination is every way preferable. In fact, if conceivability is to
                    count for anything, we have, according to Wundt, no choice, for “we can never
                    think of a presentation that has disappeared from consciousness except as
                    retaining the properties it had when in consciousness.” None the less he holds
                    it to be an error “to apply to presentations themselves a style of conception
                    that has resulted from our being of necessity confined to consciousness.”
                    Verily, this is phenomenalism with a vengeance, as if presentations themselves
                    were not also confined to consciousness!</p>

                <p>This will be the most convenient place to take note of certain psychological
                    doctrines which, though differing in some material respects, are usually
                    included under the term Law of Relativity.</p>
                <p>1. Hobbes’s <hi rend="italic">Idem semper sentire</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >et</hi><hi rend="italic">non sentire ad idem</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >recidunt</hi> is often cited as one of the first formulations of this law; and
                    if we take it to apply to the whole field of consciousness it becomes at once
                    true and trite: a field of consciousness unaltered either by change of
                    impression or of ideas would certainly be a blank and a contradiction.
                    Understood in this sense the Law of Relativity amounts to what Hamilton called
                    the Law of Variety (Reid’s <hi rend="italic">Works,</hi> p. 932). But, though
                    consciousness involves change, it is still possible that particular
                    presentations in the field of consciousness may continue unchanged indefinitely.
                    When it is said that “a constant impression is the same as a blank,” what is
                    meant turns out to be something not psychological at all, as, <hi rend="italic"
                    >e.g.,</hi> our insensibility to the motion of the earth or to the pressure of
                    the air—cases in which there is obviously no presentation, nor even any evidence
                    of nervous change. Or else this paradox proves to be but an awkward way of
                    expressing what we may call accommodation, whether physiological or
                    psychological. Thus the skin soon adapts itself to certain seasonal alterations
                    of temperature, so that heat or cold ceases to be felt: the sensation ceases
                    because the nervous change, its proximate physical counterpart, has ceased.
                    Again, there is what James Mill calls “an acquired incapacity of attention,”
                    such that a constant noise, for example, in which we have no interest is soon
                    inaudible. As attention moves away from a presentation its intensity diminishes,
                    and when the presentation is below the threshold of consciousness its intensity
                    is then subliminal, whatever that of the physical stimulus may be. In such a
                    case of psychological accommodation we should expect also to find on the
                    physiological side some form of central reflexion or isolation more or less
                    complete. As a rule, no doubt, impressions do not continue constant for more
                    than a very short time; still there are sad instances enough in the history of
                    disease, bodily and mental, to show that such a thing can quite well happen, and
                    that such constant impressions (and “fixed ideas,” which are in effect
                    tantamount to them), instead of becoming blanks, may dominate the entire
                    consciousness, colouring or bewildering everything.</p>
                <p>2. From the fact that the field of consciousness is continually changing it has
                    been supposed to follow, not only that a constant presentation is impossible,
                    but as a further consequence that every presentation is essentially nothing but
                    a transition or difference. “All feeling,” says Dr Bain, the leading exponent of
                    this view, “is two-sided. . . . We may attend more to one member of the couple
                    than to the other. . . . We are more conscious of heat when passing to a higher
                    temperature, and of cold when passing to a lower. The state we have passed <hi
                    rend="italic">to</hi> is our <hi rend="italic">explicit</hi> consciousness, the
                    state we have passed <hi rend="italic">from</hi> is our <hi rend="italic"
                    >implicit</hi> consciousness.” But the transition need not be from heat to cold,
                    or <hi rend="italic">vice versa</hi>: it can equally well take place from a
                    neutral state, which is indeed the normal state, of neither heat nor cold; a
                    new-born mammal, <hi rend="italic">e.g.,</hi> must experience cold, having never
                    experienced heat. Again, suppose a sailor becalmed, gazing for a whole morning
                    upon a stretch of sea and sky, what sensations are implicit here? Shall we say
                    yellow as the greatest contrast to blue, or darkness as the contrary of light,
                    or both? What, again, is the implicit consciousness when the explicit is sweet;
                    is it bitter or sour, and from what is the transition in such a case?</p>
                <p>It is difficult to avoid suspecting a certain confusion here between the
                    transition of attention from one presentation to another and the qualitative
                    differences among presentations themselves. It is strange that the psychologist
                    who has laid such stress on neutral states of surprise as being akin to feeling,
                    and so distinct from special presentations, should in any way confound the two.
                    The mistake, if mistake indeed it be, is perhaps accounted for by the fact that
                    Dr Bain, in common with the rest of his school, nowhere distinguishes between
                    attention and the presentations that are attended to. To be conscious or
                    mentally alive we must have a succession of shocks or surprises, new objects
                    calling off attention from old ones; but, over and above these movements of
                    attention from presentation to presentation, do we find that each presentation
                    is also itself but a transition or difference? “We do not know any one thing of
                    itself but only the difference between it and another thing,” says Dr Bain. But
                    it is plain we cannot speak of contrast or difference between two states or
                    things as a contrast or difference if the states or things are not themselves
                    presented, else the so-called contrast or difference would itself be a single
                    presentation, and its supposed “relativity” but an inference. Difference is not
                    more necessary to the presentation of two objects than two objects to the
                    presentation of difference. And, what is more, a difference between
                    presentations is not at all the same thing as the presentation of that
                    difference. The former must precede the latter; the latter, which requires
                    active comparison, need not follow. There is an ambiguity in the words “know,”
                    “knowledge,” which Dr Bain seems not to have considered: “to know” may mean
                    either to perceive or apprehend, or it may mean to understand or
                    comprehend.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Other

                    Philosophica,</hi> of Professor J. Grote. Hobbes too was well awake to this
                    difference, as, <hi rend="italic">e.g.,</hi> when he says, “There are two kinds
                    of knowledge; the one, sense or knowledge original and remembrance of the same;
                    the other, science or knowledge of the truth of propositions, derived from
                    understanding.”</p></note> Knowledge in the first sense is only what we shall
                    have presently to discuss as the recognition or assimilation of an impression
                    (see below, p. 53); knowledge in the latter sense is the result of intellectual
                    comparison and is embodied in a proposition. Thus a blind man who cannot know
                    light in the first sense can know about light in the second if he studies a
                    treatise on optics. Now in simple perception or recognition we cannot with any
                    exactness say that two <hi rend="italic">things</hi> are perceived: straight is
                    a thing, <hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> a definite object presented; not so
                    not-straight, which may be qualitatively obscure or intensively feeble to any
                    degree. Only when we rise to intellectual knowledge is it true to say, “No one
                    could understand the meaning of a <hi rend="italic">straight</hi> line without
                    being shown a line not straight, a bent or crooked line.”<note anchored="true"

                    is here implied; but we cannot begin with such definitional differentiation: we
                    must first recognize our objects before we can compare them. We need, then, to
                    distinguish between the comparativity of intellectual knowledge, which we must
                    admit—for it rests at bottom on a purely analytical proposition—and the
                    “differential theory of presentations,” which, however plausible at first sight,
                    must be wrong somewhere since it commits us to absurdities. Thus, if we cannot
                    have a presentation <hi rend="italic">X</hi> but only the presentation of the
                    difference between <hi rend="italic">Y</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Z,</hi> it
                    would seem that in like manner we cannot have the presentation of <hi
                    rend="italic">Y</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Z,</hi> nor therefore of their
                    difference <hi rend="italic">X,</hi> till we have had the presentation of <hi

                    emerge if we examine more closely what may be meant by difference. We may speak

                    regards (a) and (ό), it will be found that the difference between two
                    intensities of the same quality, or between two qualities of the same continuum,
                    may be itself a distinct presentation. But nothing of this kind holds of

                    this is, however, superadded to the sensation, probably on the ground of
                    similarities in the accompanying organic sensations.</p></note> In passing from

                    one might the distance between two places on the same road. But in passing from
                    the scent of a rose to the sound of a gong or a sting from a bee we have no such
                    means of bringing the two into relation—scarcely more than we might have of

                    through the looking-glass. In (c), then, we have only a change, a difference of

                    this in (a) or (6) provided the selected presentations occur together. If red
                    follows green we may be aware of a greater difference than we could if red
                    followed orange; and we should ordinarily call a 10-ft&gt; load heavy after one
                    of <hi rend="italic">5</hi> ft» and light after one of 20 ft). Facts like these

                <p>3. On the strength of such facts Wundt has formulated a law of relativity, free,
                    apparently, from the objections just urged against Dr Bain’s doctrine, which
                    runs thus: —“Our sensations afford no absolute but only a <hi rend="italic"
                    >relative.</hi> measure of external impressions. The intensities of stimuli, the
                    pitch of tones, the qualities of light, we apprehend <hi rend="italic"
                    >(empfinden)</hi> in general only according to their mutual relation, not
                    according to any unalterably fixed unit given along with or before the
                    impression itself.”<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi
                    rend="italic">Physiologische Psychologie,</hi> 1st e&lt;L, p. 421; the doctrine
                    reappears in the 2d ed., but no equally general statement of it is
                    given.</p></note> We are not now concerned with so much of this statement as
                    relates to the physical antecedents of sensation; but that what is of
                    psychological account in it requires very substantial qualification is evident
                    at once from a single consideration, viz., that if true this law would make it
                    quite immaterial what the impressions themselves were: provided the relation
                    continued the same, the sensation would be the same too, just as the ratio of 2
                    to 1 is the same whether our unit be miles or millimètres. In the case of
                    intensities, €.&lt;?., there is a <hi rend="italic">minimum</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">sensibile</hi> and a <hi rend="italic">maximum</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">sensibile.</hi> The existence of such extremes is alone sufficient
                    to turn the flank of the thoroughgoing relativists; but there are instances
                    enough of intermediate intensities that are directly recognized. A
                    letter-sorter, for example, who identifies an ounce or two ounces with
                    remarkable exactness identifies each for itself and not the first as half the
                    second; of an ounce and a half or of three ounces he may have a comparatively
                    vague idea. And so generally within certain limits of error, <hi rend="italic"
                    >indirectly ascertained,</hi> we can identify intensities, each for itself,
                    neither referring to a common standard nor to one that varies from time to time
                    —to any intensity, that is to say, that chances to be simultaneously presented;
                    just as an enlisting sergeant will recognize a man fit for the Guards without a
                    yard measure and whether the man’s comrades are tall or short. Of course such
                    identification is only possible through the reproduction of past impressions,
                    but then such reproduction itself is only possible because the several
                    impressions concerned have all along had a certain independence of related
                    impressions, and a certain identity among themselves. As regards the qualities
                    of sensations the outlook of the relativists is, if anything, worse. In what is
                    called Meyer’s experiment, <hi rend="italic">e.g.</hi> (described under <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Eye,</hi> vol. viii. p. 825), what appears greenish on a red
                    ground will appear of an orange tint on a ground of blue; but this contrast is
                    only possible within certain very narrow limits. In fact, the phenomena of
                    colour-contrast, so far from proving, distinctly disprove that we apprehend the
                    qualities of light only according to their mutual relation. In the case of tones
                    it is very questionable whether such contrasts exist at all. Summing up on the
                    particular doctrine of relativity of which Wundt is the most distinguished
                    adherent, the truth seems to be that, in some cases where two presentations
                    whose difference is itself presentable occur in close connexion, this
                    difference—as we indirectly learn—exerts a certain bias on the assimilation or
                    identification of one or both of the presentations. There is no “unalterably
                    fixed unit” certainly, but, on the other hand, “the mutual relations of
                    impressions” are not everything.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    &amp;c.</hi></p></note> is to account for their differences of quality. In some
                    respects it may well seem an idle question, for at some stage or other we must
                    acknowledge final or irresolvable differences. Still, differences can be
                    frequently shown to be due to variety in the number, arrangement, and intensity
                    of parts severally the same,— these several parts being either simultaneously
                    presented or succeeding each other with varying intervals. It is a sound
                    scientific instinct which has led writers like G. H. Lewes and Mr Spencer to
                    look out for evidence of some simple primordial presentation—the psychical
                    counterpart, they supposed, of a single nerve-shock or neural tremor— out of
                    which by various grouping existing sensations have arisen. It must, however, be
                    admitted that but little of such evidence is at present forthcoming; and
                    further, if we look at the question for a moment from the physiological
                    standpoint which these writers are too apt to affect, what we find seems on the
                    whole to make against this assumption. Protoplasm in its simplest state is
                    readily irritated either by light, heat, electricity, or mechanical shock. Till
                    the physiological characteristics of these various stimuli are better known, it
                    is fruitless to speculate as to the nature of primitive sensation. But we have
                    certainly no warrant for supposing that any existing class of sensations is
                    entitled to rank as original. Touch, as we experience it now, is probably quite
                    as complex as any of our special sensations. If a supposition must be ventured
                    at all, it is perhaps most in keeping with what we know to suppose that the
                    sensations answering to the five senses in their earliest form were only
                    slightly differing variations of the more or less massive organic sensation
                    which constituted the primitive presentation-continuum. We may suppose, in other
                    words, that at the outset these sensations corresponded more completely with
                    what we might call the general physiological action of light, heat, &lt;fcc., as
                    distinct from the action of these stimulants on specially differentiated
                    end-organs. But, short of resolving such sensations into combinations of one
                    primordial modification of consciousness, if we could conceive such, there are
                    many interesting facts which point clearly to a complexity that we can seldom
                    directly detect. Many of our supposed sensations of taste, <hi rend="italic"
                    >e.q.,</hi> are complicated with sensations of <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit20newyrich/page/n64/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0920-0064-0051"/> touch and smell: thus the pungency of pepper and
                    the dryness of wine are tactual sensations, and their spicy flavours are really
                    smells. How largely smells mingle with what we ordinarily take to be simply
                    tastes is best brought home to us by a severe cold in the head, as this
                    temporarily prevents the access of exhalations to the olfactory surfaces. The
                    difference between the smooth feel of a polished surface and the roughness of
                    one that is unpolished, though to direct introspection an irresolvable
                    difference of quality, is probably due to the fact that several
                    nerve-terminations are excited in each case: where the sensation is one of
                    smoothness all are stimulated equally; where it is one of roughness the ridges
                    compress the nerve-ends more, and the hollows compress them less, than the level
                    parts do. The most striking instance in point, however, is furnished by musical
                    timbre (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Ear,</hi> vol. vii. p. 593).</p>
                <p>We find other evidence of the complexity of our existing sensations in the
                    variations in quality that accompany variations in intensity, extensity, and
                    duration. With the exception of spectral red all colours give place, sooner or
                    later, to a mere colourless grey as the intensity of the light diminishes, and
                    all in like manner become indis-tinguishably white after a certain increase of
                    intensity. A longer time is also in most cases necessary to produce a sensation
                    of colour than to produce a sensation merely of light or brightness: the solar
                    spectrum seen for a moment appears not of seven colours but of two only— faintly
                    red towards the left side and blue towards the right. Very small objects, again,
                    such as coloured specks on a white ground, though still distinctly seen, appear
                    as colourless if of less than a certain size, the relation between their
                    intensity and extensity being such that within certain limits the brighter they
                    are the smaller they may be without losing colour, and the larger they are the
                    fainter in like manner. Similar facts are observable in the case of other
                    senses, so that generally we seem justified in regarding what we now distinguish
                    as a sensation as probably complicated in several respects. In other words, if
                    psychical magnification were possible, we might be directly aware that
                    sensations which we now suppose to be both single and simple were both compound
                    and complex—that they consisted, that is, of two or more sensational elements or
                    changes, alike or different in quality, of uniform or variable intensity, and
                    occurring either simultaneously or in regular or irregular succession.</p>
                <p>It is interesting to note that all possible sensations of colour, of tone, and of
                    temperature constitute as many groups of qualitative continua. By continuum is
                    here meant a series of presentations changing gradually in quality, <hi
                    rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> so that any two differ less the more they approximate
                    in the series. We may represent this relation among presentations spatially, so
                    long as the differences do not exceed three. In this way our normal
                    colour-sensations have been compared to a sphere, in which (a) the maximum of
                    luminosity is at one pole and the minimum at the other; (δ) the series of
                    colours proper (red to violet and through purple back to red), constituting a
                    closed line, are placed round the equator or in zones parallel to it, according
                    to shade; and (c) the amount of saturation (or absence of white) for any given
                    zone of illumination increases with distance from the axis. The several musical
                    tones, again, have been compared to an ascending spiral, a given tone and its
                    octaves lying in the same perpendicular. Temperatures similarly might be
                    represented as ranging in opposite directions, t'.e., through heat or through
                    cold, between a zero of no sensation and the organic sensations that accompany
                    the destructive action of heat and cold alike. As we frequently experience a
                    continuous range of intensity of varying amount, so we may experience continuous
                    variations in quality, as in looking at the rainbow, for example. Still it is
                    not to be· supposed that colours or notes are necessarily presented as continua:
                    that they are such is matter of after-observation.</p>
                <p>The groups of sensations known as touches, smells, tastes, on the other hand, do
                    not constitute continua: bitter tastes, for instance, will not shade off into
                    acid or sweet tastes, except, of course, through a gradual diminution of
                    intensity rendering the one quality subliminal followed by a gradual increase
                    from zero in the intensity of the other. This want of continuity might be
                    explained if there were grounds for regarding these groups as more complex than
                    the rest,—in so far as tertiary colours or vowel-sounds, say, are complex and
                    comparatively discontinuous. But it might equally well be argued that they are
                    simpler than the rest and, as simple and different, are necessarily disparate,
                    while the continuity of colours or tones is due to a gradual change of
                    components.</p>
                <p>Our motor presentations contrast with the sensory by their want of striking
                    qualitative differences. We may divide them into two groups, (a) motor
                    presentations proper and (ό) auxilio-motor presentations. The former answer to
                    our “feelings of muscular effort” or “feelings of innervation.” The latter are
                    those presentations due to the straining of tendons, stretching and flexing of
                    the skin, and the like, by which the healthy man knows that his efforts to move
                    are followed by movement, and so knows the position of his body and limbs. It is
                    owing to the absence of these presentations that the anaesthetic patient cannot
                    directly tell whether his efforts are effectual or not, nor in what position his
                    limbs have been placed by movements from without. Thus under normal
                    circumstances motor presentations are always accompanied by auxilio-motor; but
                    in disease and in passive movements they are separated and their distinctness
                    thus made manifest. Originally we may suppose auxilio-motor objects to form one
                    imperfectly differentiated continuum, but now, as with sensations, movements
                    have become a collection of special continua, viz., the groups of movements
                    possible to each limb and certain combinations of these.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Perception.</hi></p>
                <p>In treating apart of the differentiation of our sensory and motor continua, as
                    resulting merely in a number of distinguishable sensations and movements, we
                    have been compelled by the exigencies of exposition to leave out of sight
                    another process which really advances <hi rend="italic">])ari passu</hi> with
                    this differentiation, viz., the integration or synthesis of these proximately
                    elementary presentations into those complex presentations which are called
                    perceptions, intuitions, sensori-motor reactions, and the like. It is, of
                    course, not to be supposed that in the evolution of mind any creature attained
                    to such variety of distinct sensations and movements as a human being possesses
                    without making even the first step towards building up this material into the
                    most rudimentary knowledge and action. On the contrary, there is every reason to
                    think, as has been said already incidentally, that further differentiation was
                    helped by previous integration, that perception prepared the way for distincter
                    sensations, and purposive action for more various movements. This process of
                    synthesis, which is in the truest sense a psychical process, deserves some
                    general consideration before we proceed to the several complexes that result
                    from it. Most complexes, certainly the most important, are consequences of that
                    principle of subjective selection whereby interesting sensations lead through
                    the intervention of feeling to movements; and the movements that turn out to
                    subserve such interest come to have a share in it. In this way—which we need not
                    stay to examine more closely now—it happens that, in the <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit20newyrich/page/n65/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0920-0065-0052"/> alternation of sensory and motor phases which is
                    common to all psychical life, a certain sensation, comparatively intense, and a
                    certain movement, definite enough to control that sensation, engage attention in
                    immediate succession, to the more or less complete exclusion from attention of
                    the other less intense sensations and more diffused movements that accompany
                    them. Apart from this intervention of controlling movements, the
                    presentation-continuum, however much differentiated, would be for all purposes
                    of knowledge little better than the disconnected manifold for which Kant took
                    it. At the same time it is to be remembered that the subject obtains command of
                    particular movements out of all the mass involved in emotional expression only
                    because such movements prove on occurrence adapted to control certain
                    sensations. Before experience, and apart from heredity, there seems not only no
                    scientific warrant for assuming any sort of practical prescience but also none
                    for the hypothesis of <hi rend="italic">a priori</hi> forms of knowledge. Of a
                    pre-established harmony between the active and passive phases of consciousness
                    we need none, or—it may be safer to say—at least indefinitely little. A sentient
                    creature moves first of all because it feels, not because it intends. A long
                    process, in which natural selection probably played the chief part at the
                    outset—subjective selection becoming more prominent as the process advanced—must
                    have been necessary to secure as much purposive movement as even a lobster
                    displays. It seems impossible to except from this process the movements of the
                    special sense-organs which are essential to our perception of external things.
                    Here too subjective interest will explain, so far as psychological explanation
                    is possible, those syntheses of motor and sensory presentations which we call
                    spatial perceptions and intuitions of material things. For example, some of the
                    earliest lessons of this kind seem to be acquired, as we may presently see, in
                    the process of exploring the body by means of the limbs,—a process for which
                    grounds in subjective interest can obviously never be wanting.</p>
                <p>The mere process of “association ”—whereby we may suppose the synthesis of
                    presentations to be effected so that presentations originally in no way
                    connected tend to move in consciousness together—will confront us with its own
                    problems later on. We need for the present only to bear in mind that the
                    conjunction or continuity upon which the association primarily depends is one
                    determined by the movements of attention, which movements in turn depend very
                    largely upon the pleasure or pain that presentations occasion. To some extent,
                    however, there is no doubt that attention may pass non-voluntarily from one
                    indifferent presentation to another, each being sufficiently intense to give
                    what has been called a “shock of surprise,” but not so intense as to awaken
                    feeling to move for their detention or dismissal. But throughout the process of
                    mental development, where we are concerned with what is new, the range of such
                    indifference is probably small: indifferent presentations there will be, but
                    that does not matter while there are others that are interesting to take the
                    lead.</p>
                <p>Perception as a psychological term has received various, though related, meanings
                    for different writers. It is sometimes used for the recognition of a sensation
                    or movement as distinct from its mere presentation, and thus is said to imply
                    the more or less definite revival of certain residua or re-presentations of past
                    experience which resembled the present. More frequently it is used as the
                    equivalent of what has been otherwise called the “localization and projection”
                    of sensations,—that is to say, a sensation presented either as an affection of
                    some part of our own body regarded as extended or as a state of some foreign
                    body beyond it. According to the former usage, strictly taken, there might be
                    perception without any spatial presentation at all: a sensation that had been
                    attended to a few times might be perceived as familiar. Such percept being a
                    “presentative-representative” complex, and wholly sensory, we might symbolize
                    it, details apart, as ∕S ’ + s, using ∣S' for the present sensation, and s for a
                    former <hi rend="italic">S</hi> represented. According to the latter usage, an
                    entirely new sensation, provided it were complicated with motor experiences in
                    the way required for its localization or projection, would become a perception.
                    Such a perception might be roughly symbolized as <hi rend="italic">X + (Λf +
                    τn),</hi> or as <hi rend="italic">X + m</hi> simply, J∕ standing for actual
                    movements, as in ocular adjustment, which in some cases might be only former
                    movements represented or <hi rend="italic">m.</hi> But as a matter of fact
                    actual perception probably invariably includes both cases: impressions which we
                    recognize we also localize or project, and impressions which are localized or
                    projected are never entirely new,— they are, at least, perceived as sounds or
                    colours or aches, &amp;c. It will, however, frequently happen that we are
                    specially concerned with only one side of the whole process, as is the case with
                    a tea-taster or a colour-mixer on the one hand, or, on the other, with the
                    patient who is perplexed to decide whether what he sees and hears is
                    “subjective,” or whether it is “real.” Usually we have more trouble to
                    discriminate the quality of an impression than to fix it spatially; indeed this
                    latter process was taken for granted by most psychologists till recently. But,
                    however little the two sides are actually separated, it is important to mark
                    their logical distinctness, and it would be well if we had a precise name for
                    each. In any other science save psychology such names would be at once
                    forthcoming; but it seems the fate of this science to be restricted in its
                    terminology to the ill-defined and well-worn currency of common speech, with
                    which every psychologist feels at liberty to do what is right in his own eyes,
                    at least within the wide range which a loose connotation allows. If there were
                    any hope of their general acceptance we might propose to call the
                    first-mentioned process the <hi rend="italic">assimilation</hi> or <hi
                    rend="italic">recognition</hi> of an impression, and might apply the term <hi
                    rend="italic">localization</hi> to its spatial fixation, without distinguishing
                    between the body and space beyond,—a matter of the less importance as projection
                    hardly enters into primitive spatial experience. But there is still a
                    distinction called for: perception as we now know it involves not only
                    localization, or “spatial reference,” as it is not very happily termed, but
                    “objective reference” as well. We may perceive sound or light without any
                    presentation of that which sounds or shines; but none the less we do not regard
                    such sound or light as merely the object of our attention, as having only
                    immanent existence, but as the quality or change or state of a thing, an object
                    distinct not only from the subject attending but from all presentations whatever
                    to which it attends. Here again the actual separation is impossible, because
                    this factor in perception has been so intertwined throughout our mental
                    development with the other two. Still a careful psychological analysis will show
                    that such “reification,” as we might almost call it, has depended on special
                    circumstances, which we can at any rate conceive absent. These special
                    circumstances are briefly the constant conjunctions and successions of
                    impressions, for which psychology can give no reason, and the constant movements
                    to which they prompt. Thus we receive together, <hi rend="italic">e.g.,</hi>
                    those impressions we now recognize as severally the scent, colour, and “feel” of
                    the rose we pluck and handle. We might call each a “percept,” and the whole a
                    “complex percept.” But there is more in such a complex than a sum of partial
                    percepts; there is the apprehension or intuition of the rose as a thing having
                    this scent, colour, and texture. We have, then, under perception to consider
                    (i.) the assimilation and (ii.) the localization of impressions, and (iii.) the
                    intuition of things.</p>
                <p>The range of the terms assimilation or recognition of <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit20newyrich/page/n66/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0920-0066-0053"/> impressions is wide: between the simplest mental
                    process they may be supposed to denote and the most complex there is a great
                    difference. The penguin that watched unmoved the first landing of man upon its
                    lonely rock becomes as wild and wary as more civilized fowl after two or three
                    visits from its molester: it then recognizes that featherless biped. His friends
                    at home also recognize him though altered by years of peril and exposure. In the
                    latter case some trick of his voice or manner, some “striking” feature, calls up
                    and sustains a crowd of memories of the traveller in the past,—events leading on
                    to the present scene. The two recognitions are widely different, and it is from
                    state's of mind more like the latter than the former that psychologists have
                    usually drawn their description of perception. At the outset, they say, we have
                    a primary presentation or impression <hi rend="italic">P,</hi> and after sundry
                    repetitions there remains a mass or a series of <hi rend="italic">P</hi>
                    residua, <hi rend="italic">p</hi><hi rend="italic subscript"> i</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">p&lt;fp</hi><hi rend="italic subscript"> i</hi><hi rend="italic">.
                    . .;</hi> perception ensues when, sooner or later, <hi rend="italic">P</hi><hi
                    rend="italic subscript"> n</hi> “calls up” and associates itself with these
                    re-presentations or ideas. Much of our later perception, and especially when we
                    are at all interested, awakens, no doubt, both distinct memories and distinct
                    expectations; but, since these imply previous perceptions, it is obvious that
                    the earliest form of recognition, or, as we might better call it, assimilation,
                    must be free from such complications, can have nothing in it answering to the
                    overt judgment, <hi rend="italic">P</hi><hi rend="italic
                    subscript"> n</hi> is a <hi rend="italic">P.</hi> Assimilation involves
                    retentiveness and differentiation, as we have seen, and prepares the way for
                    re-presentation; but in itself there is no confronting the new with the old, no
                    determination of likeness, and no subsequent classification. The pure sensation
                    we may regard as a psychological myth; and the simple image, or such sensation
                    revived, seems equally mythical, as we may see later on. The nth sensation is
                    not like the first: it is a change in a presentation-continuum that has itself
                    been changed by those preceding; and it cannot with any propriety be said to
                    reproduce these past sensations, for they never had the individuality which such
                    reproduction implies. Nor does it associate with images like itself, since where
                    there is association there must first have been distinctness, and what can be
                    associated can also, for some good time at least, be dissociated.</p>
                <p>To treat of the localization of impressions is really to give an account of the
                    steps by which the psychological individual comes to a knowledge of space. At
                    the outset of such an inquiry it seems desirable first of all to make plain what
                    lies within our purview, and what does not, lest we disturb the peace of those
                    who, confounding philosophy and psychology, are ever eager to fight for or
                    against the <hi rend="italic">a priori</hi> character of this element of
                    knowledge. That space is <hi rend="italic">a priori</hi> in the epistemological
                    sense it is no concern of the psychologist either to assert or to deny.
                    Psychologically α <hi rend="italic">priori</hi> or original in such sense that
                    it has been either actually or potentially an element in all presentation from
                    the very beginning it certainly is not. It will help to make this matter clearer
                    if we distinguish what philosophers frequently confuse, viz., the concrete
                    spatial experiences, constituting actual localization for the individual, and
                    the abstract conception of space, generalized from what is found to be common in
                    such experiences. A gannet’s mind “possessed of” a philosopher, if such a
                    conceit may be allowed, would certainly afford its tenant very different spatial
                    experiences from those he might share if he took up his quarters in a mole. So,
                    any one who has revisited in after years a place from which he had been absent
                    since childhood knows how largely a “personal equation,” as it were, enters into
                    his spatial perceptions. Or the same truth may be brought home to him if,
                    walking with a friend more athletic than himself, they come upon a ditch, which
                    both know to be twelve feet wide, but which the one feels he can clear by a jump
                    and the other feels he cannot. In the concrete “up” is much more than a
                    different direction from “along.” The hen-harrier, which cannot soar, is
                    indifferent to a quarry a hundred feet above it—to which the peregrine, built
                    for soaring, would at once give chase— but is on the alert as soon as it
                    descries prey of the same apparent magnitude, but upon the ground. Similarly, in
                    the concrete, the body is the origin or datum to which all positions are
                    referred, and such positions differ not merely quantitatively but qualitatively.
                    Moreover, our various bodily movements and their combinations constitute a
                    network of co-ordinates, qualitatively distinguishable but geometrically, so to
                    put it, both redundant and incomplete. It is a long way from these facts of
                    perception, which the brutes share with us, to that scientific conception of
                    space as having three dimensions and no qualitative differences which we have
                    elaborated by the aid of thought and language, and which reason may see to be
                    the logical presupposition of what in the order of mental development has
                    chronologically preceded it. That the experience of space is not psychologically
                    original seems obvious—quite apart from any successful explanation of its
                    origin—from the mere consideration of its complexity. Thus we must have a
                    plurality of objects— <hi rend="italic">A</hi> out of <hi rend="italic"
                    >B,</hi><hi rend="italic">B</hi> beside <hi rend="italic">C,</hi> distant from
                    <hi rend="italic">D,</hi> and so on; and these relations of externality,
                    juxtaposition, and size or distance imply further specialization; for with a
                    mere plurality of objects we have not straightway spatial differences.
                    Juxtaposition, <hi rend="italic">e.g.,</hi> is only possible when the related
                    objects form a continuum; but, again, not any continuity is extensive. Now how
                    has this complexity come about?</p>
                <p>The first condition of spatial experience seems to lie: in what has been noted
                    above (p. 46) as the extensity of <hi rend="superscript"> i</hi> sensation. This
                    much we may allow is original; for the longer we reflect the more clearly we see
                    that no combination or association of sensations varying only in intensity and
                    quality, not even if motor presentations are added, will account for the
                    space-element in our perceptions. A series of touches α, δ, <hi rend="italic">c,
                    d</hi> may be combined with a series of movements <hi rend="italic">m</hi><hi
                    rend="italic subscript"> 1</hi><hi rend="italic">, m</hi><hi rend="italic
                    subscript"> 2</hi><hi rend="italic">, m</hi><hi rend="italic subscript">
                    3</hi><hi rend="italic">, m</hi><hi rend="italic subscript"> i</hi>; both series
                    may be reversed; and finally the touches may be presented simultaneously. In
                    this way we can attain the knowledge of the coexistence of objects that have a
                    certain quasi-distance between them, and such experience is an important element
                    in our perception of space; but it is not the whole of it. For, as has been
                    already remarked by critics of the associationist psychology, we have an
                    experience very similar to this in singing and hearing musical notes or the
                    chromatic scale. The most elaborate attempt to get extensity out of succession
                    and coexistence is that of Mr Herbert Spencer. He has done, perhaps, all that
                    can be done, and only to make it the more plain that the entire procedure is a
                    υστepov <hi rend="italic">πpoτepov.</hi> We do not first experience a succession
                    of touches or of retinal excitations by means of movements, and then, when these
                    impressions are simultaneously presented, regard them as extensive, because they
                    are associated with or symbolize the original series of movements; but, before
                    and apart from movement altogether, we experience that massiveness or extensity
                    of impressions in which movements enable us to find positions, and also to
                    measure.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>We are ever in
                    danger of exaggerating the competence of a new discovery; and the
                    associationists seem to have fallen into this mistake, not only in the use they
                    have made of the conception of association in psychology in general, but in the
                    stress they have laid upon the fact of movement when explaining our
                    space-perceptions in particular. Indeed, both ideas have here conspired against
                    them,— association in keeping up the notion that we have only to deal with a
                    plurality of discrete impressions, and movement in keeping to the front the idea
                    of sequence. Mill’s <hi rend="italic">Examination of Hamilton</hi> (3d ed., p.
                    266 <hi rend="italic">sq.)</hi> surely ought to convince us that, unless we are

                    absurdity of making the contents of consciousness extended. The edge of this
                    objection will be best turned by rendering the conception of extensity more
                    precise. Thus, suppose a postage stamp pasted on the back of the hand; we have
                    in consequence a certain sensation. If another be added beside it, the new
                    experience would not be adequately described by merely saying we have a greater
                    quantity of sensation, for intensity involves quantity, and increased intensity
                    is not what is meant. For a sensation of a certain intensity, say a sensation of
                    red, cannot be changed into one having two qualities, red anα' blue, leaving the
                    intensity unchanged; but with extensity this change is possible. For one of the
                    postage stamps a piece of wet cloth of the same size might be substituted and
                    the massiveness of the compound sensation remain very much the same. Intensity
                    belongs to what may be called graded quantity: it admits of increment or
                    decrement, but is not a sum of parts. Extensity, on the other hand, does imply
                    plurality: we might call it latent or merged plurality or a “ground” of
                    plurality, inasmuch as to say that a single presentation has massiveness is to
                    say that a portion of the presentationcontinuum at the moment undifferentiated
                    is capable of differentiation. Attributing this property of extensity to the
                    presentation-continuum as a whole, we may call the relation of any particular
                    sensation to this larger whole its <hi rend="italic">local sign,</hi> and can
                    see that, so long as the extensity of a presentation admits of diminution
                    without the presentation becoming nil, such presentation has two or more local
                    signs,—its parts, taken separately, though identical in quality and intensity,
                    having a different relation to the whole. Such difference of relation must be
                    regarded fundamentally as a ground or possibility of distinctness of
                    sign—whether as being the ground or possibility of different complexes or
                    otherwise—rather than as being from the beginning such an overt difference as
                    the term “local sign,” when used by Lotze, is meant to imply.<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>To illustrate what is meant
                    by different complexes it will be enough to refer to the psychological
                    implications of the fact that scarcely two portions of the sensitive surface of
                    the human body are anatomically alike. Not only in the distribution and
                    character of the nerve-endings but in the variety of the underlying parts—in one
                    place bone, in another fatty tissue, in others tendons or muscles variously
                    arranged—we find ample ground for diversity in “the local colouring” of
                    sensations. Λnd comparative zoology helps us to see how such diversity has been
                    developed as external impressions and the answering movements have gradually
                    differentiated an organism originally almost homogeneous and symmetrical.
                    Between one point and another on the surface of a sphere there is no ground of
                    difference; but this is no longer true if the sphere revolves round a fixed
                    axis, still less if it also runs in one direction along its axis.</p></note>
                    From this point of view we may say that more partial presentations are concerned
                    in the sensation caused by two stamps than in that caused by one. The fact that
                    these partial presentations, though identical in quality and intensity, on the
                    one hand are not wholly identical, and on the other are presented only as a
                    quantity and not as a plurality, is explained by the distinctness along with the
                    continuity of their local signs. Assuming that to every distinguishable part of
                    the body there corresponds a local sign, we may allow that at any moment only a
                    certain portion of this continuum is definitely within the field of
                    consciousness; but no one will maintain that a part of one hand is ever felt as
                    continuous with part of the other or with part of the face. This we can only
                    represent by saying that the local signs have an invariable relation to each
                    other: two continuous signs are not one day coincident and the next widely
                    separate.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>The
                    improvements in the sensibility of our “spatial sense” consequent on its
                    variations under practice, the action of drugs, &amp;c., are obviously no real
                    contradiction to this; on the contrary, such facts are all in favour of making
                    extensity a distinct factor in our space experience and one more fundamental
                    than that of movement.</p></note> This last fact is hardly perhaps implied in
                    the mere massiveness of a sensation, but it will be convenient to include it
                    when speaking of the continuum of local signs as extensive. We have, then, a
                    plurality of presentations constituting a continuum, presented simultaneously as
                    impressions and having certain fixed and invariable relations to each other. Of
                    such experience the typical case is that of passive touch, though the other
                    senses exemplify it. It must be allowed that our conception of space in like
                    manner involves a fixed continuity of positions; but then it involves, further,
                    the possibility of movement. Now in the continuum of local signs there is
                    nothing whatever of this; we might call this continuum an implicit <hi
                    rend="italic">plenum.</hi> It only becomes the presentation of <hi rend="italic"
                    >occupied space</hi> after its several local signs are complicated or
                    “associated” in an orderly way with <hi rend="italic">active</hi> touches, when
                    in fact we have experienced the contrast of movements with contact and movements
                    without, <hi rend="italic">i.e., in vacuo.</hi> It is quite true that we cannot
                    now think of this plenum except as a space, because we cannot divest ourselves
                    of these motor experiences by which we have explored it. We can, however, form
                    some idea of the difference between the perception of space and this one element
                    in the perception by contrasting massive internal sensations with massive
                    superficial ones, or the general sensation of the body as “an animated organism”
                    with our perception of it as extended.</p>
                <p>It must seem strange, if this conception of extensity is essential to a
                    psychological theory of space, that it has escaped notice so long. The reason
                    may be that in investigations into the origin of our knowledge of space it was
                    always the <hi rend="italic">conception</hi> of space and not our concrete space
                    <hi rend="italic">perceptions</hi> that came up for examination. Now in space as
                    we conceive it one position is distinguishable from another solely by its
                    co-ordinates, <hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> by the magnitude and signs of certain
                    lines and angles, as referred to a certain datum position, or origin; and these
                    elements our motor experiences seem fully to explain. But on reflexion we ought,
                    surely, to be puzzled by the question, how these coexistent positions could be
                    known before those movements were made which constitute them different
                    positions. The link we thus suspect to be missing is supplied by the more
                    concrete experiences we obtain from our own body, in which two positions have a
                    qualitative difference or “local colour” independently of movement. True, such
                    positions would not be known as spatial without movement; but neither would the
                    movement be known as spatial had those positions no other difference than such
                    as arises from movement.</p>
                <p>We may now consider the part which movement plays in elaborating the
                    presentations of this dimensionless continuum into perceptions of space. In so
                    doing we must bear in mind that this continuum implies the incopresentability of
                    two impressions having the same local sign, but allows not only of the
                    presentation of impressions of varying massiveness but of several distinct
                    impressions at the same time. As regards the motor element itself, the first
                    point of importance is the incopresentability and invariability of a series of
                    auxilio-motor presentations, <hi rend="italic">P</hi><hi rend="italic
                    subscript"> γ</hi><hi rend="italic">,P</hi><hi rend="italic subscript">
                    2</hi><hi rend="italic">,P</hi><hi rend="italic subscript"> 3</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">,P</hi><hi rend="italic subscript"> i</hi><hi rend="italic">.
                    P</hi><hi rend="italic subscript"> 1</hi> cannot be presented along with <hi
                    rend="italic">P</hi><hi rend="italic subscript"> 2</hi><hi rend="italic">,</hi>
                    and from <hi rend="italic">P</hi><hi rend="italic subscript"> i</hi> it is
                    impossible to reach <hi rend="italic">P-</hi><hi rend="italic subscript"> i</hi>
                    again save through <hi rend="italic">P</hi><hi rend="italic subscript"> 3</hi>

                    >.</hi> Such a series, taken alone, could afford us, it is evident, nothing but
                    the knowledge of an invariable sequence of impressions which it was in our own
                    power to produce. Its psychological interest would lie solely in the fact that,
                    whereas other impressions depend on an objective initiative, these depend on a
                    subjective. But in the course of the movements necessary to the exploration of
                    say, as Mill seems to do, “that the idea of space is at bottom one of time” (p.
                    276), we must admit the inadequacy of our experience of movement to explain the
                    origin of it.</p>

                <p>the body—probably our earliest lesson in spatial perception —these auxilio-motor
                    presentations receive a new significance from the active and passive touches
                    that accompany them, just as they impart to these last a significance they could
                    never have alone.</p>
                <p>It is only in the resulting complex that we have the presentations of position
                    and of spatial magnitude. For space, though conceived as a coexistent continuum,

                    accompanied by active touches without passive there arises the distinction
                    between one’s own body and foreign bodies; when the initial movement of a series
                    is accompanied by both active and passive touches, the final movement by active
                    touches only, and the intermediate movements are unaccompanied by either, we get
                    the further presentation of empty space lying between us and them,—but only when
                    by frequent experience of contacts along with those intermediate movements we
                    have come to know all movement as not only succession but change of position.
                    Thus active touches come at length to be projected, passive touches alone being
                    localized in the stricter sense. But in actual fact, of course, the localization
                    of one impression is not perfected before that of another is begun, and we must
                    take care lest our necessarily meagre exposition give rise to the mistaken
                    notion that localizing an impression consists wholly and solely in performing or
                    imaging the particular movements necessary to add active touches to a group of
                    passive impressions. That this cannot suffice is evident merely from the
                    consideration that a single position out of relation to all other positions is a
                    contradiction. Localization, though it depends on many special experiences of
                    the kind described, is not like an artificial product which is completed a part
                    at a time, but is essentially a growth, its several constituent4ocalizations
                    advancing together in definiteness and interconnexion. So far has this
                    development advanced that we do not even imagine the special movements which the
                    localization of an impression implies, that is to say, they are no longer
                    distinctly represented as they would be if we definitely intended to make them:
                    the past experiences are “retained,” but too much blended in the mere perception
                    to be appropriately spoken of as remembered or imaged.</p>
                <p>Apropos of this almost instinctive character of even our earliest spatial
                    perceptions it will be appropriate to animadvert on a misleading implicationin
                    the current use of such terms as “localization,” “projection,” “bodily
                    reference,” “spatial reference,” and the like. The implication is that external
                    space, or the body as extended, is in some sort presented or supposed apart from
                    the localization, projection, or reference of impressions to such space. That it
                    may be possible to put a book in its place on a shelf there must be (1) the
                    book, and (2), distinct and apart from it, the place on the shelf. But in the
                    evolution of our spatial experience impressions and positions are not thus
                    presented apart. We <hi rend="italic">can</hi> have, or at least we can suppose,
                    an impression which is recognized without being localized; but if it <hi
                    rend="italic">is</hi> localized this means that a more complex presentation is
                    formed by the addition of new elements, not that a second distinct object is
                    presented and some indescribable connexion established between the impression
                    and it, still less that the impression is referred to something not strictly
                    presented at all. The truth is that the body as extended is from the
                    psychological point of view not perceived at all apart from localized
                    impressions. In like manner impressions projected (or the absence of impressions
                    projected) constitute all that is perceived as the occupied (or unoccupied)
                    space beyond. It is not till a much later stage, after many varying experiences
                    of different impressions similarly localized or projected, that even the mere
                    materials are present for the formation of such an abstract conception of space
                    as “spatial reference” implies. Psychologists, being themselves at this later
                    stage, are apt to commit the oversight of introducing it into the earlier stage
                    which they have to expound.</p>
                <p>In a complex presentation, such as that of an orange or a piece of wax, may be
                    distinguished the following points concerning which psychology may be expected
                    to give an account :—(a) its reality, <hi rend="italic">(b)</hi> its solidity or
                    occupation of space, (c) its permanence, or rather its continuity in time,
                    (&lt;∕) its unity and complexity, and (e) its substantiality and the connexion
                    of its attributes and powers. Though, in fact, these items are most intimately
                    blended, our exposition will be clearer if we consider each for a moment
                    apart.</p>
                <p>(a) The terms actuality and reality have each more than one meaning. Thus what is
                    real, in the sense of material, is opposed to what is mental; as the existent or
                    actual it is opposed to the non-existent; and again, what is actual is
                    distinguished from what is possible or necessary. But here both terms, with a
                    certain shade of difference, in so far as actual is more appropriate to
                    movements and events, are used, in antithesis to whatever is ideal or
                    represented, for what is sense-given or presented. This seems at least their
                    primary psychological meaning; and it is the one most in vogue in English
                    philosophy at any rate, over-tinged as that is with psychology.<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Thus Locke says, “Our simple
                    ideas <hi rend="italic">[i.e.,</hi> presentations or impressions, as we should

                    Know.,</hi> part i, § 33).</p></note> Any examination of this characteristic
                    will be best deferred till we come to deal with ideation generally (see p. 58
                    below). Meanwhile it may suffice to remark that reality or actuality is not a
                    single distinct element added to the others which enter into the complex
                    presentation we call a thing, as colour or solidity may be. Neither is it a
                    special relation among these elements, like that of substance and attribute, for
                    example. In these respects the real and the ideal, the actual and the possible,
                    are alike; all the elements or qualities within the complex, and all the
                    relations of those elements to each other, are the same in the rose represented
                    as in the presented rose. The difference turns not upon what these elements are,
                    regarded as qualities or relations presented or represented, but upon whatever
                    it is that distinguishes the presentation from the representation of any given
                    qualities or relations. Now this, as we shall see, turns partly upon the
                    relation of such complex presentation to other presentations in consciousness
                    with it, partly upon its relation as a presentation to the subject whose
                    presentation it is. In this respect we find a difference, not only between the
                    simple qualities, such as cold, hard, red, and sweet in strawberry ice, <hi
                    rend="italic">e.g.,</hi> as presented and as represented, but also, though less
                    conspicuously, in the spatial, and even the temporal, relations which enter into
                    our intuition as distinct from our imagination of it. Where no such difference
                    exists we have passed beyond <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit20newyrich/page/n69/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0920-0069-0056"/> the distinction of percept and image to the
                    higher level of conception and thought. So, then, reality or actuality is not
                    strictly an item by itself, but a characteristic of all the items that
                    follow.</p>
                <p>(ft) Here our properly motor presentations or “feelings of effort or innervation”
                    come specially into play. They are not entirely absent in those movements of
                    exploration by which we attain a knowledge of space; but it is when these
                    movements are definitely resisted, or are only possible by increased effort,
                    that we reach the full meaning of body as that which occupies space. Heat and
                    cold, light and sound, the natural man regards as real, and by and by perhaps as
                    due to the powers of things known or unknown, but not as themselves things. At
                    the outset things are all corporeal like his own body, the first and archetypal
                    thing, that is to say: things are intuited only when touch is accompanied by
                    pressure; and, though at a later stage passive touch without pressure may
                    suffice, this is only because pressures depending on a subjective initiative,
                    <hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> on voluntary muscular exertion, have been
                    previously experienced. It is of more than psychological interest to remark how
                    the primordial factor in materiality is thus due to the projection of a
                    subjectively determined reaction to that action of a not-self on which
                    sense-impressions depend,— an action of the not-self which, of course, is not
                    known as such till this projection of the subjective reaction has taken place.
                    Still we must remember that accompanying sense-impressions are a condition of
                    its projection: muscular effort without simultaneous sensations of contact would
                    not yield the distinct presentation of the resistant occupying the space into
                    which we have moved and would move again. Nay more, it is in the highest degree
                    an essential circumstance in this experience that muscular effort, though
                    subjectively initiated, is still only possible when there is contact with
                    something that, as it seems, is making an effort the counterpart of our own. But
                    this something is so far no more than thing-stuff; without the elements next to
                    be considered our psychological individual would fall short of the complete
                    intuition of distinct things.</p>
                <p>(c) The remaining important factors in the psychological constitution of things
                    might be described in general terms as the time-relations of their components.
                    Such relations are themselves in no way psychologically determined; impressions
                    recur with a certain order or want of order quite independently of the subject’s
                    interest or of any psychological principles of synthesis or association
                    whatever. It is essential that impressions should recur, and recur as they have
                    previously occurred, if knowledge is ever to begin; out of a continual chaos of
                    sensation, all matter and no form, such as some philosophers describe, nothing
                    but chaos could result. But a flux of impressions having this real or
                    sense-given order will not suffice; there must be also attention to and
                    retention of the order, and these indispensable processes at least are
                    psychological. Still they need not be further emphasized here, nor would it have
                    been necessary at this point to call them to mind at all had not British
                    empirical philosophers brought psychology into disrepute by overlooking them
                    altogether.</p>
                <p>But for its familiarity we should marvel at the fact that out of the variety of
                    impressions simultaneously presented we do not instantly group together all the
                    sounds and all the colours, all the touches and all the smells, but, dividing
                    what is given together, single out a certain sound or smell as belonging with a
                    certain colour and feel, similarly singled out from the rest, to what we call
                    one thing. We might wonder, too—those at least who have made so much of
                    association by similarity ought to wonder—that, say, the white of snow calls up
                    directly, not other shades of white or other colours, but the expectation of
                    cold or of powdery softness. The first step in this process has been the
                    simultaneous projection into the same occupied space of the several impressions
                    which we thus come to regard as the qualities of the body filling it. Yet such
                    simultaneous and coincident projection would avail but little unless the
                    constituent impressions were again and again repeated in like order so as to
                    prompt anew the same grouping, and unless, further, this constancy in the one
                    group was present along with changes in other groups and in the general field.
                    There is nothing in its first experience to tell the infant that the song of the
                    bird does not inhere in the hawthorn whence the notes proceed, but that the
                    fragrance of the may-flower does. It is only where a group, as a whole, has been
                    found to change its position relatively to other groups, and —apart from causal
                    relations—to be independent of changes of position among them, that such
                    complexes can become distinct unities and yield a world of things. Again,
                    because things are so often a world within themselves, their several parts or
                    members not only having distinguishing qualities but moving and changing with
                    more or less independence of the rest, it comes about that what is from one
                    point of view one thing becomes from another point of view several,—like a tree
                    with its separable branches and fruits, for example. Wherein, then, more
                    precisely, does the unity of a thing consist Î This question, so far as it here
                    admits of answer, carries us over to temporal continuity.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">(d)</hi> Amidst all the change above described there is one
                    thing comparatively fixed: our own body is both constant as a group and a
                    constant item in every field of groups; and not only so, but it is beyond all
                    other things an object of constant and peculiar interest, inasmuch as our
                    earliest pleasures and pains depend solely upon it and what affects it. The body
                    becomes, in fact, the earliest form of self, the first datum for our later
                    conceptions of permanence and individuality. A continuity like that of self is
                    then transferred to other bodies which resemble our own, so far as our direct
                    experience goes, in passing continuously from place to place and undergoing only
                    partial and gradual changes of form and quality. As we have existed—or, more
                    exactly, as the body has been continuously presented—during the interval between
                    two encounters with some other recognized body, so this is regarded as having
                    continuously existed during its absence from us. However permanent we suppose
                    the conscious subject to be, it is hard to see how, without the continuous
                    presentation to it of such a group as the bodily self, we should ever be
                    prompted to resolve the discontinuous presentations of external things into a
                    continuity of existence. It might be said: “Since the second presentation of a
                    particular group would, by the mere workings of psychical laws, coalesce or
                    become identical with the image of the first, this coalescence suffices to ‘
                    generate ’ the conception of continued existence.” But such assimilation is only
                    the ground of an intellectual identification and furnishes no motive, one way or
                    the other, for resolving two like things into the same thing: between a second
                    presentation of A and the presentation at different times of two A’s there is so
                    far no difference. Real identity no more involves exact similarity than exact
                    similarity involves sameness of things; on the contrary, we are wont to find the
                    same thing alter with time, so that exact similarity after an interval, so far
                    from suggesting one thing, is often the surest proof that there are two
                    concerned. Of such real identity, then, it would seem we must have direct
                    experience; and we have it in the continuous presentation of the bodily self;
                    apart from this it could not be “generated” by association among changing
                    presentations. Other bodies being in the first instance personified, that then
                    is regarded as one thing—from whatever point of view we look at it, whether <pb

                    of such parts—which has had one beginning in time. But what is it that has thus
                    a beginning and continues indefinitely 1 This leads to our last point.</p>
                <p>(e) So far we have been concerned only with the combination of sensory and motor
                    presentations into groups and with the differentiation of group from group; the
                    relations to each other of the constituents of each group still for the most
                    part remain. To these relations in the main must be referred the correlative
                    conceptions of substance and attribute, the distinction in substances of
                    qualities and powers, of primary qualities and secondary, and the like.<note

                    thing and its properties, like all the foregoing distinctions, is one that might
                    be more fully treated under the head of “Thought and Conception.” Still,
                    inasmuch as the material warrant for these concepts is contained more or less
                    implicitly in our percepts, some consideration of it is in place
                    here.</p></note></p>
                <p>Of all the constituents of things only one is universally present, that above
                    described as physical solidity, which presents itself according to circumstances
                    as impenetrability, resistance, or weight. Things differing in temperature,
                    colour, taste, and smell agree in resisting compression, in filling space.
                    Because of this quality we regard the wind as a thing, though it has neither
                    shape nor colour, while a shadow, though it has both but not resistance, is the
                    very type of nothingness. This constituent is invariable, while other qualities
                    are either absent or change,—form altering, colour disappearing with light,
                    sound and smells intermitting. Many of the other qualities—colour, temperature,
                    sound, smell—increase in intensity until we reach and touch a body occupying
                    space; with the same movement too its visual magnitude varies. At the moment of
                    contact an unvarying tactual magnitude is ascertained, while the other qualities
                    and the visual magnitude reach a fixed maximum; then first it becomes possible
                    by effort to change or attempt to change the position and form of what we
                    apprehend. This tangible plenum we thenceforth regard as the seat and source of
                    all the qualities we project into it. In other words, that which occupies space
                    is psychologically the substantial; the other real constituents are but its
                    properties or attributes, the marks or manifestations which lead us to expect
                    its presence.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Imagination or Ideation.</hi></p>
                <p>Before the intuition of things has reached a stage so complete and definite as
                    that just described, imagination or ideation as distinct from perception has
                    well begun. In passing to the consideration of this higher form of mental life
                    we have to note the distinction between impressions and images or ideas, to
                    which Hume first gave general currency. Hume did not think it “necessary to
                    employ many words in explaining this distinction. Every one of himself will
                    readily perceive the difference . . .; though it is not impossible but in
                    particular instances they may very nearly approach to each other. Thus in sleep,
                    in a fever, in madness, or in any very violent emotions of soul, our ideas may
                    approach to our impressions; as, on the other hand, it sometimes happens our
                    impressions are so faint and low that we cannot distinguish them from our
                    ideas.”<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi
                    rend="italic">Treatise of Human Nature,</hi> book i. part i. § 1.</p></note> In
                    most cases, no doubt, the obvious difference in intensity, or, as Hume puts it,
                    “in the force or liveliness with which they strike upon the mind,” is a
                    sufficient characteristic, but we must examine a good deal further and pay more
                    attention to his uncertain cases if this important distinction is ever to be in
                    any sense psychologically “explained.”</p>
                <p>To begin with, it is very questionable whether Hume was right in applying Locke’s
                    distinction of simple and complex to ideas in the narrower sense as well as to
                    im pressions. “That idea of red,” says Hume, “which we form in the dark and that
                    impression which strikes our eyes in the sunshine differ only in degree, not in
                    nature.”<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi
                    rend="italic">Ibid.</hi></p></note> But what he seems to overlook is that,
                    whereas there can be a mere sensation red—and such a presentation may for
                    present purposes be regarded as simple—we can only have an image or
                    representation of a red thing or a red form, <hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> of red
                    in some way ideally projected or intuited. In other words, there are no ideas
                    answering to simple or isolated impressions: what are revived in memory and
                    imagination are percepts, not unlocalized sensations and movements. It is not
                    only that we cannot now directly observe such representations,—because, for that
                    matter, we can no longer directly observe even the original presentations as
                    merely elementary impressions; the point rather is that ideas as such are from
                    the first complex, and do not begin to appear in consciousness apart from the
                    impressions which they are said to reproduce till after these impressions have
                    been frequently attended to together, and have been more or less firmly
                    synthesized into percepts or intuitions.</p>
                <p>The effects of even the earliest of these syntheses or “associations” of
                    impressions must of course in some way persist, or progress in perception would
                    be impossible. On this account it has been usual to say that “perception”
                    implies both “memory” and “imagination”; but such a statement can be allowed
                    only so long as these terms are vaguely used. The dog’s mouth waters only at the
                    <hi rend="italic">sight</hi> of food, but the gourmand’s mouth will also water
                    at the <hi rend="italic">thought</hi> of it. We recognize the smell of violets
                    as certainly as we recognize the colour when the spring brings them round again;
                    but few persons, if any, can recall the scent when the flower has gone, so as to
                    say with Shelley—</p>
                <p>“Odours, when sweet violets sicken, Live within the sense they quicken ’’—</p>
                <p>though most can recall the colour with tolerable clearness. In like manner
                    everybody can perform innumerable complex voluntary movements which only a few
                    can mentally rehearse or describe without the prompting of actual execution. And
                    not only does such reproduction as suffices for perception fall short of that
                    involved in reminiscence or memory in the narrower sense, but the manner in
                    which the constituent elements in a perception are combined differs materially
                    from what is strictly to be called the association of ideas. To realize this
                    difference we need only to observe first how the sight of a suit of polished
                    armour, for example, instantly reinstates and steadily maintains all that we
                    retain of former sensations of its hardness and smoothness and coldness, and
                    then to observe how this same sight gradually calls up ideas now of tournaments,
                    now of crusades, and so through all the changing imagery of romance. Though the
                    percept is complex, it is but a single whole, and the act of perception is
                    single too; but, where, as is the case in memory and imagination, attention
                    passes, whether voluntarily or non - voluntarily, from one representation to
                    another, it is obvious that these several objects of attention are still
                    distinct and that it is directed in turn to each. The term “association” seems
                    only appropriate to the latter. To the connexion of the partial presentations in
                    a complex, whether perception or idea, it would be better to apply the term
                    “complication,” which was used in this sense by Herbart, and has been so used by
                    many psychologists since. When we perceive an orange by sight we may say that
                    its taste or feel is represented, when we perceive it by touch we may in like
                    manner say that its colour is represented, symbolizing the whole complex in the
                    first case sufficiently for our present purpose as <hi rend="italic">Ctf,</hi>
                    in the second as <hi rend="italic">F</hi><hi rend="italic">c t.</hi> We might
                    also symbolize the idea of an orange as seen by <hi rend="italic">d tf</hi> and
                    the idea of an orange as felt by <hi rend="italic">f' c t,</hi> using the
                    accented letter to signify that different constituents are dominant in the two
                    cases. What we have, then, to observe is briefly (1) that the processes by which
                    the whole complex c' <hi rend="italic">tf</hi> or <hi rend="italic">f' ct</hi>
                    is brought into consciousness differ importantly from the process by which <hi
                    rend="italic">C</hi> or <hi rend="italic">F</hi> reinstates and maintains <hi
                    rend="italic">tf ov ct,</hi> and (2) that <hi rend="italic">c, t,</hi> and
                    /never have that distinct existence as representations which they had as
                    presentations or impressions.</p>
                <p>The mental synthesis which has taken place in the evolution of the percept can
                    only partially fail in the idea, and never so far as to leave us with a chaotic
                    “manifold” of mere sensational remnants. On the contrary, we find that in
                    “constructive imagination” a new kind of effort is often requisite in order to
                    dissociate these representational complexes<pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit20newyrich/page/n71/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0920-0071-0058"/> as a preliminary to new combinations. But it is
                    doubtful whether the results of such an analysis are ever the ultimate elements
                    of the percept, that is, merely isolated impressions in a fainter form. We may
                    now try to ascertain further the characteristic marks which distinguish what is
                    imaged from what is perceived.</p>
                <p>The most obvious, if not the most invariable, difference is that which, as we
                    have seen, Hume calls the superior force or liveliness of primary presentations
                    as compared with secondary presentations. But what exactly are we to understand
                    by this somewhat figurative language? A simple difference of intensity cannqt be
                    all that is meant, for, though we may be momentarily confused, we can perfectly
                    well distinguish the faintest impression from an image, and yet can hardly
                    suppose the faintest impression to be intenser than the most lively image.
                    Moreover, we can reproduce such faintest impressions in idea, so that, if
                    everything depended on intensity, we should be committed to the gratuitous
                    supposition that secondary presentations can secure attention with a less
                    intensity than is required for primary presentations. The whole subject of the
                    intensity of representations awaits investigation. Between moonlight and
                    sunlight or between midday and dawn we could discriminate many grades of
                    intensity; but it does not appear that there is any corresponding variation of
                    intensity between them when they are not seen but imagined. Many persons suppose
                    they can imagine a waxing or a waning sound or the gradual abatement of an
                    intense pain; but what really happens in such cases is probably not a rise and
                    fall in the intensity of a single representation, but a change in the complex
                    represented. In the primary presentation there has been a change of quality
                    along with change of intensity, and not only so, but most frequently a change in
                    the muscular adaptations of the sense-organs too, to say nothing of organic
                    sensations accompanying these changes. A representation of some or all of these
                    attendants is perhaps what takes place when variations of intensity are supposed
                    to be reproduced. Again, hallucinations are often described as abnormally
                    intense images which simply, by reason of their intensity, are mistaken for
                    percepts. But such statement, though supported by very high authority, is almost
                    certainly false, and would probably never have been made if physiological and
                    epistemological considerations had been excluded as they ought to have been.
                    Hallucinations, when carefully examined, seem just as much as percepts to
                    contain among their constituents some primary presentation—either a so-called
                    subjective sensation of sight and hearing or some organic sensation due to
                    deranged circulation or secretion. Now we have noticed already incidentally in a
                    preceding paragraph that primary presentations reinstate and maintain the
                    representational constituents of a percept in a manner very different from that
                    in which what are unmistakably ideas reproduce each other. The intensity and
                    steadiness of the impressional elements are, as it were, shared by the
                    ideational elements in a complex containing both. Intensity alone, then, will
                    not suffice to discriminate, neither will extremes of intensity alone lead us to
                    confuse, impressions and images.</p>
                <p>The superior steadiness just mentioned is perhaps a more constant and not less
                    striking characteristic of percepts. Ideas are not only in a continual flux, but
                    even when we attempt forcibly to detain one it varies continually in clearness
                    and completeness, reminding one of nothing so much as of the illuminated devices
                    made of gas jets, common at fêtes, when the wind sweeps across them, momentarily
                    obliterating one part and at the same time intensifying another. There is not
                    this perpetual flow and flicker in what we perceive; for this, unlike the train
                    of ideas, has at the outset neither a logical nor a psychological continuity.
                    The impressions entering consciousness at any one moment are psychologically
                    independent of each other; they are equally independent of the impressions and
                    images presented the moment before —independent, <hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> as
                    regards their order and character, not, of course, as regards the share of
                    attention they secure. Attention to be concentrated in one direction must be
                    withdrawn from another, and images may absorb it to the exclusion of impressions
                    as readily as a first impression to the exclusion of a second. But, when
                    attention <hi rend="italic">is</hi> secured, a faint impression has a fixity and
                    definiteness lacking in the case of even vivid ideas. One ground for this
                    definiteness and independence lies in the localization or projection which
                    accompanies all perception. But why, if so, it might be asked, do we not
                    confound percept and image when what we imagine is imagined as definitely
                    localized and projected? Because we have a contrary percept to give the image
                    the lie; where this fails, as in dreams, or where, as in hallucination, the
                    image obtains in other ways the fixity characteristic of impressions, such
                    confusion does in fact result. But in normal waking life we have the whole
                    presentation-continuum, as it were, occupied and in operation: we are distinctly
                    conscious of being embodied and having our senses about us.</p>
                <p>This contrariety between impression and image suggests, however, a deeper
                    question: we may ask, not how it is resolved, but how it is possible. With eyes
                    wide open, and while clearly aware of the actual field of sight and its filling,
                    one can recall or imagine a wholly different scene: lying warm in bed one can
                    imagine oneself out walking in the cold. It is useless to say the terms are
                    different, that what is perceived is present and what is imaged is past or
                    future.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Moreover, as we
                    shall see, the distinction between present and past or future psychologically
                    presupposes the contrast of impression and image.</p></note> The images, it is
                    true, have certain temporal marks—of which more presently—by which they may be
                    referred to past or future; but as imaged they <hi rend="italic">are</hi>
                    present, and, as we have just observed, are regarded as both actual and present
                    in the absence of correcting impressions. We cannot at once see the sky red and
                    blue; how is it we can imagine it the one while perceiving it to be the other?
                    When we attempt to make the field of sight at once red and blue, as in looking
                    through red glass with one eye and through blue glass with the other, either the
                    colours merge and we see a purple sky or we see the sky first of the one colour
                    and then of the other in irregular alternation. That this does not happen
                    between impression and image shows that, whatever their connexion, images
                    altogether are distinct from the presentation-continuum and cannot with strict
                    propriety be spoken of as revived or reproduced impressions. This difference is
                    manifest in another respect, viz., when we compare the effects of diffusion in
                    the two cases. An increase in the intensity of a sensation of touch entails an
                    increase in the extensity; an increase of muscular innervation entails
                    irradiation to adjacent muscles; but when a particular idea becomes clearer and
                    more distinct there rises into consciousness an associated idea qualitatively
                    related probably to impressions of quite another class, as when the smell of tar
                    calls up memories of the sea-beach and fishing-boats. Since images are thus
                    distinct from impressions, and yet so far continuous with each other as to form
                    a train in itself unbroken, we should be justified, if it were convenient, in
                    speaking of images as changes in a representation-or memory-continuum; and later
                    on we may see that this is convenient.</p>
                <p>Impressions, then, have no associates to whose presence their own is accommodated
                    and on whose intensity their own depends. Each bids independently for attention,
                    so <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit20newyrich/page/n72/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0920-0072-0059"/> that often a state of distraction ensues, such as
                    the train of ideas left to itself never occasions. The better to hear we listen;
                    the better to see we look; to smell better we dilate the nostrils and sniff; and
                    so with all the special senses: each sensory impression sets up nascent
                    movements for its better reception.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>Organic sensations, though distinguishable from images by
                    their definite though often anatomically inaccurate localization, furnish no
                    clear evidence of such adaptations. But in another respect they are still more
                    clearly marked off from images, viz., by the pleasure or pain they directly
                    occasion.</p></note> In like manner there is also an adjustment for images which
                    can be distinguished from sensory adjustments almost as readily as these are
                    distinguished from each other. We become most aware of this, as, <hi
                    rend="italic">mutatis</hi><hi rend="italic">mutandis,</hi> we do of them, when
                    we voluntarily concentrate attention upon particular ideas instead of remaining
                    mere passive spectators, as it were, of the general procession. To this
                    ideational adjustment may be referred most of the strain and “head-splitting”
                    connected with recollecting, reflecting, and all that people call headwork; and
                    the “absent look” of one intently thinking or absorbed in reverie seems directly
                    due to the absence of sensory adjustment that accompanies the concentration of
                    attention upon ideas.</p>
                <p>But, distinct as they are, impressions and images are still closely connected. In
                    the first place, there are two or three well-marked intermediate stages, so
                    that, though we cannot observe it, we seem justified in assuming a steady
                    transition from the one to the other. As the first of such intermediate stages,
                    it is usual to reckon what are often, and—so far as psychology
                    goes—inaccurately, styled after-images. They would be better described as
                    aftersensations, except perlaps when the sense of sight is specially in
                    question, inasmuch as they are due either (1) to the persistence of the original
                    peripheral excitation after the stimulus is withdrawn, or (2) to the effects of
                    the exhaustion or the repair that immediately follows this excitation. In the
                    former case they are qualitatively identical with the original sensation and are
                    called “positive,” in the latter they are complementary to it and are called
                    “negative” (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Eye,</hi> vol. viii. p. 823). These last,
                    then, of which we have clear instances only in connexion with sight, are
                    obviously in no sort re-presentations of the original impression, but a sequent
                    presentation of diametrically opposite quality; while positive after-sensations
                    are, psychologically regarded, nothing but the original sensations in a state of
                    evanescence. It is this continuance and gradual waning after the physical
                    stimulus has completely ceased that give after-sensations their chief title to a
                    place in the transition from impression to image. There is, however, another
                    point of resemblance: aftersensations are less affected by movement. If we turn
                    away our eyes we cease to see the flame at which we have been looking, but the
                    after-image remains and is projected upon the wall, and continues still
                    localized in the dark field of sight even if we close our eyes altogether. But
                    the fact that movement affects their localization, though it does not exclude
                    them, and the fact also that we are distinctly aware of our sense-organs being
                    concerned in their presentation, both serve to mark them off as primary and not
                    secondary presentations. The after-sensation is in reality more elementary than
                    either the preceding percept or its image. In both these, in the case of sight,
                    objects appear in space of three dimensions, <hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> with
                    all the marks of solidity and perspective;<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>The following scant quotation from Fechner, one of the best
                    observers in this department, must suffice in illustration. “Lying awake in the
                    early morning after daybreak, with my eyes motionless though open, there usually
                    appears, when I chance to close them for a moment, the black after-image of the
                    white bed immediately before me and the white after-image of the black
                    stove-pipe some distance away against the opposite wall. . . . Both
                    [after-images] appear as if they were in juxtaposition in the same plane; and,
                    though—when my eyes are open—I seem to see the white bed in its entire length,
                    the after-image—when my eyes are shut—presents instead only a narrow black
                    stripe owing to the fact that the bed is seen considerably foreshortened. But
                    the memory-image on the other hand completely reproduces the pictorial illusion
                    as it appears when the eyes are open <hi rend="superscript"> ,k</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">{Elemente der Psychophysik,</hi> ii. p. 473).</p></note> but the
                    so-called after-image lacks all these. Still further removed from normal
                    sensations <hi rend="italic">(i.e.,</hi> sensations determined by the stimuli
                    appropriate to the sense-organ) are the “recurrent sensations” often unnoticed
                    but probably experienced more or less frequently by everybody—cases, that is, in
                    which sights or sounds, usually such as at the time were engrossing and
                    impressive, suddenly reappear several hours or even days after the physical
                    stimuli, as well as their effects on the terminal senseorgan, seem entirely to
                    have ceased. Thus workers with the microscope often see objects which they have
                    examined during the day stand out clearly before them in the dark; it was indeed
                    precisely such an experience that led the anatomist Henle first to call
                    attention to these facts. But he and others have wrongly referred them to what
                    he called a “sense-memory”; all that we know is against the supposition that the
                    eye or the ear has any power to retain and reproduce percepts. “Recurrent
                    sensations” have all the marks of percepts which after-images lack; they only
                    differ from what are more strictly called “hallucinations” in being, as regards
                    form and quality, exact reproductions of the original impression and in being
                    independent of all subjective suggestion determined by emotion or mental
                    derangement.</p>
                <p>In what Fechner has called the “memory-after-image,” or primary memory-image, as
                    it is better termed, we have the ordinary image in its earliest form. As an
                    instance of what is meant may be cited the familiar experience that a knock at
                    the door, the hour struck on the clock, the face of a friend whom we have passed
                    unnoticed, may sometimes be recognized a few moments later by means of the
                    persisting image, although the actual impression was entirely disregarded. But
                    the primary memory-image can always be obtained, and is obtained to most
                    advantage, by looking intently at some object for an instant and then closing
                    the eyes or turning them away. The object is then imaged for a moment very
                    vividly and distinctly, and can be so recovered several times in succession by
                    an effort of attention. Such reinstatement is materially helped by rapidly
                    opening and closing the eyes, or by suddenly moving them in any way. In this
                    respect a primary memory-image resembles an after-sensation, which can be
                    repeatedly revived in this manner when it would otherwise have disappeared. But
                    in other respects the two are very different: the aftersensation is necessarily
                    presented if the intensity and direction of the original excitation suflice for
                    its production, and cannot be presented, however much we attend, if they do not.
                    Moreover, the after-sensation is only for a moment positive, and then passes
                    into the negative or complementary phase, when, so far from even contributing
                    towards the continuance of the original percept, it directly hinders it. Primary
                    memory-images, on the other hand, and indeed all images, depend mainly upon the
                    attention given to the impression; provided that was sufficient the faintest
                    impression may be long retained, and without it very intense ones will soon
                    leave no trace. The primary memoryimage retains so much of its original
                    definiteness and intensity as to make it possible with great accuracy to compare
                    two physical phenomena, one of which is in this way remembered while the other
                    is really present; for the most part this is indeed a more accurate procedure
                    than that of dealing with both together. But this is only possible for a very
                    short time. From Weber’s experiments with weights and lines<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi rend="italic">Die Lehre vom
                    Tastsinne,</hi> &amp;c., p. 86 <hi rend="italic">sq.</hi></p></note> it would
                    appear that even after <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit20newyrich/page/n73/mode/1up"

                    and after 100 seconds all that is distinctive of the primary image has probably
                    ceased.</p>
                <p>On the whole, then, it appears that the ordinary memoryimage is a joint effect;
                    it is not the mere residuum of changes in the presentation-continuum, but an
                    effect of these only when there has been some concentration of attention upon
                    them. It has the form of a percept, but is not constituted of “revived
                    impressions,” for the essential marks of impressions are absent; there is no
                    localization or projection, neither is there the motor adaptation, nor the tone
                    of feeling, incident to the réception of impressions. Ideas do not reproduce the
                    intensity of these original constituents, but only their quality and
                    complication. What we call the vividness of an idea is of the nature of
                    intensity, but it is an intensity very partially and indirectly determined by
                    that of the original impression; it depends much more upon the state of the
                    memory-continuum and the attention the idea receives. The range of vividness in
                    ideas is probably comparatively small; what are called variations in vividness
                    are often really variations in distinctness and completeness.<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>As we have seen that there is
                    a steady transition from percept to image, so, if space allowed, the study of
                    hallucinations might make clear an opposite and abnormal process—the passage,
                    that is to say, of images into percepts, for such, to all intents and purposes,
                    are hallucinations of perception, psychologically regarded.</p></note> Where we
                    have great intensity, as in hallucinations, primary presentations may be
                    reasonably supposed to enter into the complex.</p>
                <p>It is manifest that the memory-continuum has been in some way formed out of or
                    differentiated from the presentation-continuum by the movements of attention,
                    but the precise connexion of the two continua is still very difficult to
                    determine. We see perhaps the first distinct step of this evolution in the
                    primary memory-image: here there has been no cessation in presentation and yet
                    the characteristic marks of the impression are gone, so much so, indeed, that
                    superposition without “fusion” with an exactly similar impression is possible.
                    In this manner we. seem to have several primary images in the field of
                    consciousness together, as when we cwunt up the strokes of the clock after it
                    has ceased striking. But, though the image thus first arises in the field of
                    consciousness as a sort of <hi rend="italic">απόρροια</hi> or emanation from the
                    presentation-continuum, its return (at which stage it first becomes a proper
                    re-presentation) is never determined directly and solely by a second
                    presentation like that which first gave it being. Its “revival” is not another
                    birth. With a second impression exactly like the first we should have
                    assimilation or simple recognition—an identity of the indiscernible which
                    precludes the individual distinctness required in representation. But how, then,
                    was this distinctness in the first instance possible in the series of primary
                    images just referred to as being due to the repetition of the same presentation?
                    Seemingly to differences in the rest of that field of consciousness in which
                    each in turn occurred and to some persistence of these differences. If the whole
                    field which the second impression entered had been just like the field of the
                    first it is hard to see what ground for distinctness there would have been. When
                    such second impression does not occur till after the primary memory-image has
                    ceased, a representation is still possible provided the new impression can
                    reinstate sufficient of the mental framing of the old to give the image
                    individual distinctness. This is really what happens in what is ordinarily
                    called “association by similarity,”—similarity, that is, in the midst of some
                    diversity. Our inquiry into the connexion between presentations and
                    representations has thus brought us to the general consideration of mental
                    association.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Mental Association and the Memory-continuum.</hi></p>
                <p>Only a very brief treatment of this important subject is permissible here, as it
                    has already been handled at length under <hi rend="smallcaps">Association of
                    Ideas</hi><hi rend="italic">(q.v.').</hi> Great confusion has been occasioned,
                    as we have seen incidentally, by the lax use of the term “association”; this
                    confusion has been increased by a further laxity in the use of the term
                    “association by similarity.” In so far as the similarity amounts to identity, as
                    in assimilation, we have a process which is more fundamental than association by
                    contiguity, but then it is not a process of association. Yet, when the reviving
                    presentation is only partially similar to the presentation revived, the nature
                    of the association does not appear to differ from that operative when one
                    “contiguous” presentation revives another. In the one case we have, say, <hi
                    rend="italic">ab</hi><hi rend="italic">X</hi> recalling <hi rend="italic">a b
                    y</hi> and in the other <hi rend="italic">a b c</hi> recalling <hi rend="italic"
                    >def.</hi> Now anybody λvho will reflect must surely see that the similarity
                    between <hi rend="italic">a b x</hi> and <hi rend="italic">a b y,</hi> as
                    distinct from the identity of their partial constituent <hi rend="italic">a
                    b,</hi> cannot be the means of recall; for this similarity is nothing but the
                    state of mind—to be studied presently—which results when <hi rend="italic">a b
                    x</hi> and <hi rend="italic">ab</hi><hi rend="italic">y,</hi> having been
                    recalled, are in consciousness together and then <hi rend="italic"
                    >compared.</hi> But, if <hi rend="italic">a b,</hi> having concurred with <hi
                    rend="italic">y</hi> before and being now present in <hi rend="italic">a b
                    x,</hi> again revives <hi rend="italic">y,</hi> the association, so far as that
                    goes, is manifestly one of contiguity, albeit the state of mind immediately
                    incident as soon as the revival is complete be what Dr Bain loves to style “the
                    flash of similarity.” So far as the mere revival itself goes, there is no more
                    similarity in this case than there is when <hi rend="italic">a b c</hi> revives
                    <hi rend="italic">def.</hi> For the very <hi rend="italic">a</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">b</hi><hi rend="italic">c</hi> that now operates as the reviving
                    presentation was obviously never in time contiguous with the <hi rend="italic"
                    >def</hi> that is revived; if all traces of previous experiences of <hi
                    rend="italic">a</hi><hi rend="italic">b</hi><hi rend="italic">c</hi> were
                    obliterated there would be no revival. In other words, the <hi rend="italic"
                    >a</hi><hi rend="italic">b</hi><hi rend="italic">c</hi> now present must be
                    “automatically associated,” or, as we prefer to say, must be assimilated to
                    those residua of <hi rend="italic">a</hi><hi rend="italic">b</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">c</hi> which were “contiguous” with <hi rend="italic">def</hi>
                    before its representation can occur. And this, and nothing more than this, we
                    have seen, is all the “similarity” that could be at work when <hi rend="italic"
                    >a</hi><hi rend="italic">b</hi><hi rend="italic">x</hi> “brought up” <hi
                    rend="italic">a b y</hi><hi rend="italic">.</hi></p>
                <p>On the whole, then, we may assume that the only principle of association we have
                    to examine is the so-called “association by contiguity,” which, as ordinarily
                    formulated, runs :—Any presentations whatever, which are in consciousness
                    together or in close succession, cohere in such a way that when one recurs it
                    tends to revive the rest, such tendency increasing with the frequency of the
                    conjunction. But such a statement is liable to all the objections already urged
                    against what we may call atomistic psychology. Presentations do not really crowd
                    into Mansoul by the avenues of Eyegate, Eargate, &amp;c., there to form bonds
                    and unions as in Bunyan’s famous allegory. It has been often contended that any
                    investigation into the nature of association must be fruitless.<note

                    association is thus a first principle, it ought at least to admit of such a
                    statement as shall remove the necessity for inquiry. So long, however, as we are
                    asked to conceive presentations originally distinct and isolated becoming
                    eventually linked together, we shall naturally feel the need of some explanation
                    of the process, for neither the isolation nor the links are clear,—not the
                    isolation, for we can only conceive two presentations separated by other
                    presentations intervening; nor the links, unless these are also presentations,
                    and then the difficulty recurs. But, if for contiguity we substitute continuity
                    and regard the associated presentations as parts of a new continuum, the only
                    important inquiry is how this new whole was first of all integrated.</p>

                    xml:id="kp-eb0920-0074-0061"/>
                <p>To ascertain this point we must examine each of the two leading divisions of
                    contiguous association—that of simultaneous presentations and that of
                    presentations occurring in close succession. The last, being the clearer, may be
                    taken first. In a series of associated presentations, <hi rend="italic">A B C
                    DE,</hi> such as the movements made in writing, the words of a poem learned by
                    heart, or the simple letters of the alphabet themselves, we find that each
                    member recalls its successor but not its predecessor. Familiar as this fact is,
                    it is not perhaps easy to explain it satisfactorily. Since <hi rend="italic"
                    >C</hi> is associated both with <hi rend="italic">B</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >D,</hi> and apparently as intimately with the one as with the other, why does
                    it revive the later only and not the earlier? <hi rend="italic">B</hi> recalls
                    <hi rend="italic">C;</hi> why does not <hi rend="italic">C</hi> recall <hi
                    rend="italic">Bl</hi> We have seen that any reproduction at all of <hi
                    rend="italic">A</hi> or <hi rend="italic">B</hi> or <hi rend="italic">C</hi>
                    depends primarily upon its having been the object of special attention so as to
                    occupy at least momentarily the focus of consciousness. Now we can in the first
                    instance only surmise that the order in which they are reproduced is determined
                    by the order in which they were thus attended to when first presented. The next
                    question is whether the association of objects simultaneously presented can be
                    resolved into an association of objects successively attended to. Whenever we
                    try to recall a scene we saw but for a moment there are always a few traits that
                    recur, the rest being blurred and vague, instead of the whole being revived in
                    equal distinctness or indistinctness. On seeing the same scene a second time our
                    attention is apt to be caught by something unnoticed before, as this has the
                    advantage of novelty; and so on, till we have “lived ourselves into” the whole,
                    which may then admit of simultaneous recall. Dr Bain, who is rightly held to
                    have given the best exposition of the laws of association, admits something very
                    like this in saying that “coexistence is an artificial growth formed from a
                    certain peculiar class of mental successions.” But, while it is easy to think of
                    instances in which the associated objects were attended to successively, and we
                    are all perfectly aware that the surest —not to say the only—way to fix the
                    association of a number of objects is by thus concentrating attention on each in
                    turn, it seems hardly possible to mention a case in which attention to the
                    associated objects could not have been successive. In fact, an aggregate of
                    objects on which attention could be focused at once would be already
                    associated.</p>
                <p>The only case, then, that now remains to be considered is that—to take it in its
                    simplest form—of two primary presentations <hi rend="italic">A</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">X,</hi> parts of different special continua or distinct— <hi
                    rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> non-adjacent—parts of the same, and occupying the focus
                    of consciousness in immediate succession. This constitutes their integration;
                    for the result of this occupation may be regarded as a new continuum in which
                    <hi rend="italic">A</hi> and <hi rend="italic">X</hi> become adjacent parts. For
                    it is characteristic of a continuum that an increase in the intensity of any
                    part leads to the intenser presentation of adjacent parts; and in this sense <hi
                    rend="italic">A</hi> and <hi rend="italic">X,</hi> which were not originally
                    continuous, have come to be so. We have here, then, some justification for the
                    term secondary or memory-continuum when applied to this continuous series of
                    representations to distinguish it from the primary or presentation-continuum
                    from which its constituents are derived. The most important peculiarity of this
                    continuum, therefore, is that it is a series of representations integrated by
                    means of the movements of attention out of the differentiations of the primary
                    or presentationcontinuum, or rather out of so much of these differentiations as
                    pertain to what we know as the primary memoryimage. These movements of
                    attention, if the phrase may be allowed, come in the end to depend mainly upon
                    interest, but at first appear to be determined entirely by mere intensity.<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>This connexion of association
                    with continuous movements of attention makes it easier to understand the
                    difficulty above referred to, viz. that in a series <hi rend="italic">A BC D . .
                    . B</hi> revives <hi rend="italic">C</hi> but not <hi rend="italic">A,</hi> and
                    so on—a difficulty that the analogy of adhesiveness or links leaves
                    unaccountable. To ignore the part played by attention in association, to
                    represent the memory-continuum as due solely to the concurrence of
                    presentations, is perhaps the chief defect of the associationist psychology,
                    both English and German. Mr Spencer’s endeavour to show “that psychical life is
                    distinguished from physical life by consisting of successive changes only
                    instead of successive and simultaneous changes” <hi rend="italic">{Principles of
                    Psychology,</hi> pt. iv. ch. ii., in particular pp. 403, 406) is really nothing
                    but so much testimony to the work of attention in forming the memory -
                    continuum, especially when, as there is good reason to do, we reject his
                    assumption that this growing seriality is physically determined.</p></note> To
                    them it is proposed to look for that continuity which images lose in so far as
                    they part with the local signs they had as impressions and cease to be either
                    localized or projected. Inasmuch as it is assumed that these movements form the
                    connexion between one representation and another in the memory-train they may be
                    called “temporal signs.”<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"
                    ><p>A term borrowed from Lotze <hi rend="italic">{Metaphysik,</hi> 1st ed., p.
                    295), but the present writer is alone responsible for the sense here given to it
                    and the hypothesis in which it is used.</p></note> The evidence for their
                    existence can be more conveniently adduced presently; it must suffice to remark
                    here that it consists almost wholly of facts connected with voluntary attention
                    and the voluntary control of the flow of ideas, so that temporal signs, unlike
                    local signs, are fundamentally motor and not sensory. And, unlike impressions,
                    representations can have each but a single sign,<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Apart, that is to say, of course, from the
                    reduplications of the memory-train spoken of below.</p></note> the continuum of
                    which, in contrast to that of local signs, is not rounded and complete but
                    continuously advancing.</p>
                <p>But in saying this we are assuming for a moment that the memory-continuum forms a
                    perfectly single and unbroken train. If it ever actually became so, then, in the
                    absence of any repetition of old impressions and apart from voluntary
                    interference with the train, consciousness, till it ceased entirely, would
                    consist of a fixed and mechanical round of images. Some approximation to such a
                    state is often found in uncultured persons who lead uneventful lives, and still
                    more in idiots, who can scarcely think at all.</p>
                <p>In actual fact, however, the memory-train is liable to change in two respects,
                    which considerably modify its structure, viz., (1) through the evanescence of
                    some parts, and (2) through the partial recurrence of like impressions, which
                    produces reduplications of varying amount and extent in other parts. As regards
                    the first, we may infer that the waning or sinking towards the threshold of
                    consciousness which we can observe in the primary mental image continues in
                    subconsciousness after the threshold is past. For the longer the time that
                    elapses before their revival the fainter, the less distinct, and the less
                    complete are the images when revived, and the more slowly they rise. All the
                    elements of a complex are not equally revivable, as we have seen already:
                    tastes, smells, and organic sensations, though powerful as impressions to revive
                    other images, have little capacity for ideal reproduction themselves, while
                    muscular movements, though perhaps of all presentations the most readily
                    revived, do not so readily revive other presentations. Idiosyncrasies are,
                    however, frequent; thus we find one person has an exceptional memory for sounds,
                    another for colours, another for forms. Still it is in general true that the
                    most intense, the most impressive, and the most interesting presentations
                    persist the longest. But the evanescence, which is in all cases comparatively
                    rapid at first, deepens sooner or later into real or apparent oblivion. In this
                    manner it comes about that parts of the memory-continuum lose all distinctness
                    of feature and, being without recognizable content, <pb break="no"

                    life that has lapsed—a representation that just suffices, for example, to show
                    us that “our earliest recollections” are not of our first experiences, or to
                    save them from being not only isolated but discontinuous. Such discontinuity
                    can, of course, never be absolute; we must have something represented even to
                    mark the gap. Oblivion and the absence of all representation are thus the same,
                    and the absence of all representation cannot psychologically constitute a break.
                    The terms “evolution” and “involution” have in this respect been happily applied
                    to the rising and falling of representations. When we recall a particular period
                    of our past life or what has long ceased to be a familiar scene, events and
                    features gradually unfold and, as it were, spread out as we keep on attending. A
                    precisely opposite process may then be supposed to take place when they are left
                    in undisturbed forgetfulness; with loss of distinctness in the several members
                    of a whole or series, there is a loss of individuality and of individual
                    differences. And such loss is not a mere latency, as some psychologists, on
                    metaphysical grounds<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>So,
                    <hi rend="italic">e.g.,</hi> Hamilton (following H. Schmid), <hi rend="italic"

                    mistaken use of physical analogies, have been led to suppose. There is no real
                    resemblance between the action, or rather inaction, of a particle obedient to
                    the first law of motion and the persistence of a presentation,<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Cf. Lotze, <hi rend="italic"

                    of an atom.</p>
                <p>More important changes are produced by the repetition of parts of the
                    memory-train. The effect of this is not merely to prevent the evanescence of the
                    particular image or series of images, but by partial and more or less frequent
                    reduplications of the train upon itself to convert it into a partially new
                    continuum, which we might perhaps call the “ideational continuum.” The
                    reduplicated portions of the train are strengthened, while at the points of
                    divergence it becomes comparatively weakened, and this apart from the effects of
                    obhviscence. One who had seen the queen but once would scarcely be likely to
                    think of her without finding the attendant circumstances recur as well; this
                    could not happen after seeing her in a hundred different scenes. The central
                    representation of the whole complex would have become more distinct, whereas the
                    several diverging lines would tend to dissipate attention and, by involving
                    opposing representations, to neutralize each other, so that probably no definite
                    background would be reinstated. Even this central representation would be more
                    or less generalized. It has been often remarked that one’s most familiar friends
                    are apt to be mentally pictured less concretely and vividly than persons seen
                    more seldom and then in similar attitudes and moods; in the former case a
                    “generic image” has grown out of such more specific representations as the
                    latter affords. Still further removed from memory-images are the images that
                    result from such familiar percepts as those of horses, houses, trees,
                    &amp;c.</p>
                <p>Thus as the joint effect of obliviscence and reduplication we are provided with a
                    flow of ideas distinct from the memory-train and thereby with the material,
                    already more or less organized, for intellectual and volitional manipulation. We
                    do not experience this flow—save very momentarily and occasionally—altogether
                    undisturbed; even in dreams and reverie it is continually interrupted and
                    diverted. Nevertheless it is not difficult to ascertain that, so far as it is
                    left to itself, it takes a very different course from that which we should have
                    to retrace if bent on reminiscence and able to recollect perfectly. The
                    readiness and steadiness of this flow are shown by the extremely small effort
                    necessary in order to follow it. Nevertheless from its very nature it is liable,
                    though not to positive breaches of continuity from its own working, yet to
                    occasional blocks or impediments to the smooth succession of images at points
                    where reduplications diverge, and either permanently or at the particular time
                    neutralize each other.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"
                    ><p>It is a mark of the looseness of much of our psychological terminology that
                    facts of this kind are commonly described as cases of association. Dr Bain calls
                    them “obstructive association,” which is about on a par with “progress
                    backwards”; Mr Sully’s “divergent association” is better. But it is plain that
                    what we really have is an arrest or inhibition consequent on association, and
                    nothing that is either itself association or that leads to
                    association.</p></note></p>
                <p>The flow of ideas is, however, exposed to positive interruptions from two
                    distinct sides,—by the intrusion of new presentations and by voluntary
                    interference. The only result of such interruptions which we need here consider
                    is <hi rend="italic">the conflict of presentations</hi> that may ensue. Herbart
                    and his followers have gone so far as to elaborate a complete system of
                    psychical statics and dynamics, based on the conception of presentations as
                    forces and on certain more or less improbable assumptions as to the modes in
                    which such forces interact. Since our power of attention is limited, it
                    continually happens that attention is drawn off by new presentations at the
                    expense of old ones. But, even if we regard this non-voluntary redistribution of
                    attention as implying a struggle between presentations, still such conflict to
                    secure a place in consciousness is very different from a conflict between
                    presentations that are already there. Either may be experienced to any degree
                    possible without the other appearing at all; as, absorbed in watching a starry
                    sky, one might be unaware of the chilliness of the air, though recognizing at
                    once, as soon as the cold is felt, that, so far from being incompatible, the
                    clearness and the coldness are causally connected. This difference between a
                    conflict of presentations to enter consciousness, if we allow for a moment the
                    propriety of the expression, and that opposition or incompatibility of
                    presentations which is only possible when they are in consciousness has been
                    strangely confused by the Herbartians. In the former the intensity of the
                    presentation is primarily alone of account; in the latter, on the contrary,
                    quality and content are mainly concerned. Only the last requires any notice
                    here, since such opposition arises when the ideational continuum is interrupted.
                    in the ways just mentioned, and apparently arises in no other way. Certainly
                    there is no such opposition between primary presentations: there we have the law
                    of incopresentability preventing the presentation of opposites with the same
                    local sign; and their presentation with different local signs involves, on this
                    level at all events, no conflict. But what has never been presented could hardly
                    be represented, if the ideational process were undisturbed: even in our dreams
                    white negroes or round squares, for instance, never appear. In fact, absurd and
                    bizarre as dream-imagery is, it never at any moment entails overt
                    contradictions, though contradiction may be implicit.</p>
                <p>But between ideas and percepts actual incompatibility is frequent. In the
                    perplexity of Isaac, <hi rend="italic">e.g.—“</hi> The voice is Jacob’s voice,
                    but the hands are the hands of Esau ”—we have such a case in a familiar form.
                    There is here not merely mental arrest but actual conflict: the voice perceived
                    identifies Jacob, at the same time the hands identify Esau. The images of Esau
                    and Jacob by themselves are different, but do not conflict; neither is there any
                    strain, quite the contrary, in recognizing a person partly like Jacob and partly
                    like Esau. For there is no direct incompatibility between smooth and rough, so
                    long as one pertains only to voice and the other only to hands, but the same
                    hands and voice cannot be both smooth and rough. Similar incompatibilities may
                    arise without the intrusion of percepts, as when, in trying to guess a riddle or
                    to solve a problem, or generally to eliminate intellectual differences, we have
                    images which in themselves are only logically opposite, psychologically opposed,
                    or in conflict, because each strives to enter the same complex. In all such
                    conflicts alike we find, in fact, a relation of presentations the exact converse
                    of that which constitutes similarity. In the latter we have two complete
                    presentations, <hi rend="italic">abx</hi> and <hi rend="italic">aby,</hi> as
                    similar, each including the common part <hi rend="italic">ab</hi>; in the former
                    we have two partial presentations, <hi rend="italic">x</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">y,</hi> as contraries, each excluding the other from the
                    incomplete <hi rend="italic">ab</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >.</hi> And this <hi rend="italic">ab,</hi> it is to be noted, is not more
                    essential to the similarity than to the conflict. But in the one case it is a
                    generic image (and can logically be predicated of two subjects); in the other it
                    is a partially determined individual (and cannot be subject to opposing
                    predicates). Except as thus supplementing <hi rend="italic">a b, x</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">y</hi> do not conflict; black and white are not incompatible save
                    as attributes of the same thing. The possibility of most of these conflicts—of
                    all, indeed, that have any logical interest—lies in that reduplication of the
                    memory-continuum which gives rise to these new complexes, generic images, or
                    general ideas.</p>
                <p>Having thus attempted to ascertain the formation of the ideational continuum out
                    of the memory-train, the <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0920-0076-0063"/> question arises: How now are we to distinguish
                    between imagining and remembering, and again, between imagining and expecting?
                    It is plainly absurd to make the difference depend on the presence of belief in
                    memory and expectation and on its absence in mere imagination; for the belief
                    itself depends on the difference instead of constituting it. One real and
                    obvious distinction, however, which Hume pointed out as regards memory, is the
                    fixed order and position of the ideas of what is remembered or expected as
                    contrasted with “the liberty” of the imagination to transpose and change its
                    ideas. This order and position in the case of memory are, of course, normally
                    those of the original impressions, but it seems rather naive of Hume to tell us
                    that memory “is tied down to these without any power of variation,” while
                    imagination has liberty to transpose as it pleases, as if the originals sat to
                    memory for their portraits, while to imagination they were but studies. Such
                    correspondence being out of the question— as Hume takes care to state as soon as
                    it suits him—all we have, so far, is this fixity and definiteness as contrasted
                    with the kaleidoscopic instability of ideation. In this respect what is
                    remembered or expected resembles what is perceived: the grouping not only does
                    not change capriciously and spontaneously, but resists any mental efforts to
                    change it. But, provided these characteristics are there, we should be apt to
                    believe that we are remembering, just as, <hi rend="italic">mutatis</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">mutandis,</hi> with like characteristics we might believe that we
                    were perceiving: hallucination is possible in either case.</p>
                <p>This fixity of order and position is, however, not sufficient to constitute a
                    typical remembrance where the term is exactly used. But remembering is often
                    regarded as equivalent to knowing and recognizing, as when on revisiting some
                    once familiar place one remarks, “How well I remember it !” What is meant is
                    that the place is recognized, and that its recognition awakens memories. Memory
                    includes recognition · recognition as such does not include memory. In human
                    consciousness, as we directly observe it, there is, perhaps, no pure
                    recognition: here the new presentation is not only assimilated to the old, but
                    the former framing of circumstance is reinstated, and so perforce distinguished
                    from the present. It may be there is no warrant for supposing that such
                    redintegration of a preceding field is ever absolutely <hi rend="italic"
                    >nil,</hi> still we are justified in regarding it as extremely vague and meagre,
                    both where mental evolution is but slightly advanced and where frequent
                    repetition in varying and irrelevant circumstances has produced a blurred and
                    neutral zone. The last is the case with a great part of our knowledge; the
                    writer happens to know that <hi rend="italic">bos</hi> is the Latin for “ox” and
                    <hi rend="italic">bufo</hi> the Latin for “toad,” and may be said to remember
                    both items of knowledge, if “remember” is only to be synonymous with “retain.”
                    But if he came across <hi rend="italic">bos</hi> in reading he would think of an
                    ox and nothing more; <hi rend="italic">bufo</hi> would immediately call up not
                    only “toad” but Virgil’s <hi rend="italic">Georgies,</hi> the only place in
                    which he has seen the word, and which he never read but once. In the former
                    there is so far nothing but recognition (which, however, of course rests upon
                    retentiveness); in the latter there is also remembrance of the time and
                    circumstances in which that piece of knowledge was acquired. Of course in so far
                    as we are aware that we recognize we also think that remembrance is at any rate
                    possible, since what we know we must previously have learned,—recognition
                    excluding novelty. But the point here urged is that there is an actual
                    remembrance only when the recognition is accompanied by a reinstatement of
                    portions of the memory-train continuous with the previous presentation of what
                    is now recognized. Summarily stated, we may say that between knowing and
                    remembering on the one hand and imagining on the other the difference primarily
                    turns on the fixity and completeness of the grouping in the former; in the
                    latter there is a shifting play of images more or less “generic,” reminding one
                    of “dissolving views.” Hence the first tλvo approximate in character to
                    perception, and are rightly called recognitions. Between them, again, the
                    difference turns primarily on the presence or absence of temporal signs. In what
                    is remembered these are still intact enough to ensure a localization in the past
                    of what is recognized; in what is known merely such localization is prevented,
                    either because of the obliviscence of temporal connexions or because the
                    reduplications of the memory-train that have consolidated the central group have
                    entailed their suppression. There is further the difference first mentioned,
                    which is often only a difference of degree, viz., that remembrances have more
                    circumstantiality, so to say, than mere recognitions have: more of the
                    collateral constituents of the original concrete field of consciousness are
                    reinstated. But of the two characteristics of memory proper—(a) concreteness or
                    circumstantiality, and (ό) localization in the past—the latter is the more
                    essential. It sometimes happens that we have the one with little or nothing of
                    the other. For example, we may have but a faint and meagre representation of a
                    scene, yet if it falls into and retains a fixed place in the memory-train we
                    have no doubt that seme such experience was once actually ours. On the other
                    hand, as in certain so-called illusions of memory, we may suddenly find
                    ourselves reminded by what is happening at the moment of a preceding experience
                    exactly like it— some even feel that they know from what is thus recalled what
                    will happen next; and yet, because we are wholly unable to assign such
                    representation a place in the past, instead of a belief that it happened, there
                    arises a most distressing sense of bewilderment, as if one were haunted and had
                    lost one’s personal bearings.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    past self as agent or patient in the event or situation recalled. And this is
                    true as regards all but the earliest human experience, at any rate; still,
                    whereas it is easy to see that memory is essential to any development of
                    self-consciousness, the converse is not at all clear, and would involve us in a
                    needless circle.</p>
                <p>Intimately connected with memory is expectation. We may as the result of
                    reasoning conclude that a certain event will happen; we may also, in like
                    manner, conclude that a certain other event has happened. But as we should <hi
                    rend="italic">not</hi> call the latter memory, so it is desirable to distinguish
                    such indirect anticipation as the former from that expectation which is directly
                    due to the interaction of ideas. Any man knows that he will die, and may make a
                    variety of arrangements in anticipation of death, but he cannot with propriety
                    be said to be expecting it unless he has actually present to his mind a series
                    of ideas ending in that of death, such series being due to previous
                    associations, and unless, further, this series owes its representation at this
                    moment to the actual recurrence of some experience to which that series
                    succeeded before. And as familiarity with an object or event in very various
                    settings may be a bar to recollection, so it may be to expectation: the average
                    Englishman, <hi rend="italic">e.g.,</hi> is continually surprised without his
                    umbrella, though only too familiar with rain, since in his climate one not
                    specially attentive to the weather obtains no clear representation of its
                    successive phases. But after a series of events <hi rend="italic">ABCDE .
                    .</hi>. has been once experienced we instinctively expect the recurrence <pb
                    break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit20newyrich/page/n77/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0920-0077-0064"/> of <hi rend="italic">B</hi><hi rend="italic">C .
                    . .</hi> on the recurrence of <hi rend="italic">A, i.e.,</hi> provided the
                    memory-train continues so far intact. Such expectation, at first perhaps
                    slight—a mere tendency easily overborne— becomes strengthened by every
                    repetition of the series in the old order, till eventually, if often fulfilled
                    and never falsified, it becomes certain and, as we commonly say, irresistible.
                    To have a clear case of expectation, then, it is not necessary that we should
                    distinctly remember any previous experience like it, but only that we should
                    have actually present some earlier member of a series which has been firmly
                    associated by such previous experiences, the remaining members, or at least the
                    next, if they continue serial, being revived through that which is once again
                    realized. This expectation may be instantly checked by reflexion, just as it may
                    of course be disappointed in fact; but these are matters which do not concern
                    the inquiry as to the nature of expectation while expectation lasts.</p>
                <p>We shall continue this inquiry to most advantage by now widening it into an
                    examination of the distinction of present, past, and future. To a being whose
                    presentations never passed through the transitions which ours undergo—first
                    divested of the strength and vividness of impressions, again reinvested with
                    them and brought back from the faint world of ideas—the sharp contrasts of “now”
                    and “then,” and all the manifold emotions they occasion, would be quite unknown.
                    Even we, so far as we confine our activity and attention to ideas, are almost
                    without them. Time-order, succession, antecedence and consequence, of course,
                    there might be still, but in that sense of events as “past and gone for ever,”
                    which is one of the melancholy factors in our life; and in the obligation to
                    wait and work in hope or dread of what is “still to come” there is much more
                    than time-order. It is to presentations in their primary stage, to impressions,
                    that we owe what real difference we find between now and then, whether
                    prospective or retrospective, as it is to them also that we directly owe our
                    sense of the <hi rend="italic">real,</hi> of what <hi rend="italic">is</hi> and
                    exists as opposed to the non-existent that is not. But the present alone and
                    life in a succession of presents, or, in other words, continuous occupation with
                    impressions, give us no knowledge of the present as present. This we first
                    obtain when our present consciousness consists partly of memories or partly of
                    expectations as well. An event expected differs from a like event remembered
                    chiefly in two ways—in its relation to present impressions and images and in the
                    active attitude to which it leads. The diverse feelings that accompany our
                    intuitions of time and contribute so largely to their colouring are mainly
                    consequences of these differences. Let us take a series of simple and familiar
                    events <hi rend="italic">ABC DE,</hi> representing ideas by small letters and
                    perceptions by capitals whenever it is necessary to distinguish them. Such
                    series may be present in consciousness in such wise that <hi rend="italic"
                    >abed</hi> are imaged while <hi rend="italic">E</hi> is perceived anew, <hi
                    rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> the whole symbolized as proposed would be <hi
                    rend="italic">abcdE∙,</hi> such would be, <hi rend="italic">e.g.,</hi> the state
                    of a dog which had just finished his daily meal. Again, there may be a fresh
                    impression of <hi rend="italic">A</hi> which revives <hi rend="italic"
                    >bcde∙,</hi> we should have then (1) A <hi rend="italic">bcde—</hi> the state of
                    our dog when he next day gets sight of the dish in which his food is brought to
                    him. A little later we may have (2) <hi rend="italic">a b C d e.</hi> Here <hi
                    rend="italic">ab</hi> are either after-sensations or primary memoryimages, or
                    have at any rate the increased intensity due to recent impression; but this
                    increased intensity will be rapidly on the wane even while <hi rend="italic"
                    >C</hi> lasts, and <hi rend="italic">a b</hi> will pale still further when <hi
                    rend="italic">C</hi> gives place to <hi rend="italic">D,</hi> and we have (3)
                    <hi rend="italic">abcD e.</hi> But, returning to (2), we should find <hi
                    rend="italic">de</hi> to be increasing in intensity and definiteness, as
                    compared with their state in (1), now that <hi rend="italic">C,</hi> instead of
                    A, is the present impression. For, when <hi rend="italic">A</hi> occupied this
                    position, not only was <hi rend="italic">e</hi> raised less prominently above
                    the threshold of consciousness by reason of its greater distance from <hi
                    rend="italic">A</hi> in the memory-continuum, but, owing to the reduplications
                    of this continuum, more lines of possible revival were opened up, to be
                    successively negatived as <hi rend="italic">B</hi> succeeded to <hi
                    rend="italic">A</hi> and <hi rend="italic">C</hi> to <hi rend="italic">B -,</hi>
                    even dogs know that “there is many a slip ’ twixt the cup and the lip.” But,
                    where <hi rend="italic">A B C D</hi><hi rend="italic">E</hi> is a series of
                    percepts such as we have here supposed—and a series of simpler states would
                    hardly afford much ground for the distinctions of past, present, and
                    future—there would be a varying amount of active adjustment of sense-organs and
                    other movements supplementary to full sensation. In (2), the point at which we
                    have <hi rend="italic">ab</hi><hi rend="italic">C de,</hi> for instance, such
                    adjustments and movements as were appropriate to <hi rend="italic">b</hi> would
                    cease as <hi rend="italic">B</hi> lapsed and be replaced by those appropriate to
                    <hi rend="italic">C.</hi> Again, as <hi rend="italic">C</hi> succeeded to <hi
                    rend="italic">B,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">d</hi> in consequence increased in
                    intensity and definiteness, the movements adapted to the reception of <hi
                    rend="italic">D</hi> would become nascent, and so on. Thus, psychologically
                    regarded, the distinction of past and future and what we might call the oneness
                    of direction of time depend, as just described, (1) upon the continuous sinking
                    of the primary memory-images on the one side, and the continuous rising of the
                    ordinary images on the other side, of that member of a series of percepts then
                    repeating which is actual at the moment; and (2) on the prevenient adjustments
                    of attention, to which such words as “expect,” “await,” “anticipate,” all
                    testify by their etymology. These conditions in turn will be found to depend
                    upon all that is implied in the formation of the memory-train and upon that
                    recurrence of like series of impressions which we attribute to the “uniformity
                    of nature.” If we never had the same series of impressions twice, knowledge of
                    time would be impossible, as indeed would knowledge of any sert.</p>
                <p>This is perhaps the fittest point at which to inquire into the character and
                    origin of our knowledge of succession and duration, so far, that is, as such an
                    inquiry belongs to psychology. We have not to ask how time itself comes to be;
                    but, assuming it to be, we ask how the individual comes to know it. Time is
                    often figuratively represented as a line, and we may perhaps utilize this figure
                    to make clear the relation of our intuition of time to what we call time itself.
                    Time, then, we say, stretches backwards and forwards from the present moment.
                    But the present, though a point of time, is still such that we can and do in
                    that moment attend to a plurality of presentations to which we might otherwise
                    have attended severally in successive moments. Granting this implication of
                    simultaneity and succession, we may, if we represent succession as a line,
                    represent simultaneity as a second line at right angles to the first; empty
                    time—or time-length without time-breadth, we may say—is a mere abstraction. Now
                    it is with the former line that we have to do in treating of time as it is, and
                    with the latter in treating of our intuition of time, where, just as in a
                    perspective representation of distance, we are confined to lines in a plane at
                    right angles to the actual line of depth. In a succession of events, say of
                    sense-impressions, <hi rend="italic">A B C D E . .</hi>. the presence of <hi
                    rend="italic">B</hi> means the absence of <hi rend="italic">A</hi> and of <hi
                    rend="italic">C,</hi> but the presentation of this succession involves the
                    simultaneous presence, in some mode or other, of two or more of the
                    presentations <hi rend="italic">ABCD.</hi> In presentation, as we have seen, all
                    that corresponds to the differences of past, present, and future is in
                    consciousness simultaneously. This truism —or paradox—that all we know of
                    succession is but an interpretation of what is really simultaneous or
                    coexistent, we may then concisely express by saying that we are aware of time
                    only through time-perspective, and experience shows that it is a long step from
                    a succession of presentations to such presentation of succession. The first
                    condition is that we should have represented together presentations that were in
                    the first instance attended to <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit20newyrich/page/n78/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0920-0078-0065"/> successively, and this we have both in the
                    persistence of primary memory-images and in the simultaneous reproduction of
                    longer or shorter portions of the memory-train. In a series thus secured there
                    may be time-marks, though no time, and by these marks the series must be
                    distinguished from other simultaneous series. To ask which is first among a
                    number of simultaneous presentations is unmeaning; one might be logically prior
                    to another, but in time they are together and priority is excluded. Nevertheless
                    after each distinct representation α, <hi rend="italic">b, c, d</hi> there
                    probably follows, as we have supposed, some trace of that movement of attention
                    of which we are aware in passing from one presentation to another. In our
                    present reminiscences we have, it must be allowed, little direct proof of this
                    interposition, though there is strong indirect evidence of it in the tendency of
                    the flow to follow the order in which the presentations were first attended to.
                    With the movements themselves we are familiar enough, though the residua of such
                    movements are not ordinarily conspicuous. These residua, then, are our temporal
                    signs, and, together with the representations connected by them, constitute the
                    memory-continuum. But temporal signs alone will not furnish all the pictorial
                    exactness of the time-perspective. They give us only a fixed series; but the
                    working of obliviscence, by insuring a progressive variation in intensity and
                    distinctness as we pass from one member of the series to the other, yields the
                    effect which we call time-distance. By themselves such variations would leave us
                    liable to confound more vivid representations in the distance with fainter ones
                    nearer the present, but from this mistake the temporal signs save us; and, as a
                    matter of fact, where the memory-train is imperfect such mistakes continually
                    occur. On the other hand, where these variations are slight and imperceptible,
                    though the memory-continuum preserves the order of events intact, we have still
                    no such distinct appreciation of comparative distance in time as we have nearer
                    the present where these perspective effects are considerable.</p>
                <p>, When in retrospect we note that a particular presentation X has had a place in
                    the field of consciousness, while a series of objects <hi rend="italic">Λ B C D
                    . .</hi>. have succeeded each other, then we may be said in observing this
                    relation of the two to perceive the duration of <hi rend="italic">X.</hi> And it
                    is in this way that we do subjectively estimate longer periods of time. But
                    first, it is evident that we cannot apply this method to indefinitely short
                    periods without passing beyond the region of distinct presentation; and, since
                    the <hi rend="italic">knowledge</hi> of duration implies a relation between
                    distinguishable presentations <hi rend="italic">ABC D</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >X,</hi> the case is one in which the hypothesis of subconsciousness can hardly
                    help any but those who confound the fact of time with the knowledge of it.
                    Secondly, if we are to compare different durations at all, it is not enough that
                    one of them should last out a series <hi rend="italic">ABC D,</hi> and another a
                    series <hi rend="italic">L Μ N 0;</hi> we also want some sort of common measure
                    of those series. Locke was awake to this point, though he expresses himself
                    vaguely <hi rend="italic">{Essay,</hi> ii. 14, §§ 9-12). He speaks of our ideas
                    succeeding each other “at certain distances not much unlike the images in the
                    inside of a lantern turned round by the heat of a candle,” and “guesses” that
                    “this appearance of theirs in train varies not very much in a waking man.” Now
                    what is this “distance” that separates <hi rend="italic">A</hi> from <hi
                    rend="italic">B,</hi><hi rend="italic">B</hi> from <hi rend="italic">C,</hi> and
                    so on, and what means have we of knowing that it is tolerably constant in waking
                    life? It is probably that the residuum of which we have called a temporal sign
                    <hi rend="italic">; or,</hi> in other words, it is the movement of attention
                    from <hi rend="italic">A</hi> to <hi rend="italic">B.</hi> But we must endeavour
                    here to get a more exact notion of this movement. Everybody knows what it is to
                    be distracted by a rapid succession of varied impressions, and equally what it
                    is to be wearied by the slow and monotonous recurrence of the same impressions.
                    Now these “feelings” of distraction and tedium owe their characteristic
                    qualities to movements of attention. In the first, attention is kept incessantly
                    on the move: before it is accommodated to A, it is disturbed by the suddenness,
                    intensity, or novelty of <hi rend="italic">B;</hi> in the second, it is kept all
                    but stationary by the repeated presentation of the same impression. Such excess
                    and defect of surprises make one realize a fact which in ordinary life is so
                    obscure as to escape notice. But recent experiments have set this fact in a more
                    striking light, and made clear what Locke had dimly before his mind in talking
                    of a certain distance between the presentations of a waking man. In estimating
                    very short periods of time, of a second or less, indicated say by the beats of a
                    metronome, it is found that there is a certain period for which the mean of a
                    number of estimates is correct, while shorter periods are on the whole
                    overestimated, and longer periods underestimated. This we may perhaps take to be
                    evidence of the time occupied in accommodating or fixing attention. Whether the
                    “point of indifference” is determined by the rate of usual bodily movement, as
                    Spencer asserts and Wundt conjectures, or conversely, is a question we need not
                    discuss just now. But, though the fixation of attention does of course really
                    occupy time, it is probably not in the first instance perceived as time, <hi
                    rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> as continuous “protensity,” to use a term of
                    Hamilton’s, but as intensity. Thus, if this supposition be true, there is an
                    element in our concrete time-perceptions which has no place in our abstract
                    conception of time. In time conceived as physical there is no trace of
                    intensity; in time psychically experienced duration is primarily an intensive
                    magnitude, witness the comparison of times when we are “bored” with others when
                    we are amused. It must have struck every one as strange who has reflected upon
                    it that a period of time which seems long in retrospect—such as an eventful
                    excursion—should have appeared short in passing; while a period, on the
                    contrary, which in memory has dwindled to a wretched span seemed everlasting
                    till it was gone. But, if we consider that in retrospect length of time is
                    represented primarily and chiefly by impressions that have survived, we have an
                    explanation of one-half; and in the intensity of the movements of attention we
                    shall perhaps find an explanation of the other. What tells in retrospect is the
                    series <hi rend="italic">abcde,</hi> &amp;c.; what tells in the present is the
                    intervening i <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi> i <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> i <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 3</hi>, &amp;c., or rather the original accommodation of which
                    these temporal signs are the residuum. For, as we have seen elsewhere, the
                    intensity of a presentation does not persist, so that in memory the residuum of
                    the most intense feeling of tedium may only be so many <hi rend="italic"
                    >t’s</hi> in a memory-continuum whose surviving members are few and
                    uninteresting. But in the actual experience, say, of a wearisome sermon, when
                    the expectation of release is continually balked and attention forced back upon
                    a monotonous dribble of platitudes, the one impressive fact is the hearer’s
                    impatience. On the other hand, so long as we are entertained, attention is never
                    involuntary, and there is no continually deferred expectation. Just as we are
                    said to walk with least effort when our pace accords with the rate of swing of
                    our legs regarded as pendulums, so in pastimes impressions succeed each other at
                    the rate at which attention can be most easily accommodated, and are such that
                    we attend willingly. We are absorbed in the present without being unwillingly
                    confined to it; not only is there no motive for retrospect or expectation, but
                    there is no feeling that the present endures. Each impression lasts as long as
                    it is interesting, but does not continue to monopolize the focus of
                    consciousness till attention to it is fatiguing, because uninteresting. In such
                    facts, then, we seem to have proof that our perception of duration rests <pb
                    break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit20newyrich/page/n79/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0920-0079-0066"/> ultimately upon quasi-motor objects of varying
                    intensity, the duration of which we do not directly experience as duration at
                    all. They do endure and their intensity is a function of their duration; but the
                    intensity is all that we directly perceive. In other words, it is here contended
                    that what Locke called an instant or moment—“the time of one idea in our minds
                    without the succession of another, wherein therefore we perceive no succession
                    at all”—is psychologically not “a part in duration” in that sense in which, as
                    he says, “we cannot conceive any duration without succession” <hi rend="italic"
                    >{Essay,</hi> ii. 16, 12).</p>
                <p>How do we know that the distance between our ideas cannot vary beyond certain
                    bounds Î This is not altogether a psychological question; but we are perhaps
                    entitled to note some interesting facts bearing upon it which may also serve to
                    connect the perceptions of duration and succession. If we make a Savart’s wheel
                    with a single tooth revolve slowly, say in three-quarters of a second, it will
                    be found that in the long-run we estimate this interval correctly,—slight
                    overestimates and slight underestimates occurring indifferently. If we next
                    place a second tooth opposite the first, letting the wheel revolve as before, so
                    as to divide the three-quarters of a second into two intervals, we shall on the
                    average overestimate it, and must increase the whole period to reach a new point
                    of indifference. With two other teeth at right angles to the first two, the
                    three-quarters of a second will appear longer still, and the time of a
                    revolution must be still more increased before we shall cease to overestimate
                    it. If we next employ, say, six teeth, 60° apart, the wheel revolving as at
                    first, we shall detect ourselves attending to the alternate strokes, say to the
                    first, third, and fifth, or perhaps to the third and the sixth; in this way,
                    though we continue to overestimate the total period, we can note the number and
                    regularity of the subdivisions. If these, however, be yet further increased, we
                    can no longer reproduce them, though still aware that the whole period is
                    divided into parts. But by the time we have introduced about fifteen equidistant
                    teeth, although there is physically an alternation of noise and silence as
                    before, we perceive only a continuous hum, which steadily changes in quality as
                    the number of teeth is further increased. Facts like these not only show that we
                    estimate duration primarily by the effects of attention, but also make it
                    probable that such estimate is fairly constant, since it is always approximately
                    the same physical interval that becomes blurred. Further, we see that, where the
                    distance between successive presentations is too short for a separate fixation
                    of attention upon each, we proceed to take them in groups. This procedure is
                    facilitated by differences in the quality and intensity of the objects as well
                    as by differences in the intervals between them; hence among other things the
                    aesthetic properties of modulation and rhythm.</p>
                <p>But, if our experience of time depends primarily upon acts of attention to a
                    succession of distinct objects, it would seem that time, subjectively regarded,
                    must be discrete and not continuous. This, which is the view steadily maintained
                    by the psychologists of Herbart’s school, was implied if not stated by Locke,
                    Berkeley, and Hume. Locke hopelessly confuses time as perceived and time as
                    conceived, and can only save himself from pressing objections by the retort, “It
                    is very common to observe intelligible discourses spoiled by too much subtlety
                    in nice divisions.” But Berkeley and Hume with the mathematical discoveries of
                    Newton and Leibnitz before them could only protest that there was nothing
                    answering to mathematical continuity in our experience. And, whereas Locke had
                    tried to combine with his general psychological account the inconsistent
                    position that ‘ ‘ none of the distinct ideas we have of either [space or time]
                    is without all manner of composition,” Berkeley declares, “For my own part,
                    whenever I attempt to frame a simple idea of time, abstracted from the
                    succession of ideas in my mind, which flows uniformly and is participated by all
                    beings, I am lost and embrangled in inextricable difficulties. I have no notion
                    of it at all, only I hear others say it is infinitely divisible, and speak of it
                    in such a manner as leads me to harbour odd thoughts of my existence. . . . Time
                    therefore being nothing, abstracted from the succession of ideas in our minds,
                    it follows that the duration of any finite spirit must be estimated <hi
                    rend="italic">by the number of ideas or actions</hi> succeeding each other in
                    that same spirit or mind” <hi rend="italic">{Principles of Knowledge,</hi> i. §
                    98). Hume, again, is at still greater pains to show that “the <hi rend="italic"
                    >idea</hi> which we form of any finite quality is not infinitely divisible, but
                    that by proper distinctions and separations we may run this idea up to inferior
                    ones, which will be perfectly simple and indivisible . . . that the imagination
                    reaches a <hi rend="italic">minimum,</hi> and may raise up to itself an idea of
                    which it cannot conceive any subdivision, and which cannot be diminished without
                    a total annihilation” <hi rend="italic">{Human Nature,</hi> pt. ii. § 1, Green’s
                    ed., p. 335).</p>
                <p>At the first blush we are perhaps disposed to accept this account of our
                    time-perception, as Wundt, <hi rend="italic">e.g.,</hi> does, and to regard the
                    attribution of continuity as wholly the result of after-reflexion.<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Comp. Wundt, <hi
                    rend="italic">Logik,</hi> vol. i. p. 432.</p></note> But it may be doubted if
                    this is really an exact analysis of the case. Granted that the impressions to
                    which we chiefly attend are distinct and discontinuous in their occupation of
                    the focus of consciousness, and that, so far, the most vivid element in our
                    timeexperience is discrete; granted further that in recollection and expectation
                    such objects are still distinct—all which seems to imply that time is a mere
                    plurality—yet there is more behind. The whole field of consciousness is not
                    occupied by distinct objects, neither are the changes in this field
                    discontinuous. The experimental facts above-mentioned illustrate the transition
                    from a succession the members of which are distinctly attended to to one in
                    which they are indistinctly attended to, <hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> are not
                    discontinuous enough to be separately distinguished. Attention does not move by
                    hops from one definite spot to another, but, as Wundt himself allows, by
                    alternate diffusion and concentration, like the foot of a snail, which never
                    leaves the surface it is traversing. We have a clear presentation discerned as
                    <hi rend="italic">A</hi> or <hi rend="italic">B</hi> when attention is gathered
                    up; and, when attention spreads out, we have confused presentations not
                    admitting of recognition. But, though not recognizable, such confused
                    presentations are represented, and so serve to bridge over the comparatively
                    empty interval during which attention is unfocused. Thus our perception of a
                    period of time is not comparable to so many terms in a series of finite units
                    any more than it is to a series of infinitesimals. When attention is
                    concentrated in expectation of some single impression, then, no doubt, it is
                    brought to a very fine point (“zugespitzt,” as Herbart would say); and a
                    succession of such impressions would be represented as relatively discrete
                    compared with the representation of the scenery of a day-dream. But absolutely
                    discrete it is not and cannot be. In this respect the truth is rather with
                    Herbert Spencer, who, treating of this subject from another point of view,
                    remarks, “When the facts are contemplated objectively, it becomes manifest that,
                    though the changes constituting intelligence approach to a single succession,
                    they do not absolutely form one” <hi rend="italic">{Psychology,</hi> i. § 180,
                    p. 403).</p>
                <p>On the whole, then, we may conclude that our concrete time-experiences are due to
                    the simultaneous representation of a series of definite presentations both
                    accompanied and separated by more or fewer indefinite presentations more or less
                    confused; that, further, the definite presentations have certain marks or
                    temporal signs due to the movements of attention; that the rate of these
                    movements or accommodations is approximately constant; and that each movement
                    itself is primarily experienced as an intensity.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Feeling.</hi></p>
                <p>Such summary survey as these limits allow of the more elementary facts of
                    cognition is here at an end; so far the most conspicuous factors at work have
                    been those of what might be termed our ideational mechanism. In the higher
                    processes of thought we have to take more account of mental activity and of the
                    part played by language. But it seems preferable, before entering upon this, to
                    explore also the emotional and active constituents of mind in their more
                    elementary phases.</p>
                <p>In our preliminary survey we have seen that psychical life consists in the main
                    of a continuous alternation of receptive and reactive consciousness, <hi
                    rend="italic">i,e.,</hi> in its earliest form, of alternations of sensation and
                    movement. At a later stage we find that in the receptive phase ideation is added
                    to sensation, and that in the active phase thought and fancy, or the voluntary
                    manipulation and control of the ideational trains, are added to the voluntary
                    manipulation and control of the muscles. At this higher level also it is
                    possible that either form of receptive consciousness may lead to either form of
                    active: sensations may lead to thought rather than to action in the restricted
                    <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit20newyrich/page/n80/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0920-0080-0067"/> sense, and ideas apart from sensations may prompt
                    to muscular exertion. There is a further complication still: not only may either
                    sensations or ideas lead to either muscular or mental movements, but movements
                    themselves, whether of mind or limb, may as mere presentations determine other
                    movements of either kind. In this respect, however, movements and thoughts
                    either in themselves or through their sensational and ideational accompaniments
                    may be regarded as pertaining to the receptive side of consciousness. With these
                    provisos, then, the broad generalization may hold that receptive states lead
                    through feeling to active states, and that presentations that give neither
                    pleasure nor pain meet with no responsive action. But first the objection must
                    be met that presentations that are in themselves purely indifferent lead
                    continually to very energetic action, often the promptest and most definite
                    action. To this there are two answers. First, on the higher levels of Ssychical
                    life presentations in themselves indifferent are often in-irectly interesting as
                    signs of, or as means to, other presentations that are more directly
                    interesting. It is enough for the present, therefore, if it be admitted that all
                    such indifferent presentations are without effect as often as they are <hi
                    rend="italic">not</hi> instrumental in furthering the realization of some
                    desirable end. Secondly, a large class of movements, such as those called
                    sensori-motor and. ideo-motor, are initiated by presentations that are
                    frequently, it must be allowed, neither pleasurable nor painful. In all such
                    cases, however, there is probably only an apparent exception to the principle of
                    subjective selection. They may all be regarded as instances of another important
                    psychological principle which we have to deal with more fully by and by, viz.,
                    that voluntary actions, and especially those that either only avert pain or are
                    merely subsidiary to pleasure-giving actions, tend at length, as the effect of
                    habit in the individual and of heredity in the race, to become “secondarily
                    automatic,” as it has been called. Such mechanical or instinctive dexterities
                    make possible a more efficient use of present energies in securing pleasurable
                    and interesting experiences, and, like the rings of former growths in a tree,
                    afford a basis for further advance, as old interests pall and new ones present
                    themselves. Here, again, it suffices for our present purpose if it be granted
                    that there is a fair presumption in favour of supposing all such movements to
                    have been originally initiated by feeling, as certainly very many of them
                    were.</p>
                <p>Of the feeling itself that intervenes between these sensory and motor
                    presentations there is but little to be said. The chief points have been already
                    insisted upon, viz., that it is not itself a presentation, but a purely
                    subjective state, at once the effect of a change in receptive consciousness and
                    the cause of a change in motor consciousness; hence its continual confusion
                    either with the movements, whether ideational or muscular, that are its
                    expression, or with the sensations or ideas that are its cause. For feeling as
                    such is, so to put it, matter of <hi rend="italic">being</hi> rather than of
                    direct knowledge; and all that we know about it we know from its antecedents or
                    consequents in presentation.</p>
                <p>Pure feeling, then, ranging solely between the opposite extremes of pleasure and
                    pain, we are naturally led to inquire whether there is any corresponding
                    contrast in the causes of feeling on the one hand, and on the other in its
                    manifestations and effects. To begin with the first question, which we may thus
                    formulate: What, if any, are the invariable differences characteristic of the
                    presentations or states of mind we respectively like and dislike; or, taking
                    account of the diverse sources of feeling—sensuous, aesthetic, intellectual,
                    active—is there anything that we can predicate alike of all that are pleasurable
                    and deny of all that are painful, and <hi rend="italic">vice versa 1</hi> It is
                    at once evident that at least in presentations objectively regarded no such
                    common characters will be found; if we find them anywhere it must be in some
                    relation to the conscious subject, <hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> in the fact of
                    presentation itself. There is one important truth concerning pleasures and pains
                    that may occur at once as an answer to our inquiry, and that is often advanced
                    as such, viz., that whatever is pleasurable tends to further and perfect life,
                    and whatever is painful to disturb or destroy it. The many seeming exceptions to
                    this law of self-conservation, as it has been called, probably all admit of
                    explanation in conformity with it, so as to leave its substantial truth
                    unimpeached.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>See
                    Spencer, <hi rend="italic">Data of Ethics,</hi> chaps, i.-iv.; G. H. Schneider,

                    Menschengeschlechts,</hi> chap. i.</p></note> But this law, however stated, is
                    too teleological to serve as a purely psychological principle, and, as generally
                    formulated and illustrated, it takes account of matters quite outside the
                    psychologist’s ken. We are not now concerned to know <hi rend="italic">why</hi>
                    a bitter taste, <hi rend="italic">e.g.,</hi> is painful or the gratification of
                    an appetite pleasant, but <hi rend="italic">what</hi> marks distinctive of all
                    painful presentations the one has and the other lacks. From a biological
                    standpoint it may be true enough that the final cause of sexual and parental
                    feelings is the perpetuation of the species; but this does not help us to
                    ascertain what common character they have as actual sources of feeling for the
                    individual. From the biological standpoint even the senile decadence and death
                    of the individual may be shown to be advantageous to the race; but it would
                    certainly be odd to describe this as advantageous to the individual, so
                    different are the two points of view. What we are in search of, although a
                    generalization, has reference to something much more concrete than conceptions
                    like race or life, and does not require us to go beyond the consciousness of the
                    moment to such ulterior facts as they imply.</p>
                <p>Were it possible it would be quite unnecessary to examine in detail every variety
                    of pleasurable and painful consciousness in connexion with a general inquiry of
                    this sort. It will be best to enumerate at the outset the only cases that
                    specially call for investigation. Feeling may arise mainly from (1) single
                    sensations or movements, including in these what recent psychologists call their
                    <hi rend="italic">tone</hi>; or it may be chiefly determined by (2) some
                    combination or arrangement of these primary presentations,—hence what might be
                    styled the lower aesthetic feelings. We have thus among primary presentations a
                    more material and a more formal cause or ground of feeling. The mere
                    representation of these sources of feeling involves nothing of moment: the idea
                    of a bright colour or a bitter taste has not definiteness or intensity enough to
                    produce feeling; and the ideal presentation of a harmonious arrangement of
                    sounds or colours does not in itself differ essentially as regards the feeling
                    it occasions from the actual presentation. When we advance to the level at which
                    there occur ideas more complex and more highly representative—or
                    re-representative, as Mr Spencer would say—than any we have yet considered we
                    can again distinguish between material and formal grounds of feeling. To the
                    first we might refer, <hi rend="italic">e.g.,</hi> (3) the egoistic,
                    sympathetic, and religious feelings; this class will probably require but brief
                    notice. The second, consisting of (4) the intellectual and (5) the higher
                    aesthetic feelings, is more important. There is a special class of feelings,
                    which might be distinguished from all the preceding as <hi rend="italic"
                    >reflex,</hi> since they arise from the memory or expectation of feelings; but
                    in fact these are largely involved in all the higher feelings, and this brief
                    reference to them will suffice; of such hope, fear, regret, are examples.</p>
                <p>1. The quality and intensity as well as the duration and frequency of a sensation
                    or movement all have to do with determining to what feeling it gives rise. It
                    will be best to leave the last two out of account for a time. Apart from these,
                    the pleasantness or painfulness of a movement appears to depend solely upon its
                    intensity, that is to say, upon the amount of effort necessary to effect it, in
                    such wise that a certain amount of exertion is agreeable and any excess
                    disagreeable. Some sensations also, such as light and sound, are agreeable if
                    not too intense, their pleasantness increasing with their intensity up to a
                    certain point, on nearing which the feeling rapidly changes and becomes
                    disagreeable or even painful. Other sensations, as bitter tastes, <hi
                    rend="italic">e.g.,</hi> are naturally unpleasant, however faint,—though we must
                    allow the possibility of an acquired liking for moderately bitter or pungent
                    flavours. But in every case such sensations produce unmistakable <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit20newyrich/page/n81/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0920-0081-0068"/> manifestations of disgust, if at all intense.
                    Sweet tastes, on the other hand, however intense, are pleasant to an unspoiled
                    palate, though apt before long to become mawkish, like “sweetest honey,
                    loathsome in his own deliciousness,” as confectioners’ apprentices are said soon
                    to find. The painfulness of all painful sensations or movements increases with
                    their intensity without any assignable maximum being reached.</p>
                <p>A comparison of examples of this kind, which it would be tedious to describe more
                    fully and which are indeed too familiar to need much description, seems to show
                    (1) that, so far as feeling is determined by the intensity of a presentation,
                    there is pleasure so long as attention can be adapted or accommodated to the
                    presentation, and pain so soon as the intensity is too great for this; and (2)
                    that, so far as feeling is determined by the quality of a presentation, those
                    that are pleasurable enlarge the field of consciousness and introduce or
                    agreeably increase in intensity certain organic sensations, while those that are
                    painful contract the field of consciousness and introduce or disagreeably
                    increase in intensity certain organic sensations. There are certain other
                    hedonic effects due to quality the examination of which we must for the present
                    defer. Meanwhile as to the first point it may be suggested, as at any rate a
                    working hypothesis, that in itself any and every simple sensation or movement is
                    pleasurable if there is attention forthcoming adequate to its intensity. In the
                    earliest and simplest phases of life, in which the presentationcontinuum is but
                    little differentiated, it is reasonable to suppose that variation in the
                    intensity of presentation preponderates over changes in the quality of
                    presentation, and that to the same extent feeling is determined by the former
                    and not by the latter. And, whereas this dependence on intensity is invariable,
                    there is no ground for supposing the quality of any primary presentation, when
                    not of excessive intensity, to be invariably disagreeable; the changes
                    above-mentioned in the hedonic effects of bitter tastes, sweet tastes, or the
                    like tend rather to prove the contrary. This brings us to the second point, and
                    it requires some elucidation. We need here to call to mind the continuity of our
                    presentations and especially the existence of a background of organic sensations
                    or somatic consciousness, as it is variously termed. By the time that
                    qualitatively distinct presentations have been differentiated from this common
                    basis it becomes possible for any of these, without having the intensity
                    requisite to affect feeling directly, to change it indirectly by means of the
                    systemic sensations accompanying them, or, in other words, by their tone. The
                    physiological concomitants of these changes of somatic tone are largely reflex
                    movements or equivalents of movements, such as alterations in circulatory,
                    respiratory, and excretory processes. Such movements are psychologically
                    movements no longer, and are rightly regarded as pertaining wholly to the
                    sensory division of presentations. But originally it may have been otherwise. To
                    us now, these organic reflexes seem but part and parcel of the special sensation
                    whose tone they form, and which they accompany even when that sensation, so far
                    as its mere intensity goes, might be deemed indifferent. But perhaps at first
                    the special qualities that are now throughout unpleasant may have been always
                    presented with an excessive intensity that would be painful on this score alone,
                    and the reflexes that at present pertain to them may then have been
                    psychologically the expression of this pain.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    of heredity, or to reckon this accompanying systemic feeling as part of them.
                    The latter seems the readier and perhaps, too, the preferable course. A word
                    will now suffice to explain what is meant by enlarging and contracting the field

                    purely sensory experience, certain organic sensations which are ordinarily
                    indifferent acquire a gentle intensity, which seems by flowing over to quicken
                    and expand the ideational stream, as we see, for instance, in the effects of
                    mountain air and sunshine. Or, on the other hand, these sensations become so
                    violently intense as to drain off and ingulf all available energy in one
                    monotonous corroding care, an oppressive weight which leaves no place for free

                    si l’animal voulait se rendre plus petit, et offrir moins de surface à la
                    douleur. Il est intéressant de remarquer que, pour l’homme comme pour tous les
                    animaux, on retrouve ces mêmes mouvements généraux de flexion et d’extension
                    répondant aux sentiments différents de plaisir et de la douleur. Le plaisir
                    répond à un mouvement d’épanouissement, de dilatation, d’extension. Au
                    contraire, dans la douleur, on se rapetisse, on se referme sur soi; c’est un
                    mouvement général de flexion” (0. Richet, <hi rend="italic">L'Homme et

                <p>As regards the duration and the frequency of presentation, it is in general true
                    that the hedonic effect soon attains its maximum, and then, if pleasant, rapidly
                    declines, or even changes to its opposite. Pains in like manner decline, but
                    more slowly, and without in the same sense changing to pleasures. The like holds
                    of too frequent repetition. Physiological explanation of these facts, good as
                    far as it goes, is, of course, at once forthcoming: sensibility is blunted, time
                    is required for restoration, and so forth; but at least we want the
                    psychological equivalent of all this. In one respect we find nothing materially
                    new · so far as continued presentation entails diminished intensity we have
                    nothing but diminished feeling as a consequence; so far as its continued
                    presentation entails satiety the train of agreeable accompaniments ceases in
                    which the pleasurable tone consisted. But in another way long duration and

                    and accommodation. We may get used to a painful presentation in such wise that
                    we cease to be conscious of it as positively disagreeable, though its cessation
                    is at once a source of pleasure; in like manner we come to require things simply
                    because it is painful to be without them, although their possession has long
                    ceased to be a ground of positive enjoyment. This loss (or gain) consequent on
                    accommodation<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>It has
                    been definitely formulated, but in physiological language, by Dr Bain as the Law
                    of Novelty: “No second occurrence of any great shock or stimulus, whether
                    pleasure, pain, or mere excitement, is ever fully equal to the first,
                    notwithstanding that full time has been given for the nerves to recover from
                    their exhaustion” <hi rend="italic">(Mind and Body,</hi> p. 51). Comp, also his
                    <hi rend="italic">Emotions and Will,</hi> 3d ed., p. 83.</p></note> has a most
                    important effect in changing the sources of feeling: it helps to transfer
                    attention from mere sensations to what we may distinguish as interests.</p>
                <p>2. Certain sensations or movements not separately unpleasant become so when
                    presented together or in immediate succession; and contrariwise, some
                    combinations of sensations or of movements may be such as to afford pleasure
                    distinct from, and often greater than, any that they separately yield. Here
                    again we find that in some cases the effect seems mainly to depend on intensity,
                    in others mainly on quality, (i.) As instances of the former may be mentioned
                    the pleasurableness of a rhythmic succession of sounds or movements, of
                    symmetrical forms and curved outlines, of gentle crescendos and diminuendos in
                    sound, and of gradual variations of shade in colour, and the painfulness of
                    flickering lights, “beats” in musical notes, false time, false steps, false
                    quantities, and the like. In all these, whenever the result is pleasurable,
                    attention can be readily accommodated,—is, so to say, economically meted out;
                    and, whenever the result is painful, attention is surprised, balked, wasted.
                    Thus we can make more movements and with less expenditure of energy when they
                    are rhythmic than when they are not, as the performances of a ballroom or of
                    troops marching to music amply testify. Of this economy we have also a striking
                    proof in the ease with which rhythmic language is retained, (ii.) As instances
                    of the latter may be cited those arrangements of musical tones and of colours
                    that are called harmonious or the opposite. Harmony, however, must be taken to
                    have a different meaning in the two cases. When two or three tones harmonize
                    there results, as is well known, a distinct pleasure over and above any pleasure
                    due to the tones themselves. On the other hand, tones that are discordant are
                    unpleasant in spite of any pleasantness they may have singly. Besides the
                    negative condition of absence of beats, a musical interval to be pleasant must
                    fulfil certain positive conditions, sufficiently expressed for our purpose by
                    saying that two tones are pleasant when they give rise to few combination-tones,
                    and when among these there are several that coincide, and that they are
                    unpleasant when they give rise to many combination-tones, and when among these
                    there are few or none that coincide. Too many tones together prevent any from
                    being distinct. But where tones coincide the number of tones actually present is
                    less than the number of possible tones, and there is a proportionate
                    simplification, so to put it: more is commanded and with less effort. A recent
                    writer<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Preyer, <hi
                    rend="italic">Akustische Untersuchungen,</hi> p. 59.</p></note> on harmony, in
                    fact, compares the confusion of a discord to that of “trying to reckon up a sum
                    in one’s head and failing because the numbers are too high.” A different
                    explanation must be given of the so-called harmonies of colour. The pleasurable
                    effect of graduations of colour or shade—to which, as Ruskin tells us, the rose
                    owes its victorious beauty when compared with other flowers—has been already
                    mentioned: it is rather a quantitative than a qualitative effect. What we are
                    now concerned with are the pleasurable or painful combinations of different
                    ungraduated colours. A comparison of these seems to justify the general
                    statement that those colours yield good combinations that are far apart in the
                    colour circle, while those near together are apt to be discordant. The
                    explanation given, viz., that the one arrangement secures and the other prevents
                    perfect retinal activity, seems on the whole satisfactory,—especially if we
                    acknowledge the tendency of all recent investigations and distinguish
                    sensibility to colour and sensibility to mere light as both psychologically and
                    physiologically two separate facts. Thus, when red and green are juxtaposed, the
                    red increases the saturation of the green and the green that of the red, so that
                    both colours are heightened in brilliance. But such an effect is only pleasing
                    to the child and the savage; for civilized men the contrast is excessive, and
                    colours less completely opposed, as red and blue, are preferred, each being a
                    rest from the other, so that as the eye wanders to and fro over their border
                    different elements are active by turns. Red and orange, again, are bad, in that
                    both exhaust in a similar manner and leave the remaining factors out of
                    play.</p>
                <p>3. The more or less spontaneous workings of imagination, as well as that direct
                    control of this working necessary to thinking in the stricter sense, are always
                    productive of pain or pleasure in varying degrees. Though the exposition of the
                    higher intellectual processes has not yet been reached, there will be no
                    inconvenience in at once taking account of their effects on feeling, since these
                    are fairly obvious and largely independent of any analysis of the processes
                    themselves. It will also be convenient to include under the one term
                    “intellectual feelings,” not only the feelings connected with certainty, doubt,
                    perplexity, comprehension, and so forth, but also what the Herbartian
                    psychologists—whose work in this department of psychology is classical—have
                    called <hi rend="italic">par excellence</hi> the formal feelings,—that is to
                    say, feelings which they regard as entirely determined by the form of the flow
                    of ideas, and not by the ideas themselves. Thus, be the ideas what they may,
                    when their onward movement is checked by divergent or obstructing lines of
                    association, and especially when in this manner we are hindered, say, from
                    recollecting a name or a quotation (as if, <hi rend="italic">e.g.</hi><hi
                    rend="italic subscript"> i</hi> the names of Archimedes, Anaximenes, and
                    Anaximander each arrested the clear revival of the other), we are conscious of a
                    certain strain and oppressiveness, which give way to momentary relief when at
                    length what is wanted rises into distinct consciousness and our ideas resume
                    their flow. Here again, too, as in muscular movements, we have the contrast of
                    exertion and facility, when “thoughts refuse to flow” and we work “invita
                    Minerva,” or when the appropriate ideas seem to unfold and display themselves
                    before us like a vision before one inspired. To be confronted with propositions
                    we cannot reconcile— <hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> with what is or appears
                    inconsistent, false, contradictory—is apt to be painful; the recognition of
                    truth or logical coherence, on the other hand, is pleasurable. The feeling in
                    either case is, no doubt, greater the greater our interest in the subjectmatter;
                    but the mere conflict of ideas as such is in itself depressing, and the
                    discernment of agreement, of the one in the many, in like manner a distinct
                    satisfaction. Now in the one case we are conscious of futile efforts to
                    comprehend as one ideas which the more distinctly we apprehend them for the
                    purpose only prove to be the more completely and diametrically opposed; we can
                    only affirm and mentally envisage the one by denying and suppressing the
                    representation of the other, and yet we have to strive to predicate both and to
                    embody them together in the same mental image. Attention is like a house divided
                    against itself: there is effort but it is not effective, for the field of
                    consciousness is narrowed and the flow of ideas <pb break="no"

                    common principle among diverse and apparently disconnected particulars, instead
                    of all the attention we can command being taxed in the separate apprehension of
                    these “disjecta membra,” they become as one, and we seem at once to have at our
                    disposal resources for the command of an enlarged field and the detection of new
                    resemblances.</p>
                <p>4. Closely related to these formal intellectual feelings are certain of the
                    higher aesthetic feelings. A reference to some of the commonplaces of
                    aesthetical writers may be sufficient briefly to exhibit the leading
                    characteristics of these feelings. There is a wide agreement among men in
                    general as to what is beautiful and what is not, and it is the business of a
                    treatise on empirical aesthetics from an analysis of these matters of fact to
                    generalize the principles of taste,—to do, in fact, for one source of pleasure
                    and pain what we are here attempting in a meagre fashion for all. And these
                    principles are the more important in their bearing upon the larger psychological
                    question, because among aesthetic effects are reckoned only such as are pleasing
                    or otherwise in themselves, apart from all recognition of utility, of
                    possession, or of ulterior gratification of any kind whatever. Thus, if it
                    should be objected that the intellectual satisfaction of consistency is really
                    due to its utility, to the fact that what is incompatible and incomprehensible
                    is of no avail for practical guidance, at least this objection will not hold
                    against the aesthetic principle of <hi rend="italic">unity in variety.</hi> In
                    accordance with this primary maxim of art criticism, at the one extreme art
                    productions are condemned for monotony, as incapable of sustaining interest
                    because “empty,” “bald,” and “poor”; at the other extreme they are condemned as
                    too incoherent and disconnected to furnish a centre of interest. And those are
                    held as so far praiseworthy in which a variety of elements, be they movements,
                    forms, colours, or incidents, instead of conflicting, all unite to enhance each
                    other and to form not merely a mass but a whole. Another principle that serves
                    to throw light on our inquiry is that which has been called the principle of <hi

                    viz., that an effect is pleasing in proportion as it is attained by little
                    effort and simple means. The brothers Weber in their classic work on human
                    locomotion discovered that those movements that are aesthetically beautiful are
                    also physiologically correct; grace and ease, in fact, are wellnigh synonymous,
                    as Herbert Spencer points out, and illustrates by apt instances of graceful
                    attitudes, motions, and forms. The same writer,<note anchored="true"

                    for a more general law underlying the current maxims of writers on composition
                    and rhetoric is led to a special formulation of this principle as applied to
                    style, viz., that “economy of the recipient’s attention is the secret of
                    effect.”</p>
                <p>Perhaps of all aesthetical principles the most wide-reaching, as well as
                    practically the most important, is that which explains aesthetic effects by
                    association. Thus, to take one example where so many are possible, the croaking
                    of frogs and the monotonous ditty of the cuckoo owe their pleasantness, not
                    directly to what they are in themselves, but entirely to their intimate
                    association with spring-time and its gladness. At first it might seem,
                    therefore, that there is nothing fresh in this principle relevant to our present
                    inquiry, since a pleasure that is only due to association at once carries back
                    the question to its sources, so that in asking why the spring, for example, is
                    pleasant we should be returning to old ground. But this is not altogether true;
                    aesthetic effects call up not merely ideas but ideals. A great work of art
                    improves upon the real in two respects: it intensifies and it transfigures. It
                    is for art to gather into one focus, cleared from dross and commonplace, the
                    genial memories of a lifetime, the instinctive memories of a race; and, where
                    theory can only classify and arrange what it receives, art— in a measure free
                    from “the literal unities of time and place ”—creates and glorifies. Still art
                    eschews the abstract and speculative; however plastic in its hands, the material
                    wrought is always that of sense. We have already noticed more than once the
                    power which primary presentations have to sustain vivid re-presentations, and
                    the bearing of this on the aesthetic effects of works of art must be straightway
                    obvious. The notes and colours, rhymes and rhythms, forms and move∏ιents, which
                    produce the lower aesthetic feelings also serve as the means of bringing into
                    view, and maintaining at a higher level of vividness, a wider range and flow of
                    pleasing ideas than we can ordinarily command.</p>
                <p>5. When we reach the level at which there is distinct self-consciousness (comp.
                    p. 84), we have an important class of feelings determined by the relation of the
                    presentation of self to the other contents of consciousness. And as the
                    knowledge of other selves advances <hi rend="italic">pari passu</hi> with that
                    of one’s own self, so along with the egoistic feelings appear certain social or
                    altruistic feelings. The two have much in common; in pride and shame, for
                    example, account is taken of the estimate other persons form of us and of our
                    regard for them; while, on the other hand, when we admire or despise,
                    congratulate or pity another, we have always present to our mind a more or less
                    definite conception of self in like circumstances. It will therefore amply serve
                    all the ends of our present inquiry if we briefly survey the leading
                    characteristics of some contrasted egoistic feelings, such as self-complacency
                    and disappointment. When a man is pleased with himself, his achievements,
                    possessions, or circumstances, such pleasure is the result of a comparison of
                    his present position in this respect with some former position or with the
                    position of some one else. Without descending to details, we may say that two
                    prospects are before him, and the larger and fairer is recognized as his own.
                    Under disappointment or reverse the same two pictures may be present to his
                    mind, but accompanied by the certainty that the better is not his or is his no
                    more. So far, then, it might be said that the contents of his consciousness are
                    in each case the same, the whole difference lying in the different relationship
                    to self. But this makes all the difference even to the contents of his
                    consciousness, as we shall at once see if we consider its active side. Even the
                    idlest and most thoughtless mind teems with intentions and expectations, and in
                    its prosperity, like the fool in the parable, thinks to pull down its barns and
                    build greater, to take its ease, eat, drink, and be merry. The support of all
                    this pleasing show and these far-reaching aims is, not the bare knowledge of
                    what abundance will do, but the reflexion—These many goods are mine. In mind
                    alone final causes have a place, and the end can produce the beginning; the
                    prospect of a summer makes the present into spring. But action is paralysed or
                    impossible when the means evade us—</p>
                <p>“Now drops at once the pride of awful state, The golden canopy, the glittering
                    plate,”</p>
                <p>and a bleak and wintry barrenness is filled with the emptiness of despair. In so
                    far as a man’s life consists in the abundance of the things he possesseth, we
                    see then why it dwindles with these. The like holds where self-complacency or
                    displicency rests on a sense of personal worth or on the honour or affection of
                    others.</p>

                <p>We are now at the end of our survey of certain typical pleasurable and painful
                    states. The answer to our inquiry which it seems to suggest is that there is
                    pleasure in proportion as a maximum of attention is effectively exercised, and
                    pain in proportion as such effective attention is frustrated by distractions,
                    shocks, or incomplete and faulty adaptations, or fails of exercise, owing to the
                    narrowness of the field of consciousness and the slowness and smallness of its
                    changes. Something must be said in explication of this formula, and certain
                    objections that might be made to it must be considered. First of all, it implies
                    that feeling is determined partly by quantitative, or, as we might say,,
                    material, conditions, and partly by conditions that are formal or qualitative.
                    As regards the former, both the intensity or concentration of attention and its
                    diffusion or the extent of the field of consciousness have to be taken into
                    account. Attention, whatever else it is, is a limited quantity—</p>
                <p>Pluribus intentus minor est ad singula sensus—</p>
                <p>to quote Hamilton’s pet adage. Moreover, as we have seen, attention requires
                    time. If, then, attention be distributed over too wide a field, there is a
                    corresponding loss of intensity, and so of distinctness: we tend towards a
                    succession of indistinguishables—indistinguishable, therefore, from no
                    succession. We must not have more presentations in the field of consciousness
                    than will allow of some concentration of attention: a maximum diffusion will not
                    do. A maximum concentration, in like manner— even if there were no other
                    objection to it—would seem to conflict with the general conditions of
                    consciousness, inasmuch as a single simple presentation, however intense, would
                    admit of no differentiation, and any complex presentation is in some sort a
                    plurality. The most effective attention, then, as regards its quantitative
                    conditions, must lie somewhere between the two zeros of complete indifference
                    and complete absorption. If there be an excess of diffusion, effective attention
                    will increase up to a certain point as concentration increases, but beyond that
                    point will decrease if this intensification continues to increase; and <hi
                    rend="italic">vice versa,</hi> if there be an excess of concentration. But,
                    inasmuch as these quantitative conditions involve a plurality of distinguishable
                    presentations or changes in consciousness, the way is open for formal conditions
                    as well. Since different presentations consort differently when above the
                    threshold of consciousness together, one field may be wider and yet as intense
                    as another, or intenser and yet as wide, owing to a more advantageous
                    arrangement of its constituents.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>As it is impossible to say that any distinguishable
                    presentation is absolutely simple, the hypothesis of subconsciousness would
                    leave us free to assume that any pleasantness or unpleasantness that cannot be
                    explained on the score of intensity is due to some obscure harmony or discord,
                    compatibility or incompatibility, of elements not separately discernible. But
                    this, though tempting, is not really a very scientific procedure. If a
                    particular presentation is pleasurable or painful in such wise as to lead to a
                    redistribution of attention, it is reasonable to look for an explanation
                    primarily in its connexion with the rest of the field of consciousness.
                    Moreover, it is obvious—since what takes place in subconsciousness can only be
                    explained in analogy with what takes place in consciousness—that, if we have an
                    inexplicable in the one, we must have a corresponding inexplicable in the other.
                    If the feeling produced by what comports itself as a simple presentation cannot
                    be explained by what is in consciousness, we should be forced to admit that some
                    presentations are unpleasant simply because they are unpleasant—an
                    inexplicability which the hypothesis of subconsciousness might push farther back
                    but would not remove.</p></note></p>
                <p>The doctrine here developed, viz., that feeling depends on efficiency, is in the
                    main as old as Aristotle; all that has been done is to give it a more accurately
                    psychological expression, and to free it from the implications of the faculty
                    theory,'in which form it was expounded by Hamilton. Of possible objections there
                    are at least two that we must anticipate, and the consideration of which will
                    help to make the general view clearer. First, it may be urged that, according to
                    this view, it ought to be one continuous pain to fall asleep, since in this
                    state consciousness is rapidly restricted both as to intensity and range. This
                    statement is entirely true as regards the intensity and substantially true as
                    regards the range, at least of the higher consciousness: certain massive and
                    agreeable organic sensations pertain to falling asleep, but the variety of
                    presentations at all events grows less. But then the capacity to attend is also
                    rapidly declining: even a slight intruding sensation entails an acute sense of
                    strain in one sense, in place of the massive pleasure of repose throughout; and
                    any voluntary concentration either in order to move or to think involves a like
                    organic conflict, futile effort, and arrest of balmy ease. There is as regards
                    the more definite constituents of the field of consciousness a close resemblance
                    between natural sleepiness and the state of monotonous humdrum we call tedium or
                    ennui; and yet the very same excitement that would relieve the one by
                    dissipating the weariness of inaction would disturb the other by renewing the
                    weariness of action: the one is commensurate with the resources of the moment,
                    the other is not. Thus the maximum of effective attention in question is, as
                    Aristotle would say, a maximum “relative to us.” It is possible, therefore, that
                    a change from a wider to a narrower field of consciousness may be a pleasurable
                    change, if attention is more effectively engaged. Strictly speaking, however,
                    the so-called negative pleasures of rest do not consist in a mere narrowing of
                    the field of consciousness so much as in a change in the amount of
                    concentration. Massive organic sensations connected with restoration take the
                    place of the comparatively acute sensations of jaded powers forced to work. We
                    have, then, in all cases to bear in mind this subjective relativity of all
                    pleasurable or painful states of consciousness.</p>
                <p>But there is still another and more serious difficulty to face. It has long been
                    a burning question with theoretical moralists whether pleasures differ only
                    quantitatively or differ qualitatively as well, whether psychological analysis
                    will justify the common distinction of higher and lower pleasures or force us to
                    recognize nothing but differences of degree, of duration, and so forth,—as
                    expounded, <hi rend="italic">e.g.,</hi> by Bentham, whose cynical <hi
                    rend="italic">mot,</hi><hi rend="italic superscript"> ti</hi> Pushpin is as good
                    as poetry provided it be as pleasant,” was long a stumbling-block in the way of
                    utilitarianism. The entire issue here is confused by an ambiguity in terms that
                    has been already noticed: pleasure and pleasures have not the same connotation.
                    By <hi rend="italic">a</hi> pleasure or pleasures we mean some assignable
                    presentation or presentations which are pleasant,— <hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi>
                    afford pleasure; by pleasure simply is meant this subjective state of feeling
                    itself. The former, like other objects of knowledge, admit of classification and
                    comparison: we may distinguish them as coarse or as noble, or, if we will, as
                    cheap and wholesome. But, while the <hi rend="italic">causes of</hi> feeling are
                    manifold, the feeling itself is a subjective state, varying only in intensity
                    and duration. The best evidence of this lies in the general character of the
                    actions that ensue through feeling,—the matter which has next to engage us.
                    Whatever be the variety in the sources of pleasure, whatever be the moral or
                    conventional estimate of their worthiness, if a given state of consciousness is
                    pleasant we seek to retain it, if painful to be rid of it: we prefer greater
                    pleasure before less, less pain before greater. This is, in fact, the whole
                    meaning of preference as a psychological term. Wisdom and folly prefer each the
                    course which the other rejects. Both courses cannot, indeed, be objectively
                    preferable; that, however, is not a matter for psychology. But, as soon as
                    reflexion begins, exceptions to this primary principle of action seem to arise
                    continually, even though we regard the individual as a law to himself. Such
                    exceptions<pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit20newyrich/page/n85/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0920-0085-0072"/>, however, we may presently find to be apparent
                    only. At any rate the principle is obviously true before reflexion begins,—true
                    so long as we are dealing with actually present sources of feeling, and not with
                    their re-presentations. But to admit this is psychologically to admit
                    everything, at least if mind is to be genetically explained. Assuming, then,
                    that we start with only quantitative variations of feeling, we have to attempt
                    to explain the development of formal and qualitative differences in the grounds
                    of feeling. But, if aversions and pursuits result from incommensurable states of
                    pain and pleasure, there seems no other way of saving the unity and continuity
                    of the subject except by a speculative assumption,—the doctrine known as the
                    freedom of the will. The one position involves the other, and the more
                    scientific course is to avoid both as far as we can.</p>
                <p>The question, then, is: How, if action depends in the last resort on a merely
                    quantitative difference, could it ever come about that what we call the higher
                    sources of feeling should supersede the lower? If it is only quantity that turns
                    the scales, where does quality come in, for we cannot say, <hi rend="italic"

                    rend="italic">in Ulis</hi> contains the answer in brief. We shall understand
                    this answer better if we look at a parallel case, or what is really our own from
                    another point of view. We distinguish between higher and lower forms of life: we
                    might say there is more life in a large oyster than in a small one, other things
                    being equal, but we should regard a crab as possessing not necessarily more
                    life—as measured by waste of tissue— but certainly as manifesting life in a
                    higher form. How, in the evolution of the animal kingdom, do we suppose this
                    advance to l· ave been made? The tendency at any one moment is simply towards
                    more life, simply growth; but this process of self-preservation imperceptibly
                    but steadily modifies the self that is preserved. The creature is bent only on
                    filling its skin; but in doing this as easily as may be it gets a better skin to
                    fill, and accordingly seeks to fill it differently. Though cabbage and honey are
                    what they were before, they have changed relatively to the grub now it has
                    become a butterfly. So, while we are all along preferring a more pleasurable
                    state of consciousness before a less, the content of our consciousness is
                    continually changing; the greater pleasure still outweighs the less, but the
                    pleasures to be weighed are either wholly different, or at least are the same
                    for us no more. What we require, then, is not that the higher pleasures shall
                    always afford greater pleasure than the lower did, but that to advance to the
                    level of life on which pleasure is derived from higher objects shall on the
                    whole be more pleasurable and less painful than to remain behind. And this
                    condition seems provided in the fact of accommodation above referred to (p. 69)
                    and in the important fact that attention can be more effectively expended by
                    what we may therefore call improvements in the form of the field of
                    consciousness. But when all is said and done a certain repugnance is apt to
                    arise against any association of the differences between the higher and lower
                    feelings with differences of quantity. Yet such repugnance is but another
                    outcome of the common mistake of supposing that the real is obtained by pulling
                    to pieces rather than by building up.</p>

                <p>But no logical analysis—nay, further, no logical synthesis —is adequate to the
                    fulness of things. For the rest, such aversion is wholly emotional, and has no

                <p>We turn now from the causes of feeling to its manifestations or effects, and have
                    here in like manner to inquire whether there is in these also any contrast
                    corresponding to the opposing extremes of pleasure and pain. We have already
                    seen reasons for dismissing reflex movements or movements not determined by
                    feeling as psychologically secondary, the effects of habit and heredity, and for
                    regarding those diffusive movements that are immediately expressive of feeling
                    as primordial,—such movements as are strictly purposive being gradually selected
                    or elaborated from them. But some distinction is called for among the various
                    movements expressive of emotion; for there is more in these than the direct
                    effect of feeling regarded as merely pleasure or pain. It has been usual with
                    psychologists to confound emotions with feeling, because intense feeling is
                    essential to emotion. But, strictly speaking, a state of emotion is a complete
                    state of mind, a psychosis, and not a psychical element, if we may so say. Thus
                    in anger we have over and above pain a more or less definite object as its
                    cause, and a certain characteristic reactive display—frowns, compressed lips,
                    erect head, clenched fists, in a word, the combative attitude—as its effect, and
                    similarly of other emotions; so that generally in the particular movements
                    indicative of particular emotions the primary and primitive effects of feeling
                    are overlaid by what Darwin has called serviceable associated habits. The
                    purposive actions of an earlier stage of development become, though somewhat
                    atrophied as it were, the emotive outlet of a later stage: in the circumstances
                    in which our ancestors worried their enemies we only show our teeth. We must,
                    therefore, leave aside the more complex emotional manifestations and look only
                    to the simplest effects of pleasure and of pain, if we are to discover any
                    fundamental contrast between them.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>Of the three principles Darwin advances in explanation of
                    emotional expression that which he places last—perhaps because it admits of less
                    definite illustration — seems both psychologically and physiologically more
                    fundamental than the more striking principle of serviceable associated habits
                    which he places first; indeed the following, which is his statement of it,
                    implies as much: “Certain actions which we recognize as expressive of certain
                    states of mind are the direct result of the constitution of the nervous system,
                    and have been from the first independent of the will, and to a large extent of
                    habit” <hi rend="italic">{Expression oj the Emotions,</hi> p. 66). It is in
                    illustration of this principle too that Darwin describes the movements
                    expressive of joy and grief, emotions which in some form or other are surely the
                    most primitive of any.</p></note></p>
                <p>Joy finds expression in dancing, clapping the hands, and meaningless laughter,
                    and these actions are not only pleasurable in themselves but such as increase
                    the existing pleasure. Attention is not drafted off or diverted; but rather the
                    available resources seem reinforced, so that the old expenditure is supported as
                    well as the new. To the pleasure on the receptive side is added pleasure on the
                    active side. The violent contortions due to pain, on the other hand, are painful
                    in themselves, though less intense than the pains from which they withdraw
                    attention: they are but counter-irritants that arrest or inhibit still more
                    painful thoughts or sensations. Thus, according to Darwin, “sailors who are
                    going to be flogged sometimes take a piece of lead into their mouths in order to
                    bite it with their utmost force, and thus to bear the pain.” When in this way we
                    take account of the immediate effects as well <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit20newyrich/page/n86/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0920-0086-0073"/> as of the causes of feeling, we find it still
                    more strikingly true that only in pleasurable states is there an efficient
                    expenditure of attention. It is needless now to dwell upon this point, although
                    any earlier mention of it would hardly have been in place. But we should fail to
                    realize the contrast between the motor effects of pleasure and of pain if we
                    merely regarded them as cases of diffusion. The intenser the feeling the
                    intenser the reaction, no doubt, whether it be smiles or tears, jumping for joy,
                    or writhing in agony; but in the movements consequent on pleasure the diffusion
                    is the result of mere exuberance, an overflow of good spirits, as we sometimes
                    say, and these movements, as already remarked, are always comparatively
                    purposeless or playful. Even the earliest expressions of pain, on the contrary,
                    seem but so many efforts to escape from the cause of it; in them there is at
                    least the blind purpose to flee from a definite ill, but in pleasure only the
                    enjoyment of present fortune.</p>
                <p>From Plato downwards psychologists and moralists have been fond of discussing the
                    relation of pleasure and pain. It has been maintained that pain is the first and
                    more fundamental fact, and pleasure nothing but relief from pain; and, again, on
                    the other side, that pleasure is prior and positive, and pain only the negation
                    of pleasure. So far as the mere change goes, it is obviously true that the
                    diminution of pain is <hi rend="italic">pro</hi><hi rend="italic">tanto</hi>
                    pleasant, and the diminution of pleasure <hi rend="italic">pro</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">tanto</hi> unpleasant; and if relativity had the unlimited range
                    sometimes assigned to it this would be all we could say. But we must sooner or
                    later recognize the existence of a comparatively fixed neutral state, deviations
                    from which, of comparatively short duration and of sufficient intensity,
                    constitute distinct states of pleasure or pain. Such states, if not of liminal
                    intensity, may then be further diminished without reversing their pleasurable or
                    painful character. The turning-point here implied may, of course, gradually
                    change too,—as a result, in fact, of the law of accommodation. Thus a long run
                    of pleasure would raise “the hedonistic zero,” while—to the small extent to
                    which accommodation to pain is possible—a continuance of pain would lower it.
                    But such admission makes no material difference where the actual feeling of the
                    moment is alone concerned and retrospect out of the question. On the whole it
                    seems, therefore, most reasonable to regard pleasure and pain as emerging out of
                    a neutral state, which is prior to and distinct from both,—not a state of
                    absolute indifference, but of simple contentment, marked by no special active
                    display. But it is by reference to such state of equilibrium or <hi
                    rend="italic">άπαθία</hi> that we see most clearly the superior volitional
                    efficacy of pain upon which pessimists love to descant. “Nobody,” says Von
                    Hartmann, “who had to choose between no taste at all for ten minutes or five
                    minutes of a pleasant taste and then five minutes of an unpleasant taste, would
                    prefer the last.” Most men and all the lower animals are content “to let ιvell
                    alone.”</p>
                <p>To ascertain the origin and progress of purposive action it seems, then, that we
                    must look to the effects of pain rather than to those of pleasure. Necessity is
                    the mother of invention, and all things are full of labour. It is true that
                    psychologists not unfrequently describe the earliest purposive movements as
                    appetitive; or at least they treat appetitive and aversive movements as
                    co-ordinate and equally primitive, pleasures being supposed to lead to actions
                    for their continuance as much as pains to actions for their removal. No doubt,
                    as soon as the connexion between a pleasurable sensation and the appropriate
                    action is completely established, as in the case of imbibing food, the whole
                    process is then self-sustaining till satiety begins. But the point is that such
                    facility was first acquired under the teaching of pain,—the pain of unsatisfied
                    hunger. The term “appetite” is apt both by its etymology and its later
                    associations to be misleading. What are properly called the “instinctive”
                    appetites are—when regarded from their active side—movements determined by some
                    existing uneasy sensation. So far as their earliest manifestation in a
                    particular individual is concerned, this urgency seems almost entirely of the
                    nature of a <hi rend="italic">vis a tergo;</hi> and the movements are only more
                    definite than those simply expressive of pain because of inherited
                    pre-adaptation, on which account, of course, they are called “instinctive.” But
                    what one inherits another must have acquired, and we have agreed here to leave
                    heredity on one side and consider only the original evolution.</p>
                <p>But if none but psychological causes were at work this evolution would be very
                    long and in its early stages very uncertain. At first, when only random
                    movements ensue, we may fairly suppose both that the chance of at once making a
                    happy hit would be small and that the number of chances, the space for
                    repentance, would also be small. Under such circumstances natural selection
                    would have to do almost everything and subjective selection almost nothing. So
                    far as natural selection worked, we should have, not the individual subject
                    making a series of tries and perfecting itself by practice, as in learning to
                    dance or swim, but we should have those individuals whose stuff or structure
                    happened to vary for the better surviving, increasing, and displacing the rest.
                    How much natural selection, apparently unaided, can accomplish in the way of
                    complicated adjustment we see in the adaptation of the form and colour of plants
                    and animals to their environment. Both factors, in reality, operate at once, and
                    it would be hard to fix a limit to either, though to our minds natural selection
                    seems to lose in comparative importance as we advance towards the higher stages
                    of life.</p>
                <p>But psychologically we have primarily to consider subjective selection, <hi
                    rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> first of all, the association of particular movements
                    with particular sensations through the mediation of feeling. The sensations here
                    concerned are mainly painful excitations from the environment, the recurring
                    pains of innutrition, weariness, &amp;c., and pleasurable sensations due to the
                    satisfaction of these organic wants—pleasures which, although not a mere
                    “filling up,” as Plato at one time contended, are still preceded by pain, but
                    imply over and above the removal of this a certain surplus of positive good.
                    There seem only a few points to notice, (a) When the movements that ensue
                    through pleasure are themselves pleasurable there is ordinarily no ground for
                    singling out any one; such movements simply enhance the general enjoyment, which
                    is complete in itself and so far contains no hint of anything beyond, (δ) Should
                    one of these spontaneous movements of pleasure chance to cause pain, no doubt
                    such movement is speedily arrested. Probably the most immediate connexion
                    possible between feeling and purposive action is that in which a painful
                    movement leads through pain to its own suppression. But such connexion is not
                    very fruitful of consequences, inasmuch as it only secures what we may call
                    internal training and does little to extend the relation of the individual to
                    its environment, (c) Out of the irregular, often conflicting movements which
                    indirectly relieve pain some one may chance to remove the cause of it
                    altogether. Upon this movement, the last of a tentative series, attention,
                    released from the pain, is concentrated; and in this way the evil and the remedy
                    become so far associated that on a recurrence of the former the many diffused
                    movements become less, and the one purposive movement more, pronounced; the one
                    effectual way is at length established and the others, which were but
                    palliatives, disappear. (&lt;Z) When things have advanced so far that some one
                    definite movement is definitely represented along with the painful sensation it
                    remedies, it is not long before a still further advance is possible and we have
                    <hi rend="italic">preventive movements.</hi> Thanks to the orderliness of
                    things, dangers have their premonitions. After a time, therefore, the occurrence
                    of some signal sensation revives the image of the harm that has previously
                    followed in its wake, and a movement—either like the first, or another that has
                    to be selected from the random tries of fear—occurs in time to avert the
                    impending ill. (e) In like manner, provided the cravings of appetite are felt,
                    any signs of the presence of pleasurable objects prompt to movements for theiι∙

                    action determined by perceptions. The cases in which the subject is incited to
                    action by ideas as distinct from perceptions require a more detailed
                    consideration; such are the facts mainly covered by the term “desire.”</p>
                <p>By the time that ideas are sufficiently self-sustaining to form trains that are
                    not wholly shaped by the circumstances of the present, entirely new
                    possibilities of action are opened up. We can desire to live again through
                    experiences of which there is nothing actually present to remind us, and we can
                    desire a new experience which as yet we only imagine. We often, no doubt, apply
                    the term to the simpler states mentioned under <hi rend="italic">(e)</hi> in the
                    last ]∙aragraph: the fox in the fable is said to have desired the grapes he
                    vilified because out of his reach. Again, at the other extreme it is usual to
                    speak of a desire for honour·, or for wealth, and the like; but such are not so
                    much single states of mind as inclinations or habitual desires. Moreover,
                    abstractions of this kind belong to a more advanced stage of development than
                    that at which desire begins, and of necessity imply more complicated grounds of
                    action than we can at present examine. The essential characteristics of desire
                    will be more apparent if we suppose a case somewhere between these extremes. A
                    busy man reads a novel at the close of the day, and finds himself led off by a
                    reference to angling or tropical scenery to picture himself with his rods packed
                    <hi rend="italic">en</hi><hi rend="italic">route</hi> for Scotland, or booked by
                    the next steamer for the fairyland of the West Indies. Presently, while the
                    ideas of Jamaica or fishing are at least as vividly imagined as before, the
                    fancied preparations receive a rude shock as the thought of his work recurs.
                    Some such case we may take as typical and attempt to analyse it.</p>
                <p>First of all it is obviously true, at least of such more concrete desires, that
                    what awakens desire at one time fails to do so at another, and that we are often
                    so absorbed or content with the present as not to be amenable to (new) desires
                    at all. A given X or Y cannot, then, be called desirable <hi rend="italic">per
                    se,</hi> it is only desirable by relation to the contents of consciousness at
                    the moment. Of what nature is this relation? (1) At the level of psychical life
                    that we have now reached very close and complete connexions have been formed
                    between ideas and the movements necessary for their realization, so that when
                    the idea is vividly present these movements are apt to be nascent. This
                    association is the result of subjective selection— <hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi>
                    of feeling—but, being once established, it persists like other associations
                    independently of it. (2) Those movements are especially apt to become nascent
                    which have not been recently executed, which are therefore fresh and accompanied
                    by the organic sensations of freshness, but also those which are frequently
                    executed, and so from habit readily aroused. The latter fact, which chiefly
                    concerns habitual desires, may be left aside for a time. (3) At times, then,
                    when there is a lack of present interests, or when these have begun to wane, or
                    when there is positive pain, attention is ready to fasten on any new suggestion
                    that calls for more activity, requires a change of active attitude, or promises
                    relief. Such spontaneous concentration of attention ensures greater vividness to
                    the new idea, whatever it be, and to its belongings. In some cases this greater
                    vividness may suffice. This is most likely to happen when the new idea affords
                    intellectual occupation, and this is at the time congenial, or with indolent and
                    imaginative persons who prefer dreaming to doing. (4) But when the new idea does
                    not lead off the pent-up stream of action by opening out fresh channels, when,
                    instead of this, it is one that keeps them intent upon itself in an attitude
                    comparable to expectation, then we have desire. In such a state the intensity of
                    the re-presentation is not adequate to the intensity of the incipient actions it
                    has aroused. This is most obvious when the latter are directed towards
                    sensations or percepts, and the former remains only an idea. If it were possible
                    by concentrating attention to convert ideas into percepts, there would be an end
                    of most desires: “if wishes were horses beggars would ride.” (5) But our
                    voluntary power over movements is in general of this kind: here the fiat may
                    become fact. When we cannot hear we can at least listen, and, though there be
                    nothing to fill them, we can at least hold out our hands. It would seem, then,
                    that the source of desire lies essentially in this excess of the active reaction
                    above the intensity of the re-presentation (the one constituting the “impulse,”
                    the other the “object” of desire, or the desideratum), and that this disparity
                    rests ultimately on the fact that movements have, and sensations have not, a
                    subjective initiative. (6) The impulse or striving to act will, as already
                    hinted, be stronger the greater the available energy, the fewer the present
                    outlets, and, habits apart, the fresher the new opening for activity. (7)
                    Finally, it is to be noted that, when such inchoate action can be at once
                    consummated, desire ends where it begins: to constitute a definite state of
                    desire there must be not only an obstacle to the realization of the
                    desideratum—if this were all we should rather call the state one of wishing—but
                    an obstacle to its realization by means of the actions its representation has
                    aroused.</p>
                <p>However the desire may have been called forth, its intensity is primarily
                    identical with the strength of this impulse to action, and has no definite or
                    constant relation to the amount of pleasure that may result from its
                    satisfaction. The feeling directly consequent on desire as a state of want and
                    restraint is one of pain, and the reaction which this pain sets up may either
                    suppress the desire or prompt to efforts to avoid or overcome the obstacles in
                    its way. To inquire into these alternatives would lead us into the higher phases
                    of voluntary action; but we must first consider the relation of desire to
                    feeling more closely.</p>
                <p>Instances are by no means wanting of very imperious desires accompanied by the
                    clear knowledge that their gratification will be positively distasteful.<note

                    is possible to recollect or picture circumstances known or believed to be
                    intensely pleasurable without any desire for them being awakened at all: we can
                    regret or admire without desiring. Yet there are many psychologists who maintain
                    that desire is excited only by the prospect of the pleasure that may arise
                    through its gratification, and that the strength of the desire is proportional
                    to the intensity of the pleasure thus anticipated. <hi rend="italic"

                    specie</hi><hi rend="italic">boni</hi> is their main formula. The plausibility
                    of this doctrine rests partly upon a seemingly imperfect analysis of what
                    strictly pertains to desire and partly on the fact that it is substantially true
                    both of what we may call “presentation-prompted” action, which belongs to an
                    earlier stage than desire, and of the more or less rational action that comes
                    later. In the very moment of enjoyment it may be fairly supposed that action is
                    sustained solely by the pleasure received and is proportional to the intensity
                    of that pleasure. But there is here no re-presentation and no seeking; the
                    conditions essential to desire, therefore, do not apply. Again, in rational
                    action, where both are present, it may be true —to quote the words of an able
                    advocate of the view here controverted—that “our character as rational beings is
                    to desire everything exactly according to its pleasure value.”<note

                    conceptions as the good, pleasure value, and rational action involve. Here we
                    have foresight and calculation, regard for self as an object of permanent <pb

                    such is blind, without either the present certainty of sense or the assured
                    prevision of reason. Pleasure in the past, no doubt, has usually brought about
                    the association between the representation of the desired object and the
                    movement for its realization; but neither the recollection of this pleasure nor
                    its anticipation is necessary to desire, and even when present they do not
                    determine what urgency it will have. The best proof of this lies in certain
                    habitual desires. Pleasures are diminished by repetition, whilst habits are
                    strengthened by it; if the intensity of desire, therefore, were proportioned to
                    the “pleasure value” of its gratification, the desire for renewed gratification
                    should diminish as this pleasure grows less; but, if the present pain of
                    restraint from action determines the intensity of desire, this should increase
                    as the action becomes habitual. And observation seems to show that, unless
                    prudence suggest the forcible suppression of belated desires or the active
                    energies themselves fail, desires do in fact become more imperious, although
                    less productive of positive pleasure, as time goes on.</p>
                <p>In this there is, of course, no exception to the general principle that action is
                    consequent on feeling,—a greater pleasure being preferred before a less, a less
                    pain before a greater; for, though the feeling that follows upon its
                    satisfaction be less or even change entirely, still the pain of the unsatisfied
                    desire increases as the desire hardens into habit. It is also a point in favour
                    of the position here taken that appetites, which may be compared to inherited
                    desires, certainly prompt to action by present pain rather than by prospective
                    pleasure.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Intellection.</hi></p>
                <p>Desire naturally prompts to the search for the means to its satisfaction and
                    frequently to a mental rehearsal of various possible courses of action, their
                    advantages and disadvantages. Thus, by the time the ideational continuum has
                    become, mainly by the comparatively passive working of association, sufficiently
                    developed to furnish thinking material, motives are forthcoming for thinking to
                    begin. It is obviously impossible to assign any precise time for this advance;
                    like all others, it is gradual. Fitfully, in strange circumstances and under
                    strong excitement, the lower animals give unmistakable signs that they can
                    understand and reason. But thought as a permanent activity may be fairly said to
                    originate in and even to depend upon the acquisition of speech. This
                    indispensable instrument, which more than anything else enables our
                    psychological individual to advance to the distinctly human or rational stage,
                    consists of gestures and vocal utterances, which were originally—and indeed are
                    still to a large extent— emotional expressions.<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>It must here be noted that, though we still
                    retain our psychological standpoint, the higher development of the individual is
                    only possible through intercourse with other individuals, that is to say,
                    through society. Without language we should be mutually exclusive and
                    impenetrable, like so many physical atoms; with it each several mind may
                    transcend its own limits and share the minds of others. As a herd of individuals
                    mankind would have a natural history as other animals have; but personality can
                    only emerge out of intercourse with persons, and of such intercourse language is
                    the means. But, important as is this addition of a transparent and responsive
                    world of minds to the dead opaqueness of external things, the development of our
                    psychological individual still remains a purely individual development. The only
                    new point is—and it is of the highest importance to keep it in sight— that the
                    materials of this development no longer consist of nothing but presentations
                    elaborated by a single mind in accordance with psychical laws. But that
                    combination of individual experiences that converts subjective idiosyncrasy and
                    isolation into the objectivity and solidarity of Universal Mind only affects the
                    individual in accordance with psychical laws, and we have no need therefore to
                    overstep our proper domain in studying the advance from the non-rational phase
                    to the phase of reason.</p></note> It is a question of the highest interest to
                    ascertain the general mode of its elaboration; but as to this the reader must

                    s^.). Our space will only allow us to note in what way language, when it already
                    exists, is instrumental in the development as distinct from the communi cation
                    of thought. But, first of all, what in general is thinking, of which language is
                    the instrument <hi rend="italic">1</hi></p>
                <p>In entering upon this inquiry we are really passing one of the hardest and
                    fastest lines of the old psychology,—that between sense and understanding. So
                    long as it was the fashion to assume a multiplicity of faculties the need was
                    less felt for a clear exposition of their connexion. A man had senses and
                    intellect much as he had eyes and ears; the heterogeneity in the one case was no
                    more puzzling than in the other. But for psychologists who do not cut the knot
                    in this fashion it is confessedly a hard matter to explain the relation of the
                    two. The contrast of receptivity and activity hardly avails, for all
                    presentation involves activity and essentially the same activity, that of
                    attention. Nor can we well maintain that the presentations attended to differ in
                    kind, albeit such a view has been held from Plato downwards. <hi rend="italic"

                    possess. If pure being is pure nothing, pure thought is equally empty. Thought
                    consists of a certain elaboration of sensory and motor presentations and has no
                    content apart from these. We cannot even say that the forms of this elaboration
                    are psychologically <hi rend="italic">a priori</hi>; on the contrary, what is
                    epistemologically the most fundamental is the last to be psychologically
                    realized. This is not only true as a fact; it is also true of necessity, in so
                    far as the formation of more concrete concepts is an essential preliminary to
                    the formation of others more abstract, —those most abstract, like the Kantian
                    categories, &amp;c., being thus the last of all to be thought out or understood.
                    And though this formative work is substantially voluntary, yet, if we enter upon
                    it, the form at each step is determined by the so-called matter, and not by us;
                    in this respect “the spontaneity of thought” is not really freer than the

                    with our understanding: all that is voluntary in our knowledge is the employing
                    or withholding any of our faculties from this or that sort of objects and a more
                    or less accurate survey of them” <hi rend="italic">{Essay,</hi> iv. 13,
                    2).</p></note> It is sometimes said that thought is synthetic, and this is true;
                    but imagination is synthetic also; and the processes which yield the ideational
                    train are the only processes at work in intellectual synthesis. Moreover, it
                    would be arbitrary to say at what point the mere generic image ceases and the
                    true concept begins,—so continuous are the two. No wonder, therefore, that
                    English psychology has been prone to regard thought as only a special kind of
                    perception—perceiving the agreement or disagreement of ideas—and the ideas
                    themselves as mainly the products of association. Yet this is much like
                    confounding observation with experiment or invention,—the act of a cave-man in
                    betaking himself to a drifting tree with that of Noah in building himself an
                    ark. In reverie, and even in understanding the communications of others, we are
                    comparatively passive spectators of ideational movements, non-voluntarily
                    determined. But in thinking or “intellection,” as it has been conveniently
                    termed, there is always a search for something more or less'vaguely conceived,
                    for a clue which will be known when it occurs by seeming to satisfy certain
                    conditions. Thinking may be broadly"described as solving a problem,—finding an
                    AX that is B. In so doing we start from a comparatively fixed central idea or
                    intuition and work along the several diverging lines of ideas associated with
                    it,—hence far the aptest and in fact the oldest description of thought is that
                    it is <hi rend="italic">discursive.</hi> Emotional excitement—and at the outset
                    the natural man does not think much in cold blood—quickens the flow of ideas:
                    what seems relevant is at once contemplated more closely, while what seems
                    irrelevant awakens little interest and receives little attention. At first the
                    control acquired is but very imperfect; the actual course of thought of even a
                    disciplined mind falls far short of the clearness, distinc tness, and coherence
                    of the logician’s ideal. Familiar associations hurry attention away from the
                    proper topic, and thought becomes not only discursive but wandering; in place of
                    concepts of fixed and crystalline completeness, such as logic describes, we may
                    find a congeries of ideas but imperfectly compacted into one generic idea,
                    subject to continual transformation and implicating much that is irrelevant and
                    confusing.</p>
                <p>Thus, while it is possible for thought to begin without language, just as arts
                    may begin without tools, yet language enables us to carry the same process
                    enormously farther. In the first place it gives us an increased command of even
                    such comparatively concrete generic images as can be <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0920-0089-0076"/> formed without it. The name of a thing or action
                    becomes for one who knows the name as much an objective mark or attribute as any
                    quality whatever can be. The form and colour of what we call an “orange” are
                    perhaps even more intimately combined with the sound and utterance of this word
                    than with the taste and fragrance which we regard as strictly essential to the
                    thing. But, whereas its essential attributes often evade us, we can always
                    command its nominal attribute, in so far as this depends upon movements of
                    articulation. By uttering the name (or hearing it uttered) we have secured to
                    us, in a greater or less degree, that superior vividness-and definiteness that
                    pertain to images reinstated by impressions: our idea approximates to the fixity
                    and independence of a percept (comp. p. 57 above). With young children and
                    uncultured minds—who, by the way, commonly “think aloud ”—the gain in this
                    respect is probably more striking than those not confined to their mother-tongue
                    or those used to an analytical handling of language at all realize.<note

                    When things are thus made ours by receiving names from us and we can freely
                    manipulate them in idea, it becomes easier mentally to bring together facts that
                    logically belong together, and so to classify and generalize. For names set us
                    free from the cumbersome tangibility and particularity of perception, which is
                    confined to just what is presented here and now. But as ideas increase in
                    generality they diminish in definiteness and unity; they not only become less
                    pictorial and more schematic, but they become vague and unsteady as well,
                    because formed from a number of concrete images only related as regards one or
                    two constituents, and not assimilated as the several images of the same thing
                    may be. The mental picture answering to the word “horse” has, so to say, body
                    enough to remain a steady object when under attention from time to time; but
                    that answering to the word “animal” is perhaps scarcely twice alike. The
                    relations of things could thus never be readily recalled or steadily controlled
                    if the names of those relations, which as words always remain concrete, did not
                    give us a definite hold upon them,— make them comprehensible. Once these “airy
                    nothings” have a name, we reap again the advantages a concrete constituent
                    affords: by its means that which is relevant becomes more closely associated,
                    and that which is irrelevant—abstracted from—falls off. When what answers to the
                    logical connotation or meaning of a concept is in this way linked with the name,
                    it is no longer necessary that such “matter or content” should be distinctly
                    present in consciousness. It takes time for an image to raise its associates
                    above the threshold; and, when all are there, there is more demand upon
                    attention in proportion. There is thus a manifest economy in what Leibnitz
                    happily styled “symbolic,” in contrast to “intuitive” thinking. Our power of
                    efficient attention is limited, and with words for counters we can, as Leibnitz
                    remarks, readily perform operations involving very complex presentations, and
                    wait till these operations are concluded before realizing and spreading out the
                    net result in sterling coin.</p>
                <p>But this simile must not mislead us. In actual thinking there never is any
                    complete separation between the symbol and the ideas symbolized: the movements
                    of the one are never entirely suspended till those of the other are complete.
                    “Thus,” says Hume, “if, instead of saying, that in war the weaker have always
                    recourse to negotiation, we should say, that they have always recourse to
                    conquest, the custom which we have acquired of attributing certain relations to
                    ideas still follows the words and makes us immediately perceive the absurdity of
                    that proposition.”<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi

                    surprises that give what point there is to puns, and by the small confusion that
                    results from the existence of homo-nymous terms. The question thus arises—What
                    are the properly ideational elements concerned in thought? Over this question
                    psychologists long waged fight as either nominalists or conceptualists. The
                    former maintain that what is imaged in connexion with a general concept, such as
                    triangle, is some individual triangle “taken in a certain light,”<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>So Hume, <hi rend="italic"
                    >op. cit.,</hi> p. 456.</p></note> while the latter maintain that an “abstract
                    idea” is formed embodying such constituents of the several particulars as the
                    concept connotes, but dissociated from the specific or accidental variations
                    that distinguish one particular from another. As often happens in such
                    controversies, each party saw the weak point in the other. The nominalists
                    easily showed that there was no distinct abstract idea representable apart from
                    particulars; and the conceptualists could as easily show that a particular
                    presentation “considered in a certain light” is no longer merely a particular
                    presentation nor yet a mere crowd of presentations. The very thing to ascertain
                    is what this consideration in a certain light implies. Perhaps a speedier end
                    might have been put to this controversy if either party had been driven to
                    define more exactly what was to be understood by image or idea. Such ideas as
                    are possible to us apart from abstraction are, as we have seen, revived
                    percepts, not revived sensations, are complex total re-presentations made up of
                    partial re-presentations (comp. p. 57). Reproductive imagination is so far but a
                    faint rehearsal of actual perceptions, and constructive imagination but a faint
                    anticipation of possible perceptions. In either case we are busied with
                    elementary presentations complicated or synthesized to what are tantamount to
                    intuitions, in so far as the forms of intuition remain in the idea, though the
                    fact, as tested by movement, &lt;fcc., is absent. The several partial
                    re-presentations, however, which make up an idea might also be called ideas, not
                    merely in the wide sense in which every mental object may be so called, but also
                    in the narrower sense as secondary presentations, <hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi>
                    as distinguished from primary presentations or impressions. But such isolated
                    images of an impression, even if possible, would no more be intuitions than the
                    mere impression itself would be one: taken alone the one would be as free of
                    space and time as is the other. Till it is settled, therefore, whether the
                    ideational elements concerned in conception are intuitive complexes or something
                    answering to the ultimate elements of these, nothing further can be done.</p>
                <p>In the case of what are specially called “concrete” as distinct from “abstract”
                    conceptions—if this rough-and-ready, but unscientific, distinction maybe
                    allowed—the idea answering to the concept differs little from an intuition, and
                    we have already remarked that the generic image <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Gemeinbild</hi> of German psychologists) constitutes the connecting link
                    between imagination and conception. But even concerning these it is useless to
                    ask what does one imagine in thinking, <hi rend="italic">e.g.,</hi> of triangle
                    or man or colour. We never—except for the sake of this very inquiry— attempt to
                    fix our minds in this manner upon some isolated conception; in actual thinking
                    ideas are not in consciousness alone and disjointedly but as part of a context.
                    When the idea “man” is present, it is present in some proposition or question,
                    as—Man is the paragon of animals; In man there is nothing great but mind; and so
                    on. It is quite clear that in understanding or mentally verifying such
                    statements very different constituents out of the <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit20newyrich/page/n90/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0920-0090-0077"/> whole complex “man” are prominent in each.
                    Further, what is present to consciousness when a general term is understood will
                    differ, not only with a different context, but also the longer we dwell upon it:
                    we may either analyse its connotation or muster its denotation, as the context
                    or the cast of our minds may determine. Thus what is relevant is alone
                    prominent, and the more summary the attention we bestow the less the full extent
                    and intent of the concept are displayed. To the nominalist’s objection, that it
                    is impossible to imagine a man without imagining him as either tall or short,
                    young or old, dark or light, and so forth, the conceptualist might reply that at
                    all events percepts may be clear without being distinct, that we can recognize a
                    tree without recognizing what kind of tree it is, and that, moreover, the
                    objection proves too much: for, if our image is to answer exactly to fact, we
                    must represent not only a tall or a short man but a man of definite nature,—one
                    not merely either light or dark, but of a certain precise complexion. But the
                    true answer rather is that in conceiving as such we do not necessarily imagine
                    <hi rend="italic">a</hi> man or <hi rend="italic">a</hi> tree at all, any more
                    than—if such an illustration may serve—in writing the equation to the parabola
                    we necessarily draw a parabola as well.</p>
                <p>The individuality of a concept is thus not to be confounded with the sensible
                    concreteness of an intuition either distinct or indistinct, and “the pains and
                    skill” which Locke felt were required in order to frame what he called an
                    abstract idea are not comparable to the pains and skill that may be necessary to
                    discriminate or decipher what is faint or fleeting. The material “framed”
                    consists no doubt of ideas, if by this is meant that in thinking we work
                    ultimately with the ideational continuum, but what results is never a mere
                    intuitive complex nor yet a mere group of such. The concept or “abstract idea”
                    only emerges when a certain intelligible relation is established among the
                    members of such a group; and the very same intuition may furnish the material
                    for different concepts as often as a different <hi rend="italic"
                    >geistiges</hi><hi rend="italic">Band</hi> is drawn between them. The stuff of
                    this bond, as we have seen, is the word, and this brings into the foreground of
                    consciousness when necessary those elements—whether they form an intuition or
                    not—which are relevant to the concept. Conception, then, is not identical with
                    imagination, although the two terms are still often, and were once generally,
                    regarded as synonymous. The same ultimate materials occur in each; but in the
                    one they start with and retain a sensible form, in the other they are elaborated
                    into the form which is called “intelligible.”</p>
                <p>The distinctive character of this intellectual synthesis lies, we have seen, in
                    the fact that it is determined entirely by what is synthesized, whether that be
                    the elementary constituents of intuitions or general relations of whatever kind
                    among these. It differs, therefore, in being selective from the synthesis of
                    ideation, which rests upon contiguity and unites together whatever occurs
                    together. It differs also from any synthesis, though equally voluntary in its
                    initiation, which is determined by a purely subjective preference, in that
                    intellection depends upon objective relations alone. Owing to the influence of
                    logic, which has long been in a much more forward state than psychology, it has
                    been usual to resolve intellection into comparison, abstraction, and
                    classification, after this fashion: ABCM and ABCN are compared, their
                    differences Μ and N left out of sight, and the class notion ABC formed including
                    both; the same process repeated with ABC and ABD yields a higher class notion
                    AB; and so on. But our ideational continuum is not a mere string of ideas of
                    concrete things, least of all such concrete things as this view implies. Not
                    till our daily life resembles that of a museum porter receiving specimens will
                    our higher mental activity be comparable to that of the savant who sorts such
                    specimens into cases and compartments. What we perceive is a world of things in
                    continual motion, waxing, waning, the centres of manifold changes, affecting us
                    and apparently affected by each other, amenable to our action and, as it seems,
                    continually interacting among themselves. Even the individual thing, as our
                    brief analysis of perception attempts to show (comp. pp. 55, 56), is not a mere
                    sum of properties which can be taken to pieces and distributed like type, but a
                    whole combined of parts very variously related. To understand intellection we
                    must look at its actual development under the impetus of practical needs, rather
                    than to logical ideals of what it ought to be. Like other forms of purposive
                    activity, thinking is primarily undertaken as a means to an end, and especially
                    the end of economy. It is often easier and always quicker to manipulate ideas
                    than to manipulate real things; to the common mind the thoughtful man is one who
                    “uses his head to save his heels.” In all the arts of life, in the growth of
                    language and institutions, in scientific explanation, and even in the
                    speculations of philosophy, we may remark a steady simplification in the steps
                    to a given end or conclusion, or—what is for our present inquiry the same
                    thing—the attainment of better results with the same means. The earliest
                    machines are the most cumbrous and clumsy, the earliest speculations the most
                    fanciful and anthropomorphic. Gradually imitation yields to invention, the
                    natural fallacy of <hi rend="italic">post hoc, ergo propter hoc</hi> to
                    methodical induction, till what is essential and effective is realized and
                    appreciated and what is accidental and inert is discarded and falls out of
                    sight. In this way man advances in the construction of a complete mental clue or
                    master-key to the intricacies of the real world, but this key is still the
                    counterpart of the world it enables us to control and explain.</p>
                <p>To describe the process by which such insight is attained as a mere matter of
                    abstraction deserves the stigma of “soulless blunder” which Hegel applied to it.
                    Of course if attention is concentrated on X it must <hi rend="italic"
                    >pro</hi><hi rend="italic">tanto</hi> be abstracted from Y, and such command of
                    attention may require “some pains and skill.” But to see in this invariable
                    accompaniment of thinking its essential feature is much like the schoolboy’s
                    saying that engraving consists in cutting fine shavings out of a hard block. The
                    great thing is to find out what are the light-bearing and fruitbearing
                    combinations. Moreover, thinking does not begin with a conscious abstraction of
                    attention from recognized differences in the way logicians describe. The actual
                    process of generalization, for the most part at all events, is much simpler. The
                    same name is applied to different things or events because only their more
                    salient features are perceived at all. Their differences, so far from being
                    consciously and with effort left out of account, often cannot be observed when
                    attention is directed to them: to the inexperienced all <hi rend="italic"
                    >is</hi> gold that glitters. Thus, and as an instance of the principle of
                    progressive differentiation already noted (p. 42), we find genera recognized
                    before species, and the species obtained by adding on differences, not the genus
                    by abstracting from them. Of course such vague and indefinite concepts are not
                    at first logically general: they only become so when certain common elements are
                    consciously noted as pertaining to presentations in other respects qualitatively
                    different, as well as numerically distinct. But actually thinking starts from
                    such more potential generality as is secured by the association of a generic
                    image with a name. So far the material of thought is always general,—is freed,
                    that is, from the local and temporal and other defining marks of percepts.</p>
                <p>The process of thinking itself is psychologically much better described as (1) an
                    analysis and (2) a re-synthesis of <pb break="no"

                    trains. The logical resolution of thought into hierarchies of concepts arranged
                    like Porphyry’s tree, into judgments uniting such concepts by means of a logical
                    copula, &lt;fcc , is the outcome of later reflexion—mainly for technical
                    purposes— upon thought as a completed product, and entirely presupposes all that
                    psychology has to explain. The logical theory of the formation of concepts by
                    generalization (or abstraction) and by determination (or concretion)— <hi
                    rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> by the removal or addition of defining marks—assumes
                    the previous existence of the very things to be formed, for these marks or
                    attributes—X’s and .Y⅛, A’s and B’s— are themselves already concepts. Moreover,
                    the act of generalizing or determining is really an act of judgment, so that the
                    logician’s account of conception presupposes judgment, while at the same time
                    his account of judgment presupposes conception. But this is no evil; for logic
                    does not essay to exhibit the actual genesis of thought but only an ideal for
                    future thinking. Psychologically—that is to say, chronologically—the judgment is
                    first. The growing mind, we may suppose, passes beyond simple perception when
                    some striking difference in what is at the moment perceived is the occasion of a
                    conflict of presentations (comp. p. 62). The stalking hunter is not instantly
                    recognized as the destroying biped, because he crawls on all fours; or the
                    scarecrow looks like him, and yet not like him <hi rend="italic">; for,</hi>
                    though it stands on two legs, it never moves. There is no immediate
                    assimilation: percept and idea remain distinct till, on being severally attended
                    to and compared, what is there is known in spite of the differences. Recognition
                    under such circumstances is in itself a judgment; but of more account is the
                    further judgment involved in it or accompanying it—that which connects the new
                    fact with the old idea. Though actually complex, as the result of a combination
                    of impressions, generic images are not necessarily known as complexes when they
                    first enter into judgments; as the subjects of such judgments they are but
                    starting-points for predication,—It crawls; It does not move; and the like. Such
                    impersonal judgments, according to most philologists, are in fact the earliest;
                    and we may reasonably suppose that by means of them our generic images have been
                    partially analysed, and have attained to something of the distinctness and
                    constancy of logical concepts. But the analysis is rarely complete: a certain
                    confused and fluctuating residuum remains behind. The psychological concept
                    merges at sundry points into those cognate with it,—in other words, the
                    continuity of the underlying memory-train still operates; only the ideal
                    concepts of logic are in all respects <hi rend="italic">totus,</hi><hi

                    on all sides, and, if we could recover the first vestiges of thinking, would be
                    more abundant still.</p>
                <p>But, if we agree that it is through acts of judgment which successively resolve
                    composite presentations into elements that concepts first arise, it is still
                    very necessary to inquire more carefully what these elements are. On the one
                    side we have seen logicians comparing them to so many letters, and on the other
                    psychologists enumerating the several sensible properties of gold or wax—their
                    colour, weight, texture, &amp;c. —as instances of such elements. In this way
                    formal logic and sensationalist psychology have been but blind leaders of the
                    blind. Language, which has enabled thought to advance to the level at which
                    reflexion about thought can begin, is now an obstacle in the way of a thorough
                    analysis of it. A child or savage would speak only of “red” and “hot,” but we of
                    “redness” and “heat.” They would probably say, “Swallows come when the days are
                    lengthening and snipe when they are shortening”; we say, “Swallows are spring
                    and snipe are winter migrants.” Instead of “The sun shines and plants grow,” we
                    should say, “Sunlight is the cause of vegetation.” In short, there is a tendency
                    to resolve all concepts into substantive concepts; and the reason of this is not
                    far to seek. Whether the subject or starting-point of our discursive thinking be
                    actually what we perceive as a thing, or whether it be a quality, an action, an
                    effectuation <hi rend="italic">{i.e..</hi> a transitive action), a concrete
                    spatial or temporal relation, or finally, a resemblance or difference in these
                    or in other respects, it becomes by the very fact of being the central object of
                    thought <hi rend="italic">pro</hi><hi rend="italic">tanto</hi> a unity, and all
                    that can be affirmed concerning it may so far be regarded as its property or
                    attribute. It is, as we have seen, the characteristic of every completed concept
                    to be a fixed and independent whole, as it were, crystallized out of the
                    still-fluent matrix of ideas. Moreover, the earliest objects of thought and the
                    earliest concepts must naturally be those of the things that live and move about
                    us; hence, then—to seek no deeper reason for the present— this natural tendency,
                    which language by providing distinct names powerfully seconds, to reify or
                    personify not only things but every element and relation of things which we can
                    single out, or, in other words, to concrete our abstracts.<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>See Wundt, <hi rend="italic">Logik,</hi> i.

                    kategoriale Verschiebung der Begriffe.”</p></note> It is when things have
                    reached this stage that logic begins. But ordinary, so-called formal, logic,
                    which intends to concern itself not with thinking but only with the most general
                    structure of thought, is debarred from recognizing any difference between
                    concepts that does not affect their relations as terms in a proposition. As a
                    consequence it drifts inevitably into that compartmental logic or logic of
                    extension which knows nothing of categories or predicables, but only of the one
                    relation of whole and part qualitatively considered. It thus pushes this
                    reduction to a common denomination to the utmost: its terms, grammatically
                    regarded, are always names and symbolize classes or compartments of things. From
                    this point of view all disparity among concepts, save that of contradictory
                    exclusion, and all connexion, save that of partial coincidence, are at an
                    end.</p>
                <p>Of a piece with this are the logical formula for a simple judgment, X is Y, and
                    the corresponding definitions of judgment as the comparison of two concepts and
                    the recognition of their agreement or disagreement.<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Comp. Hamilton: “To judge <hi rend="italic"
                    >(κplveιv,</hi><hi rend="italic">judicare)</hi> is to recognize the relation of
                    congruence or of confliction in which two concepts, two individual things, or a
                    concept and an individual, compared together, stand to each other” <hi
                    rend="italic">{Lectures on Logic,</hi> i. p. 225).</p></note> It certainly is
                    possible to represent every judgment as a comparison, although the term is
                    strictly adequate to only one kind and is often a very artificial description of
                    what actually happens. But for a logic mainly concerned with inference— <hi
                    rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> with explicating what is implicated in any given
                    statements concerning classes—there is nothing more to be done but to ascertain
                    agreements or disagreements; and the existence of these, if not necessarily, is
                    at least most evidently represented by spatial relations. Such representation
                    obviously implies a single ground of comparison only and therefore leaves no
                    room for differences of category. The resolution of all concepts into class
                    concepts and that of all judgments into comparisons thus go together. On this
                    view if a concept is complex it can only be so as a class combination; and, if
                    the mode of its synthesis could be taken account of at all, this could only be
                    by treating it as an element in the combination like the rest :—iron is a
                    substance, &amp;c., virtue a quality, &amp;c., distance a relation, &amp;c., and
                    so on. There is much of directly psychological interest in this thoroughgoing
                    reduction of thought to a form which makes its consistency and logical
                    concatenation conspicuously evident. But of the so-called matter of thought it
                    tells us nothing. And, as said, there are many forms in that matter of at least
                    equal moment, both for psychology and for epistemology; these formal logic has
                    tended to keep out of sight.</p>
                <p>It has generally been under the bias of such a formal or computational logic that
                    psychologists, and especially English psychologists, have entered upon the study
                    of mind. They have brought with them an analytic scheme which affords a ready
                    place for sensations or “simple ideas” as the elements of thought, but none for
                    any differences in the combinations of these elements. Sensations being in their
                    very nature concrete, all generality becomes an affair of names; and, as Sigwart
                    has acutely remarked, sensationalism and nominalism always go together. History
                    would have borne him out if he had added that a purely formal logic tends in
                    like manner to be nominalistic (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Logic,</hi> vol. xiv.
                    p. 791).</p>
                <p>If we are still to speak of the elements of thought, we must extend this term so
                    as to include not only the sensory elements we are said to receive but three
                    distinct ways in which this pure matter is combined :—(1) the forms of
                    intuition,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>As to these
                    it must suffice to refer to what has been already said; comp. pp. 53 and 64 <hi

                    Substance, Attribute, State, Act, Effect, End or Purpose, &amp;c.—the exact
                    determination of which is not here in place; and (3) certain formal (logical and
                    mathematical) categories, —as Unity, Difference, Identity, Likeness. These can
                    no more be obtained by such a process of abstraction and generalization as
                    logicians and psychologists alike have been wont to describe than the melody
                    could be obtained <pb break="no"

                    They are not primarily concepts more general than all others in the sense in
                    which animal is more general than man, but rather distinct methods of relating
                    or synthesizing presentations. Kant, though he accepted almost unquestioned the
                    logic and psychology current in his day, has yet been the occasion, in spite of
                    himself, of materially advancing both, and chiefly by the distinction he was led
                    to make between formal and transcendental logic. In his exposition of the latter
                    he brings to light the difference between the “functions of the understanding”
                    in synthesizing—or, as we might say, organizing—percepts into concepts and the
                    merely analytic subsumption of <hi rend="italic">abc</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >abd</hi> under <hi rend="italic">ab,</hi><hi rend="italic">—a, b, c,</hi> and
                    <hi rend="italic">d</hi> being what they may. Unlike other concepts, categories
                    as such do not in the first instance signify objects of thought however general,
                    but these functions of the understanding in constituting objects. In fine, they
                    all imply some special process, and into these processes it is the business of
                    psychology to inquire. But only the briefest attempt at such inquiry is here
                    possible.</p>
                <p>To begin with what are <hi rend="italic">par excellence</hi> formal categories,
                    and among these with that which is the most fundamental and formal of all—How do
                    we come by the conception of unity <hi rend="italic">Ί</hi> “Amongst all the
                    ideas we have,” says Locke, “as there is none suggested to the mind by more
                    ways, so there is none more simple than that of unity, or one. It has no shadow
                    of variety or composition in it; every object our senses are employed about,
                    every idea in our understandings, every thought of our minds, brings this idea
                    along with it.”<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi
                    rend="italic">Essay concerning Human Understanding,</hi> II. xvi. §
                    1.</p></note> And the like with painful iteration has been said by almost all
                    English psychologists since. Such consensus notwithstanding, to assign a
                    sensible origin to unity is certainly a mistake,—one of a class of mistakes
                    already more than once referred to, which consist in transferring to the data of
                    sense all that is implied in the language necessarily used in speaking of them.
                    The <hi rend="italic">term</hi> “a sensation” no doubt carries along with it the
                    idea of unity, but the bare sensation as received brings along with it nothing
                    but itself. And, if we consider sensory consciousness merely, we do not receive
                    a sensation, and then another sensation, and so on <hi rend="italic"
                    >seriatim</hi>; but we have always a continuous diversity of sensations even
                    when these are qualitatively sharply differentiated. Moreover, if unity were an
                    impression of sense and passively received, it would, in common with other
                    impressions, be unamenable to change. We cannot see red as blue, but we can
                    resolve many (parts) into one (whole), and <hi rend="italic">vice
                    versa.</hi><note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>“Wir können

                    rend="italic">Logik,</hi> ii. p. 41).</p></note> Unity, then, is the result of
                    an act the occasions for which, no doubt, are at first non-voluntarily
                    determined; but the act is still as distinct from them as is attention from the
                    objects attended to. It is to that movement of attention already described in
                    dealing with ideation (p. 61) that we must look as the source of this category.
                    This same movement, in like manner, yields us temporal signs; and the complex
                    unity formed by a combination of these is what we call number. When there is
                    little or no difference between the field and the focus of attention, unifying
                    is an impossibility, whatever the impressions received may be. On the other
                    hand, as voluntary acts of concentration become more frequent and distinct the
                    variegated continuum of sense is shaped into intuitions of definite things and
                    events. Also, as soon as words facilitate the control of ideas, it becomes
                    possible to single out special aspects and relations of things as the subjects
                    or starting-points of our discursive thinking. Thus the forms of unity are
                    manifold: every act of intuition or thought, whatever else it is, is an act of
                    unifying.</p>
                <p>It is obvious that the whole field of consciousness at any moment can never be
                    actually embraced as one. What is unified becomes thereby the focus of
                    consciousness and so leaves an outlying field; so far unity may be held to imply
                    plurality. But it cannot with propriety be said that in a simple act of
                    attention the field of consciousness is analysed into two distinct parts, <hi
                    rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> two unities,— <hi rend="italic">this</hi> (now attended
                    to) and <hi rend="italic">the other</hi> or the rest (abstracted from). For the
                    not-this is but the rest of a continuum and not itself a whole; it is left out
                    but not determined, as the bounding space is left out when a figure is drawn. To
                    know two unities we must connect both together; and herein comes to light the
                    difference between the unity which is the form of the concept or subject of
                    discourse and the unity of a judgment. The latter is of necessity complex; the
                    former may or may not be. But in any case the complexity of the two is
                    different. If the subject of thought is not only clear but distinct— <hi
                    rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> not merely defined as a whole but having its
                    constituents likewise more or less defined—such distinctness is due to previous
                    judgments. At any future time these may of course be repeated; such are the
                    analytical or explicative judgments of logic. As the mere subject of discourse
                    it is, however, a single unity simultaneously apprehended · the relation
                    ascertained between it and its predicate constitutes the unity of judgment, a
                    unity which is comprehended only when its parts are successively
                    apprehended.</p>
                <p>But, though a judgment is always a complex unity, the 1 extent of this complexity
                    seems at first sight to vary as ’ the form of synthesis varies. Formal logic, as
                    we have <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi> seen, by throwing the form of synthesis
                    into the predicate <hi rend="superscript"> i</hi> has no difficulty in reducing
                    every judgment to an S is P. But, if we at all regard the matter thought, it is
                    certain, for example, that “It is an explosion” is less complex than “The enemy
                    explodes the mine.” The first answers one question; the second answers three.
                    But as regards the more complex judgment both the process of ascertaining the
                    fact and the language in which it is expressed show that the three elements
                    concerned in it are not synthesized at once. Suppose we start from the
                    explosion,—and changes or movements are not only apt to attract attention first,
                    but, when recognized as events and not as abstracts personified, they call for
                    some supplementing beyond themselves—then in this case we may search for the
                    agent at work or for the object affected, but not for both at once. Moreover, if
                    we find either, a complete judgment at once ensues: “The enemy explodes,” or
                    “The mine is exploded.” The original judgment is really due to a synthesis of
                    these two. But, when the results of former judgments are in this manner taken up
                    into a new judgment, a certain “condensation of thought” ensues. Of this
                    condensation the grammatical structure of language is evidence, though logical
                    manipulation—with great pains—obliterates it. Thus our more complex judgment
                    would take the form— “The enemy is now mine - exploding” or “The mine is
                    enemy-exploded,” according as one or other of the simpler judgments was made
                    first. An examination of other cases would in like manner tend to show that
                    intellectual synthesis is always—in itself and apart from implications—a binary
                    synthesis. Wundt, to whom belongs the merit of first explicitly stating this
                    “law of dichotomy or duality”<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>Wundt, <hi rend="italic">Logik: eine Untersuchung der

                    as the cardinal principle of discursive thinking, contrasts it with synthesis by
                    mere association. This, as running on continuously, he represents thus—A <hi
                    rend="superscript"> -</hi> B^C <hi rend="superscript"> -</hi> D~ . . .: the <pb

                    symbolizes by forms such as the following :—</p>
                <table>
                    <row cols="1" role="data" rows="1">
                        <cell cols="1" role="data" rows="1"><p>AB AB CD AB C¾j⅛ &amp;c.</p></cell>
                    </row>
                </table>
                <p>In explanation of this law as a law oi intellection it is hardly sufficient to
                    rest it ultimately on the fact “that in a given moment of time only a single act
                    of apperception is possible.”<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>Wundt, <hi rend="italic">op. cit.,</hi> i. p. 58.</p></note>
                    This applies to all syntheses alike. . The point surely is that the one thing
                    attended to in an intellective act is the synthesis of two things, and of two
                    things only, because, as only one movement of attention is possible at a time,
                    only two things at a time can be synthesized. In that merely associative
                    synthesis by which the memorycontinuum is produced attention moves from A to B
                    and thence to C without any relation between A and B being attended to at all,
                    although they must have relations, that of sequence, <hi rend="italic"
                    >e.g.,</hi> at least. The intellective synthesis which follows upon this first
                    resolves the A <hi rend="superscript"> -</hi> B into its elements, and then, if
                    there be any ground for so doing, re-synthesizes them with a consciousness of
                    what the synthesis means.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"
                    ><p>It need not, of course, be maintained that in every act of thought, no
                    matter how abstract, the ideas related have been previously connected by
                    association. But certainly at the outset this is the case, in such wise that all
                    the forms of intellectual synthesis are prefigured in the connexions of the
                    ideational train or its reduplications.</p></note></p>
                <p>Passing now to the remaining formal categories—Difference, Likeness, Identity—all
                    of which come under the law of duality so far as they imply not a single
                    presentation but some relation between two presentations, we have to seek out
                    the characteristics of the states of mind in which these relations become
                    objects of consciousness. The so-called <hi rend="italic">fundamentum
                    relationis,</hi> of course, can be nothing but the two presentations concerned.
                    Just as certain, however, is it that the relation itself involves something more
                    than these. Two equal triangles may be made to coincide, but are not necessarily
                    coincident: Dromio of Ephesus might be mistaken for Dromio of Syracuse, but at
                    least they never mistook each other. And this brings us to the point. As Lotze
                    puts it, “Two impressions <hi rend="italic">a</hi> and <hi rend="italic">b</hi>
                    are never to be regarded as more than <hi rend="italic">stimuli</hi> which, by
                    affecting the conscious subject—in its very nature individual and <hi
                    rend="italic">sui generis—</hi> incite to reaction that <hi rend="italic"
                    >activity</hi> by means of which there arise the new presentations, such as
                    similarity, equality, contrast, &amp;c.”<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p><hi rend="italic">Grundzüge der</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Psychologie,</hi> p. 24.</p></note> The activity thus stimulated is what in
                    other words we call the voluntary concentration of attention; to ascertain,
                    then, what these “new presentations” of difference, likeness, and so forth are,
                    we must analyse carefully what takes place when two impressions <hi
                    rend="italic">a</hi> and <hi rend="italic">b</hi> are expressly compared.</p>
                <p>“Difference,” says Hume, “I consider rather as a negation of relation than as
                    anything real or positive. Difference is of two kinds, as opposed either to
                    identity [unity?] or resemblance. The first is called a difference of <hi
                    rend="italic">number,</hi> the other of <hi rend="italic">kind.”</hi> The truth
                    seems rather to be that difference in the sense of numerical difference is so
                    far an element in all relations as all imply distinct correlatives. To this
                    extent even identity—or at least the recognition of it—rests on difference, that
                    form of difference, viz., which is essential to plurality. But absolute
                    difference of kind may be considered tantamount not, indeed, to the negation,
                    but at least to the absence, of all formal relation. That this absolute
                    difference—or disparateness, as we may call it—affords no ground for relations
                    becomes evident when we consider (1) that, if we had only a plurality of
                    absolutely different presentations, we should have no consciousness at all
                    (comp. p. 45); and (2) that we never compare—although we distinguish, <hi
                    rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> recognize, numerical difference—where presentations
                    seem absolutely or totally different, as are, <hi rend="italic">e.g.,</hi> a
                    thunderclap and the taste of sugar, or the notion of free trade and that of the
                    Greek accusative. All actual comparison of what is qualitatively different rests
                    upon opposition or contrariety, <hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> upon at least
                    partial likeness (comp. p. 46). This being understood, it is noteworthy that the
                    recognition of such unlikeness is, if anything, more “real or positive” than
                    that of likeness, and is certainly the simpler of the two. In the comparison of
                    sensible impressions—as of two colours, two sounds, the lengths or the
                    directions of two lines, &amp;c.—we find it easier in some cases to have the two
                    impressions that are compared presented together, in others to have first one
                    presented and then the other. But either way the essential matter is to secure
                    the most effective presentation of their difference, which in every case is
                    something positive and, like any other impression, may vary in amount from bare
                    perceptibility to the extremest distance that the continuum to which it belongs
                    will admit. Where no difference or distance at all is perceptible, there we say
                    there is likeness or equality. Is the only outcome, then, that when we pass from
                    <hi rend="italic">ab</hi> to <hi rend="italic">ac</hi> there is a change in
                    consciousness, and that when <hi rend="italic">ab</hi> persists there is none?
                    To say this is to take no account of the operations (we may symbolize them as
                    <hi rend="italic">ac -</hi><hi rend="italic">ab</hi><hi rend="italic">=
                    cb,</hi><hi rend="italic">ab - ab</hi><hi rend="italic">=</hi> 0) by which the
                    difference or the equality results. The change of presentation (δc) and absence
                    of change (0) are not here what they are when merely passive occurrences, so to
                    put it. This is evident from the fact that the former is but a single
                    presentation and the latter no presentation at all. The relation of unlikeness,
                    then, is distinguished from the mere “position” of change by (1) the voluntary
                    concentration of attention upon <hi rend="italic">ab</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >ac</hi> with a view to the detection of this change as <hi rend="italic"
                    >their</hi> difference, and by (2) the act, relating them through it, in that
                    they are judged unlike to that extent. The type of comparison is such
                    superposition of geometrical lines or figures (as, <hi rend="italic">e.g.,</hi>
                    in Euclid I. iv.): if they coincide we have concrete equality; if they do not
                    their difference is a line or figure. All sensible comparisons conform
                    essentially to this type. In comparing two shades we place them side by side,
                    and passing from one to the other seek to determine not the absolute shade of
                    the second but its shade relative to the first,—in other words, we look out for
                    contrast. We do not say of one “It is dark,” for in the scale of shades it may
                    be light, but “It is darker or <hi rend="italic">vice versa.</hi> Where there is
                    no distance or contrast we simply have not <hi rend="italic">two</hi>
                    impressions, and, as said—if we consider the difference by itself—no impression
                    at all. Two coincident triangles must be perceived as one. The distinction
                    between the one triangle thus formed by two coinciding and the single triangle
                    rests upon something extraneous to this bare presentation of a triangle that is
                    one and the same in both cases. The marks of this numerical distinctness may be
                    various: they may be different temporal signs, as in reduplications of the
                    memory-continuum; or they may be constituents peculiar to each, from which
                    attention is for the moment abstracted, any one of which suffices to give the
                    common or identical constituent a new setting. In general, it may be said (1)
                    that the numerical distinctness of the related terms is secured in the absence
                    of all qualitative difference solely by the intellectual act which has so
                    unified each as to retain what may serve as an individual mark; and (2) that
                    they become related as “like” either in virtue of the active adjustment to a
                    change of impression which their partial assimilation defeats, or in virtue of
                    an anticipated continuance of the impression which this assimilation
                    confirms.</p>
                <p>It is in keeping with this analysis that we say in common speech that two things
                    in any respect similar are so far the same: that, <hi rend="italic">e.a.,</hi>
                    the two Dromios—</p>

                <p>“The one so like the other</p>

                    same stature just as we say they had the same mother. This ambiguity in the word
                    “same,” whereby it means either individual identity or indistinguishable
                    resemblance, has been often noticed, and from a logical or objective point of
                    view justly complained of as “engendering fallacies in otherwise enlightened
                    understandings.” But apparently no one has inquired into its psychological
                    basis, although more than one writer has admitted that the ambiguity is one “in
                    itself not always to be avoided.”<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    of common names and to cite the forgotten controversies of scholastic realism.
                    We are not now concerned with the conformity of thought to things or with
                    logical analysis, but with the analysis of a psychological process. The tendency
                    to treat presentations as if they were copies of things—the objective bias, as
                    we may call it—is the one grand obstacle to psychological observation. Some only
                    realize with an effort that the idea of extension is not extended; no wonder,
                    then, if it should seem “unnatural” to maintain that the idea of two like things
                    does not consist of two like ideas. But, assuming that both meanings of identity
                    have a psychological justification, it will be well to distinguish them and to
                    examine their connexion. Perhaps we might term the one “material identity” and
                    the other “individual identity,”— following the analogy of expressions such as
                    “different things but all made of the same stuff,” “the same person but entirely
                    changed.” Thus there is unity and plurality concerned in both, and herein
                    identity or sameness differs from singularity or mere oneness, which entails no
                    relation. But the unity and the plurality are different in each, and each is in
                    some sort the converse of the other. In the one, two different individuals
                    partially coincide; in the other, one individual is partially different; the
                    unity in the one case is an individual presentation, in the other is the
                    presentation of an individual.</p>
                <p>In material identity the unity is that of a single presentation, whether simple
                    or complex, which enters as a common constituent into two or more others. It may
                    be possible of course to individualize it, but as it emerges in a comparison it
                    is a single presentation and nothing more. On account of this absence of
                    individual marks this single presentation is what logicians call “abstract”; but
                    this is not psychologically essential. It may be a generic image which has
                    resulted from the neutralization of individual marks, but it may equally well be
                    a simple presentation, like red, to which such marks never belonged. We come
                    here from a new side upon a truth which has been already expounded at length,
                    viz., that presentations are not given to us as individuals but as changes in a
                    continuum. Time and space—the instruments, as it were, of individualization,
                    which are presupposed in the objective sciences—are psychologically later than
                    this mere differentiation.</p>
                <p>The many vexed questions that arise concerning individual identity are
                    metaphysical rather than psychological. But it will serve to bring out the
                    difference between the two forms of identity to note that an identification
                    cannot be established solely by qualitative comparison; an <hi rend="italic"
                    >alibi</hi> or a breach of temporal continuity will turn the flank of the
                    strongest argument from resemblance. Moreover, resemblance itself may be fatal
                    to identification when the law of being is change. But, while temporal and
                    spatial determinations are essential to individual identity, they have, strictly
                    speaking, no individual identity of their own. When we speak of two impressions
                    occurring at the same time, or localize or project them into the same place, a
                    careful analysis shows only that we detect no difference of-temporal and local
                    signs respectively,—in other words, have only special cases of comparison.</p>
                <p>As regards the real categories, it may be said generally that these owe their
                    origin in large measure to the anthropomorphic or mythical tendency of human
                    thought,— <hi rend="smallcaps">to</hi><hi rend="italic">ofj.oi.ov</hi> τω ό/ζοίφ
                    <hi rend="italic">γιvdxrκeσθaι.</hi> Into the formation of these conceptions two
                    very distinct factors enter—(1) the facts of what in the stricter sense we call
                    “self-consciousness,” and (2) certain spatial and temporal relations among our
                    presentations themselves. On the one hand, it has to be noted that these spatial
                    and temporal relations are but the occasion or motive—and ultimately perhaps, we
                    may say, the warrant—for the analogical attribution to things of selfness,
                    efficiency, and design, but are not directly the source of the forms of thought
                    that thus arise. On the other hand, it is to be noted also that such forms,
                    although they have an independent source, would never apart from suitable
                    material come into actual existence. If the followers of Hume err in their
                    exclusive reliance upon “associations naturally and even necessarily generated
                    by the order of our sensations” (J. S. Mill), the disciple of Kant errs also who
                    relies exclusively on “the synthetic unity of apperception.” The truth is that
                    we are on the verge of error in thus sharply distinguishing the two at all; if
                    we do so momentarily for the purpose of exposition it behoves us here again to
                    remember that mind grows and is not made. The use of terms like “innate,” “a
                    priori,” “necessary,” “formal,” &amp;c., without further qualification leads
                    only too easily to the mistaken notion that all the mental facts so named are
                    alike underived and original, independent not only of experience but of each
                    other; whereas but for the forms of intuition the forms of thought would be
                    impossible,—that is to say, we should never have a self-consciousness at all if
                    we had not previously learnt to distinguish occupied and unoccupied space, past
                    and present in time, and the like. But, again, it is equally true that, if we
                    could not feel and move as well as receive impressions, and if experience did
                    not repeat itself, we should never attain even to this level of spatial and
                    temporal intuition. Kant shows a very lame and halting recognition of this
                    dependence of the higher forms on the lower both in his schematism of the
                    categories, and again in correcting in his Analytic the opposition of sense and
                    understanding as respectively receptive and active with which he set out in his
                    Aesthetic. Still, although what are called the subjective and objective factors
                    of real knowledge advance together, the former is in a sense always a step
                    ahead. We find <hi rend="italic">again</hi> without us the permanence,
                    individuality, efficiency, and adaptation we have found <hi rend="italic">first
                    of all</hi> within (comp. p. 56, <hi rend="italic">b</hi> and &lt;Z). But such
                    primitive imputation of personality, though it facilitates a first
                    understanding, soon proves itself faulty and begets the contradictions which
                    have been one chief motive to philosophy. We smile at the savage who thinks a
                    magnet must need food and is puzzled that the horses in a picture remain for
                    ever still; but few consider that underlying all common-sense thinking there
                    lurks the same natural precipitancy. We attribute to extended things a unity
                    which we know only as the unity of an unextended subject; we attribute to
                    changes among these extended things what we know only when we act and suffer
                    ourselves; and we attribute further both to them and their changes a striving
                    for ends which we know only because we feel. In asking what they are, how they
                    act, and why they are thus and thus, we assimilate them to ourselves, in spite
                    of the differences which lead us by and by to see a gulf between mind and
                    matter. Such instinctive analogies have, like other analogies, to be confirmed,
                    refuted, or modified by further knowledge, <hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi><pb
                    break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit20newyrich/page/n95/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0920-0095-0082"/> by the very insight into things which these
                    analogies have themselves made possible. That in their first form they were
                    mythical, and that they could never have been at all unless originated in this
                    way, are considerations that make no difference to their validity,—assuming,
                    that is, that they admit, now or hereafter, of a logical transformation which
                    renders them objectively valid. This legitimation is of course the business of
                    philosophy; we are concerned only with the psychological analysis and origin of
                    the conceptions themselves.</p>
                <p>As it must here suffice to examine one of these categories, let us take that
                    which is the most important and central of the three, viz., causality or the
                    relation of cause and effect, as that will necessarily throw some light upon the
                    constitution of the others. To begin, we must distinguish three things, which,
                    though very different, are very liable to be confused. (1) Perceiving in a
                    definite case, <hi rend="italic">e.g.,</hi> that on the sun shining a stone
                    becomes warm, we may say the sun makes the stone warm. This is a concrete
                    instance of predicating the causal relation. In this there is, explicitly at all
                    events, no statement of a general law or axiom, such as we have when we say (2)
                    “Every event must have a cause,”—a statement commonly known as the principle of
                    causality. This again is distinct from what is on all hands allowed to be an
                    empirical generalization, viz., (3) that such and such particular causes have
                    invariably such and such particular effects. With these last psychology is not
                    directly concerned at all: it has only to analyse and trace to its origin the
                    bare conception of causation as expressed in (1) and involved in both these
                    generalizations. Whether only some things have causes, as the notion of chance
                    implies, whether all causes are uniform in their action or some capricious and
                    arbitrary, as the unreflecting suppose,—all this is beside the question for
                    us.</p>
                <p>One point in the analysis of the causal relation Hume may be said to have settled
                    once for all: it does not rest upon or contain any immediate intuition of a
                    causal nexus. The two relations that Hume allowed to be perceived (or “presumed
                    to exist”), viz., contiguity in space of the objects causally related and
                    priority in time of the cause before the effect, are the only relations directly
                    discernible. We say indeed “The sun warms the stone” as readily as we say “The
                    sun rises and sets,” as if both were matters of direct observation then and
                    there. But that this is not so ⅛ evident from the fact that only in some cases
                    when one change follows upon another do we regard it as following from the
                    other: casual coincidence is at least as common as causal connexion. Whence the
                    difference, then, if not from perception? Hume’s answer,<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi rend="italic">Treatise of Human
                    Nature,</hi> pt. iii., § xiv., “Of the idea of necessary connexion.”</p></note>
                    repeated in the main by English psychologists since, is, as all the world knows,
                    that the difference is the result of association, that when a change <hi
                    rend="italic">β</hi> in an object B has been frequently observed to succeed a
                    change <hi rend="italic">a</hi> in another object A, the frequent repetition <hi
                    rend="italic">determines</hi> the mind to a transition from the one to the
                    other. It is this determination, which could not be present at first, that
                    constitutes “the third relation betwixt these objects.” This “internal
                    impression” generated by association is then projected; “for’tis a common
                    observation that the mind has a great propensity to spread itself on external
                    objects.”</p>
                <p>The subjective origin and the after-projection we must admit, but all else in
                    Hume’s famous doctrine seems glaringly at variance with facts. In one respect it
                    proves too much, for all constant sequences are not regarded as causal, as
                    according to his analysis they ought to be; again, in another respect it proves
                    too little, for causal connexion is continually predicated on a first
                    occurrence. The natural man has always distinguished between causes and signs or
                    portents; but there is nothing to show that he produced an effect many times
                    before regarding himself as the cause of it. J. S. Mill has indeed obviated the
                    first objection epistemologically by adding to constant conjunction the further
                    characteristic of “unconditionality.” But this is a conception that cannot be
                    psychologically explained from Hume’s premisses, unless perhaps by resolving it
                    into the qualification that the invariability must be complete and not partial,
                    whereupon the second objection applies. “Unconditional” is a word for which we
                    can find no meaning as long as we confine our attention to temporal succession.
                    It will not do to say both that an invariable succession generates the idea, and
                    that such invariable succession must be not only invariable but also
                    unconditional in order to generate it. We may here turn the master against the
                    disciple: “the same principle,” says Hume, “cannot be both the cause and the
                    effect of another, and this is perhaps the only proposition concerning that
                    relation which is either intuitively or demonstratively certain” <hi
                    rend="italic">(op. cit.,</hi> p. 391). Unconditionality is then part of the
                    causal relation and yet not the product of invariable repetition.</p>
                <p>Perhaps the source of this element in the relation will become clear if we
                    examine more closely the internal impression of the mind which according to Hume
                    constitutes the whole of our idea of power or efficacy. To illustrate the nature
                    of this impression Hume cites the instant passage of the imagination to a
                    particular idea on hearing the word commonly annexed to it, when “’twill scarce
                    be possible for the mind by its utmost efforts to prevent that transition” <hi
                    rend="italic">(op. cit.,</hi> p. 393). It is this determination, then, which is
                    felt internally, not perceived externally, that we mistakenly transfer to
                    objects and regard as an intelligible connexion between them. But, if Hume
                    admits this, must he not admit more? Can it be pretended that it is through the
                    workings of association among our ideas that we first feel a determination which
                    our utmost efforts can scarce resist, or that we feel such determination under
                    no other circumstances? If it be allowed that the natural man is irresistibly
                    determined to imagine an apple when he hears its name or to expect thunder when
                    he sees lightning, must it not also be allowed that he is irresistibly
                    determined much earlier and in a much more impressive way when overmastered by
                    the elements or by his enemies? But further, such instances bring to light what
                    Hume’s “determination” also implies, viz., its necessary correlative, effort or
                    action. Even irresistible association can' only be known as such by efforts to
                    resist it. Hume allows this when he says that his principles of association “are
                    not infallible causes; for one may fix his attention during some time on any one
                    object without looking farther” <hi rend="italic">(op. cit.,</hi> p. 393). But
                    the fact is, we know both what it is to act and what it is to suffer, to go
                    where we would and to be carried where we would not, quite apart from the
                    workings of association. And, had Hume not confused the two different inquiries,
                    that concerning the origin of the idea of causation and that concerning the
                    ground of causal inference or law of causation, it could never have occurred to
                    him to offer such an analysis of the former as he does.</p>
                <p>Keeping to the former and simpler question, it would seem that when in ordinary
                    thinking we say A causes this or that in B we project or analogically attribute
                    to A what we experience in acting, and to B what we experience in being acted
                    on; and the structure of language shows that such projection was made long
                    before it was suspected that what A once did and B once suffered must happen in
                    like manner again. The occasions suitable for this projection are determined by
                    the temporal and spatial relations of the objects concerned, which relations are
                    matter of intuition. These are of no very special interest from a psychological
                    point of view, but the subjective elements we shall do well to consider further.
                    First of all, we must note the distinction of immanent action and transitive
                    action; the former is what we call action simply, and implies only a single
                    thing, the agent; the latter, which we might with advantage call effectuation,
                    implies two things, <hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> a patient distinct from the
                    agent. In scientific language the agent in an intransitive act is called a <hi
                    rend="italic">cazιsa</hi><hi rend="italic">immanens</hi> and so distinguished
                    from the agent in effectuation or <hi rend="italic">causa</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >transiens.</hi> Common thought, however, does not regard mere action as caused
                    at all; and we shall find it, in fact, impossible to resolve action into
                    effectuation. But, since the things with which we ordinarily deal are complex,
                    have many parts, properties, members, phases, and in consequence of the analytic
                    procedure of thought, there ensues, indeed, a continual shifting of the point of
                    view from which we regard any given thing, so that what is in one aspect one
                    thing, is in another many (comp. p. 56 c). So it comes about that, when
                    regarding himself as one, the natural man speaks of himself as walking,
                    shouting, &amp;c.; but, when distinguishing between himself and his members, he
                    speaks of raising his voice, moving his legs, and so forth. Thus no sooner do we
                    resolve any given action into an effectuation, by analytically distinguishing
                    within the original agent an agent and a patient, than a new action appears.
                    Action is thus a simpler notion than causation and inexplicable by means of it.
                    It is certainly no easy problem in philosophy to determine where the resolution
                    of the complex is to cease, at what point we must stop, because in the presence
                    of an individual thing and a simple activity. At any rate, we reach such a point
                    psychologically in the conscious subject, and that energy in consciousness we
                    call attention. If this be allowed, Hume’s critique of the notion of efficacy is
                    really wide of the mark. “Some,”<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>Hume here has Locke and Berkeley specially in view. Locke as
                    a patient and acute inquirer was incomparably better as a psychologist than a
                    man addicted to literary foppery like Hume, for all his genius, could possibly
                    be. On the particular question, see Locke, ii. 21, 3-5.</p></note> he says,

                    consider’d as a cause, has no more a discoverable connexion with its effects
                    than any material cause has with its proper effect. . . . The effect is there
                    [too] distinguishable and separable from the cause, and cou’d not be foreseen
                    without the experience of their constant conjunction” <hi rend="italic">(op.
                    cit,,p.</hi> 455). This is logical analysis, not psychological; the point is
                    that the will is not considered as a cause and distinguished from its effects,
                    nor in fact considered at <pb break="no"

                    separable impressions; for we cannot really make the indefinite regress that
                    such logical distinctions as that between the conscious subject and its acts
                    implies. Moreover, our activity as such is not directly presented at all: we <hi
                    rend="italic">are,</hi> being active; and further than this psychological
                    analysis will not go. There are, as we have seen, two ways in which this
                    activity is manifested, the receptive or passive and the motor or active in the
                    stricter sense—(comp. p. 44) and our experience of these we project in
                    predicating the causal relation. But two halves do not make a whole; so we have
                    no complete experience of effectuation, for the simple reason that we cannot be
                    two things at once. We are guided in piecing it together by the temporal and
                    spatial relations of the things concerned. Hence, perhaps, some of the
                    antinomies that beset this conception. In its earliest form, then, the so-called
                    necessary connexion of cause and effect is perhaps nothing more than that of
                    physical constraint. To this, no doubt, is added the strength of expectation—as
                    Hume supposed—when the same effect has been found invariably to follow the same
                    cause. Finally, when upon a basis of associated uniformities of sequence a
                    definite intellectual elaboration of such material ensues, the logical necessity
                    of reason and consequent finds a place, and so far as deduction is applicable
                    cause and reason become interchangeable ideas.<note anchored="true"

                <p>The mention of logical necessity brings up a topic already incidentally noticed,
                    viz., the objectivity of thought and cognition generally (comp. pp. 55,77). The
                    psychological treatment of this topic is tantamount to an inquiry into the
                    characteristics of the states of mind we call certainty, doubt, belief—all of
                    which centre round the one fact of <hi rend="italic">evidence.</hi> Between the
                    certainty that a proposition is true and the certainty that it is not there may
                    intervene continuous grades of uncertainty. We may know that A is sometimes B,
                    or sometimes not; or that some at least of the conditions of B are present or
                    absent <hi rend="italic">; or</hi> the presentation of A may be too confused for
                    distinct analysis. This is the region of probability, possibility, more or less
                    obscurity. Leaving this aside, it will be enough to notice those cases in which
                    certainty may be complete. With that certainty which is absolutely objective,
                    <hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> with knowledge, psychology has no direct concern;
                    it is for logic to furnish the criteria by which knowledge is ascertained.</p>
                <p>Emotion and desire are frequent indirect <hi rend="italic">causes</hi> of
                    subjective certainty, in so far as they determine the constituents and the
                    grouping of the field of consciousness at the moment—“pack the jury” or “suborn
                    the witnesses,” as it were. But the <hi rend="italic">ground</hi> of certainty
                    is in all cases some quality or some relation of these presentations <hi
                    rend="italic">inter se.</hi> In a sense, therefore, the ground of all certainty
                    is objective—in the sense, that is, of being something at least directly and
                    immediately determined for the subject and not by it. But, though objective,
                    this ground is not itself—at least is not ultimately —an object or presentation.
                    Where certainty is mediate, one judgment is often spoken of as the ground of
                    another; but a syllogism is still psychologically a single, though not a simple,
                    judgment, and the certainty of it as a whole is immediate. Between the judgment
                    A is B and the question Is A B? the difference is not one of content nor
                    scarcely one of form: it is a difference which depends upon the effect of the
                    proposition on the subject judging, (i.) We have this effect before us most
                    clearly if we consider what is by common consent regarded as the type of
                    certainty and evidence, the certainty of present sense-impressions whence it is
                    said, “Seeing is believing.” The evident is here the actual, and the ‘ ‘ feeling
                    or consciousness” of certainty is in this case nothing but the sense of being
                    taken fast hold of and forced to apprehend what is there, (ii. ) The like is
                    true of memory and expectation: in these also there is a sense of being tied
                    down to what is given, whereas in mere imagination, however lively, this
                    non-voluntary determination is absent (comp, p. 63). Hume saw this at times
                    clearly enough, as, <hi rend="italic">e.g.,</hi> when he says, “An idea assented
                    to <hi rend="italic">feels</hi> different from a fictitious idea that the fancy
                    alone presents to us.” But unfortunately he not only made this difference a mere
                    difference of intensity, but spoke of belief itself as “an operation of the
                    mind” or “manner of conception that bestowed on our ideas this additional force
                    or vivacity.”<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi

                    396.</p></note> In short, Hume confounded one of the indirect causes of belief
                    with the ground of it, and again, in describing this ground committed the <hi
                    rend="italic">υστeρov πp6τepov</hi> of making the mind determine the ideas
                    instead of the ideas determine the mind, (iii.) In speaking of intellection he
                    is clearer: “The answer is easy with regard to propositions that are prov’d by
                    intuition or demonstration. In that case, the person who assents not only
                    conceives the ideas according to the proposition, but is necessarily determin’d
                    to conceive them in that particular manner” <hi rend="italic">(op. cit.</hi>, p.
                    395). It has been often urged—as by J. S. Mill, for example—that belief is
                    something “ultimate and primordial.” No doubt it is; but so is the distinction
                    between activity and passivity, and it is not here maintained that certainty can
                    be analysed into something simpler, but only that it is identical with what is
                    of the nature of passivity—</p>
                <p>objective determination. As Dr Bain puts it, “The leading fact in belief . . . is
                    our primitive credulity. We begin by believing everything: whatever is is true”
                    <hi rend="italic">(Emotions and Will,</hi> 3d ed., p. 511). But the point is
                    that in this primitive state there is no act answering to “believe” distinct
                    from the non-voluntary attention answering to “perceive,” and no reflexion such
                    as a modal term like “true” implies. With eyes open in the broad day no man
                    says, “lam certain there is light”: he simply sees. He may by and by come
                    absolutely to disbelieve much that he sees— <hi rend="italic">e.g.,</hi> that
                    things are nearer when viewed through a telescope—just as he will come to
                    disbelieve his dreams, though while they last he is certain in these too. The
                    limits of this article forbid any attempt to deal specially with the
                    intellectual aspects of such conflicts of presentations (comp. p. 62) or with
                    their resolution and what is meant by saying that reason turns out superior to
                    sense. The consistency we find it possible to establish among certain of our
                    ideas becomes an ideal, to which we expect to find all our experience conform.
                    Still the intuitive evidence of logical and mathematical axioms is
                    psychologically but a new form of the actual; we are only certain that two and
                    two make four and we are not less certain that we see things nearer through a
                    telescope.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>See <hi

                    the rest of our intellectual furniture; on this account it is at once desirable
                    and difficult to analyse it and ascertain the conditions of its
                    development.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>A large,
                    though certainly diminishing, school of thinkers would entirely demur to such a
                    proposal. “This personality,” says one, “like all other simple and immediate
                    presentations, is indefinable . . . it can be analysed into no simpler elements;
                    for it is revealed to us in all the clearness of an original intuition” (Mansel,
                    <hi rend="italic">Metaphysics,</hi> p. 182). Such an objection arises from that
                    confusion between psychology and epistemology which we have met already several
                    times before (as, <hi rend="italic">e.g.,</hi> in the case of space, p. 53, and
                    of unity, p. 79). The fact is that a conception that is logically “simple and
                    immediate,” in such wise as to be underivable from others, and therefore
                    indefinable, may be—we might almost say will be—psychologically the result of a
                    long process of development; for the more abstract a concept is, <hi
                    rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> the more fundamental in epistemological structure, the
                    more thinking there has been to elaborate it. The most complex integrations of
                    experience are needed to furnish the ideas of its ultimate elements. Such ideas
                    when reached have <hi rend="italic">intellectually</hi> all the clearness of an
                    original intuition, no doubt; but they are not therefore to be confounded with
                    what is psychologically a simple and immediate presentation. It was in this last
                    sense that idealists like Berkeley and Kant denied any presentation of self as
                    much as sceptics like Hume. Self is psychologically a product of thought, not a
                    datum of sense; hence, while Berkeley called it a “notion” and Kant an “idea of
                    the reason,” Hume treated it as a philosophical fiction.</p></note> In
                    attempting this we must carefully distinguish between the bare presentation of
                    self and that reference of other presentations to it which is often called
                    specially self-consciousness, “inner sense,” or internal perception. Concerning
                    all presentations whatever—that of self no less than the rest—it is possible to
                    reflect, “This presentation is mine; it is my object; I am the subject attending
                    to it.” Self, then, is one presentation among others, the result, like them, of
                    the differentiation of the original continuum. But it is obvious that this
                    presentation must be in existence first before other presentations can be
                    related to it. On the other hand, it is only in and by means of such relations
                    that the conception of self is completed. We begin, therefore, with self simply
                    as an object, and end with the conception of that object as the subject or
                    “myself” that knows itself. Self has, in contradistinction from all other
                    presentations, first of all (a) a unique interest and (δ) a certain inwardness;
                    (c) it is an individual that (&lt;Z) persists, (e) is active, and finally (∕)
                    knows itself. These several characteristics of self are intimately involved; so
                    far as they appear at all they advance in definiteness from the lowest level of
                    mere sentience to those moments of highest self-consciousness in which
                    conscience approves or condemns volition.</p>
                <p>The earliest and to the last the most important element in self— what we might
                    perhaps term its root or material element—is that variously styled the organic
                    sensations, vital sense, coenaesthesis, or somatic consciousness. This largely
                    determines the tone of the <pb break="no"

                    suspected, into all our higher feelings. If, as sometimes happens in serious
                    nervous affections, the whole body or any part of it should lose common
                    sensibility, the whole body or that part is at once regarded as strange and even
                    as hostile. In some forms of hypochondria, in λvhich this extreme somatic
                    insensibility and absence of zest leave the intellect and memory unaffected, the
                    individual doubts his own existence or denies it altogether. Ribot cites the
                    case of such a patient who, declaring that he had been dead for two years, thus
                    expressed his perplexity:—“J’existe, mais en dehors de la vie réelle,
                    matérielle, et, malgré moi, rien ne m’ayant donné la mort. Tout est mécanique
                    chez moi et se fait inconsciemment.”<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    not because they accompany physiological functions essential to the efficiency
                    of the organism as an organism, but simply because they are the most immediate
                    and most constant sources of feeling, that these massive but ill-defined organic
                    sensations are from the first the objects of the directest and most unreflecting
                    interest. Other objects have at the outset but a mediate interest through
                    subjective selection in relation to these, and never become so instinctively and
                    inseparably identified with self, never have the same inwardness. This brings us
                    to a new point. As soon as definite perception begins, the body as an extended
                    thing is distinguished from other bodies, and such organic sensations as can be
                    localized at all are localized within it. At the same time the actions of other
                    bodies upon it are accompanied by pleasures and pains, while their action upon
                    each other is not. The body also is the only thing directly set in motion by the
                    reactions of these feelings, the purpose of such movements being to bring near
                    to it the things for which there is appetite and to remove from it those towards
                    which there is aversion. It is thus not merely the type of occupied space and
                    the centre from which all positions are reckoned, but it affords us an unfailing
                    and ever-present intuition of the actually felt and living self, to which all
                    other things are external, more or less distant, and at times absent altogether.
                    The body then first of all gives to self a certain measure of individuality,
                    permanence, and inwardness.</p>
                <p>But with the development of ideation there arises within this what we may call an
                    inner zone of self, having still more unity and permanence. We have at this
                    stage not only an intuition of the bodily self doing or suffering here and now,
                    but also memories of what it has been and done under varied circumstances in the
                    past. External impressions have by this time lost in novelty and become less
                    absorbing, while the train of ideas, largely increased in number, distinctness,
                    and mobility, diverts attention and often shuts out the things of sense
                    altogether. In all such reminiscence or reverie a generic image of self is the
                    centre, and every new image as it arises derives all its interest from relation
                    to this; and so apart from bodily appetites new desires may be quickened and old
                    emotions stirred again when all that is actually present is dull and unexciting.
                    But desires and emotions, it must be remembered, though awakened by what is only
                    imaginary, invariably entail actual organic perturbations, and with these the
                    generic image of self comes to be intimately combined. Hence arises a contrast
                    between the inner self, which the natural man locates in his breast or <hi
                    rend="italic">φρήν,</hi> the chief seat of these emotional disturbances, and the
                    whole visible and tangible body besides. Although from their nature they do not
                    admit of much ideal representation, yet, when actually present, these organic
                    sensations exert a powerful and often irresistible influence over other ideas;
                    they have each their appropriate train, and so heighten in the very complex and
                    loosely compacted idea of self those traits they originally wrought into it,
                    suppressing to an equal extent all the rest. Normally there is a certain
                    equilibrium to which they return, and which, we may suppose, determines the
                    so-called temperament, <hi rend="italic">naturel,</hi> or disposition, thus
                    securing some tolerable uniformity and continuity in the presentation of self.
                    But even within the limits of sanity great and sudden changes of mood are
                    possible, as, <hi rend="italic">e.g.,</hi> in hysterical persons or those of a
                    “mercurial temperament,” or among the lower animals at the onset of parental or
                    migratory instincts. Beyond those limits—as the concomitant apparently of
                    serious visceral derangements or the altered nutrition of parts of the nervous
                    system itself—complete “alienation” may ensue. A new self may arise, not only
                    distinct from the old and devoid of all save the most elementary knowledge and
                    skill that the old possessed, but diametrically opposed to it in tastes and
                    disposition,—obscenity, it may be, taking the place of modesty and cupidity or
                    cowardice succeeding to generosity or courage. The most convincing illustrations
                    of the psychological growth and structure of the presentation of self on the
                    lower levels of sensation and ideation are furnished by these melancholy
                    spectacles of minds diseased; but it is impossible to refer to them in detail
                    here.</p>
                <p>Passing to the higher level of intellection, we come at length upon the concept
                    which every intelligent being more or less distinctly forms of himself as a
                    person, Μ. or N., having such and such a character, tastes, and convictions,
                    such and such a history, and such and such an aim in life. The main instrument
                    in the formation of this concept, as of others, is language, and especially the
                    social intercourse that language makes possible. Up to this point the
                    presentation of self has shaped that of nôt-self,—that is to say, external
                    things have been comprehended by the projection of its characteristics. But now
                    the order is in a sense reversed: the individual advances to a fuller
                    self-knowledge by comparing the self within with what is first discernible in
                    other persons without So far <hi rend="italic">avant l'homme est la
                    société</hi>; it is through the “us” that we learn of the “me” (comp. p. 75 note
                    1). Collective action for common ends is of the essence of society, and in
                    taking counsel together for the good of his tribe each one learns also to take
                    counsel with himself for his own good on the whole; with the idea of the common
                    weal arises the idea of happiness as distinct from momentary gratification. The
                    extra-regarding impulses are now confronted by a reasonable self-love, and in
                    the deliberations that thus ensue activity attains to its highest forms, those
                    of thought and volition. In the first we have a distinctly active manipulation
                    of ideas as compared with the more passive spectacle of memory and imagination.
                    Thereby emerges a contrast between the thinker and these objects of his thought,
                    including among them the mere generic image of self, from which is now formed
                    this conception of self as a person. A similar, even sharper, contrast also
                    accompanies the exercise of what is very misleadingly termed “self-control,” <hi
                    rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> control by this personal self of “the various natural
                    affections,” to use Butler’s phrase, which often hinder it as external objects
                    hindered them. It is doubtful whether the reasoning, regulating self is commonly
                    regarded as definitely localized. The effort of thinking and concentrating
                    attention upon ideas is no doubt referred to the brain, but this is only
                    comparable with the localization of other efforts in the limbs; when we think we
                    commonly feel also, and the emotional basis is of all the most subjective and
                    inalienable. If we speak of this latest phase of self as <hi rend="italic">par
                    excellence</hi> “the inner self” such language is then mainly figurative,
                    inasmuch as the contrasts just described are contrasts into which spatial
                    relations do not enter.</p>
                <p>The term “reflexion” or internal perception is applied to that state of mind in
                    which some particular presentation or group of presentations (ic or <hi
                    rend="italic">y)</hi> is not simply in the field of consciousness but there as
                    consciously related to self, which is also presented at the same time. Self here
                    may be symbolized by Μ, to emphasize the fact that it is in like manner an
                    object in the field of consciousness. The relation of the two is commonly
                    expressed by saying, “This <hi rend="italic">(x</hi> or <hi rend="italic"
                    >y)</hi> is my (M’s) percept, idea, or volition; I (Μ) it is that perceive,
                    think, will it.” Self-consciousness, in the narrowest sense, as when we say, “I
                    know myself, I am conscious that I am,” &amp;c., is but a special, though the
                    most important, instance of this internal perception: here self (Μ) is presented
                    in relation to self (with a difference, M'); the subject itself—at least so we
                    say—is or appears as its own object.</p>
                <p>It has been often maintained that the difference between consciousness and
                    reflexion is not a real difference, that to know and to know that you know are
                    “the same thing considered in different aspects.”<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>So—misled possibly by the confusions incident
                    to a special faculty of reflexion, which they controvert—James Mill, <hi

                    same thing are <hi rend="italic">not</hi> the same thing, for psychology at
                    least. Not only is it not the same thing to feel and to know that you feel; but
                    it might even be held to be a different thing still to know that you feel and to
                    know that you know that you feel,—such being the difference perhaps between
                    ordinary reflexion and psychological introspection.<note anchored="true"

                    view that it implies the possibility of an indefinite regress; but why should it
                    not? We reach the limit of our experience in reflexion or at most in deliberate
                    introspection, just as in space of three dimensions we reach the limit of our
                    experience in another respect. But there is no absurdity in supposing a
                    consciousness more evolved and explicit than our self-consciousness and
                    advancing on it as it advances on that of the unreflecting brutes.</p></note> ®
                    The difficulty of apprehending these facts and keeping them distinct seems
                    obviously due to the necessary presence of the earlier along with the later;
                    that is to say, we can never know that we feel without feeling. But the converse
                    need not be true. How distinct the two states are is shown in one way by their
                    notorious incompatibility, the direct consequence of the limitation of
                    attention: whatever we have to do that is not altogether mechanical is ill done
                    unless we lose ourselves in the doing of it. This mutual exclusiveness receives
                    a further explanation from the fact so often used to discredit psychology, viz.,
                    that the so-called introspection and indeed all reflexion are really
                    retrospective. It is not while we are angry or lost in reverie that we take note
                    of such states, but afterwards, or by momentary side glances intercepting the
                    main interest, if this be not too absorbing.</p>
                <p>But we require an exacter analysis of the essential fact in this retrospect—the
                    relation of the presentation <hi rend="italic">x or</hi><hi rend="italic">y</hi>
                    to that of self or Μ. What we have to deal with, it will be observed, is,
                    implicitly at least, a judgment. First of all, then, it is noteworthy that we
                    are never prompted to such judgments by every-day occurrences or acts of
                    routine, but only by matters of interest, and, as said, generally<pb break="no"

                    all-engrossing. Now in such cases it will be found that some effect of the
                    preceding state of objective absorption persists, like wounds received in battle
                    unnoticed till the fight is over,—such, <hi rend="italic">e.g.,</hi> as the
                    weariness of muscular exertion or of long concentration of attention; some
                    pleasurable or painful after-sensation passively experienced, or an emotional
                    wave subsiding but not yet spent; ‘ ‘ the jar of interrupted expectation,” or
                    the relief of sudden attainment after arduous striving, making prominent the
                    contrast of contentment and want in that particular; or, finally, the quiet
                    retrospect and mental rumination in which we note what time has wrought upon us
                    and either regret or approve what we were and did. All such presentations are of
                    the class out of which, as we have seen, the presentation of self is built up,
                    and so form in each case the concrete bond connecting the generic image of self
                    with its object.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>They
                    have thus a certain analogy to the presentative element in external perception,
                    the re-presentative elements being furnished by the rest of the generic image of
                    self. But, as this generic image is combined with and primarily sustained by a
                    continuous stream of organic sensations, the analogy is not very
                    exact.</p></note> In this way and in this respect each is a concrete instance of
                    what we call a state, act, affection, &amp;c., and the judgments in which such
                    relations to the standing presentation of self are recognized are the original
                    and the type of all real predications (comp. p. 81). The opportunities for
                    reflexion are at first few, the materials being as it were thrust upon
                    attention, and the resulting “percepts” are but vague. By the time, however,
                    that a clear conception of self has been attained the exigencies of life make it
                    a frequent object of contemplation, and as the abstract of a series of instances
                    of such definite self-consciousness we reach the purely formal notion of a
                    subject or pure ego. For empirical psychology this notion is ultimate; its
                    speculative treatment falls altogether—usually under the heading “rational
                    psychology”—to metaphysics.</p>
                <p>The growth of intellection and self-consciousness reacts powerfully upon the
                    emotional and active side of mind. To describe the various sources of feeling
                    and of desire that thus arise—aesthetic, social and religious sentiments, pride,
                    ambition, selfishness, sympathy, &amp;c.—is beyond the scope of systematic
                    psychology and certainly quite beyond the limits of an article like the
                    present.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>The psychology
                    of a century or so ago, like the biology of the same period, was largely of the
                    “natural history” type and was much occupied with such descriptions; writers
                    like Dugald Stewart, Brown, and Abercrombie, <hi rend="italic">e.g.,</hi> draw
                    freely from biography (and even from Action) illustrations of the popularly
                    received mental faculties and affections. A very complete and competent handling
                    of the various emotions and springs of action will be found in Bain, <hi
                    rend="italic">The Emotions and the Will;</hi> Nahlowsky, <hi rend="italic">Das
                    Gefühlsleben,</hi> 2d ed., 1884, is also good.</p></note> But at least a general
                    <hi rend="italic">résumé</hi> of the characteristics of activity on this highest
                    or rational level is indispensable. If we are to gain any oversight in a matter
                    of such complexity it is of the first importance to keep steadily in view, as a
                    fundamental principle, that as the causes of feeling become more complex,
                    internal, and representative the consequent actions change in like manner. We
                    have noted this connexion already in the case of the emergence of desires, and
                    seen that desire in prompting to the search for means to its end is the <hi
                    rend="italic">primum movens</hi> of intellection (pp. 73-75). But intellect does
                    much more than devise and contrive in unquestioning subservience to the impulse
                    of the moment, like some demon of Eastern fable; even the brutes, whose cunning
                    is on the whole of this sort, are not without traces of self-control. As motives
                    conflict and the evils of hasty action recur to mind, deliberation succeeds to
                    mere invention and design. In moments of leisure, the more imperious cravings
                    being stilled, besides the rehearsal of failures or successes in the past, come
                    longer and longer flights of imagination into the future. Both furnish material
                    for intellectual rumination, and so we have at length (1) conceptions of general
                    and distant ends, as wealth, power, knowledge, and—self-consciousness having
                    arisen— the conception also of the happiness or perfection of self, and (2)
                    maxims or practical generalizations as to the best means to these ends. Instead
                    of actions determined by the <hi rend="italic">vis a tergo</hi> of blind passion
                    we have conduct shaped by what is literally prudence or foresight, the pursuit
                    of ends that are not esteemed desirable till they are judged to be <hi
                    rend="italic">good.</hi> The good, it is truly urged, is not to be identified
                    with the pleasant, for the one implies a standard and a judgment and the other
                    nothing but a bare fact of feeling; thus the good is often not pleasant and the
                    pleasant not good; in talking of the good, in short, we are passing out of the
                    region of nature into that of character. It is so, and yet this progress is
                    itself so far natural as to admit of psychological explication. As already urged
                    (p. 72), the causes of feeling change as the constituents of consciousness
                    change and depend more upon the form of that consciousness as that increases in
                    complexity. When we can deliberately range to and fro in time and circumstances,
                    the good that is not directly pleasant may indeed be preferred to what is only
                    pleasant while attention is confined to the seen and sensible; but then the
                    choice of such good is itself pleasant, —pleasanter than its rejection would
                    have been. Freedom of will in the sense of absolute arbitrariness or “causeless
                    volition,” then, is at least without support from experience. The immediate
                    affirmation of self-consciousness that in the moment of action we are free must
                    be admitted indeed, but it does not prove what it is supposed to prove—the
                    existence of a <hi rend="italic">liberum</hi><hi rend="italic">arbitrium
                    indifferentiae</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi> but only that the relation of the
                    end approved to the empirical self as then presented was the determining motive.
                    This freedom of this empirical self is in all cases a relative freedom; hence at
                    a later time we often come to see that in some past act of choice we were not
                    our true selves, not really free. Or perhaps we hold that we <hi rend="italic"
                    >were</hi> free and could have acted otherwise; and this also is true if we
                    suppose the place of the purely formal and abstract conception of self had been
                    occupied by some other mood of that empirical self which is continuously, but at
                    no one moment completely, presented. It must, however, be admitted that
                    psychological analysis in such cases is not only actually incomplete but in one
                    respect must necessarily always remain so; and that for the simple reason that
                    all we discern by reflexion must ever be less than all we are. That empirical
                    self that the subject sees and even fashions is after all only its object and
                    workmanship, not itself. If this be so, the indeterminist position, that
                    particular acts are not fully determined by aught in consciousness, can neither
                    be certainly established nor finally overthrown on scientific grounds; but the
                    presumption is against it. In another sense, however, it may be allowed that
                    freedom is possible, if not actual, viz., as synonymous with self-rule or
                    autonomy. Freedom applies not to the ultimate source of an activity but to
                    execution; that man is free “externally” who can do what he pleases, and when we
                    talk of internal freedom the same meaning holds.<note anchored="true"

                    though the latter work in places is superficial and inaccurate.</p>
                <p>B. <hi rend="italic">Positive,—</hi> The most useful and complete work as an
                    introduction, and for the English reader, is Mr Sully’s well-arranged and
                    well-written <hi rend="italic">Outlines of Psychology</hi> (2d ed., London,
                    1885). Of more advanced text-books the late Professor Volkmann’s <hi
                    rend="italic">Lehrbuch der Psychologie</hi> (2 vols., 3d ed., Köthen, 1885,
                    edited by Cornelius) is a monument worthy the lifelong labours it entailed.
                    Written in the main from a Herbartian standpoint, it is still the work of one
                    who not only had read and thought over all that was worth reading by
                    psychologists of every school but was unusually gifted with the qualities that
                    make a good investigator and a good expositor. The importance of the Herbartian
                    psychology to English students has been too long overlooked; while it has much
                    in common with the English preference for empirical methods, it is in aim, if
                    not in attainment, greatly in advance of English writers in exactness and
                    system. Other excellent works of the same school are Μ. W. H. Drobisch’s <hi
                    rend="italic">Empirische Psychologie</hi> (Leipsic, 1842), T. Waitz’s <hi
                    rend="italic">Lehrbuch der Psychologie als Naturwissenschaft</hi> (Brunswick,
                    1849), and Steinthal’s <hi rend="italic">Einleitung in die Psychologie und
                    Sprachwissenschaft</hi> (Berlin, 1871). To the honoured name of Lotze belongs a
                    distinguished place in any enumeration of recent productions in philosophy; his
                    <hi rend="italic">Medizinische Psychologie</hi> (Göttingen, 1852) is still
                    valuable; but it is out of print and scarce. A large part of his <hi
                    rend="italic">Mikrokosmos</hi> (3 vols., 3d ed., 1876-80; translated into
                    English, 2 vols., 1885) and one book of his <hi rend="italic">Metaphysik</hi>
                    (2d ed., 1884; also translated into English) are, however, devoted to
                    psychology. The close connexion between the study of mind and the study of the
                    organism has been more and more recognized as the present century has advanced,
                    and the doctrine of evolution in particular has been as fruitful in this study
                    as in other sciences that deal with life. In this respect Mr Herbert Spencer’s
                    <hi rend="italic">Principles of Psychology</hi> (2 vols., 2d ed., 1870) and <hi
                    rend="italic">Data of Ethics</hi> (1879) occupy a foremost place. Dr Bain’s
                    standard volumes, <hi rend="italic">The Senses and the Intellect</hi> (3d ed.,
                    1873) and <hi rend="italic">The Emotions and the Will</hi> (3d ed., 1875),
                    contain a good deal of “physiological psychology,” but no adequate recognition
                    of the importance of the modern theory of development; still, with the exception
                    of Locke, perhaps no English writer has made equally important contributions to
                    the science of mind. It is very questionable whether the time has yet come for a
                    systematic treatment of the connexions of mind and body. Wundt’s <hi
                    rend="italic">Physiologische Psychologie</hi> (2 vols., 2d ed., 1880) is rather
                    a physiology added to a psychology than an attempt at such a systematic
                    treatment. It is, however, a thoroughly able work by one who <hi rend="italic"
                    >is</hi> both a good psychologist and a good physiologist. (J. W *. )</p>
