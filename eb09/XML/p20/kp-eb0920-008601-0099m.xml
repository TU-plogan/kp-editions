                    remains of these curious creatures, they have occupied the attention of
                    naturalists, and various opinions have been expressed as to their natural
                    affinities. The general proportions of their bodies (excepting the larger head
                    and neck) and the modification of the forelimb, to support a membrane for
                    flight, remind one strongly of the bats, but the resemblance is only
                    superficial; a closer inspection shows that their affinities are rather with
                    reptiles and birds.In all ptérodactyles the head, neck, and forelimb are large
                    in proportion to the other parts of the body (fig. 1). The skull is remarkably
                    avian, and even the teeth, which most of them possess, and which seem so
                    unbιrd-lιke, are paralleled in the Cretaceous toothed birds of North America.
                    Judging from the form of the skull, the brain was small, but rounded and more
                    like that of a bird than that of a reptile. The position of the occipital
                    condyle, beneath and not at the back of the skull, is another character pointing
                    in the same direction. The nasal opening is not far in advance of the large
                    orbit, and in some forms there is a lachrymo-nasal fossa between them. The
                    premaxillae are large, while the maxillae are slender. In certain species the
                    extremities of the upper and lower jaws seem to have been covered with horn, and
                    some forms at least had bony plates around the eye. The union of the
                    post-frontal bone with the squamosal to form a supra-temporal fossa is a
                    reptilian character. Both jaws are usually provided with long slender teeth, but
                    they are not always present. The vertebral column may be divided into cervical,
                    dorsal, sacral, and caudal regions. The centra of the vertebrae are
                    procoelous,—that is, the front of each centrum is cup-like and receives the
                    ball-like hinder ex tremity of the vertebra next in front of it. The eight or
                    nine cervical vertebrae are always large, and are succeeded by about fourteen or
                    sixteen which bear ribs. Probably there are no vertebrae which can be called
                    lumbar. The sacrum consists of from three to six vertebrae. The tail is short in
                    some genera and very long in others. The sternum has a distinct median crest,
                    and the scapula and coracoid are also much like those of carinate birds. The
                    humerus has a strong ridge for the attachment of the pectoral muscle, and the
                    radius and ulna are separate bones. There are four distinct metacarpals; passing
                    from the inner or radial side, the first three of these bear respectively two,
                    three, and four phalanges, the terminal ones having had claws. The phalanges of
                    the outermost digit are much elongated, and except in one doubtful form are
                    always four in number. It is the extreme elongation of this outer-digit, for the
                    support of the patagium, which is the most characteristic feature of the
                    pterodactyle’s organization. A slender bone called the “pteroid” is sometimes
                    seen extending from the carpal region in the direction of the upper part of the
                    humerus. Some naturalists look upon the pteroid merely as an ossification of a
                    tendon, corresponding with one which is found in this position in birds, while
                    others are inclined to regard it rather as a rudimentary first digit, modified
                    to support the edge of the patagium. The pelvis is small. In form the ilia
                    resemble rather the-ornithic than the reptilian type; but the other portions of
                    the pelvis are more like those of the crocodiles. The hind <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit20newyrich/page/n100/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0920-0100-0087"/> limb is small, and the fibula seems to have been
                    feebly developed and fixed to the tibia. The hind foot has five digits in some
                    forms, but only four in others. In the latter case the number of phalanges to
                    each digit, counting from the tibial side, is two, three, four, five
                    respectively. The long bones and vertebrae, as well as some parts of the skull,
                    contained large pneumatic cavities similar to those found in birds. There can be
                    little doubt that the ptérodactyles had the power of sustained flight. The large
                    size of the sternal crest indicates a similar development of the pectoral
                    muscles and a corresponding strength in the arms. The form of the forelimb,
                    especially its outer digit, indicates in no uncertain “manner that it supported
                    a flying membrane; but within the last few years this has been more clearly
                    demonstrated by the discovery of a specimen in the Solenhofen slates with the
                    membrane preserved (fig. 2). The occurrence of ptérodactyle remains in marine
                    deposits would seem to indicate that they frequented the seashore; and it is
                    tolerably certain that those forms with long and slender teeth were, in part at
                    least, fish-eaters. Seeing, however, that the armature of the jaws varies
                    considerably in the different genera, it is most likely that their diet varied
                    accordingly.</p>
                <p>Ptérodactyles present so many avian peculiarities that it has been proposed to
                    place them in a special group, to be called <hi rend="italic">Omithosauria,</hi>
                    which would hold a position intermediate between <hi rend="italic">Aves</hi> and
                    <hi rend="italic">Reptilia.</hi> On the other hand, ptérodactyles are thought by
                    most authorities to have a closer relationship with the reptiles, and the
                    different genera are placed in a separate order of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Reptilia</hi> called <hi rend="italic">Pterosauria.</hi> The most important
                    genera are five. (1) <hi rend="italic">Pterodactylus</hi>; these have the jaws
                    pointed and toothed to their extremities, and the tail very short. (2) <hi
                    rend="italic">Rhamphorhynchus</hi> (fig. 2); this genus has the jaws provided
                    with slender teeth, but the extremities of both mandible and upper jaw are
                    produced into toothless beaks, which were probably covered with horn; the tail
                    is extremely long. (3) <hi rend="italic">Dimorphodon</hi>; in this form the
                    anterior teeth in both upper and lower jaws are long, but those at the hinder
                    part of the jaws are short; the tail is extremely long. (4) <hi rend="italic"
                    >Pteranodon</hi>; similar in most respects to <hi rend="italic"
                    >Pterodactylus,</hi> but the jaws are devoid of teeth. In these four genera the
                    outer digit of the manus has four phalanges. (5) <hi rend="italic"
                    >Omi-thopterus</hi>; this form is said to have only two phalanges in the outer
                    digit of the manus; the genus, however, is very imperfectly known, and it has
                    been suggested that it may perhaps be a tru⅛ bird.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Pterosauria</hi> are only known to have lived during the
                    Mesozoic period. They are first met with in the Lower Lias, the <hi
                    rend="italic">Dimor∙ phodon macronyx</hi> from Lyme Regis being perhaps the
                    earliest known species. The Jurassic slates of Solenhofen have yielded a large
                    number of beautifully preserved examples of <hi rend="italic">Pterodactylus</hi>
                    and <hi rend="italic">Rhamphorhynchus,</hi> and remains of the same genera have
                    been found in England in the Stonesfield slate. Bones of ptérodactyles have also
                    been obtained in some abundance from the Cretaceous phosphatic deposits near
                    Cambridge; and their remains have been met with occasionally in the Wealden and
                    Chalk of Kent. The genus <hi rend="italic">Pteranodon</hi> is only known from
                    the Upper Cretaceous rocks of North America. The <hi rend="italic"
                    >Pterosauria</hi> were for the most part of moderate or small size (see fig. 1),
                    but some attained to very considerable dimensions; for instance, <hi
                    rend="italic">Rhamphorhynchus Bucklandi</hi> from the Stonesfield slate probably
                    measured 7 feet between the wing-tips. But the largest forms existed apparently
                    towards the close of the Mesozoic period, the ptérodactyles of the British
                    Cretaceous rocks and the American <hi rend="italic">Pteranodon</hi> being of
                    still larger size: some of them, it is calculated, must have had wings at least
                    20 feet in extent.</p>
