                    position in history of the first leader of the opposition, was descended from an
                    ancient family with a pedigree duly recorded in Nichols’s <hi rend="italic"
                        >History of Leicestershire</hi> (iv. 320). His father, William Pulteney,
                    died in 1715, and the future statesman was the offspring of his first wife, Mary
                    Floyd, and was born in 1684. As his grandfather had been intimately connected
                    with the city of Westminster, the boy was sent to Westminster school and from it
                    proceeded to Christ Church, Oxford, acquiring in these institutions that deep
                    classical knowledge which adorned his own speeches and enabled him to correct
                    his great antagonist when he blundered in a quotation. On leaving Oxford he made
                    the usual tour on the Continent. In 1705 he was brought into parliament by Henry
                    Guy for the Yorkshire borough of Hedon, and at the death of that gentleman (a
                    politician who had at one time held the office of secretary of the treasury)
                    Pulteney inherited an estate of £500 a year and £40,000 in cash. This seat was
                    held by him without a break until 1734, and though the family was then
                    dispossessed for a time the supremacy was regained in the return of another
                    Pulteney in 1739. Throughout the reign of Queen Anne William Pulteney played a
                    prominent part in the struggles of the Whigs, and on the prosecution of
                    Sacheverell he exerted himself with great zeal against that violent divine. When

                    championed his cause in the House of Commons and joined with the leading Whigs
                    in visiting him in his prison-chamber. For these acts he was duly rewarded on
                    the accession of George I. In the first ministry of the new king he held the
                    post of secretary of war, a post which in the previous reign had been conferred
                    upon St John, Walpole, and Granville successively, and when the committee of
                    secrecy on the Utrecht treaty was formed the list included the name of William
                    Pulteney. Two years later (6th July 1716) he became one of the privy council. In
                    the following year the Whig ministry -was rent in twain by internal dissension.
                    On the proposition of the Government for granting a supply against Sweden the
                    friends of Lord Townshend and Sir Robert Walpole voted against the
                    administration, which only escaped defeat by a majority of four. Townshend was
                    immediately dismissed from his post of lord-lieutenant of Ireland, and Walpole
                    at once resigned his places, and amongst the Whigs who followed him in his
                    retirement was Pulteney. Devotion like this merited some signal mark of favour
                    on the return to power of the displaced ministers; yet, when the crash of the
                    South Sea Company restored Walpole to the highest position of authority, all
                    that he offered to Pulteney was a peerage, a distinction which entailed the
                    misfortune of banishment from the House where his faculties found their highest
                    opportunities for display. The offer was rejected, but in 1723 Pulteney stooped
                    to accept the lucrative but insignificant post of cofferer of the household. In
                    this obscure position he was content for some time to await the future; but when
                    he found himself neglected he broke out into sarcasms on the civil list and in
                    1725 was dismissed from his sinecure. From the day of his dismissal to that of
                    his ultimate triumph Pulteney remained in opposition, and, although Sir Robert
                    Walpole attempted on his quarrel with Townshend to conciliate him, all his
                    overtures were spurned. Pulteney’s resentment was not confined to his speeches
                    in parliament. With Bolingbroke he set on foot the well-known periodical called
                        <hi rend="italic">The Craftsman,</hi> and in its pages the minister was
                    incessantly denounced for many years. The war of pamphlets raged without
                    ceasing. Lord Hervey published an attack on the <hi rend="italic"
                        >Craftsman,</hi> and Pulteney, either openly or behind the person of
                    Amhurst, defended its strictures of the minister. Whether the question at issue
                    was the civil list, the excise, the income of the prince of Wales, or the state
                    of domestic affairs Pulteney was ready with a pamphlet, and the minister or one
                    of his friends came out with a reply. For one of these efforts he was challenged
                    to a duel by Lord Hervey; for another he was struck off the roll of privy
                    councillors and dismissed from the commission of the peace in several counties.
                    In print Pulteney was inferior to Bolingbroke alone among the antagonists of
                    Walpole, but in parliament, from which St John was excluded, he excelled all his
                    comrades. When the sinking fund was appropriated his voice was the foremost in
                    denunciation; when the excise scheme was stirring popular feeling to its lowest
                    depths the passion of the multitude broke out in his oratory. Through Walpole’s
                    prudent withdrawal of the latter measure the fall of his ministry was averted,
                    and dismay fell on the opposition leaders. Bolingbroke withdrew to France and
                    Pulteney sought consolation in foreign travel.</p>
                <p>From the general election of 1734 until his elevation to the peerage Pulteney sat
                    for Middlesex. For some years after this election the minister’s assailants made
                    little progress in their attack, but in 1738 the troubles with Spain supplied
                    them with the opportunity which they desired. Walpole long argued for peace, but
                    he was feebly supported in his own cabinet, and the frenzy of the people for war
                    knew no bounds. In an evil moment for his own reputation he consented to remain
                    in office and to gratify popular passion with a war against Spain. His downfall
                    was not long deferred. War was declared in 1739; a new parliament was summoned
                    in the summer of 1741, and over the division on the election petitions the
                    ministry of Walpole fell to pieces. The task of forming the new administration
                    was after some delay entrusted to his principal antagonist, whereupon Pulteney
                    offered the post of first lord of the treasury to that harmless politician the
                    earl of Wilmington, being content himself, as he had often declared his disdain
                    for office, with a seat in the cabinet coupled with a peerage. At this act
                    popular feeling broke out into open indignation. Exclamations that the country
                    was betrayed were heard on all sides, and from the moment of his elevation to
                    the Upper House Pulteney’s influence dwindled to nothing. Horace Walpole asserts
                    that when Pulteney wished to recall his desire for a peerage it was forced upon
                    him through the ex-minister’s advice by the king, and another chronicler of the
                    times records that when victor and vanquished met in the House of Lords, the one
                    as Lord Orford, the other as the earl of Bath, the remark was made by the
                    exulting Orford: “Here we are, my lord, the two most insignificant fellows in
                    England.” On 14th July 1742 Pulteney was created baron Pulteney of Hedon, county
                    York, viscount Pulteney of Wrington, county Somerset, and earl of Bath, and a
                    few months previously he had been restored to his rank in the privy council. On
                    Wilmington’s death in 1743 he made application to the king for the post of first
                    lord of the treasury, only to find that it had been conferred on Henry Pelham.
                    For two days in 1746 he was at the head of a ministry, but in “48 hours, three
                    quarters, seven minutes, and eleven seconds” this short-lived ministry
                    collapsed. An occasional pamphlet and an unfrequent speech were afterwards the
                    sole fruits of Lord Bath’s talents. His praises whilst in retirement have been
                    sung by two prelates of the established church of England, Bishops Pearce and
                    Newton. He died on 7th July 1764, and was buried on 17th July in his own vault
                    in Islip chapel, Westminster Abbey.</p>
                <p>Pulteney’s eloquence was keen and incisive, sparkling with vivacity and with
                    allusions drawn from the literature of his own country and of Rome. Of business
                    he was never fond, and the loss in 1734 of his trusted friend John Merrill, who
                    had supplied the qualities Λvhich he lacked, was feelingly lamented by him in a
                    letter to Swift. His chief weakness was a passion for money, which was born with
                    him and grew as he grew. As he left no surviving issue<note anchored="true"

                            John Gumley of Isleworth, usually styled “a wealthy glass manufacturer
                            and army contractor,” died on 14th September 1758, aged
                        sixty-four.</p></note> his vast fortune went to William Johnstone of
                    Dumfries (the third son of Sir James Johnstone), who had married Frances, the
                    daughter and heiress of his cousin Daniel Pulteney, and had taken the name of
                    Pulteney. ' Lord Bath has left no trace of the possession of practical
                    statesmanship, but for nearly twenty years he led the opposition in the House of
                    Commons to the greatest minister of the age, and had at last the triumph of
                    driving his adversary from office. (W. P. C.)</p>
