                    imagination of succeeding times that their historical lineaments are difficult
                    to discern through the mythical haze that envelops them. Animated, as it would
                    appear, not merely by the philosophic thirst for knowledge but also by the
                    enthusiasm of an ethico-religious reformer, he became, centuries after his
                    death, the ideal hero or saint of those who grafted a mystical religious
                    asceticism on the doctrines of Plato. Writings were forged in his name. Lives of
                    him were written which gather up in his person all the traits of the philosophic
                    wise man, and surround him besides with the nimbus of the prophet and
                    wonder-worker. He is described by his Neoplatonic biographers as the favourite
                    and even the son of Apollo, from whom he received his doctrines by the mouth of
                    the Delphic priestess. We read that he had a golden thigh, which he displayed to
                    the assembled Greeks at Olympia, and that on another occasion he was seen in
                    Crotona and Metapontum at one and the same time. He is said to have tamed wild
                    beasts by a word and to have foretold the future, while many stories turn upon
                    the knowledge he was reported to retain of his personality and deeds in former
                    states of existence. Thus, as Zeller truly remarks, the information respecting
                    Pythagoreanism and its founder grows fuller and fuller the farther removed in
                    time it is from its subject. The authentic details of Pythagoras’s career, on
                    the other hand, are meagre enough and merely approximate in character. He was a
                    native of Samos, and the first part of his life may therefore be said to belong
                    to that Ionian seaboard which had already witnessed the first development of
                    philosophic thought in Greece. The exact year of his birth has been variously
                    placed between 586 and 569 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.,</hi> but 582 may be taken
                    as the most probable date. Some of the accounts make him the pupil of
                    Anaximander; but such an assertion lies so ready to hand in the circumstances of
                    time and place that we cannot build with any assurance upon the suggested
                    connexion with the Ionic school. It is probable, however, that Pythagoras was
                    aware of their speculations, seeing that he left behind him in Ionia the
                    reputation of a learned and universally informed man. “Of all men Pythagoras,
                    the son of Mnesarchus, was the most assiduous inquirer,” says Heraclitus, and
                    then proceeds in his contemptuous fashion to brand his predecessor’s wisdom as
                    only eclectically compiled information or polymathy (τroλυ∕χα0iα). This
                    accumulated wisdom, as well as most of the tenets of the Pythagorean school, was
                    attributed in antiquity to the extensive travels of Pythagoras, which brought
                    him in contact (so it was said) pot only with the Egyptians, the Phoenicians,
                    the Chaldaeans, the Jews, and the Arabians, but also with the Druids of Gaul,
                    the Persian Magi, and the Brahmans. But these tales are told of too many of the
                    early philosophers to be received implicitly; they represent rather the tendency
                    of a later age to connect the beginnings of Greek speculation with the hoary
                    religions and priesthoods of the East. There is no intrinsic improbability,
                    however, in the statement that Pythagoras visited Egypt and other countries of
                    the Mediterranean, <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit20newyrich/page/n151/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0920-0151-0138"/> for travel was then one of the few ways of
                    gathering knowledge. Some of the accounts represent Pythagoras as deriving much
                    of his mathematical knowledge from an Egyptian source. Herodotus traces the
                    doctrine of metempsychosis to Egypt, as well as the practice of burying the dead
                    exclusively in linen garments, but he does not mention any visit of Pythagoras
                    to that country. There is thus little more than conjecture to fill out the first
                    half of the philosopher’s life. The historically important part of his career
                    begins with his emigration to Crotona, one of the Dorian colonies in the south
                    of Italy. Nothing is known with certainty of the reasons that led to this step,
                    which he appears to have taken about the year 529; perhaps the ethical temper
                    which can be traced in the Pythagorean school attracted the founder towards the
                    sterner Dorian character. At Crotona Pythagoras speedily became the centre of a
                    widespread and influential organization, which seems to have resembled a
                    religious brotherhood or an association for the moral reformation of society
                    much more than a philosophic school. Pythagoras appears, indeed, in all the
                    accounts more as a moral reformer than as a speculative thinker or scientific
                    teacher; and it is noteworthy that the only one of the doctrines of the school
                    which is definitely traceable to Pythagoras himself is the ethico-mystical
                    doctrine of transmigration. The aim of the brotherhood was the moral education
                    and purification of the community; and it seems to have been largely based upon
                    a revival of the Dorian ideal of abstinence and hardihood along with certain
                    other traits of a more definitely religious character, which were probably due
                    to the influence of the mysteries. But many details of life and ritual, such as
                    abstinence from animal food and from beans, celibacy, and even community of
                    goods, have been fathered by the organized asceticism of a later period upon the
                    original followers of Pythagoras. Ethics, according to the Greek and especially
                    according to the Dorian conception, being inseparably bound up with the general
                    health of the state, we are not surprised to find the Pythagoreans represented
                    as a political league; nor is it wonderful that their following was among the
                    aristocracy, and that they formed the staunchest supporters of the old Dorian
                    constitutions. It is unfair, however, to speak of the league as primarily a
                    political organization, wide though its political ramifications must latterly
                    have become. Its entanglement with politics was in the end fatal to its
                    existence. The authorities differ hopelessly in chronology, but according to the
                    balance of evidence the first reaction against the Pythagoreans took place in
                    the lifetime of Pythagoras himself after the victory gained by Crotona over
                    Sybaris in the year 510. Dissensions seem to have arisen about the allotment of
                    the conquered territory, and an adverse party was formed in Crotona under the
                    leadership of Cylon. This was probably the cause of Pythagoras’s withdrawal to
                    Metapontum, which an almost unanimous tradition assigns as the place of his
                    death in the end of the 6th or the beginning of the 5th century. The league
                    appears to have continued powerful in Magna Graecia till the middle of the 5th
                    century, when it was violently trampled out by the successful democrats. The
                    meeting-houses of the Pythagoreans were everywhere sacked and burned; mention is
                    made in particular of “.the house of Milo” in Crotona, where fifty or sixty of
                    the leading Pythagoreans were surprised and slain. The persecution to which the
                    brotherhood was subjected throughout Magna Graecia was the immediate cause of
                    the spread of the Pythagorean philosophy in Greece proper. Philolaus, who
                    resided at Thebes in the end of the 5th century (cf. Plato, <hi rend="italic"
                    >Phaedo,</hi> 6ID), was the author of the first written exposition of the
                    system. Lysis, the instructor of Epaminondas, was another of these refugees.
                    This Theban Pythagoreanism was not without an important influence upon Plato,
                    and Philolaus had also disciples in the stricter sense. But as a philosophic
                    school Pythagoreanism became extinct in Greece about the middle of the 4th
                    century. In Italy— where, after a temporary suppression, it attained a new
                    importance in the person of Archytas, ruler of Tarentum— the school finally
                    disappeared about the same time.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Pythagorean Philosophy.</hi></p>
                <p>The central thought of the Pythagorean philosophy is the idea of number, the
                    recognition of the numerical and mathematical relations of things. In the naive
                    speculation of an early age the abstract consideration of these relations was
                    tantamount to asserting their essential existence as the causes of phenomena.
                    Hence the Pythagorean thought crystallized into the formula that all things are
                    number, or that number is the essence of everything. “The Pythagoreans seem,”
                    says Aristotle, “to have looked upon number as the principle and, so to speak,
                    the matter of which existences consist”; and again, “they supposed the elements
                    of numbers to be the elements of existence, and pronounced the whole heaven to
                    be harmony and number.” “Number,” says Philolaus, “is great and perfect and
                    omnipotent, and the principle and guide of divine and human life.” Fantastical
                    as such a proposition sounds, we may still recognize the underlying truth that
                    prompted it if we reflect that it is number or definite mathematical relation
                    that separates one thing from another and so in a sense makes them things.
                    Without number and the limitation which number brings there would be only chaos
                    and the illimitable, a thought abhorrent to the Greek mind. Number, then, is the
                    principle of order, the principle by which a cosmos or ordered world subsists.
                    So we may perhaps render the thought that is crudely and sensuously expressed in
                    the utterances of the school. They found the chief illustrations, or rather
                    grounds, of their position in the regular movements of the heavenly bodies and
                    in the harmony of musical sounds, the dependence of which on regular
                    mathematical intervals they were apparently the first to discover. The famous
                    theory of the harmony of the spheres combines both ideas: the seven planets are
                    the seven golden chords of the heavenly heptachord.</p>
                <p>Immediately connected with their central doctrine is the theory of opposites held
                    by the Pythagoreans. Numbers are divided into odd and even, and from the
                    combination of odd and even the numbers themselves (and therefore all things)
                    seem to result. The odd number was identified with the limited, the even with
                    the unlimited, because even numbers may be perpetually halved, whereas the odd
                    numbers (at least the earlier ones), being without factors, seem to stand in
                    solid singleness. All things, accordingly, were derived by the Pythagoreans from
                    the combination of the limited and the unlimited; and it is in harmony with the
                    Greek spirit that the place of honour is accorded to the odd or the limited.
                    Following out the same thought, they developed a list of ten fundamental
                    oppositions, which roughly resembles the tables of categories framed by later
                    philosophers :—(1) limited and unlimited; (2) odd and even; (3) one and many;
                    (4) right and left; (5) masculine and feminine; (6) rest and motion; (7)
                    straight and crooked; (8) light and darkness; (9) good and evil; (10) square and
                    oblong. The arbitrariness of the list and the mingling of mathematical,
                    physical, and ethical contrasts are characteristic of the infancy of
                    speculation. The union of opposites in which consists the existence of things is
                    harmony; hence the expression already quoted that the whole heaven or the whole
                    universe is harmony. But it is to be noted that interpretations of
                    Pythagoreanism which represent the whole system as founded on the opposition of
                    unity and duality, and suppose this to have been explicitly identified with the
                    opposition of form and matter, of divine activity and passive material, must be
                    unhesitatingly rejected as betraying on the surface their post-Platonic origin.
                    Still more is this the case when in Neoplatonic fashion they go on to derive
                    this original opposition from the supreme Unity or God. The further speculations
                    of the Pythagoreans on the subject of number rest mainly on analogies, which
                    often become capricious and tend to lose themselves at last in a barren
                    symbolism. The decade, as the basis of the numerical system, appeared to them to
                    comprehend all other numbers in itself, and to it are applied, therefore, the
                    epithets quoted above of number in general. Similar language is held of the
                    number “four,” because it is the first square number and is also the potential
                    decade (1 + 2 4- 3 + 4 = 10); Pythagoras is celebrated as the discoverer of the
                    holy <hi rend="italic">τeτpaκτiς,</hi> “the fountain and root of ever-living
                    nature.” “Seven” is called <hi rend="italic">παρθένος</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >Άθ-ήνη,</hi> because within the decade it has neither factors nor product.
                    “Five,” on the other hand, signifies marriage, because it is the union of the
                    first masculine with the first feminine number (3 + 2, unity being considered as
                    a number apart). The thought already becomes more fanciful when “one” is
                    identified with reason, because it is unchangeable; “two” with opinion, because
                    it is unlimited and indeterminate; “four” with justice, because it is the first
                    square <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit20newyrich/page/n152/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0920-0152-0139"/></p>
                <p>number, the product of equals. More legitimate is their application of number to
                    geometry, according to which “one” was identified with the point, “two” with the
                    line, “three” with the surface, and “four” with the cube. In the history of
                    music the Pythagorean school is also of considerable importance from the
                    development which the theory of the octave owes to its members; according to
                    some accounts the discovery of the harmonic system is due to Pythagoras
                    himself.</p>
                <p>As already mentioned, the movements of the heavenly bodies formed for the
                    Pythagoreans an illustration on a grand scale of the truth of their theory.
                    Their cosmological system is also interesting on account of peculiarities which
                    mark it out from the current conceptions of antiquity and bring it curiously
                    near to the modern theory. Conceiving the universe, like many early thinkers, as
                    a sphere, they placed in the heart of it the central fire, to which they gave
                    the name of Hestia, the hearth or altar of the universe, the citadel or throne
                    of Zeus. Around this move the ten heavenly bodies—farthest off the heaven of the
                    fixed stars, then the five planets known to antiquity, then the sun, the moon,
                    the earth, and lastly the counter-earth <hi rend="italic">(avτιχθωv'),</hi>
                    which revolves between the earth and the central fire and thus completes the
                    sacred decade. Revolving along with the earth, the last-mentioned body is always
                    interposed as a shield between us and the direct rays of the central fire. Our
                    light and heat come to us indirectly by way of reflexion from the sun. When the
                    earth is on the same side of the central fire as the sun, we have day; when it
                    is on the other side, night. This attribution of the changes of day and night to
                    the earth’s own motion led up directly to the true theory, as soon as the
                    machinery of the central fire and the counter-earth was dispensed with. The
                    counter-earth became the western hemisphere, and the earth revolved on its own
                    axis instead of round an imaginary centre. But, as appears from the above, the
                    Pythagorean astronomy is also remarkable as having attributed a planetary motion
                    to the earth instead of making our globe the centre of the universe. Long
                    afterwards, when the church condemned the theory of Copernicus, the indictment
                    that lay against it was its heathen and “Pythagorean” character.</p>
                <p>The doctrine which the memory of mankind associates most closely with
                    Pythagoras’s name is that of the transmigration of souls— <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Metempsychosis</hi> (g ’.u). Though evidently of great importance for
                    Pythagoras himself, it does not stand in any very obvious connexion with his
                    philosophy proper. He seems to have adopted the idea from the Orphic Mysteries.
                    The bodily life of the soul, according to this doctrine, is an imprisonment
                    suffered for sins committed in a former state of existence. At death the soul
                    reaps what it has sown in the present life. The reward of the best is to enter
                    the cosmos, or the higher and purer regions of the universe, while the direst
                    crimes receive their punishment in Tartarus. But the general lot is to live
                    afresh in a series of human or animal forms, the nature of the bodily prison
                    being determined in each case by the deeds done in the life just ended. This is
                    the same doctrine of retribution and purificatory wandering which meets us in
                    Plato’s mythical descriptions of a future life. They are borrowed by him in
                    their substance from the Pythagoreans or from a common source in the Mysteries.
                    In accordance with this religious view of life as a stage of probation were the
                    ethical precepts of the school, inculcating reverence towards the gods and to
                    parents, justice, gentleness, temperance, purity of life, prayer, regular
                    self-examination, and. the observance of various ritual requirements.</p>
                <p>Connecting its ethics in this way with religion and the idea of a future life,
                    the Pythagorean societies had in them from the beginning a germ of asceticism
                    and contemplative mysticism which it was left for a later age fully to develop.
                    The Pythagorean life was destined to survive the peculiar doctrines of the
                    Pythagorean philosophy and to be grafted on later philosophic ideas. The
                    asceticism which characterized it appears in the 4th century <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> inclose connexion with the Orphic Mysteries; and the
                    “Pythagoreans” of that time are frequently the butts of the New Athenian Comedy.
                    In the Alexandrian period the Pythagorean tradition struck deeper roots; in
                    Alexandria and elsewhere schools of men arose calling themselves Pythagoreans,
                    but more accurately distinguished by modern criticism as Neopythagoreans, seeing
                    that their philosophical doctrines are evidently derived in varying proportions
                    from Plato, Aristotle, and the Stoics. In general it may be said that they
                    develop the mystic side of the Platonic doctrine; and only so far as this is
                    connected with the similar speculations of Pythagoras can they claim to be
                    followers of the latter. Hence men like Plutarch, who personally prefer to call
                    themselves Platonists, may also be considered as within the scope of this
                    Pythagorean revival. The link that really connects these Neopythagoreans with
                    the Samian philosopher and distinguishes them from the other schools of their
                    time is their ascetic ideal of life and their preoccupation with religion. In
                    religious speculation they paved the way for the Neoplatonic conception of God
                    as immeasurably transcending the world; and in their thirst for prophecies,
                    oracles, and signs they gave expression to the prevalent longing for a
                    supernatural revelation of the divine nature and will. The asceticism of the
                    Jewish sect of the Essenes seems, as Zeller contends, to be due to a strong
                    infusion of Neopythagorean elements. At a still later period Neopythagoreanism
                    set up Pythagoras and Apollonius of Tyana not only as ideals of the philosophic
                    life but also as prophets and wonder-workers in immediate communication with
                    another world, and in the details of their “lives” it is easy to read the desire
                    to emulate the narrative of the Gospels. The <hi rend="italic">Life</hi> of
                    Apollonius by Philostratus, which is for the most part an historical romance,

                <p><hi rend="italic">Pythagorean Geometry.</hi></p>
                <p>As the introduction of geometry into Greece is by common consent attributed to
                    Thales, so all are agreed that to Pythagoras is due the honour of having raised
                    mathematics to the rank of a science. We know that the early Pythagoreans
                    published nothing, and that, moreover, they referred all their discoveries back
                    to their master. (See <hi rend="smallcaps">Philolaus.)</hi> Hence it is not
                    possible to separate his work from that of his early disciples, and we must
                    therefore treat the geometry of the early Pythagorean school as a whole. We know
                    that Pythagoras made numbers the basis of his philosophical system, as well
                    physical as metaphysical, and that he united the study of geometry with that of
                    arithmetic.</p>
                <p>The following statements have been handed down to us. (a) Aristotle (J∕ei., i. 5,
                    985) says “the Pythagoreans first applied themselves to mathematics, a science
                    which they improved; and, penetrated with it, they fancied that the principles
                    of mathematics were the principles of all things.” (ό) Eudemus informs us that
                    “Pythagoras changed geometry into the form of a liberal science, regarding its
                    principles in a purely abstract manner, and investigated its theorems from the
                    immaterial and intellectual point of view (dυλωs καi <hi rend="italic"

                    the musician, Pythagoras seems to have esteemed arithmetic above everything, and
                    to have advanced it by diverting it from the service of commerce and by likening

                    and the other to the “how much” (το <hi rend="italic">πηλiκov);</hi> and they
                    assigned to each of these parts a twofold division. They said that discrete

                    quantity or the “how much” is either stable or in motion. Hence they laid down

                    considered a point as analogous to the monad, a line to the duad, a superficies
                    to the triad, and a body to the tetrad <hi rend="italic">(ib.,</hi> p. 97). (3)
                    They showed that the plane around a point is completely filled by six

                    >(ib.,</hi> p. 305). (4) Eudemus ascribes to them the discovery of the theorem
                    that the interior angles of a triangle are equal to two right angles, and gives
                    their proof, which was substantially the same as that in Euclid I. 32<note

                    Pythagoreans, and it appears from a passage in Lucian that Pythagoras himself
                    had considered the special case of <hi rend="italic">triangular</hi> numbers:
                    Pythagoras asks some one, “How do you count <hi rend="italic">1”</hi> he

                    altitudes, by means of which the meridian can be found; it denotes, further, the
                    index or style of a sun-dial, the shadow of which points out the hours. In
                    geometry it means the square or rectangle about the diagonal of a square or
                    rectangle, together with the two complements, on account of the resemblance of
                    the figure to a carpenter’s square; and then, more generally, the similar figure

                    simplest oblong (eτ∈po∕z^κ∈s), consisting of two unit squares or monads in

                <p>On examining the purely geometrical work of Pythagoras and his early disciples,
                    as given in the preceding extracts, we observe that it is much concerned with
                    the geometry of areas, and we are indeed struck with its Egyptian character.
                    This appears in the theorem (3) concerning the filling up a plane with regular
                    figures— for floors or walls covered with tiles of various colours were common
                    in Egypt; in the construction of the regular solids (8), for some of them are
                    found in Egyptian architecture; in the problems concerning the application of
                    areas (5); and lastly, in the theorem of Pythagoras (11), coupled with his rule
                    for the construction of right-angled triangles in numbers (12). We learn from
                    Plutarch that the Egyptians were acquainted with the geometrical fact that a
                    triangle whose sides contain three, four, and five parts is right-angled, and
                    that the square of the greatest side is equal to the squares of the sides
                    containing the right angle. It is probable too that this theorem was known to
                    them in the simple case where the right-angled triangle is isosceles, inasmuch
                    as it would be at once suggested by the contemplation of a floor covered with
                    square tiles —the square on the diagonal and the sum of the squares on the sides
                    contain each four of the right-angled triangles into which one of the squares is
                    divided by its diagonal. It is easy now to see how the problem to construct a
                    square which shall be equal to the sum of two squares could, in some cases, be
                    solved numerically. From the observation of a chequered board it would be
                    perceived that the element in the successive formation of squares is the gnomon
                    or carpenter’s square. Each gnomon consists of an odd number of squares, and the
                    successive gnomons correspond to the successive odd numbers, and include,
                    therefore, all odd squares. Suppose, now, two squares are given, one consisting
                    of sixteen and the other of nine unit squares, and that it is proposed to form
                    from them another square. It is evident that the square consisting of nine unit
                    squares can take the form of the fourth gnomon, which, being placed round the
                    former square, will generate a new square containing twenty-five unit squares.
                    Similarly it may have been observed that the twelfth gnomon, consisting of
                    twenty-five unit squares, could be transformed into a square each of whose sides
                    contains five units, and thus it may have been seen conversely that the latter
                    square, by taking the gnomonic or generating form with respect to the square on
                    twelve units as base, would produce the square of thirteen units, and so on.
                    This method required only to be generalized in order to enable Pythagoras to
                    arrive at his rule for finding right-angled triangles whose sides can be
                    expressed in numbers, which, we are told, sets out from the odd numbers. The nth
                    square together with the nth gnomon forms the (n + l)th square; if the nth
                    gnomon contains m <hi rend="superscript"> 2</hi> unit squares, <hi rend="italic"
                    >m</hi> being an <hi rend="italic">odd</hi> number, we have 2n + l=τn <hi
                    rend="superscript"> 2</hi>, . ’. n= —— -, which gives the rule of
                    Pythagoras.</p>
                <p>The general proof of Euclid I. 47 is attributed to Pythagoras, but we have the
                    express statement of Proclus <hi rend="italic">{pp. cit.,</hi> p. 426) that this
                    theorem was not proved in the first instance as it is in the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Elements.</hi> The following simple and natural way of arriving at the theorem
                    is suggested by Bretschneider after Camerer.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>See Bretsch., <hi rend="italic">Die</hi><hi rend="italic"

                    squares and two equal rectangles, as in Euclid II. 4; these two rectangles can,
                    by drawing their diagonals, be decomposed into four equal right-angled
                    triangles, the sum of the sides of each being equal to the side of the square;
                    again, these four right-angled triangles can be placed so that a vertex of each
                    shall be in one of the corners of the square in such a way that a greater and
                    less side are in continuation.</p>
                <p>The original square is thus dissected into the four triangles as before and the
                    figure within, which is the square on the hypotenuse. This square, therefore,
                    must be equal to the sum of the squares on the sides of the right-angled
                    triangle.</p>
                <p>It is well known that the Pythagoreans were much occupied with the construction
                    of regular polygons and solids, which in their cosmology played an essential
                    part as the fundamental forms of the elements of the universe. We can trace the
                    origin of these mathematical speculations in the theorem (3) that “the plane
                    around a point is completely filled by six equilateral triangles, four squares,
                    or three regular hexagons.” Plato also makes the Pythagorean Timaeus
                    explain—“Each straight-lined figure consists of triangles, but all triangles can
                    be dissected into rectangular ones which are either isosceles or scalene. Among
                    the latter the most beautiful is that out of the doubling of which an
                    equilateral arises, or in which the square of the greater perpendicular is three
                    times that of the smaller, or in which the smaller perpendicular is half the
                    hypotenuse. But two or four right-angled isosceles triangles, properly put
                    together, form the square; two or six of the most beautiful scalene right-angled
                    triangles form the equilateral triangle; and out of these two figures arise the
                    solids which correspond with the four elements of the real world, the
                    tetrahedron, octahedron, icosahedron, and the cube”<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>The dodecahedron was assigned to the fifth
                    element, <hi rend="italic">quinta pars,</hi><hi rend="italic">aether,</hi> or,
                    as some think, to the universe. (See <hi rend="smallcaps">Philolaus.</hi><hi

                    The construction of the regular solids is distinctly ascribed to Pythagoras
                    himself by Eudemus (8). Of these five solids three—the tetrahedron, the cube,
                    and the octahedron—were known to the Egyptians and are to be found in their
                    architecture. Let us now examine what is required for the construction of the
                    other two solids—the icosahedron and the dodecahedron. In the formation of the
                    tetrahedron three, and in that of the octahedron four, equal equilateral
                    triangles had been placed with a common vertex and adjacent sides coincident;
                    and it was known that if six such triangles were placed round a common vertex
                    with their adjacent sides coincident, they would lie in a plane, and that,
                    therefore, no solid could be formed in that manner from them. It remained, then,
                    to try whether five such equilateral triangles could be placed at a common
                    vertex in like manner; on trial it would be found that they could be so placed,
                    and that their bases would form a regular pentagon. The existence of a regular
                    pentagon would thus become known. It was also known from the formation of the
                    cube that three squares could be placed in a similar way with a common vertex;
                    and that, further, if three equal and regular hexagons were placed round a point
                    as common vertex with adjacent sides coincident, they would form a plane. It
                    remained in this case too only to try whether three equal regular pentagons
                    could be placed with a common vertex and in a similar way; this on trial would
                    be found possible and would lead to the construction of the regular
                    dodecahedron, which was the regular solid last arrived at.</p>
                <p>We see that the construction of the regular pentagon is required for the
                    formation of each of these two regular solids, and that, therefore, it must have
                    been a discovery of Pythagoras. If we examine now what knowledge of geometry was
                    required for the solution of this problem, we shall see that it depends on
                    Euclid IV. 10, which is reduced to Euclid II. 11, which problem is reduced to
                    the following: To produce a given straight line so that the rectangle under the
                    whole line thus produced and the produced part shall be equal to the square on
                    the given line, or, in the language of the ancients, To apply to a given
                    straight line a rectangle which shall be equal to a given area—in this case the
                    square on the given line—and which shall be <hi rend="italic">excessive</hi> by
                    a square. Now it is to be observed that the problem is solved in this manner by
                    Euclid (VI. 30, 1st method), and that we know on the authority of Eudemus that
                    the problems concerning the <hi rend="italic">application</hi> of areas and
                    their <hi rend="italic">excess</hi> and <hi rend="italic">defect</hi> are old,
                    and inventions of the Pythagoreans (5). Hence the statements of Iamblichus
                    concerning Hippasus (9)— that he divulged the sphere with the twelve
                    pentagons—and of Lucian and the scholiast on Aristophanes (10)—that the
                    pentagram was used as a symbol of recognition amongst the Pythagoreans —become
                    of greater importance.</p>
                <p>Further, the discovery of irrational magnitudes is ascribed to Pythagoras by
                    Eudemus (13), and this discovery has been ever regarded as one of the greatest
                    of antiquity. It is commonly assumed that Pythagoras was led to this theory from
                    the consideration of the isosceles right-angled triangle. It seems to the
                    present writer, however, more probable that the discovery of incommensurable
                    magnitudes was rather owing to the problem: To cut a line in extreme and mean
                    ratio. From the solution of this problem it follows at once that, if on the
                    greater segment of a line so cut a part be taken equal to the less, the greater
                    segment, regarded as a new line, will be cut in a similar manner; and this
                    process can be continued without end. On the other hand, if a similar method be
                    adopted in the case of any two lines which can be represented numerically, the
                    process would end. Hence would arise <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit20newyrich/page/n155/mode/1up"

                    incommensurable quantities. A reference to Euclid X. 2 will show that the method
                    above is the one used to prove that two magnitudes are incommensurable; and in
                    Euclid X. 3 it will be seen that the greatest common measure of two
                    commensurable magnitudes is found by this process of continued subtraction. It
                    seems probable that Pythagoras, to whom is attributed one of the rules for
                    representing the sides of right-angled triangles in numbers, tried to find the
                    sides of an isosceles right-angled triangle numerically, and that, failing in
                    the attempt, he suspected that the hypotenuse and a side had no common measure.
                    He may have demonstrated the incommensurability of the side of a square and its
                    diagonal. The nature of the old proof—which consisted of a <hi rend="italic"

                    that, if the diagonal be commensurable with the side, it would follow that the

                    probable, however, that this was accomplished by his successor’s. The existence
                    of the irrational as well as that of the regular dodecahedron appears to have
                    been regarded by the school as one of their chief discoveries, and to have been
                    preserved as a secret; it is remarkable, too, that a story similar to that told
                    by Iamblichus of Hippasus is narrated of the person who first published the idea
                    of the irrational, namely, that he suffered shipwreck, &amp;c.<note

                <p>Eudemus ascribes the problems concerning the application of figures to the
                    Pythagoreans. The simplest cases of the problems, Euclid VI. 28, 29—those,
                    namely, in which the given parallelogram is a square—correspond to the problem:
                    To cut a given straight line internally or externally so that the rectangle
                    under the segments shall be equal to a given rectilineal figure. The solution of
                    this problem—in which the solution of a quadratic equation is implicitly
                    contained—depends on the problem, Euclid II. 14, and the theorems, Euclid II. 5
                    and 6, together with the theorem of Pythagoras. It is probable that the finding
                    of a mean proportional between two given lines, or the construction of a square
                    which shall be equal to a given rectangle, is due to Pythagoras himself. The
                    solution of the more general problem, Euclid VI. 25, is also attributed to him
                    by Plutarch (7). The solution of this problem depends on that of the particular
                    case and on the application of areas; it requires, moreover, a knowledge of the
                    theorems: Similar rectilineal figures are to each other as the squares on their
                    homologous sides (Euclid VI. 20); and, If three lines are in geometrical
                    proportion, the first is to the third as the square on the first is to the
                    square on the second. Now Hippocrates of Chios, about 440 B.C., who was
                    instructed in geometry by the Pythagoreans, possessed this knowledge. We are
                    justified, therefore, in ascribing the solution of the general problem, if not
                    (with Plutarch) to Pythagoras, at least to his early successors.</p>
                <p>The theorem that similar polygons are to each other in the duplicate ratio of
                    their homologous sides involves a first sketch, at least, of the doctrine of
                    proportion and the similarity of figures.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>It is agreed on all hands that these two theories were
                    treated at length by Pythagoras and his school. It is almost certain, however,
                    that the theorems arrived at were_ proved for commensurable magnitudes only, and
                    were assumed to hold good for all. The Pythagoreans themselves seem to have been
                    aware that their proofs were not rigorous, and were open to serious objection;
                    in this we may have the explanation of the secrecy which was attached by them to
                    the idea of the incommensurable and to the pentagram which involved, and indeed
                    represented, that idea. Now it is remarkable that the doctrine of proportion is
                    <hi rend="italic">twice</hi> treated in the <hi rend="italic">Elements</hi> of
                    Euclid—first, in a general manner, so as to include incommensurables, in Book
                    V., which tradition ascribes to Eudoxus, and then arithmetically in Book VII.,
                    which, as Hankel has supposed, contains the treatment of the subject by the
                    older Pythagoreans.</p></note> That we owe the foundation and development of the
                    doctrine of proportion to Pythagoras and his school is confirmed by the
                    testimony of Nicomachus (14) and Iamblichus (15 and 16). From these passages it
                    appears that the early Pythagoreans were acquainted, not only with the
                    arithmetical and geometrical means between two magnitudes, but also with their
                    harmonical mean, which was then called “subcontrary.” The Pythagoreans were much
                    occupied with the representation of numbers by geometrical figures. These
                    speculations originated with Pythagoras, who was acquainted with the summation
                    of the natural numbers, the odd numbers, and the even numbers, all of which are
                    capable of geometrical representation. See the passage in Lucian (17) and the
                    rule for finding Pythagorean triangles (12) and the observations thereon <hi
                    rend="italic">supra.</hi> On the other hand, there is no evidence to support the
                    statement of Montucla that Pythagoras laid the foundation of the doctrine of <hi
                    rend="italic">isoperimetry,</hi> by proving that of all figures having the same
                    perimeter the circle is the greatest, and that of all solids having the same
                    surface the sphere is the greatest. We must also deny to Pythagoras and his
                    school a knowledge of the conic sections, and in particular of the quadrature of
                    the parabola, attributed to him by some authors; and we have noticed the
                    misconception which gave rise to this erroneous inference.</p>
                <p>Let us now see what conclusions can be drawn from the foregoing examination of
                    the mathematical work of Pythagoras and his school, and thus form an estimate of
                    the state of geometry about 480 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> First, as to <hi
                    rend="italic">matter.</hi> It forms the bulk of the first two books of Euclid,
                    and includes a sketch of the doctrine of proportion—which was probably limited
                    to commensurable magnitudes— together with some of the contents of the sixth
                    book. It contains too the discovery of the irrational (άλογον) and the
                    construction of the regular solids, the latter requiring the description of
                    certain regular polygons—the foundation, in fact, of the fourth book of Euclid.
                    Secondly, as to <hi rend="italic">form.</hi> The Pythagoreans first severed
                    geometry from the needs of practical life, and treated it as a liberal science,
                    giving definitions and introducing the manner of proof which has ever since been
                    in use. Further, they distinguished between <hi rend="italic">discrete</hi> and
                    <hi rend="italic">continuous</hi> quantities, and regarded geometry as a branch
                    of mathematics, of which they made the fourfold division that lasted to the
                    Middle Ages—the <hi rend="italic">quadrivium</hi> (fourfold way to knowledge) of
                    Boetius and the scholastic philosophy. And it may be observed that the name of
                    “mathematics,” as well as that of “philosophy,” is ascribed to them. Thirdly, as
                    to <hi rend="italic">method.</hi> One chief characteristic of the mathematical
                    work of Pythagoras was the combination of arithmetic with geometry. The notions
                    of an equation and a proportion—which are common to both, and contain the first
                    germ of algebra—were introduced among the Greeks by Thales. These notions,
                    especially the latter, were elaborated by Pythagoras and his school, so that
                    they reached the rank of a true scientific method in their theory of
                    proportion.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Proportion
                    was not regarded by the ancients merely as a branch of arithmetic. We learn from
                    Proclus that “Eratosthenes looked on proportion as the bond of mathematics” <hi
                    rend="italic">(op. cit.,</hi> p. 43). We are also told in an anonymous scholium
                    on the <hi rend="italic">Elements</hi> of Euclid, which Knoche attributes to
                    Proclus, that the fifth book, which treats of proportion, is common to geometry,
                    arithmetic, music, and, in a word, to all mathematical science. And Kepler, who
                    lived near enough to the ancients to reflect the spirit of their methods, says
                    that one part of geometry is concerned with the comparison of figures and
                    quantities, whence proportion arises. He also adds that arithmetic and geometry
                    afford mutual aid to each other, and that they cannot be separated.</p></note>
                    To Pythagoras, then, is due the honour of having supplied a method which is
                    common to all branches of mathematics, and in this respect he is fully
                    comparable to Descartes, to whom we owe the decisive combination of algebra with
                    geometry.</p>
