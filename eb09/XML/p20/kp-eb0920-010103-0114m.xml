                    Bottlenose, Coultemeb, Pope, Sea-Parrot, and Tammy-Norie, to say nothing of
                    other still more local designations, some (as Marrott and Willock) shared also
                    with allied species of <hi rend="italic">Alcidae,</hi> to which Family it has,
                    until very lately, been invariably deemed to belong. Of old time Puffins were a
                    valuable commodity to the owners of their breedingplaces, for the young were
                    taken from the holes in which they were hatched, and “being exceeding fat,” as
                    Carew wrote in 1602 <hi rend="italic">{Survey of Cornwall,</hi> fol. 35), were
                    “kept salted, and reputed for fish, as coming neerest thereto in their taste.”
                    In 1345, according to a document from which an extract is given in Heath’s <hi
                    rend="italic">Islands of Sdlly</hi> (p. 190), those islands were held of the
                    crown at a yearly rent of 300 Puffins<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>There can not be much doubt that the name Puffin given to
                    these young birds, salted and dried, was applied on account of their downy
                    clothing, for an English informant of Gesner’s described one to him <hi
                    rend="italic">(Hist. Avium,</hi> p. 110) as wanting true feathers, and being
                    covered only with a sort of woolly black plumage. It is right, however, to state
                    that Caius expressly declares <hi rend="italic">(Parior.</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >animal,</hi><hi rend="italic">libellus,</hi> fol. 21} that the name is derived
                    ‘ ‘ a naturali voce pupin.” Prof. Skeat states that the word is a diminutive,
                    which favours the view that it was-originally used as a name for these young
                    birds. The parents were probably known by one or other of their many local
                    appellations.</p></note> or 6s. 8d., being one-sixth of their estimated annual
                    value. A few years later (1484), either through the birds having grown scarcer
                    or money cheaper, only 50 Puffins are said <hi rend="italic">{op. cit.,</hi> p.
                    196) to have been demanded. It is stated by both Gesner and Caius that they were
                    allowed to be eaten in Lent. Ligon, who in 1673 published a <hi rend="italic"
                    >History of the Island of Barbadoes,</hi> speaks (p. 37) of the ill taste of
                    Puffins “which we have from the isles of Scilly,” and adds “this kind of food is
                    only for servants.” Puffins used to resort in vast numbers to certain stations
                    on the coast, and are still plentiful on some, reaching them in spring with
                    remarkable punctuality on a certain day, which naturally varies with the
                    locality, and after passing the summer there, leaving their homes with similar
                    precision. They differ from most other <hi rend="italic">Alcidae</hi> in laying
                    their single egg (which is white with a few grey markings when first produced,
                    but speedily begrimed by the soil) in a shallow burrow, which they either dig
                    for themselves or appropriate from a rabbit, for on most of their haunts rabbits
                    have been introduced. Their plumage is of a glossy black above—the cheeks grey,
                    encircled by a black band—and pure white beneath; their feet are of a bright
                    reddish orange, but the most remarkable feature of these birds, and one that
                    gives them a very comical expression, is their huge bill. This is very deep and
                    laterally flattened, so as indeed to resemble a coulter, as one of the bird’s
                    common names expresses; but moreover it is particoloured—blue, yellow, and
                    red-—curiously grooved and still more curiously embossed in places, that is to
                    say during the breeding-season, when the birds are most frequently seen. But it
                    had long been known to some observers that such Puffins as occasionally occur in
                    winter (most often washed up on the shore and dead) presented a beak very
                    different in shape and size, and to account for the difference was a standing
                    puzzle. Many years ago· Bingley <hi rend="italic">{North Wales,</hi> i. p. 354)
                    stated that Puffins “are said to change their bills annually.” The remark seems

                    proved to be very near the truth, for after investigations carefully pursued
                    during some years by Dr Bureau of Nantes he was in 1877 enabled to shew <hi

                    outgrowths above and beneath the eyes, dropping off at the end of the
                    breedingseason, and being reproduced the following year. Not long after the same

                    followed the similar changes which he found to take place, not only in other

                    Shearwaters from the Isle of Man, prepared in like manner to young Puffins,
