                    born at Marseilles on 31st October 1622, painter, sculptor, architect, and
                    engineer, is a rare instance of precocious genius and mature power. At the age
                    of fourteen he carved the ornaments of the galleys built in the port of his
                    native city, and at sixteen the decoration and construction of a ship were
                    entrusted to him. Soon after he went to Italy on foot, and was well received at
                    Rome by Pietro di Cortona, who employed him on the ceilings of the Barberini
                    palace and on those of the Pitti at Florence. In 1643 he returned to Marseilles,
                    where he painted portraits and carved the colossal figure-heads of men-of-war.
                    After a second journey to Italy he painted also a great number of pictures for
                    Aix, Toulon, Cuers, and La Ciotat, and sculptured a large marble group of the
                    Virgin and Child for the church of Lorgues. A serious illness in 1665 brought
                    Puget a prohibition from the doctors which caused him wholly to put aside the
                    brush. He now sculptured the caryatides of the town-hall of Toulon (Louvre),
                    went to Normandy, where he executed a statue of Hercules and a group of Janus
                    and Cybele for the marquis of Vaudreuil, and visiting Paris made the
                    acquaintance of Le Pautre and Fouquet, who determined to employ him at Vaux and
                    sent him to Italy to choose marbles for his work. The fall of Fouquet found
                    Puget at Genoa, where he remained employed by the nobles of the town. There he
                    executed for Sublet des Noyers his French Hercules (Louvre), the statues of St
                    Sebastian and of Alexandre 'Sauli in the church of Carignano, and much other
                    work. The Doria family gave him a church to build; the senate proposed that he
                    should paint their council-chamber. But Colbert bade Puget return to France, and
                    in 1669 he again took up his old work in the dockyards of Toulon. The arsenal
                    which he had there undertaken to construct under the orders of the duke of
                    Beaufort was destroyed by fire, and Puget, disheartened, took leave of Toulon.
                    In 1685 he went back to Marseilles, where he continued the long series of works
                    of sculpture on which he had been employed by Colbert. His statue of Milo
                    (Louvre) had been completed in 1681, Perseus and Andromeda (Louvre) in 1683, and
                    Alexander and Diogenes (bas-relief, Louvre) in 1685; but, in spite of the
                    personal favour which he enjoyed, Puget, on coming to Paris in 1688 to push
                    forward the execution of an equestrian statue of Louis XIV., found court
                    intrigues too much for him. He was forced to abandon his project and retire to
                    Marseilles, where he remained till his death in 1694. His last work, a
                    bas-relief of the Plague of Milan, which remained unfinished, was placed in the
                    council-chamber of the town-hall.</p>
                <p>Puget was the most vigorous representative of French sculpture in the 18th
                    century; in spite of his visits to Paris and Rome his work never lost its local
                    character: his Hercules is fresh from the galleys of Toulon; his saints and
                    virgins are men and women who speak Provençal. His best work, the St Sebastian
                    at Genoa, though a little heavy in parts, shows admirable energy and life, as
                    well as great skill in contrasting the decorative accessories with the simple
                    surface of the nude.</p>
