                <p>BENGAL (or, as it is often more precisely designated, “Lower Bengal ”)<note
                    anchored="true" place="margin" type="authorial"><p>Plate IV.</p></note>, the
                    largest and most populous of the twelve local governments of British India,
                    comprising the lower valleys and deltas of the Ganges and Brahmaputra, lies
                    between 19° 18' and 28° 15' N. lat., and between 82° and 97° E. long. Excluding
                    Assam, which was erected into a separate administration in February 1874, Bengal
                    now includes the four great provinces of Bengal Proper, Behar, Orissa, and
                    Chhotâ or Chutiâ Nâgpur; and forms a Lieutenant-Governorship with an area of
                    203,473 square miles, and a population of 64,444,379 souls. Including Assam,
                    which, until the spring of 1874, was a part of Bengal, the area was 248,231
                    square miles, and the population 66,856,859. This great lieutenant-governorship,
                    excluding Assam, contains one-third of the total population of British India,
                    and yields a revenue of £17,687,072, or over one-third of the aggregate revenues
                    of the Indian empire. It is bounded on the N. by Assam, Bhutan, and Nepâl; on
                    the S. by Burmah, the Bay of Bengal, and Madras; on the W. by an imaginary line
                    running between it and the adjoining lieutenant-governorship of the
                    North-Western •Provinces, and by the plateau of the Central Provinces; and on
                    the E. by the unexplored mountainous region which separates it from China and
                    Northern Burmah. The territory, thus hemmed in, except at its north-western
                    angle, by the unchangeable land-marks of nature, consists chiefly of two broad
                    river valleys. By the western one, the Ganges brings down the wealth and the
                    accumulated waters of Northern India. The eastern valley forms the route by
                    which the Brahmaputra, after draining the Thibetan plateau far to the north of
                    the Himalayas, and skirting round their passes not far from the Yangtse-Kiang
                    and the great river of Cambodia, ends its boisterous journey of 1800 miles.
                    These valleys, although for the most part luxuriant alluvial plains, are
                    diversified by spurs and peaks thrown out from the great mountain systems which
                    wall them in on the north-east and south-west. They teem with every product of
                    nature, from the fierce beasts and irrepressible vegetation of the tropics, to
                    the stunted barley which the hill-man rears, and the tiny furred animal which he
                    hunts within sight of the unmelting snows. Tea, indigo, turmeric, lac, waving
                    white fields of the opium-poppy, wheat and innumerable grains and pulses,
                    pepper, ginger, betel-nut, quifiine and many costly spices and drugs, oil-seeds
                    of sorts, cotton, the silk mulberry, inexhaustible crops of jutè and other
                    fibres; timber, from the feathery bamboo and coronetted palm to the iron-hearted
                    <hi rend="italic">sal</hi> tree—in short, every vegetable product which feeds
                    and clothes a people, and enables it to trade with foreign nations, abounds. Nor
                    is the country destitute of mineral wealth. The districts near the sea consist
                    entirely of alluvial formations; and, indeed, it is stated that no substance so
                    coarse as gravel occurs throughout the Delta, or in the heart of the provinces
                    within 400 miles of the river mouths. But amid the hilly spurs and undulations
                    on either side, coal, and iron and copper ores, hold out a new future to Bengal,
                    as capital increases under the influence of a stable government, and our
                    knowledge of the country becomes more exact. The coal-fields on the west have
                    for exactly a century been worked by English enterprise; in 1868 they yielded
                    564,933 tons, and more in the two following years. In the east, the coal
                    measures of Assam, which province was separated from Bengal in 1874, still await
                    the opening out of the country and improved facilities of transport. The climate
                    varies from the snowy regions of the Himalayas to the tropical vapour-bath of
                    the Delta and the burning winds of Behar. The ordinary range of the thermometer
                    on the plains is from about 52° Fahr, in the coldest month to 103° in the shade
                    in summer. Anything below 60° is considered very cold; and by care in the hot
                    weather the temperature of well-built houses rarely exceeds 95°. The rainfall
                    also varies greatly; from 500 to 600 inches per annum at Charâ Pιinji (Cherra
                    Poonjee) on the range between Silhet and Assam, to an average of about 37 inches
                    in Behar, and about 65 inches on the Delta.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">The Bivers.</hi> —But the secret of Bengal is its rivers.
                    These untaxed highways bring down, almost by the motive power of their own
                    current, the crops of Northern India to the sea-board,—an annual harvest of
                    wealth to the trading classes, for which the population of the Lower Provinces
                    neither toil nor spin. Lower Bengal, indeed, exhibits the two typical stages in
                    the life of a great river. In the northern districts the rivers, like our
                    English ones, run along the valleys, receive the drainage from the country on
                    either side, absorb broad tributaries, and rush forward with an ever increasing
                    volume. But near the centre of the provinces the rivers enter upon a new stage
                    of their career. Their main channels bifurcate, and each new stream so created
                    throws off its own set of distributaries to right and left. The country which
                    they thus enclose and intersect forms the Delta of Bengal· <hi
                    rend="superscript"> 1</hi> » Originally conquered by the fluvial deposits from
                    the sea, it now stretches out as a vast dead level, in which the rivers find
                    their velocity checked, and their current no longer able to carry along the silt
                    which they have brought down from Northern India. The streams, accordingly,
                    deposit their alluvial burden in their channels and upon their banks, so that by
                    degrees their beds rise above the level of the surrounding country. In this way
                    the rivers in the Delta slowly build themselves up into canals, which every
                    autumn break through or overflow their margins, and leave their silt upon the
                    adjacent flats. Thousands of square miles in Lower Bengal annually receive a
                    top-dressing of virgin soil, brought free of expense a quarter of a year’s
                    journey from the Himalayas,—a system of natural manuring which renders elaborate
                    tillage a mere waste of labour, and which defies the utmost power of
                    over-cropping to exhaust its fertility. As the rivers creep further down the
                    Delta, they become more and more sluggish, and their bifurcations and
                    interlacings more complicated. The last scene of all is a vast amphibious
                    wilderness of swamp and forest, amid whose solitudes their network of channels
                    insensibly merges into the sea. Here the perennial struggle between earth and
                    ocean goes on, and all the ancient secrets of land-making stand disclosed. The
                    rivers, finally checked by the dead weight of the sea, deposit their remaining
                    silt, which emerges as banks or blunted promontories, or, after a year’s
                    battling with the tide, adds a few feet or, it may be, a few inches to the
                    foreshore.</p>
                <p>The Ganges, which enters on the western frontier, and runs diagonally across
                    Bengal, gives to the country its peculiar character and aspect. About 200 miles
                    from its mouth it spreads out into numerous branches, forming a large delta,
                    composed, where it borders on the sea, of a labyrinth of creeks and rivers,
                    running through the dense forests of the Sundarbans, and exhibiting during the
                    annual inundation the appearance of an immense sea. At this time the rice fields
                    to the extent of many hundreds of square miles are submerged. The scene presents
                    to a European eye a panorama of singular novelty and interest; —rice fields
                    covered with water to a great depth; the <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit03newyrich/page/n580/mode/1up"

                    stupendous embankments, which restrain, without altogether preventing, the
                    excesses of the inundations; and peasants in all quarters going out to their
                    daily work with their cattle in canoes or on rafts. The navigable streams which
                    fall into the Ganges intersect the country in every direction, and afford great
                    facilities for internal communication. In many parts boats can approach by means
                    of lakes, rivulets, and water-courses, to the door of almost every cottage. The
                    lower region of the Ganges is the richest and most productive portion of Bengal,
                    abounding in valuable produce. Another mighty river by which Bengal is
                    intersected is the Brahmaputra, the source of whose remotest tributary is on the
                    opposite side of the same mountains which give rise to the Ganges. These two
                    rivers proceed in diverging courses until they are more than 1200 miles asunder;
                    and again approaching each other, intermix their waters before they reach the
                    ocean. The other principal rivers in Bengal are the Ghagra, Son, Gandak, Kusi,
                    Tistà; the Hιigli (Hoogly), formed by the junction of the Bhagirathi and
                    Jalangi; and farther to the west, the Damodar and Rüpnâ-râyan; and in the
                    south-west, the Mahânadï, or great river of Orissa. In a level country like
                    Bengal, where the soil is composed of yielding and loose materials, the courses
                    of the rivers are continually shifting, from the wearing away of their different
                    banks, or from the water being turned off by obstacles in its course into a
                    different channel. As this channel is gradually widened the old bed of the river
                    is left dry. The new channel into which the river flows is, of course, so much
                    land lost, while the old bed constitutes an accession to the adjacent estates.
                    Thus, one man’s property is diminished, while that of another is enlarged or
                    improved; and a distinct branch of jurisprudence has grown up, the particular
                    province of which is the definition and regulation of the alluvial rights alike
                    of private property and of the state.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">The People.</hi> —Within the provinces under the
                    Lieutenant-Governor of Bengal dwell a great congeries of peoples, of widely
                    diverse origin, speaking different languages, and representing far separated
                    eras of civilisation. They amounted in 1872 (including Assam, which then formed
                    part of Bengal), to 66,856,859 souls, or over a million and a quarter more than
                    the whole inhabitants of England and Wales, Sweden, Norway, Denmark (with
                    Jutland), Greece, and all the Ionian Islands, with the total white population,
                    Indians and Chinese, of the United States. The problem of government in Bengal,
                    however, is not one of numbers. It is intensified and infinitely complicated by
                    the fact, that while this vast population is ruled by a single head, it consists
                    of elements so dissimilar as to render it impracticable to place them under any
                    one system of administration. They exhibit every stage of human progress, and
                    every type of human enlightenment and superstition,—from the sceptical educated
                    classes, represented by the Hindu gentleman who distinguishes himself at a
                    London Inn of Court and harangues the British public in the Brighton Pavilion,
                    or from a metropolitan platform, to the hill chieftain, who lately sacrificed an
                    idiot on the top of a mountain to obtain a favourable decision in a Privy
                    Council appeal. A large section of the people belongs to the august Aryan race,
                    from which we ourselves descend, having a classical language more kindred to our
                    own than those of the Welsh or Scottish Highlanders. We address the Deity and
                    His earthly representatives, our father and mother, by words derived from roots
                    common to the Christian and the Hindu. Nor does the religious instinct assume a
                    wider variety of manifestations, or exhibit a more striking series of
                    metamorphoses, among the European than among the Indian branches of the race.
                    Theodore Parker and Comte are better known to the rising generation of Hindus in
                    Bengal than any Sanskrit theologian. On the same bench of a Calcutta college sit
                    youths trained up in the strictest theism, others indoctrinated in the mysteries
                    of the Hindu trinity and pantheon, with representatives of every link in the
                    chain of superstition—from the harmless offering of flowers before the family
                    god to the cruel rites of Kâli, whose altars in the most civilised districts of
                    Bengal, as lately as the famine of 1866, were stained with human blood. Indeed,
                    the very word Hindu is one of absolutely indeterminate meaning. The census
                    officers employ it as a convenient generic to include 42J millions of the
                    population of Bengal, comprising elements of transparently distinct ethnical
                    origin, and separated from each other by their language, customs’ and religious
                    rites. But Hinduism, understood even in this wide sense, represents only one of
                    many creeds and races found within BengaL The other great historical cultus,
                    which, during the last twelve centuries, did for the Semitic peoples what
                    Christianity accomplished among the European Aryans, has won to itself one-third
                    of the whole population of Bengal. The Muhammadans exceed 20∣ millions of souls;
                    and the Lieutenant-Governor of Bengal is, so far as numbers go, as great a
                    Musalmân power as the Sultân of Turkey him self. Amid the stupendous
                    catastrophes of the seasons, the river inundations, famines, tidal waves, and
                    cyclones of the lower provinces of Bengal, the religious instinct works with a
                    vitality unknown in European countries, where the forces of nature have long
                    yielded to the control of man. Until the British Government stepped in with its
                    police, and canals, and railroads, between the people and what they were
                    accustomed to consider the dealings of Providence, scarcely a year passed
                    without some terrible manifestation of the power and the wrath of God. Marhattâ
                    invasions from Central India, piratical devastations on the sea-board, banditti
                    who marched about the interior in bodies of 50,000 men, floods which drowned the
                    harvests of whole districts, and droughts in which a third of the population
                    starved to death, kept alive a sense of human powerlessness in the presence of
                    an Omnipotent fate with an intensity which the homilies of a stipendiary clergy
                    fail to awaken. Under the Muhammadans a pestilence turned the capital into a
                    silent wilderness, never again to be re-peopled. Under our own rule, it is
                    estimated that 10 millions perished within the Lower Provinces alone in the
                    famine, of 1769-70; and the first surveyor-general of Bengal entered on his maps
                    a tract of many hundreds of square miles as bare of villages, and “depopulated
                    by the Maghs.”</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Popular Religions.·</hi> —The people of Bengal, thus con·
                    stantly reminded by calamity of a mysterious Supreme Power, have always
                    exhibited deep earnestness in their own modes of propitiating it, and a singular
                    susceptibility to new forms of faith. Great tidal waves of religion have again
                    and again swept over the provinces within even the brief period of the Christian
                    era. Islâm was one of many reformed creeds offered to them, and several
                    circumstances combined to render its influence more widely spread and more
                    permanent than that of its rivals. It was the creed of the governing power; its
                    missionaries were men of zeal, who spoke to the popular heart; it brought the
                    good news of the unity of God and the equality of man to a priest-ridden and a
                    caste-ridden people. Above all, the initiatory rite made relapse impossible, and
                    rendered the convert and his posterity true believers for ever. Forcible
                    conversions are occasionally recorded, with several well-known instances of
                    Hindus becoming apostates from their ancient faith to purchase pardon for
                    crimes. Such cases, however, were few in number, and belonged to the higher
                    ranks. It would also appear that a Mughul adventurer now and then <pb break="no"

                    in fief. But it was not to such measures that Islâm owed its permanent success
                    in Bengal. It appealed to the people, and it derived the great mass of its
                    converts from among the poor. It brought in a truer conception of God, a nobler
                    ideal of the life of man, and offered to the teeming low castes of Bengal, who
                    had sat for ages despised and abject on the outermost pale of the Hindu
                    community, free entrance into a new social organisation. So far as local
                    tradition and the other fragmentary evidence which survives enable a modern
                    inquirer to judge, the creed of Muhammad was here spread neither by violence nor
                    by any ignoble means. It succeeded because it deserved to succeed. Nevertheless,
                    it has conspicuously failed to alter the permanent religious conceptions of the
                    people. The initiatory rite separated the Musalmâns from the rest of the Bengali
                    population, and elevated the heterogenous low-caste converts into a respectable
                    community of their own. But the proselytes brought their old superstitions with
                    them into their new faith. Their ancient rites and modes of religious thought
                    reasserted themselves with an intensity that could not be suppressed, until the
                    fierce white light of Semitic monotheism almost flickered out amid the
                    fuliginous exhalations of Hinduism. A local writer, speaking from personal
                    acquaintance with the Musalmân peasantry in the northern districts of Lower
                    Bengal, states that not one in ten can recite the brief and simple <hi
                    rend="italic">kalmd</hi> or creed, whose constant repetition is a matter of
                    almost unconscious habit with Muhammadans. He describes them as “a sect which
                    observes none of the ceremonies of its faith, which is ignorant of the simplest
                    formulas of its creed, which worships at the shrines of a rival religion, and
                    tenaciously adheres to practices which were denounced as the foulest
                    abominations by its founder.” Fifty years ago these sentences would have truly
                    described the Muhammadan peasantry, not only in the northern districts, but
                    throughout all Lower Bengal. In the cities, or amid the serene palace life of
                    the Musalmân nobility and their religious foundations, a few Maulvls of piety
                    and learning calmly carried on the routine of their faith. But the masses of the
                    rural Musalmâns had relapsed into something little better than a mongrel breed
                    of circumcised low-caste Hindus. Since then, one of those religious awakenings
                    so characteristic of India has passed over the Muhammadans of Bengal. Itinerant
                    preachers, generally from the north, have wandered from district to district,
                    calling on the people to return to the true faith, and denouncing God’s wrath on
                    the indifferent and unrepentant. A great body of the Bengali Musalmâns have
                    purged themselves of the taint of Hinduism, and shaken off the yoke of ancient
                    rural rites. The revival has had a threefold effect—religious, social, and
                    political. It has stimulated the religious instinct among an impressionable
                    people, and produced an earnest desire to cleanse the worship of God and His
                    prophet from idolatry. This stern rejection of ancient superstitions has widened
                    the gulf between the Muhammadans and the Hindus, Fifty years ago the Bengali
                    Musalmâns were simply a recognised caste, less widely separated from the lower
                    orders of the Hindus than the latter were from the Kulin Brâhmans. There were
                    certain essential points of difference, of a doctrinal sort, between the Hindu
                    and Muhammadan villager; but they had a great many rural customs and even
                    religious rites in common. The Muhammadan husbandman theoretically recognised
                    the one Semitic God; but in a country subject to floods, famines, the
                    devastations of banditti, and the ravages of wild beasts, he would have deemed
                    it a simple policy to have neglected the Hindu festivals in honour of Krishna
                    and Durgâ. The Bengali peasantry no longer look to their gods, but to the
                    officer in charge of the district, for protection; and when he fails them,
                    instead of offering expiatory sacrifices to Kâli, they petition Government, or
                    write violent letters to the vernacular press. The reformed Muhammadan
                    husbandmen now stand aloof from the village rites of the Hindus. They have
                    ceased to be merely a separate caste in the rural organisation, and have become
                    a distinct community, keeping as much apart from their nominal co-religionists
                    of the old unreformed faith as from the idolatrous Hindus. This social isolation
                    from the surrounding Hindus is the second effect of the Musalmân revival in
                    Bengal. Its third result is political, and affects ourselves. A Muhammadan like
                    a Christian revival strongly reasserts the duty of self-abnegation, and places a
                    multitude of devoted instruments at the disposal of any man who can convince
                    them that his schemes are identical with the will of God. But while a return to
                    the primitive teachings of Christ means a return to a religion of humanity and
                    love, a return to Muhammadan first principles means a return to a religion of
                    intolerance and aggression. The very essence of Musalmân Puritanism is
                    abhorrence of the Infidel. The whole conception of Islâm is that of a church
                    either actively militant or conclusively triumphant—forcibly converting the
                    world, or ruling with a rod of iron the stiff-necked unbeliever. The actual
                    state of India, where it is the Musalmâns who are in subjection, and the
                    unbeliever who governs them, is manifestly not in accord with the primitive
                    ideal; and many devout Muhammadans of the reformed faith have of late years
                    endeavoured, by plots and frontier attacks, to remove this anomaly. The majority
                    are not actively hostile, but they stand aloof from our institutions, and refuse
                    to coalesce with the system which the British Government has imposed on Bengal.
                    Their rebel camp beyond our frontier has forced us into three expeditions, which
                    has broken their military power; and the calm, inexorable action of the courts
                    has stamped out the chronic abetment of rebellion by Muhammadans within
                    Bengal.</p>
                <p>Besides the 42∣ millions aggregated under the name of Hindus, and the 20 j
                    millions of Musalmâns, a great residue remains. These consist, with the
                    exception of two very small bodies of Christians and Buddhists, of
                    semi-aboriginal and distinctly non-Aryan races. They number over 3j millions,
                    equalling almost exactly the population of Scotland. These peoples dwell, for
                    the most part, among the lofty ranges and primeval forests which wall in Bengal
                    on the north, east, and south-west, or upon the spurs and hilly outworks which
                    these mountain systems have thrown forward upon the lowlands. Some of them
                    represent the simplest types of social organisation known to modern research.
                    Their rudimentary communities are separated by religion, custom, and language
                    from each other and from the dwellers on the plains. Many of them, till lately,
                    looked upon war as the normal condition of human society, and on peace as an
                    unwelcome temporary break in their existence. For ages they have regarded the
                    lowland Hindus as their natural enemies, and in turn have been dealt with as
                    beasts of chase by the more civilised inhabitants of the valleys. Within the
                    present generation human sacrifice continued to be an obligatory rite among
                    them— a rite so deeply graven upon their village institutions, and so essential
                    to the annually recurring festivals of their religious year, as to seriously
                    occupy the Indian legislature, and to require a special agency to suppress it.
                    To this day instances of the detestable practice occur; and their extreme
                    jealousy of anything like foreign rule renders it the wisest policy to leave
                    them as much as possible under their own hamlet communities and petty chiefs.
                    Nevertheless, they form the most hopeful material yet discovered in Bengal for
                    the humanising influences of Christianity, and of that higher level of <pb

                    religion among the 66∣ millions of Bengal less marked than their different
                    capacities for self-government, and the varying degrees to which they can be
                    subjected to administrative control. They exhibit every stage of political
                    development, from the great municipality based upon English models, with powers
                    of self-taxation and a public debt of its own, down to the primitive
                    hill-hamlet, which pays no rent, acknowledges no higher tenure than the
                    aboriginal one of priority of occupation, clings to its ancient system of
                    nomadic husbandry, and is scarcely aware of any power superior to that of its
                    own tribe fathers. Including Assam, which up to February 1874 formed a part of
                    Bengal, the territories under the Lieutenant-Governor consist of five great
                    provinces, each of which speaks a language of its own, and has a separate
                    political and ethnical history. For administrative purposes these five provinces
                    are divided into 58 districts, of which 36 are regulation districts, whose
                    advanced state has rendered it expedient to place them under the complete system
                    of Anglo-Indian law; while 22 are non-regulation districts, in which this has
                    not yet been found practicable. The latter contain territories of three distinct
                    classes. The first of them consists, for the most part, of newly-acquired
                    territory, to which the general regulations have never been extended in their
                    entirety. The second, of tracts inhabited by primitive races specially exempted
                    from the operation of the regulations, to whom a less formal code of law is
                    better adapted. The third, of semi-independent or tributary states,
                    administered, or partly administered by British officers. The management of the
                    whole is firmly concentrated in a single man, the Lieutenant-Governor of Bengal,
                    who is answerable to the Government of India, and through it to Her Majesty’s
                    ministers and Parliament. His responsibility is divided by no executive council,
                    as in Madras or Bombay. All orders issue through his secretaries in his own
                    name; and although his policy is subject to the watchful control of the
                    Government of India, represented by the Viceroy, yet to the Lieutenant-Governor
                    personally belongs the reputation or disgrace of a successful or an inglorious
                    administration. In making laws for his people he is assisted by a legislative
                    council, composed partly of his principal officers, partly of leading members of
                    the non-official European and Native communities. In his legislative, as in his
                    executive functions, a power of control, amounting if needful to veto, rests
                    with the Government of India—a power which, from the English talent for
                    harmonious proconsular rule, is very seldom exercised. The administration is
                    conducted by a body of covenanted civilians, supplemented by a few military
                    officers in the less civilised districts, and aided by a staff of subordinate
                    officials. The civilians are appointed direct from England, enter into a bond
                    with the Secretary of State, and give securities for the discharge of their
                    highly responsible duties. In 1871 they numbered 260 men. The military officers
                    belong to the staff corps of the Bengal army, and are employed to the number of
                    52 in the backward tracts, which do not require so exact an administration, and
                    cannot afford to pay for the cost of it. The subordinate district officials are
                    appointed in Bengal by the Lieutenant-Governor, and consist chiefly of natives
                    and Anglo-Indians; but several departments, such as the educational, telegraph,
                    and public w orks, are now officered to a certain extent by gentlemen engaged
                    direct from England, The revenues raised in the territories under the
                    Lieutenant-Governor of Bengal amounted in 1871-72 to £17,687,072. Of this sum,
                    £16,713,636 accrued from the imperial taxes laid on by the Government of India,
                    and £973,436, from provincial, municipal, and rural taxation. The total cost of
                    government was only £6,338,968, leaving a surplus from this single one of the
                    Indian local governments of £11,348,104. It is scarcely too much to say, that so
                    long as the British pow er retains the port of Calcutta and the rich provinces
                    under the Lieutenant-Governor of Bengal, it would have sufficient revenue to
                    effect the reconquest of India if any accident should happen in the Panjàb or
                    north-west. The vast income which the Lower Provinces yield is not altogether
                    derived from their people. China pays an annual tribute of over 5 millions in
                    the shape of opium duty, and the inland parts of India contribute about a third
                    of a million to the customs of Bengal. Taking the total thus obtained from other
                    territories at a little over 6 millions, the population under the
                    Lieutenant-Governor of Bengal pays, in round figures, 11∣ millions a year, or
                    about 3s. 5d. a head. This includes imperial, provincial, municipal, and rural
                    taxation of every sort.</p>
                <p>The return which the Government gives for this light taxation may be briefly
                    summed up as f ollows :—It assures to the provinces absolute protection from
                    foreign enemies. The army employed in the territories under the
                    Lieutenant-Governor of Bengal numbers only 11,554 officersand men, exclusive of
                    a detachment of Madras Native infantry stationed at Cattack, in Orissa, and
                    numbering about 600 men—making a gross total of troops in Bengal of about 12,000
                    men. Of this small force 4662 are massed in Calcutta and its environs, with a
                    view to their proximity to the sea-board, rather than with an eye to the
                    internal requirements of the country; 6892 guard the frontiers, with detachments
                    on the line of railway, which now forms the great highway of Bengal; a
                    detachment of about 600 effective troops of the Madras Native infantry is
                    stationed in Orissa. Taking 12,000 as the total military force stationed in
                    Bengal, 3000 consist of European troops and English officers, and 9000 of Native
                    officers and men. The Government is a purely civil one, the existence of any
                    armed force being less realised than in the quietest county of England; and of
                    the 66∣ millions of people under the Lieutenant-Governor of Bengal, probably 40
                    millions go through life without once seeing the gleam of a bayonet or the face
                    of a soldier. Internal order and protection to person and property are secured
                    by a large army of police. This force consists of two elements: a regular
                    constabulary introduced by the English Government, numbering 33,913- men in
                    1871, and costing £584,059 to the state; and an indigenous police developed out
                    of the rural watch of the ancient Hindu commonwealth, numbering 184,645 men, and
                    costing £435,336 a year, paid by grants of land, or by the villages and
                    landowners. The total number of the Bengal police amounts therefore to 217,558,
                    or one man to every 307 of the population; and, excluding uninhabited swamps and
                    hill jungles, about one policeman to each square mile of area. This minute
                    supervision costs just over a million sterling a year, being at the rate of £4,
                    2s. ljd. per square mile, or 3⅛d. per head of the population.</p>
                <p>A great system of state education has been rapidly developed since 1854. In
                    1871-72 the Government and aided schools numbered 4383, with 7292 teachers, and
                    163,280 pupils,—maintained at a total cost of £194,716, of which Government
                    contributed rather under one-half, or £89,649. The total annual cost of
                    education per pupil was £1,12s. 9d., of which Government bore under one-half, or
                    15s.; the remainder being obtained from school fees, local subscriptions,
                    &amp;c. Besides these, there were 10,907 ascertained schools not receiving aid
                    from the state, with 11,026 teachers, and 169,917 pupils. In addition to these,
                    there is a vast number of petty hedge schools in Bengal, of which no statistics
                    exist. The total of state and <hi rend="italic">ascertained</hi><pb break="no"

                <p>The cheapness of labour, as compared with European countries, enables the
                    Government to perform its other functions at an equally small cost. It has
                    brought courts very near to the door of the peasant, and established a system of
                    registration by which proprietary rights and transfers are cheaply and
                    absolutely ascertained. A great department of public works has spread a network
                    of roads over the country, connecting Bengal by railways with other parts of
                    India, and, in districts which specially require it, is endeavouring to exercise
                    some degree of control over the rivers and the natural water-supply, on which
                    the safety of a tropical people depends. An organised system of emigration
                    watches over the movements of the landless classes, from the overcrowded or
                    unfertile districts of the weet to the rich under-populated territories on the
                    east, and to colonies beyond the seas. Charitable dispensaries and a
                    well-equipped medical department struggle to combat the diseases and epidemics
                    which from time immemorial have devastated the Delta, and place the operations
                    of European surgery within the reach of the poorest peasant. The whole cost of
                    civil administration for the 66∣ millions of Bengal amounts, as already stated,
                    to £6,338,968, or under Is. lid. per head. An unfettered vernacular press makes
                    known the views of the people to their rulers, and municipal institutions are
                    developing the ancient Hindu capacity for self-government from the village to
                    the municipal stage of human society.</p>

                <p>The word <hi rend="smallcaps">Bengal</hi> is derived from Sanskrit geography, and
                    applies strictly to the country stretching southwards from Bhâgalpur to the sea.
                    The ancient Banga formed one of the five outlying kingdoms of Aryan India, and
                    was practically conterminous with the Delta of Bengal. It derived its name,
                    according to the etymology of the Pandits, from a prince of the Mahâbhârata, to
                    whose portion it fell on the primitive partition of the country among the Lunar
                    race of Dehli. But a city called Bângâlâ, near Chittagong, which, although now
                    washed away, is supposed to have existed in the Muhammadan period, appears to
                    have given the name to the European world. The word Bângâlâ was first used by
                    the Musalmâns; and under their rule, like the Banga of old Sanskrit times, it
                    applied specifically to the Gangetic delta, although the latter conquests to the
                    east of the Brahmaputra were eventually included within it. In their
                    distribution of the country for fiscal purposes, it formed the central province
                    of a governorship, with Behar on the N.W., and Orissa on the S.W., jointly ruled
                    by one deputy of the Dehli emperor. Under the English the name has at different
                    periods borne very different significations. Francis Fernandez applies it to the
                    country from the extreme east of Chittagong to Point Palmyras in Orissa, with a
                    coast line which Purchas estimates at 600 miles, running inland for the same
                    distance, and watered by the Ganges. This territory would include the Muhammadan
                    province of Bengal, with parts of Behar and Orissa. The loose idea thus derived
                    from old voyagers became stereotyped in the archives of the East India Company.
                    All its north-eastern factories, from Balasor, on the Orissa coast, to Patnâ, in
                    the heart of Behar, belonged to the “Bengal Establishment,” and as our conquests
                    crept higher up the rivers, the term came to be applied to the whole of Northern
                    India. The Presidency of Bengal, in contradistinction to those of Madras and
                    Bombay, eventually included all the British territories north of the Central
                    Provinces, from the mouths of the Ganges and Brahmaputra to the Himâlayas and
                    the Panjâb. The term Bengal continues to be officially employed in this sense by
                    the military department of the Government of India. But during the last forty
                    years the tendency to a more exact order of civil administration has gradually
                    brought about a corresponding precision in the use of Indian geographical names.
                    The North-Western Provinces date their separate existence from 1831. Since that
                    year they stand forward under a name of their own as the North-Western
                    Provinces, in contradistinction to the Lower Provinces of Bengal. Later
                    annexations have added new territorial entities, and the northern Presidency is
                    now mapped out into four separate governments—the North-Western Provinces, Oudh,
                    Panjâb, and Lower Bengal. Three of the provinces of the present
                    Lieutenant-Governorship of Bengal—namely, Bengal proper, Behar, and
                    Orissa—consist of great river valleys; the fourth, Chhotâ or Chutiâ Nâgpur, is a
                    mountainous region which separates them from the Central India plateau. Orissa
                    embraces the rich deltas of the Mahânadi and the neighbouring rivers, bounded by
                    the Bay of Bengal on the S.E., and walled in on the N.W. by tributary hill
                    states. Proceeding westward, the province of Bengal proper stretches along the
                    coast from Orissa to British Burmah, and inland from the sea-board to the
                    Himâlayas. Its southern portion is formed by the united deltas of the Ganges and
                    Brahmaputra; its northern consists of the valleys of these great rivers and
                    their tributaries. Behar lies on the north-west of Bengal proper, and comprises
                    the higher valley of the Ganges, from the spot where it issues from the
                    territories of the Lieutenant-Governor of the North-Western Provinces. Between
                    Behar and Orissa, but stretching further westward and deep into the hill
                    country, lies the province of Chhotâ or Chutiâ Nâgpur.</p>

                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Principal Crops.</hi> —The chief products of the province
                    have been already enumerated. The great staple crop is rice, of which there are
                    three harvests in the year,—the <hi rend="italic">boro,</hi> or spring rice; <hi
                    rend="italic">aus,</hi> or autumn rice; and <hi rend="italic">dman,</hi> or
                    winter rice. Of these the last or winter rice is by far the most extensively
                    cultivated, and forms the great harvest of the year. The <hi rend="italic"
                    >ciman</hi> crop is grown on low land. In May, after the first fall of rain, a
                    nursery ground is ploughed three times, and the seed scattered broadcast. When
                    the seedlings make their appearance another field is prepared for transplanting.
                    By this time the rainy season has thoroughly set in, and the field is dammed up
                    so as to retain the water. It is then repeatedly ploughed until the water
                    becomes worked into the soil, and the whole reduced to thick mud. The young rice
                    is then taken from the nursery, and transplanted in rows about 9 inches apart.
                    If, by reason of the backwardness of the season, the nursery ground cannot be
                    prepared by the sowing-time in April or May, the âman rice is not transplanted
                    at alL In such a case the husbandmen in July or August soak the paddy in water
                    for one day to germinate, and plant the germinated seed not in a nursery plot,
                    but in the larger fields, which they would otherwise have used to transplant the
                    sprouts into. It is very seldom, however, that this procedure is found
                    necessary, <hi rend="italic">Aman</hi> rice is much more extensively cultivated
                    than <hi rend="italic">aus,</hi> and in favourable years is the most valuable
                    crop, but being sown in low lands is liable to be destroyed by excessive
                    rainfall. Harvest takes place in December or January. <hi rend="italic">Aus</hi>
                    rice is generally sown on high ground. The field is ploughed when the early
                    rains set in, ten or twelve times over, till the soil is reduced nearly to dust,
                    the seed being sown broadcast in April or May. As soon as the young plants reach
                    6 inches in height, the land is harrowed for the purpose of thinning the crop
                    and to clear it of weeds. The crop is harvested in August or September. <hi
                    rend="italic">Boro,</hi> or spring rice, is cultivated on low marshy land, being
                    sown in a nursery in October, transplanted a month later, and harvested in March
                    and April. An indigenous description of rice, called <hi rend="italic">uri</hi>
                    or <hi rend="italic">jaradhdn,</hi> grows in certain marshy tracts. The grain is
                    very small, and is gathered for consumption only by the poorest. No tabulated
                    statistics of cultivation exist; but in 1872-73 the quantity of rice exported
                    from Bengal to foreign ports amounted to 288,955 tons, of the value of
                    £1,685,170. Oil-seeds are very largely grown over the whole of Bengal,
                    particularly in the Behar and Assam districts. The principal oil-seeds are <hi
                    rend="italic">sarisha</hi> (mustard), <hi rend="italic">til</hi> (sesamum), and
                    <hi rend="italic">tisi, or masina</hi> (linseed). Exports of oil-seeds are
                    principally confined to linseed, of which 107,723 tons were exported in 1872-73,
                    of the value of £1,077,348. Jute <hi rend="italic">[pat</hi> or <hi
                    rend="italic">kosta)</hi> now forms a very important commercial staple of
                    Bengal. The cultivation of this crop has rapidly increased of late years. Its
                    principal seat of cultivation is Eastern Bengal, where the sup-perior varieties
                    are grown. The crop grows on either high or low lands, is sown in April, and cut
                    in August. In 1872 the area under jute cultivation in Bengal was estimated at
                    925,899 acres, and the yield at 496,703 tons. Jute exports from Bengal amounted
                    in 1872-73 to 353,097 tons, value £4,127,943. Jute manufactures, in the shape of
                    gunny bags, cloth, rope, &amp;c., were also exported to the value of £187,149.
                    Indigo cultivation and manufacture is principally carried on with European
                    capital. In Bengal proper the industry has languished of late years, and the
                    area under indigo cultivation greatly fallen off. In Behar, on the other hand,
                    the area of indigo lands has increased. The annual out-turn for all Bengalis
                    estimated at about 75,000 maunds, valued at nearly two millions sterling. Two
                    crops of indigo are raised in the year: one sown in April or May before the
                    setting in of the rains, and cut in August or September; the other sown in
                    October as the waters subside, and cut in the following July. The crop of 1872
                    was considerably above the average, the total exports amounting to 5962 tons, of
                    the value of £2,704,080. Tea cultivation is the other great industry carried on
                    by European capital. The cultivation is principally confined to Assam, which
                    province was recently separated from the Lieutenant-Governorship, and to the
                    northern Bengal district of Dârjiling. In the other localities in which tea Î3
                    grown, Chhotâ Nâgpur and Chittagong, cultivation is at present only carried on
                    on a small scale. Tea cultivation has enormously extended of late years, and the
                    gardens are, as a general rule, well filled with plants, highly cultivated and
                    carefully managed. Including Assam, the total area held under the Waste Land
                    Rules by persons connected with the tea industry, amounted in 1872 to 804,582
                    acres. Of this area 70,341 acres are returned as actually cultivated with tea,
                    but this is probably too low an estimate. The exports of tea in 1872-73 amounted
                    to 17,641,070 lb, valued at £1,567,561. Besides what is exported, there is an
                    increasing local consumption of Indian tea. In 1860 the total out-turn of tea
                    did not exceed one million lb. The cultivation of opium is a Government
                    monopoly; no person is allowed to grow the poppy except on account of the
                    Government. The manufacture is carried on at two separate agencies,—that of
                    Benares in the North-Western Provinces, of which the head station is at
                    Ghâzïpur; and that of Behar, with its head station at Patnâ. Annual engagements
                    are entered into by the cultivators, under a system of pecuniary advances, to
                    sow a certain quantity of land with poppy, and the whole produce in the form of
                    opium is delivered to Government at a fixed rate. The area under poppy
                    cultivation in the Behar agency, situated entirely within Bengal, in 1872,
                    amounted to 330,925 acres; in the Benares agency to 229,430 acres, total,
                    560,355 acres. The number of chests of opium sold at the Government sales in
                    Calcutta in 1872, was 42,675, the amount realised was £6,067,701, and the net
                    revenue, £4,259,376. The cultivation of the cinchona plant in Bengal was
                    introduced as an experiment about 1862, in a valley of the Himâlayas in
                    Dârjiling district, and the enterprise has already attained a point which
                    promises success. There are now (1874) about 2000 acres of Government cinchona
                    plantations in Dârjiling.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mineral Products.</hi> —A brief statement has already been
                    given of the principal minerals of Bengal. The coal mines of Râniganj, within
                    Bardwân district, however, demand somewhat more special notice. In this field
                    there were, in 1872, altogether 44 mines worked, of which 19 turn out more than
                    10,000 tons of coal per annum apiece. In the larger and better mines, coal is
                    raised by steam power from pits and galleries; and in the smaller mines or
                    workings, by hand labour from open quarries. In the Râniganj coal-field alone,
                    61 steam engines, withan aggregate of 867 horse-power, are at work. Only one
                    seam or set of seams of less thickness than 8J feet is worked, and the average
                    thickness of the seams at the Râniganj mines is about 15 or 16 feet. The pits
                    are mostly shallow, very few are more than 150 feet deep. The Bengal Coal
                    Company, with its mines at Râniganj and westwards, is able to raise from them
                    220,000 tons of coal annually. Salt manufacture was formerly a Government
                    monopoly, principally carried on along the sea-coast of Orissa and in Midnapur
                    district. An account of the manufacture of salt by means of evaporation by fire
                    is given in the account of <hi rend="smallcaps">Balasor</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >[q.v.)</hi> The process of manufacture by means of solar evaporation will be
                    described in the account of <hi rend="smallcaps">Purî</hi> district. Government
                    abandoned its monopoly of salt manufacture many years ago, and it is now carried
                    on by private parties on their own account, subject to a Government duty in
                    Bengal of 8s. 8d. a cwt. levied at the place of production. Salt duties <pb
                    break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit03newyrich/page/n586/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0903-0586-0569"/> vary in different parta of India, necessitating
                    the maintenance of expensive and cumbrous customs lines. This year (1874) an
                    attempt has been made towards the abolition of the Orissa customs line, by means
                    of a graduated scale of salt duty within Orissa, rising by degrees from the
                    Madras duty of 4s. lOd. a cwt. in the extreme south of the province, to the
                    Bengal duty of 8s. 8cL a cwt. in the extreme north. At the present day the
                    greater quantity of salt consumed in Bengal is imported by Liverpool ships from
                    the Cheshire mines. In 1872 the Bengal salt duty yielded a net revenue of
                    £2,610,286.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Trade.</hi> —No complete statistics of the internal trade of
                    Bengal exist. The Ganges, the Brahmaputra, and on a much smaller scale, the
                    Mahânadi in Orissa, with the Eastern Bengal Railway and the great East Indian
                    Line, form the main arteries of commerce. From these main channels a network of
                    minor streams, and a fairly adequate although not yet complete system of raised
                    roads, radiate to the remotest districts. The chief articles of internal traffic
                    are the vegetable and mineral productions enumerated above. The larger
                    transactions of commerce are conducted in the great cities, such as Calcutta and
                    Patna, and in a number of purely market centres, such as Nawâbganj and
                    Sirâjganj, which have recently grown up under British rule. The smaller
                    operations of trade are effected by means of village markets and countless <hi
                    rend="italic">hats</hi> or open air weekly bazârs in every district. The
                    external trade of Bengal is practically confined to Calcutta. There are about
                    ten other ports on the Bay of Bengal, the most important of which is the rice
                    port of Chittagong. But for general purposes the foreign and interportal
                    commerce of Calcutta may be taken to represent that of the province. In 1871-72
                    it stood thus: exports from Calcutta, £32,771,152; imports,£21,365,677; total,
                    £54,136,829. The chief articles of export are rice, opium, indigo, jute, tea,
                    oil-seeds, silk, cotton, and fibres. Chief imports, Manchester goods, woollens,
                    salt, coal, iron, metals, liquore, and oilmen’s stores.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">History.</hi> —The history of so large a province as Bengal
                    forms an integral part of the general history of India. (See <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">India.)</hi> The northern part, Behar, formed a powerful
                    kingdom in Sanskrit times, and its chief town, Patnâ, is identified as the <hi
                    rend="italic">Palibothra</hi> of the Greeks. The Delta or southern part of
                    Bengal lay beyond the ancient Sanskrit polity, and was governed by a number of
                    local kings belonging to a pre-Aryan stock. The Chinese travellers, Fa Hiang in
                    the 5th century, and Hiouen Thsang in the 7th century, found the Buddhist
                    religion prevailing throughout Bengal, but already in a fierce struggle with
                    Hinduism— a struggle which ended about the 9th or 10th century in the general
                    establishment of the latter faith. Until the end of the 12th century Hindu
                    princes governed in a number of petty principalities, till, in 1199, Muhammad
                    Bakhtiyar Khilji was appointed to lead the first Musalmân invasion into Bengal.
                    The Muhammadan conquest of Behar dates from 1200 A.D., and the new power
                    speedily spread southwards into the Delta. From about this date until 1340
                    Bengal was ruled by governors appointed by the Muhammadan emperors in the north.
                    From 1340 to 1539 its governors asserted a precarious independence, and
                    arrogated the position of sovereigns on their own account. From 1540 to 1576
                    Bengal passed under the rule of the Pathân or Afghân dynasty, which commonly
                    bears the name of Sher Shâh. On the overthrow of this house by the powerful arms
                    of Akbar, Bengal was incorporated into the Mughul empire, and administered by
                    governors appointed by the Dehli emperor, until the treaties of 1765, which
                    placed Bengal, Behar, and Orissa under the administration of the East India
                    Company. Until 1854 Bengal remained under the Governor-General of India as
                    governor, his place being supplied, during his absence in other parts of India,
                    by a deputy-governor from among the members of his council. By the statute 16
                    and 17 Vict. cap. 95, these two great offices were separated, and Bengal erected
                    into a Lieutenant-Governorship. The first lieutenant-governor was appointed in
                    1854, and the constitution of the Government of Bengal still continues on this
                    basis, except that the lieutenant-governor is now appointed subject to the
                    approval of Her Majesty. In a brief sketch like the present it is impossible to
                    attempt further historical details beyond a bare list of the successive rulers,
                    and the dates of their accession.</p>

                <p><hi rend="italic">English connection with Bengal.—</hi> The East India Company
                    formed its earliest settlements in Bengal in the first half of the 17th century.
                    These settlements were of a purely commercial character. In 1620 one of the
                    Company’s factors dates from PatnA; in 1624-36 the Company established itself,
                    by the favour of the emperor, on the ruins of the ancient Portuguese settlement
                    of Pippli, in the north of Orissa; in 1640-42 the patriotism of an English
                    surgeon, Mr Gabriel Boughton, obtained for us establishments at Balasor, also in
                    Orissa, and at Hùglf, some miles above Calcutta. The vexations and extortions to
                    which the Company’s early agents were subjected more than once almost induced
                    them to abandon the trade, and in 1677-78 they threatened to withdraw from
                    Bengal altogether. In 1685, the Bengal factors, driven to extremity by the
                    oppression of the Mughul governors, threw down the gauntlet; and after various
                    successes and hair-breadth escapes, purchased from the grandson of Aurangzeb in
                    1696, the villages which have since grown up into Calcutta, the metropolis of
                    India During the next fifty years the English had a long and hazardous struggle
                    alike with the Mughul governors of the province and the Marhattâ. armies which
                    invaded it. In 1756 this struggle culminated in the great outrage known as the
                    Black Hole of Calcutta, followed by Clive’s battle of Plassey and capture of
                    Calcutta, which avenged it. That battle, and the subsequent years of confused
                    fighting, established our military supremacy in Bengal, and procured the
                    treaties of 1765, by which the provinces of Bengal, Behar, and Orissa passed
                    under our administration. To Warren Hastings (1772-85) belongs the glory of
                    consolidating our power, and converting a military occupation into a stable
                    civil government. To another member of the civil service, John Shore, afterwards
                    Lord Teignmonth (1786-93), is due the formation of a regular system of
                    Anglo-Indian legislation. Acting through Lord Cornwallis, then Governor-General,
                    he ascertained and defined the rights of the landholders in the soil. These
                    landholders under the native system had, for the most part, started as
                    collectors of the revenues, and gradually acquired certain prescriptive rights
                    as quasi-proprietors of the estates entrusted to them by the Government. In 1793
                    Lord Cornwallis declared their rights perpetual, and made over the land of
                    Bengal to the previous quasi-proprietors or <hi rend="italic">zamind(irs,</hi>
                    on condition of the payment of a fixed land tax. This great piece of legislation
                    is known as the Permanent Settlement of the Land Revenue. But the Cornwallis
                    code, while defining the rights of the proprietors, failed to give adequate
                    recognition to the rights of the under-tenants and the cultivators. His
                    Regulations formally <hi rend="italic">reserved</hi> the latter class of rights,
                    but did not legally define them, or enable the husbandmen to enforce them in the
                    courts. After half a century of rural disquiet, the rights of the cultivators
                    were at length carefully formulated by Act X. of 1859. This measure, now known
                    as the land law of Bengal, effected for the rights of the under-holders and
                    cultivators what the Cornwallis code in 1793 had effected for those of the
                    superior landholders. The status of each class of person interested in the soil,
                    from the Government as suzerain, through the <hi rend="italic">zaminddrs</hi> or
                    superior landholders, the intermediate tenure-holders, and the undertenants,
                    down to the actual cultivator, is now clearly defined. The Act dates from the
                    first year after the transfer of India from the Company to the Crown; for,
                    meanwhile, the mutiny had burst out in 1857. The transactions of that revolt
                    chiefly took place in Northern India, and will be found under the article on the
                    North-Western Provinces; the uprising, although fierce and for a time perilous
                    to our supremacy, was quickly put down. In Bengal it began at <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Barrackpur</hi> (g.v.), was communicated to Dacca in Eastern
                    Bengal, and for a time raged in Behar, producing the memorable defence of the
                    billiard-room at Arrah by a handful of civilians and Sikhs,—one of the most
                    splendid pieces of gallantry in the history of the British arms. Since 1858,
                    when the country passed to the Crown, the history of Bengal has been one of
                    steady and peaceful progress. The two great lines of railway, the East Indian
                    and the Eastern Bengal, have been completed; and a third, the Northern Bengal
                    Railway, is now in progress. Trade has enormously expanded; new centres of
                    commerce have sprung up in spots which not long ago were -silent jungles; new
                    staples of trade, such as tea and jute, have rapidly attained importance; and
                    the coal-fields and iron ores are beginning to open up prospects of a new and
                    splendid era in the internal development of the country.</p>
                <p>The best account of Bengal as at present constituted is to be found in the
                    administration reports of Sir George Campbell, K. C.S.I., when
                    lieutenant-governor of Bengal, in 1871-72 and 1872-73. 'These reports are of an
                    official character, and embody the results of the census of 1872. Among
                    non-official works Colonel Dalton’s great volume on <hi rend="italic">The
                    Ethnology of Bengal</hi> holds a conspicuous place. 'This splendid quarto
                    condenses the personal observations of a long career spent among the people.
                    Stewart’s <hi rend="italic">History of Bengal,</hi> a work which was admirable
                    when first published, is now fifty years out of date, and stands in much need of
                    re-editiDg. The journals of the Asiatic societies in London, Paris, and
                    especially Calcutta, are still the great storehouses for original research. The
                    <hi rend="italic">Calcutta Review</hi> contains many valuable articles, which
                    the index to its first fifty volumes renders easily available. The present
                    writer has endeavoured in his <hi rend="italic">Annals of Rural Bengal,</hi> and
                    in his two volumes on <hi rend="italic">Orissa; or, the Vicissitudes of an
                    Indian Province under Native and British Rul⅛,</hi> to present to the general
                    reader the result of his researches with regard to this part of India. (W. W.
