                    distinguished English traveller, geographer, and Biblical critic, was born in
                    London, October 10, 1800. Educated for the pursuits of commerce, he afterwards
                    studied law for a short time at Lincoln’s Inn, but finally devoted himself to
                    the study of historical, geographical, and ethnographical subjects. The
                    first-fruits of his researches appeared in his work entitled <hi rend="italic"
                    >Origines Biblicoe,</hi><hi rend="italic">or Researches in Primeval
                    History,</hi> which was published in 1834. As an attempt to reconstruct the
                    early history of the human race from geological dates, it naturally raised a
                    storm of opposition on the part of those who felt it their duty to defend the
                    traditional readings of the book of Genesis. For about two years (1836 to 1838)
                    Dr Bekeheld the post of British Consul in Saxony. From that time till his death
                    his attention was devoted to geographical studies, chiefly of Africa and the
                    Nile Valley. Aided by private friends, he visited Abyssinia in connection with
                    the political mission under Major Harris, and explored districts which up to
                    that time had remained unknown to Europeans. The valuable results of this
                    journey, which occupied him from 1840 to 1843, he gave to the world in 1845 in
                    the work entitled <hi rend="italic">Abyssinia, a Statement of Facts,</hi> Ac.
                    Once again, after an interval of more than twenty years, he went to Abyssinia,
                    for the purpose of obtaining from King Theodore the release of Mr Rassam and
                    other British captives. In this he succeeded, but the king afterwards changed
                    his mind and continued to detain the prisoners. In 1848 he made an unsuccessful
                    attempt to explore the Upper Nile; his labour was repaid, however, by a large
                    amount of information about the countries which he traversed. The ardour with
                    which he pursued his chosen path was shown by his undertaking in his
                    seventy-fourth year a journey to Palestine, for the purpose of determining the
                    real position of Mount Sinai. He conceived that it was on the eastern side of
                    the Gulf of Akabah; and his exploration convinced him that his view was right.
                    It has not, however, commended itself to general acceptance. Dr Beke died at
                    Bromley, in Kent, July 31, 1874.</p>
                <p>Dr Beke’s writings are very numerous. Among the more important, besides those
                    already named, are— <hi rend="italic">An Essay on the Nile and its
                    Tributaries,</hi> 1847; <hi rend="italic">On the Sources of the Nile,</hi> 1849;
                    and <hi rend="italic">The British Captives in Abyssinia,</hi> 1865. He
                    contributed a large number of <hi rend="italic">Memoirs</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">Papers</hi> to the Royal Geographical Society, the British
                    Association, the Philological Society, the <hi rend="italic">Athcnoeum,</hi> the
                    <hi rend="italic">Archoeologia,</hi> the <hi rend="italic">Edinburgh New
                    Philosophical Journal,</hi> &amp;c., &amp;c. He was a fellow of the Royal
                    Geographical Society, and for his contributions to our knowledge of Abyssinia
                    received its gold medal, and also that of the Geographical Society of France.
                    For his <hi rend="italic">Origines Biblicoe</hi> the degree of Ph.D. was
                    conferred on him by the University of Tiibingen. He was also a fellow of the
                    Society of Antiquaries. In 1870 he received the grant of a pension on the civil
                    list.</p>
