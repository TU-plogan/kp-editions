                <p><label type="entry">BALLADS</label>. The word ballad is derived from the Old
                    French <hi rend="italic">bailer,</hi> to dance, and originally meant a song sung
                    to the rhythmic movement of a dancing chorufc. Later, the word became the
                    technical term for a particular form of old fashioned French poetry, remarkable
                    for its involved and recurring rhymes. “Laisse moi aux Jeux Floraux de Toulouse
                    toutes ces vieux poésies Francoises comme <hi rend="italic">ballades,”</hi> says
                    Joachim du Bellay in 1550; and Philaminte, the lady pedant of Molière’s <hi
                        rend="italic">Femmes Scavantes,</hi> observes—</p>
                <lg>
                    <l> “La ballade, à mon gout, est une chose fade, </l>
                    <l> Ce n’en est plus la mode, elle sent son vieux temps.” </l>
                </lg>
                <p>In England the term has usually been applied to any simple tale, told in simple
                    verse, though attempts have been made to confine it to the subject of this
                    paper, namely, Popular Songs. By popular songs we understand what the Germans
                    call <hi rend="italic">Volks-lieder,</hi> that is, songs composed by the people,
                    for the people, handed down by oral tradition, and in style, taste, and even
                    incident, common to the people in all European countries. The beauty of these
                    purely popular ballads, their directness and freshness, has made them admired
                    even by the artificial critics of the most artificial periods in literature.
                    Thus Sir Philip Sydney confesses that the ballad of <hi rend="italic">Chevy
                        Chase,</hi> when chanted by “a blind crowder,” stirred his blood like the
                    sound of trumpet. Addison devoted two articles in the <hi rend="italic"
                        >Spectator</hi> to a critique of the same poem. Montaigne praised the <hi
                        rend="italic">naivété</hi> of the village carols; and Malherbe preferred a
                    rustic <hi rend="italic">Chansonette</hi> to all the poems of Ronsard. These,
                    however, are rare instances of the taste for popular poetry, and though the
                    Danish ballads were collected and printed in the middle of the 16th century, and
                    some Scotch collections date from the beginning of the 18th, it was.not till the
                    publication of Allan Ramsay’s <hi rend="italic">Evergreen</hi> and <hi
                        rend="italic">Tea Table Miscellany,</hi> and of Bishop Percy’s <hi
                        rend="italic">Reliques,</hi> that a serious effort was made to recover
                    Scotch and English folk-songs from the recitation of the old people who still
                    knew them by heart. At the time when Percy was editing the <hi rend="italic"
                        >Reliques,</hi> Madame de Chénier, the mother of the celebrated French poet
                    of that name, composed an essay on the ballads of her native land, modem Greece;
                    and later, Herder and Grimm and Goethe, in Germany, did for the songs of their
                    country what Scott did for those of Liddesdale and the Forest. It was fortunate,
                    perhaps, for poetry, though unlucky for the scientific study of the ballads,
                    that they were mainly regarded from the literary point of view. The influence of
                    their artless melody and straightforward diction may be felt in the lyrics of
                    Goethe and of Coleridge, of Wordsworth, of Heine, and of André Chénier. Chénier,
                    in the most affected age even of French poetry, translated some of the Romaic
                    ballads; one, as it chanced, being identical with that which Shakspeare borrowed
                    from some English reciter, and put into the mouth of the mad Ophelia. The beauty
                    of the ballads and the interest they excited led to numerous forgeries. It is
                    probable that Hogg was as great a culprit in Scotland as Prosper Mérimée with
                    his <hi rend="italic">Guzla,</hi> or collection of Servian imitations, m France.
                    Editors could not resist the temptation to interpolate, to restore, and to
                    improve the fragments that came in their way. The Marquis de la Villemarqué, who
                    first drew attention to the ballads of Brittany, is not wholly free from this
                    fault. Thus a very general scepticism was awakened, and when questions came to
                    be asked as to the date and authorship of the Scottish traditional ballads, it
                    is scarcely to be wondered at that Dr Chambers attributed most of them to the
                    accomplished Lady Wardlaw, who lived in the middle of the 18th century.</p>
                <p>The vexed and dull controversy as to the origin of Scottish folk-songs was due to
                    ignorance of the comparative method, and of the ballad literature of Europe in
                    general. The result of the discussion was to leave a vague impression that our
                    native ballads were perhaps as old as the time of Dunbar, and were the
                    production of a class of professional minstrels. These minstrels are a
                    stumbling-block in the way of the student of the growth of ballads. The domestic
                    annals of Scotland show that her kings used to keep courtbards, and also that
                    strollers, <hi rend="italic">jongleurs,</hi> as they were called, went about
                    singing at the doors of farm-houses and in the streets of towns. Here were two
                    sets of minstrels who had apparently left no poetry; and, on the other side,
                    there was a number of ballads that claimed no author. It was the easiest and
                    most satisfactory inference that the courtly minstrels made the verses, which
                    the wandering crowders imitated or corrupted. But this theory fails to account,
                    among other things, for the universal sameness of tone, of incident, of legend,
                    of primitive poetical formulae, which the Scotch ballad possesses, in common
                    with the ballads of Greece, of France, of Provence, of Portugal, of Denmark, and
                    of Italy. The object, therefore, of this article is to prove that what has long
                    been acknowledged of nursery tales, of what the Germans call <hi rend="italic"
                        >Märchen,</hi> namely, that they are the immemorial inheritance at least of
                    all European peoples, is true also of ballads. The main incidents and plots of
                    the fairy tales of Celts, and Germans, and Slavonic and Indian peoples, their
                    unknown antiquity and mysterious origin, are universally recognised. No one any
                    longer attributes them to this or that author, or to this or that date. The
                    attempt to find date or author for a genuine popular song is as futile as a
                    similar search in the case of a <hi rend="italic">Märchen.</hi> It is to be
                    asked, then, whether what is confessedly true of folk-tales,—of such stories as
                    the <hi rend="italic">Sleeping Beauty</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                        >Cinderella,—</hi> is true also of folk-songs. Are they, or have they been,
                    as universally sung as the fairy tales have been narrated? Do they, too, bear
                    traces of the survival of primitive creeds and primitive forms of consciousness
                    and of imagination? Are they, like <hi rend="italic">Märchen,</hi> for the most
                    part, little influenced by the higher religions, Christian or polytheistic? Do
                    they turn, as <hi rend="italic">Märchen</hi> do, on the same incidents, repeat
                    the same stories, employ the same machinery of talking birds and beasts? Lastly,
                    are any specimens of ballad literature capable of being traced back to extreme
                    antiquity? It appears that all these questions may be answered in the
                    affirmative; that the great age and universal diffusion of the ballad may be
                    proved; and that its birth, from the lips and heart of the people, may be
                    contrasted with the origin of an artistic poetry in the demand of an aristocracy
                    for a separate epic literature, destined to be its own possession, and to be the
                    first development of a poetry of personality,—a record of <hi rend="italic"
                        >individual</hi> passions and emotions. After bringing forward examples of
                    the identity of features in European ballad poetry, we shall proceed to show
                    that they all sprang from the same primitive custom of dance, accompanied by
                    improvised song, which still exists in Greece and Russia, and even in valleys of
                    the Pyrenees.</p>
                <p>There can scarcely be a better guide in the examination <pb break="no"
                        facs="ia:encyclopediabrit03newyrich/page/n299/mode/1up"
                        xml:id="kp-eb0903-0299-0284"/> of the <hi rend="italic">notes</hi> or marks
                    of popular poetry than the instructions which Μ. Ampère gave to the committee
                    appointed in 1852-53 to search for the remains of ballads in France. Μ. Ampère
                    bade the collectors look for the following characteristics :—“The use of
                    assonance in place of rhyme, the brusque character of the recital, the textual
                    repetition, as in Homer, of the speeches of the persons, the constant use of
                    certain numbers,—as three and seven,—and the representation of the commonest
                    objects of every-day life as being made of gold and silver.” Μ. Ampère might
                    have added that French ballads would probably employ a “birdchorus,” the use of
                    talking-birds as messengers; that they would repeat the plots current in other
                    countries, and display the same non-Christian idea of death and of the future
                    world, the same ghostly superstitions and stories of metamorphosis, and the same
                    belief in elves and fairies, as are found in the ballads of Greece, of Provence,
                    of Brittany, Denmark, and Scotland. We shall now examine these supposed common
                    notes of all genuine popular song, supplying a few out of the many instances of
                    curious identity. As to brusqueness of recital, and the use of assonance instead
                    of rhyme, as well as the aid to memory given by reproducing speeches verbally,
                    these are almost unavoidable in all simple poetry preserved by oral tradition.
                    In the matter of recurring numbers, we have the eternal—</p>
                <lg>
                    <l> “Trois belles filles </l>
                    <l> L’y en a’z une plus bello que le jour,” </l>
                </lg>
                <p>who appear in old French ballads, as well as the “Three Sailors,” whose
                    adventures are related in the Lithuanian and Provençal originals of Mr
                    Thackeray’s <hi rend="italic">Little Billee.</hi> Then there is “the league, the
                    league, the league, but barely three,” of Scotch ballads; and the <hi
                        rend="italic">τριά πονλακιά,</hi> three golden birds, which sing the prelude
                    to Greek folksongs, and so on. A more curious note of primitive poetry is the
                    lavish and reckless use of gold and silver. Μ. Tozer, in his account of ballads
                    in the <hi rend="italic">Highlands of Turkey,</hi> remarks on this fact, and
                    attributes it to Eastern influences. But the horses’ shoes of silver, the knives
                    of fine gold, the talking “birds with gold on their wings,” as in Aristophanes,
                    are common to all folk-song. Everything almost is gold in the <hi rend="italic"
                        >Kalevala,</hi> an epic formed by putting into juxtaposition all the popular
                    songs of Finland. Gold is used as freely in the ballads, real or spurious, which
                    Μ. Verkovitch has had collected in the wilds of Mount Rhodope. The captain in
                    the French song is as lavish in his treatment of his runaway bride,—</p>
                <lg>
                    <l> “Son amant Γhabille, </l>
                    <l> Tout en or et argent;" </l>
                </lg>
                <p>and the rustic in a song from Poitou talks of his <hi rend="italic"
                        >faucille</hi><hi rend="italic">d'or,</hi> just as a variant of Hugh of
                    Lincoln introduces gold chairs and tables. Again, when the lover, in a ballad
                    common to France and to Scotland, cuts the winding sheet from about his living
                    bride—“il tira ses ciseaux d’or fin.” If the horses of the Klephts in Romaic
                    ballads are gold shod, the steed in <hi rend="italic">Willie's Lady</hi> is no
                    less splendidly accoutred,—</p>
                <lg>
                    <l> “Silver shod before, </l>
                    <l> And gowden shod behind.” </l>
                </lg>
                <p>Readers of Homer, and of the Chanson de Roland, must have observed the same
                    primitive luxury of gold in these early epics.</p>
                <p>Next as to talking-birds. These are not so common as in <hi rend="italic"
                        >Märchen,</hi> but still are very general, and cause no surprise to their
                    human listeners. The omniscient popinjay, who “up and spoke” in the Border
                    minstrelsy, is of the same family of birds as those that, according to Talvj,
                    pervade Servian song; as the τριά <hi rend="italic">πονλακιά</hi> which
                    introduce the story in the Romaic ballads; as the wise birds whose speech is
                    still understood by exceptionally gifted Zulus; as the wicked dove that whispers
                    temptation in the sweet French folk-song; as the “bird that came out of a bush,
                    on water for to dine,” in the <hi rend="italic">Water o’Wearies Well.</hi></p>
                <p>In the matter of identity of plot and incident in the ballads of various lands,
                    it is to be regretted that no such comparative tablée exist as Von Hahn tried,
                    not very exhaustively,* to make of the “story-roots” of <hi rend="italic"
                        >Märchen.</hi> A common plot is the story of the faithful leman, whose lord
                    brings home “a braw new bride,” and who recovers his affection at the eleventh
                    hour. In Scotland this is the ballad of Lord Thomas, and Fair Annie; in Danish
                    it is Skiaen Anna. It occurs twice in Μ. Fauriel⅛ collection of Romaic songs.
                    Again, there is the familiar ballad about a girl who pretends to be dead, that
                    she may be borne on bier to meet her lover. This occurs not only in Scotland,
                    but in the popular songs of Provence (collected by Damase Arbaud) and in those
                    of Metz (Puymaigre), and in both countries an incongruous sequel tells how the
                    lover tried to murder his bride, and how she was too cunning, and drowned him.
                    Another familiar feature is the bush and briar, or the two rose trees, which
                    meet and plait over the graves of unhappy lovers, so that all passers-by see
                    them, and say in the Provençal,—</p>
                <lg>
                    <l> “Diou ague Γamo </l>
                    <l> Des paures amourous.” </l>
                </lg>
                <p>Another example of a very wide-spread theme brings us to the ideas of the state
                    of the dead revealed in folk-songs. <hi rend="italic">The Night Journey,</hi> in
                    Μ. FaurieΓs Romaic collection, tells how a dead brother, wakened from his sleep
                    of death by the longing of love, bore his living sister on his saddlebow, in one
                    night, from Baghdad to Constantinople. In Scotland this is the story of Proud
                    Lady Margaret; in Germany it is the song which Bürger converted into Lenore; in
                    Denmark it is Aagé und Elsé; in Brittany the dead foster-brother carries his
                    sister to the apple close of the Celtic paradise <hi rend="italic"
                        >(Barzaz</hi><hi rend="italic">Breit').</hi> Only in Brittany do the
                    sad-hearted people think of the land of death as an island of Avalon, with the
                    eternal sunset lingering behind the flowering apple trees, and gleaming on the
                    fountain of forgetfulness. In Scotland the channering worm doth chide even the
                    souls that come from where, “beside the gate of Paradise, the birk grows fair
                    enough.” The Romaic idea of the place of the dead, the garden of Charon, whence
                    “neither in spring or summer, nor when grapes are gleaned in autumn, can warrior
                    or maiden escape,” is likewise pre-Christian. In Provençal, Danish, and
                    Yorkshire folk-song, the cries of children ill-treated by a cruel step-mother
                    awaken the departed mother,—</p>
                <lg>
                    <l> “ ’Twas cold at night and the bairnies graτ, </l>
                    <l> The mother below the mouls heard that.” </l>
                </lg>
                <p>She reappears in her old home, and henceforth, “when dogs howl in the night, the
                    step-mother trembles, and is kind to the children.” To this identity of
                    superstition we may add the lese tangible fact of identity of tone. The ballads
                    of Klephtic exploits in Greece match the Border songs of Dick of the Law and
                    Kinmont Willie. The same simple delight of living animates the short Greek <hi
                        rend="italic">Scholia</hi> and their counterparts in France. Everywhere in
                    these happier climes, as in Southern Italy, there are snatches of popular verse
                    that make but one song of rose trees, and apple blossom, and the nightingale
                    that sings for maidens loverless,—</p>
                <lg>
                    <l> “Il ne chante pas pour moi, </l>
                    <l> Je’n ai un, Dieu merci,” </l>
                </lg>
                <p>says the gay French refrain.</p>
                <p>It would not be difficult to multiply instances of resemblance between the
                    different folk-songs of Europe; but enough has, perhaps, been said to support
                    the position that they are popular and primitive in the same sense as <hi
                        rend="italic">Märchen.</hi> They date from times, and are composed by <pb

                        xml:id="kp-eb0903-0300-0285"/> peoples who find, in a natural improvisation,
                    a natural utterance of modulated and rhythmic speech, the appropriate relief of
                    their emotions, in moments of high-wrought feeling or on solemn occasions.
                    “Poesie” (as Puttenham well says in his <hi rend="italic">Art of English</hi><hi
                        rend="italic">Poesie,</hi> 1589) “is more ancient than the artificiali of
                    the Greeks and Latines, and used of the savage and uncivill, who were before all
                    science and civilitie. This is proved by certificate of merchants and
                    travellers, who by late navigations have surveyed the whole world, and
                    discovered large countries, and wild people strange and savage, affirming that
                    the American, the Perusine, and the very Canniball do sing and also say their
                    highest and holiest matters in certain riming versicles.” In the same way
                    Aristotle, discoursing of the origin of poetry, says <hi rend="italic"
                        >(Poet.,</hi> c. iv. ), <hi rend="italic">iγεwησav</hi><hi rend="italic"
                        >την</hi><hi rend="italic">πoιησt,v</hi><hi rend="italic">ίκ των
                        άντοσχεδιασμάτων.</hi> Μ. de la Villemarqué in Brittany, Μ. Pitré in Italy,
                    Herr Ulrich in Greece, have described the process of improvisation, how it grows
                    out of the custom of dancing in large bands and accompanying the figure of the
                    dance with song. “If the people,” says Μ. Pitré, “find out who is the composer
                    of a <hi rend="italic">canzone,</hi> they will not sing it.” Now in those lands
                    where a blithe peasant life still exists with its dances, like the <hi
                        rend="italic">holos</hi> of Russia, we find ballads identical in many
                    respects with those which have died out of oral tradition in these islands. It
                    is natural to conclude that our ballads too were first improvised, and
                    circulated in rustic dances. We learn from Μ. Bujeaud and Μ. de Puymaigre in
                    France, that all ballads there have their air or tune, and that every dance has
                    its own words, for if a new dance comes in, perhaps a fashionable one from
                    Paris, words are fitted to it. Is there any trace of such an operatic, lyrical,
                    dancing peasantry in austere Scotland 1 We find it in Gawin Douglas’s account
                    of—</p>
                <lg>
                    <l> “Sic as we clepe wenches and damosels, </l>
                    <l> In gersy greens, wandering by spring wells, </l>
                    <l> Of bloomed branches, and flowers white and red, </l>
                    <l> Plettand their lusty chaplets for their head, </l>
                    <l> Some sang ring-sangs, dances, ledes, and rounds." </l>
                </lg>
                <p>Now, ring-sangs are ballads, dancing songs; and <hi rend="italic">Young
                        Tamlane,</hi> for instance, was doubtless once danced to, as we know it
                    possessed an appropriate air. Again, Fabyan, the chronicler (quoted by Ritson)
                    says that the song of triumph over Edward II., “was after many days sung <hi
                        rend="italic">in dances,</hi> to the carols of the maidens and minstrels of
                    Scotland.” We might quote the <hi rend="italic">Complaynt of Scotland</hi> to
                    the same effect. “The shepherds, and their wyvis sang mony other melodi sangs, .
                    . . than efter this sueit celestial harmony, tha began to dance in ane ring.” It
                    is natural to conjecture that, if we find identical ballads in Scotland, and in
                    Greece, and Italy, and traces of identical customs,—customs crushed by the
                    Reformation, by Puritanism, by modern so-called civilisation,—the ballads sprang
                    out of the institution of dances, as they still do in warmer and pleasanter
                    climates. It may be supposed that legends on which the ballads are composed,
                    being found as they are from the White Sea to Cape Matapan, are part of the
                    stock of primitive folk-lore. Thus we have an immemorial antiquity for the
                    legends, and for the lyrical choruses in which their musical rendering was
                    improvised. We are still at a loss to discover the possibly mythological germs
                    of the legends; but, at all events, genuine ballads may be claimed as distinctly
                    popular, and, so to speak, impersonal in matter and in origin. It would be easy
                    to show that survivals out of this stage of inartistic lyric poetry linger in
                    the early epic poetry of Homer and of the French <hi rend="italic">épopées,</hi>
                    and that the Greek drama sprang from the sacred choruses of village vintagers.
                    In the great early epics, as in popular ballads, there is the same directness
                    and simplicity, the same use of recurring epithets, the “green grass,” the “salt
                    sea,” the “shadowy hills,” the same repetition of speeches, and something of the
                    same barbaric profusion in the use of gold and silver. But these resemblances
                    must not lead us into the mistake of supposing Homer to be a collection of
                    ballads, or that he can be properly translated into ballad metre. The <hi
                        rend="italic">Iliad</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">Odyssey</hi> are the
                    highest form of an artistic epic, not composed by piecing together ballads, but
                    developed by a long series of noble doiδoι, for the benefit of the great houses
                    which entertain them, out of the method and materials of popular song. Ballads
                    sprang from the very heart of the people, and flit from age to age, from lip to
                    lip of shepherds, peasants, nurses, of all the class that continues nearest to
                    the state of natural men. They make music with the plash of the fisherman’s oars
                    and the hum of the spinning-wheel, and keep time with the step of the ploughman
                    as he drives his team. The country seems to have aided man in their making; the
                    bird’s note rings in them, the tree has lent her whispers, the stream its
                    murmur, the village-bell its tinkling tune. The whole soul of the peasant class
                    breathes in their burdens, as the great sea resounds in the shells cast up on
                    the shores. Ballads are a voice from secret places, from silent peoples, and old
                    times long dead; and as such they stir us in a strangely intimate fashion to
                    which artistic verse can never attain.</p>
