                <p><label type="entry">BASTARD</label> is a person born out of lawful wedlock, <hi
                    rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> whose parents have not been married previous to his
                    birth. The rules by which legitimacy is determined vary chiefly as to the effect
                    to be assigned to the subsequent marriage of the bastard’s parents. The law of
                    Scotland, and of most Continental countries, following the rules of the civil
                    and canon law, legitimizes the bastard whose parents afterwards marry. The same
                    principle was at one time advocated by the clergy in England, but summarily
                    rejected by the famous statute of Merton (20 Hen. III. c. 9). The English law,
                    however, takes no account of the interval between the marriage and the birth;
                    provided the birth happens after the marriage, the offspring is legitimate. The
                    presumption of law is in favour of the legitimacy of the child of a married
                    woman, and at one time it was so strong that Lord Coke held that “if the husband
                    be within the four seas, <hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> within the jurisdiction of
                    the king of England, and the wife hath issue, no proof shall be admitted to
                    prove the child a bastard unless the husband hath an apparent impossibility of
                    procreation.” It is now settled, however, that the presumption of legitimacy may
                    be rebutted by evidence showing non-access on the part of the husband, or any
                    other circumstance showing that the husband could not in the course of nature
                    have been the father of his wife’s child. If the husband had access, or the
                    access be not clearly negatived, and others at the same time were carrying on a
                    criminal intercourse with the wife, a child born under such circumstances is
                    legitimate. If the husband had access intercourse must be presumed, unless there
                    ’ is irresistible evidence to the contrary. Neither husband nor wife will be
                    permitted to prove the non-access directly or indirectly. Children born after a
                    divorce <hi rend="italic">a</hi><hi rend="italic">mensa</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >et</hi><hi rend="italic">thoro</hi> will be presumed to be bastards unless
                    access be proved. A child born so long after the death of a husband that he
                    could not in the ordinary course of nature have been its father is illegitimate.
                    The period of gestation is presumed to be <hi rend="italic">about</hi> nine
                    calendar months; and if there were any circumstances from which an unusually
                    long or short period of gestation could be inferred, special medical testimony
                    would be required. A marriage between persons within the prohibited degrees of
                    affinity was before 1835 not void, but only voidable, and the ecclesiastical
                    courts were restrained from bastardizing the issue after the death of either of
                    the parents. Lord Lyndhurst’s Act declared all such existing marriages valid,
                    but all future marriages between persons within the prohibited degrees of
                    consanguinity or affinity were made null and void, and the issue illegitimate.
                    (See <hi rend="smallcaps">Marriage.)</hi> By 21 and 22 Vict. c. 93, application
                    may be madeto the Court of Divorce and Matrimonial Causes (in Scotland to the
                    Court of Session by action of declarator) for a declaration of legitimacy and of
                    the validity of a marriage.</p>
                <p>The law relating to the maintenance of bastard children is governed by a
                    considerable number of statutes passed during the present reign, the Acts of
                    1872 and 1873 being the last. The mother of a bastard may summon the putative
                    father to Petty Sessions within twelve months of the birth (or at any later time
                    if he is proved to have contributed to the child’s support within twelve months
                    after the birth), and the justices, after hearing evidence on both sides, may,
                    if the mother’s evidence be corroborated in some material particular, adjudge
                    the man to be the putative father of the child, and order him to pay a sum not
                    exceeding five shillings a week for its maintenance, together with a sum for
                    expenses incidental to the birth. No such order is to be valid after the child
                    is dead or reaches the age of thirteen, but the justices may in the order direct
                    the payments to be continued until the child is sixteen years of age. The
                    putative father may appeal to Quarter Sessions. Should the child afterwards
                    become chargeable to the parish, the sum due by the father may be received by
                    the parish officer. When a bastard child, whose mother has not obtained an
                    order, becomes chargeable to the parish, the guardians may proceed against the
                    putative father for a contribution. The mother of an illegitimate child is
                    entitled to its custody in preference to the father.</p>
                <p>The rights of a bastard are only such as he can acquire; for civilly he can <hi
                    rend="italic">inherit</hi> nothing, being looked upon as the son of nobody, and
                    sometimes called <hi rend="italic">filius nullius,</hi> sometimes <hi
                    rend="italic">filius populi.</hi> This, however, does not hold as to ‘moral
                    purposes, <hi rend="italic">e.g.,</hi> he cannot marry his mother or bastard
                    sister. Yet he may gain a surname by reputation though he has none by
                    inheritance, and may even be made legitimate and capable of inheriting by the
                    transcendent power of an Act of Parliament. All other children have their
                    primary settlement in their father’s parish; but a bastard has his in the parish
                    where he was born, unless <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit03newyrich/page/n442/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0903-0442-0427"/> such birth has been procured by fraud, or has
                    happened under an order of removal, in a state of vagrancy, in the house of
                    correction, or under certificate; for in law he has no father. The incapacities
                    attaching to a bastard consist principally in this, that he cannot be heir to
                    any one; for being <hi rend="italic">nullius</hi><hi rend="italic">filius,</hi>
                    he is therefore of kin to nobody, and has no ancestor from whom an inheritable
                    blood can be derived. Therefore, if there be no other claimant upon an
                    inheritance than such illegitimate child, it escheats to the lord. And as
                    bastards cannot be heirs themselves, so neither can they have any heirs but
                    those of their own bodies; for as all collateral kindred consists in being
                    derived from the same common ancestor, and as a bastard has no legal ancestor,
                    he can have no collateral kindred, and consequently no legal heirs, except such
                    as claim by a lineal descent from himself. And hence, if a bastard purchase
                    land, and die seised therefor without issue and intestate, the land escheats to
                    the lord of the fee. Originally a bastard was deemed incapable of holy orders,
                    and disqualified by the fact of his birth from holding any dignity in the
                    church; but this doctrine is now obsolete, and in all other respects there is no
                    distinction between a bastard and another man. By the law of Scotland a bastard
                    is not only excluded from his father’s succession, because the law knows no
                    father who is not marked out by marriage; and from all heritable succession,
                    whether by the father or mother, because he cannot be pronounced lawful heir by
                    the inquest in terms of the brief; but also from the movable succession of his
                    mother, because he is not her lawful child, and legitimacy is implied in all
                    succession deferred by the law. But a bastard, although he cannot succeed J⅛re
                    <hi rend="italic">sanguinis,</hi> may succeed by destination, where he is
                    specially called to the succession by entail or testament. In Scotland, as in
                    England, a bastard can have no legal heirs except those of his own body; and
                    hence, failing his lawful issue, the king succeeds to him as last heir. In
                    Scotland bastards may be legitimized in two ways; either by the subsequent
                    intermarriage of the mother of the child with the father, as already mentioned,
                    or by letters of legitimization from the sovereign. With respect to the last,
                    however, it is to be observed, that letters of legitimization, be their clauses
                    ever so strong, cannot enable the bastard to succeed to his natural father; for
                    the king cannot, by any prerogative, cut off the private right of third parties.
                    But, by a special clause in the letters of legitimation, he may renounce his
                    right to the bastard’s succession, failing descendants, in favour of him who
                    would have been the bastard’s heir had he been born in lawful wedlock, such
                    renunciation encroaching upon no right competent to any third party. Formerly
                    bastards in Scotland without issue of their own could not make a will, but this
                    disability was removed by G Will. IV. c. 22. If bastards or other persons
                    without kindred die intestate without wife or child, their effects go to the
                    king as <hi rend="italic">ultimus haeres</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> but a
                    grant is usually made of them by letters patent, and the grantee becomes
                    entitled to the administration.</p>
                <p>The conflict of laws on the subject of legitimization by subsequent marriage
                    yields some curious results. Thus, in the case of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Burtwhistle</hi> v. <hi rend="italic">Vardill,</hi> it was decided that a child
                    born in Scotland of parents domiciled there, not married till after his birth,
                    is legitimate by the law of Scotland, but cannot take real estate in England as
                    heir. Again, a domiciled Scotchman had a son born in Scotland and then married
                    the mother in Scotland. The son died seised of land in England, and it was held
                    that the father could not inherit from the son. A domiciled Englishman, putative
                    father of a child born in France of a French woman, having afterwards acquired a
                    French domicile, married the mother and acknowledged the child as legitimate in
                    the mode prescribed by the law of France. It was held that he could not
                    legitimize the child so as to enable it to share in a bequest to his children by
                    a person in England. The law of England, while admitting the general maxim that
                    the <hi rend="italic">status</hi> of legitimacy must be tried by the law of the
                    country where it originates, holds that the succession to real property must be
                    determined by the <hi rend="italic">lex loci rei sitae;</hi> so that, for
                    example, a legitimized Scotchman would be recognized as legitimate in England,
                    but not legitimate so far as to take lands as heir.</p>
                <p>The statistics of illegitimacy present some striking differences and
                    uniformities, but it is only in the case of Scotland that we can be reasonably
                    certain of the accuracy of the figures. The status of the child is not recorded
                    in the English system of registration, but is a matter of inference from the
                    facts stated by the parents. In 1873 illegitimacy varied in Scotland as follows.

                <p>In the counties the percentage varied from 4 in Shetland, Ross, and Cromarty, 5
                    in Nairn, and 6 <hi rend="superscript"> -</hi> 5 in Sutherland, to 11T in

                    Wigtown. Similar variations are shown by English statistics for 1859. Compare
                    the highest (Cumberland, ll·4; Norfolk, 10’7; Westmoreland, 9 ’ 7) with the
                    lowest (Monmouth and Middlesex, 4 ’ 7; and Surrey, 5). The metropolis stands at
                    4 ’ 2. With these local variations may be contrasted the steadiness with which
                    the general average of illegitimacy is maintained. In England, for example,
                    during nineteenyears (1841-1859) the percentage fluctuated between 6 '37 and 7,
                    and during the last thirteen years of the period between G∙4 and 6 <hi
                    rend="superscript"> -</hi> 8. The returns of the Registrar-General show rather
                    more fluctuation in Scotland during the period for which we have statistics
                    (1855-1873), the figures being 7 <hi rend="superscript"> ,</hi> 8 in 1855, 8 ’ 5
                    in 185G, steadily rising to 10 in 1863, and 10 ’ 2 in 1866, and then steadily
                    falling to 9 <hi rend="superscript"> -</hi> l in 1872, and 9 in 1873. The
                    statistics of different countries, so far as any proper comparison can be made
                    between them, show differences equally remarkable. The order in which they
                    stand, would be something like the following:—Sardinia (illegitimates), 2Ό91 per
                    cent.; Holland, 3'96; Spain, 5’6; Switzerland, 5 <hi rend="superscript"> -</hi>
                    9; Tuscany, 6; England, 6'5; Finland, Belgium, Sicily, France, 7'8; Prussia, 7
                    to 8; Austria, Norway, Scotland, 9; Denmark, Sweden, Hanover, Iceland, Saxony,
                    15; Wurtemberg, Bavaria, 20 (from Mr Lumley’s paper in the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Journal of the Statistical Society</hi> for June 1862). It will be seen that
                    these differences cannot be explained on any consideration of religious belief
                    or education. An inquiry made in Prussia in 1849 yielded the following results.

                    most cases be regarded as approximations only :—</p>
