                    couple of heavy wooden wheels of equal diameter, one behind the other, and
                    joined together by a longitudinal wooden bar on which the rider’s seat was
                    fixed, the mode of propulsion being the pushing the feet against the ground.
                    That such a cumbersome method of locomotion soon died a natural death is not to
                    be wondered at. For the next fifty years no real progress was made, as various
                    kinds of levers and other attempted appliances were found too intricate. In 1869
                    Μ. Michaux of Paris conceived the idea of making the front or driving wheel much
                    larger than the hind wheel; and very soon afterwards, Μ. Magee, another
                    Parisian, still further improved bicycles by making them entirely of steel and
                    iron. The principle of crank action attached to revolving axles having also
                    become developed, the pastime of bicycling was entirely revolutionized.
                    Indiarubber tyres and strong beaks were brought into requisition to relieve
                    jolting; and now-a-days a crack racing bicycle with a driving-wheel from 55 to
                    60 inches diameter does not exceed 50 lb in weight, or about half the weight of
                    one of the old wooden machines. Tricycles have been tried, but no great amount
                    of speed will ever be got out of them until the friction and weight can be
                    materially reduced.</p>
                <p>The diameter of the front or driving wheel of the modern bicycle varies from 2 j
                    to 5 feet, according to the length of the rider’s legs. When it is meant for
                    racing, most of the component parts are lighter, and the rest for relieving the
                    legs when going down hill is dispensed with. The rider sits astride a small
                    saddle, and the motive power is obtained from the feet working the crank
                    treadles attached to the revolving axle of the driving-wheel. There being no
                    lateral support to the machine, the first thing to be learnt is balancing, after
                    which it is best to begin riding down a gentle gradient without using the
                    treadles. Steering, which is managed by a transverse handle attached to the
                    driving-wheel and placed in front of the rider, should be mastered in the same
                    manner, after which the feet and legs may be brought into play on the treadles
                    and speed gradually acquired. Falls are inevitable at first, and they are best
                    avoided by slightly turning the driving-wheel in the direction the machine is
                    inclining, not the contrary way. Care must be taken to keep all bearings,
                    &lt;fcc., oiled from time to time, in order to prevent friction and so leesen
                    speed. With the exception of skating, bicycling is the quickest means of
                    locomotion that man possesses. A fair bicyclist can outstrip a horse in a day,
                    whilst an expert can do so in an hour. Bicycling has rapidly grown in favour
                    during the past two years; and long tours are now made with the greatest ease.
                    Where the roads are fairly level, and in a tolerably good state of repair, the
                    bicycle is unsurpassed as a means of self-locomotion. In hilly and mountainous
                    countries, where there are no made roads, or where they are much broken up and
                    heavy, it is next to useless, although india-rubber tyres to a certain extent
                    relieve the jolting over rough ground. Lightness, great strength, and the best
                    of workmanship are necessary’ in the manufacture of bicycles in order to prevent
                    serious accidents. It is in the two former requisites that steel and
                    india-rubber have such an advantage over iron and wood.</p>
                <p>As a proof of the perfection to which bicycle-riding has now been brought, the

                <p>The last of these, as one of the London daily journals remarked, fairly ranks as
                    “the most extraordinary performance on record of any man, animal, or machine.”
                    The distance from Tunbridge to Liverpool, 234 miles, has been accomplished in 18
                    hours 35 minutes. A hundred miles a day, over fair roads, has often been
                    achieved for several days together, and many such journeys are recorded. A ride
                    of 800 miles, from London to John O’Groats, was made in 14 days, over
                    unexceptionally hilly and heavy roads, in June 1873.</p>
