                    having died when Bengel was only six years old, his education was taken in hand
                    by a friend of his father named Spindler, who having afterwards become a master
                    in the gymnasium at Stuttgart, carried the boy thither with him, and
                    superintended his education until he entered the University of Tübingen in the
                    year 1703. While at the university, the works to which, among others, he gave
                    special attention as private studies were those of Aristotle and Spinoza, and so
                    thoroughly did he make himself acquainted with the metaphysics of the latter,
                    that he was selected by one of the professors to prepare materials for a
                    treatise <hi rend="italic">De Spinosismo</hi> which the professor afterwards
                    published. He himself used to express his “great thankfulness for the benefit
                    which he had derived from the study of metaphysics and mathematics, in respect
                    of the clearness of thought which they imparted, which was of the utmost value
                    to him in the analysis and exposition of the language of Scripture.” After
                    taking his degree, Bengel devoted himself to the study of theology, to which the
                    grave and religious tone of his mind, deepened and strengthened by his early
                    training and discipline, naturally inclined him. Like other young men of
                    thoughtful character, before and since, he had to struggle with doubts and
                    difficulties of a religious nature, and he alludes, with much feeling, to the
                    “many arrows which pierced his poor heart, and made his youth hard to bear.” It
                    is interesting to know that at this early date his attention was directed to the
                    various readings of the Greek New Testament, and that one cause of his mental
                    perplexities was the difficulty of ascertaining the true reading among the great
                    number of those which were presented to his notice. In 1707 Bengel entered the
                    church, and was appointed to the parochial charge of Metzingen-unter-Urach. Here
                    he remained only one year, and during that time devoted himself to the study of
                    the writings of Spener, Arndt, A. H. Franke, and Chemnitz. The profound
                    impression which the works of these men made upon his mind was never effaced,
                    and may be traced in that vein of devotional, not to saypietistic, feeling which
                    runs through all his religious compositions. In 1708 Bengel was recalled to
                    Tübingen to undertake the office of <hi rend="italic">Repetent</hi> or
                    theological tutor. Here he remained until 1713, when he was appointed the head
                    of a seminary recently established at Denkendorf and intended as a preparatory
                    school of theology. Before entering on his duties there, he made a literary
                    journey through the greater part of Germany, to acquaint himself with the
                    various systems of education which were in use, in order to qualify himself for
                    the better discharge of his official duties. In prosecuting the journey he
                    visited with laudable impartiality the seminaries of the Jesuits as well as
                    those of the Lutheran and Reformed Churches. Among other places he visited
                    Heidelberg and Halle, and had his attention directed at the former city to the
                    canons of Scripture criticism published by Gerhard von Mästricht, and at the
                    latter to Vitringa’s <hi rend="italic">Anacrisis ad Apocalypsin.</hi> The
                    influence exerted by these upon his theological studies will be apparent when we
                    come to notice his works upon the criticism and interpretation of Scripture. For
                    twentyeight years—from 1713-1741—he discharged his important duties as head of
                    the school of Denkendorf with distinguished ability and success, devoting all
                    his energies to the religious and intellectual improvement of his students. It
                    is impossible to read the extracts from his diary and correspondence, which have
                    been preserved, without being struck with the spirit of fervent piety, combined
                    with sagacity and good sense, which characterized his management of the
                    institution. These twenty-eight years were the period of BengeΓs greatest
                    intellectual activity, many of the works on which his reputation rests being
                    included within them. In 1741 he was appointed prelate of the cloister of
                    Herbrechtingen, an office which he held for eight years. In 1749 he was raised
                    to the dignity of consistorial counsellor and prelate of Alpirsbach, with a
                    residence in Stuttgart. Bengel henceforth devoted himself to the discharge of
                    his duties as a member of the consistory. A question of considerable difficulty
                    was at that time occupying the attention of the church courts, viz., the manner
                    in which those who separated themselves from the church were to be dealt with,
                    and the amount of toleration which should be accorded to meetings held in
                    private houses for the purpose of religious edification. The civil power (the
                    duke of "Wurtemberg was a Roman Catholic) was disposed to have recourse to
                    measures of repression, while the members of the consistory, recognizing the
                    good effects of such meetings, were inclined to concede a considerable degree of
                    liberty. Bengel exerted himself on the side of the latter. The admirer of
                    Spener, the founder of the <hi rend="italic">collegia</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >pietatis,</hi> could not but show himself favourably disposed to meetings held
                    for religious purposes, and while maintaining the rights and privileges of the
                    church, he was an advocate for all reasonable freedom being accorded to those
                    who felt themselves bound on grounds of conscience to withdraw from her
                    communion. The good effects of this policy may be seen at this day in the
                    attitude taken up by those who in Würtemberg have separated from the church.
                    BengeΓs public position necessarily brought him into contact with many
                    individuals of celebrity, by whom he was consulted on all important theological
                    and ecclesiastical questions. In a single year he received no fewer than 1200
                    letters. In the year 1751 the University of Tübingen, his own <hi rend="italic"
                    >alma mater,</hi> conferred upon him the degree of doctor of divinity. Bengel’s
                    life was now drawing to a close. He died, after a short illness, in 1752, aged
                    sixty-five years and four months. He himself is reported to have said, “I shall
                    be forgotten for a while, but I shall again come into remembrance and his
                    favourite pupil Oetinger remarked of him, “His like is not left in
                    Würtemberg.”</p>
                <p>The works on which Bengel’s reputation rests as a Biblical scholar and critic
                    are, his edition of the Greek New Testament, and his <hi rend="italic"
                    >Gnomon</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Exegdical Commentary</hi> on the same.</p>
                <p>(A. ) His edition of the Greek Testament was published in 4to at Tübingen in
                    1734, and in 8vo at Stuttgart in the same year, but without the critical
                    apparatus. So early as 1725 he had given an account in his <hi rend="italic"
                    >Prodromus</hi><hi rend="italic">Novi</hi><hi rend="italic">Testamenti</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Greed</hi><hi rend="italic">recte</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >cauteque</hi><hi rend="italic">adornandi</hi> of the principles on which his
                    intended edition was to be based. In preparation for his work Bengel was able to
                    avail himself of the collations of upwards of twenty MSS., none of them,
                    however, <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit03newyrich/page/n589/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0903-0589-0572"/> of great importance, twelve of which had been
                    collated by himself. In constituting the text, he imposed upon himself the
                    singular restriction of not inserting any various reading which had not already
                    been <hi rend="italic">printed</hi> in some preceding edition of the Greek text.
                    From this rule, however, he deviated in the case of the Apocalypse, where, owing
                    to the corrupt state of the text, he felt himself at liberty to introduce some
                    readings on manuscript authority. In the lower margin of the page he inserted a
                    selection of various readings, the relative importance of which he denoted by
                    the first five letters of the Greek alphabet in the following manner :— <hi
                    rend="italic">a</hi> was employed to denote the reading which in his judgment
                    was the true one, although he did not venture to place it in the text; <hi
                    rend="italic">β,</hi> a reading better than that in the text; γ, one equal to
                    the textual reading; δ and e, readings inferior to those in the text. Stephens’s
                    division into verses was retained in the inner margin, but the text was divided
                    into paragraphs. The text was followed by a critical apparatus, the first part
                    of which consisted of an introduction to the criticism of the New Testament, in
                    the thirty-fourth section of which he laid down and explained his celebrated
                    canon, “<hi rend="italic">Proclivi Scriptioni</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >praestat</hi><hi rend="italic">ardua” {“</hi> The more difficult reading to be
                    preferred to that which is more easy”), the soundness of which, as a general
                    principle, has been recognized by succeeding critics, although it was objected
                    to by his great opponent Wetstein, who, nevertheless, found “himself ultimately
                    obliged to lay down something nearly to the same effect” (Scrivener). The second
                    part of the critical apparatus was devoted to a consideration of the various
                    readings, and here Bengel adopted the plan of stating the evidence both <hi
                    rend="italic">against</hi> and <hi rend="italic">in favour</hi> of a particular
                    reading, thus placing before the reader the materials for forming a judgment It
                    is a proof of BeDgeΓs great critical sagacity that he was the first definitely
                    to propound the theory of families or recensions of MSS. His investigations had
                    led him to see that a certain affinity or resemblance existed amongst many of
                    the authorities for the Greek text—MSS., versions, and ecclesiastical writers;
                    that if a peculiar reading, <hi rend="italic">e.g.,</hi> were found in one of
                    these, it was generally found also in the other members of the same class; and
                    this general relationship seemed to point ultimately to a common origin for all
                    the authorities which presented such peculiarities. Although disposed at first
                    to divide the various documents into three classes, he finally adopted a
                    classification into two—the African, or older family of documents, and the
                    Byzantine, or more recent class, to which he attached only a subordinate value.
                    The theory was afterwards adopted by Semler and Griesbach, and worked up into an
                    elaborate system by the latter critic. BengeΓs laboure on the text of the Greek
                    Testament were received with great disfavour in many quarters. Like Walton and
                    Mill before him, he had to encounter the opposition of ignorant and fanatical
                    individuals who believed that the certainty of the Word of God was endangered by
                    the importance attached to the various readings, as if the received text were
                    possessed of infallible authority. One of his opponents, Provost Kohl-reif,
                    publicly challenged him to put the enemies of criticism to silence by admitting
                    that even the various readings were given by inspiration, in order to meet the
                    necessities of various classes <hi rend="italic">ot</hi> readers! Wetstein, on
                    the other hand, accused him of excessive caution in not making freer use of his
                    critical materials. In answer to these strictures, Bengel published a <hi
                    rend="italic">Defence of the Greek Text of his New Testament,</hi> which he
                    prefixed to his <hi rend="italic">Harmony of the Four Gospels,</hi> published in
                    1736, and which contained a sufficient answer to the misrepresentations,
                    especially of Wetstein, which had been brought against him from so many
                    different quarters. The text of Bengel long enjoyed a high reputation amongst
                    scholars, and was frequently reprinted.</p>
                <p>(B.) The other great work of Bengel, and that on which his reputation as an
                    exegete is mainly based, is his <hi rend="italic">Gnomon, or Exegetical
                    Annotations on the New Testament,</hi> published in 1742. It was the fruit of
                    twenty years’ labour, and exhibits with a pregnant brevity of expression, which,
                    it has been said, “condenses more matter into a line than can be extracted from
                    pages of other writers,” the results of his study of the sacred volume. He
                    modestly entitled his work a <hi rend="italic">Gnomon</hi> or index, his object
                    being rather to guide the reader to ascertain the meaning for himself, than to
                    save him from the trouble, of personal investigation. The principles of
                    interpretation on which he proceeded were, to import nothing <hi rend="italic"
                    >into</hi> Scripture, but to draw <hi rend="italic">out of</hi> it everything
                    that it really contained, in conformity with grammatico-historical rules; not to
                    be hampered by dogmatical considerations; and not to be influenced by the
                    symbolical books. BengeΓs .hope that the <hi rend="italic">Gnomon</hi> would
                    help to rekindle a fresh interest in the study of the New Testament was fully
                    realized. It has passed through many editions (latest 1850), has been translated
                    into German and into English, and is still one of the books most highly prized
                    by the expositor of the New Testament. It is a striking testimony to its value
                    that John Wesley largely availed himself of it in writing his <hi rend="italic"
                    >Expository Notes upon the New Testament,</hi> 1755, saying that he “believed he
                    would much better serve the interests of religion by translating from the <hi
                    rend="italic">Gnomon</hi> than by writing many volumes'of his own notes.” Later
                    commentators have not failed to follow Wesley’s example.</p>
                <p>Besides the two works already described, Bengel was the editor or author of many
                    others, classical, patristic, ecclesiastical, and expository, which our limits
                    do not allow us to discuss. We can only name two, viz., <hi rend="italic">Or
                    do</hi><hi rend="italic">Temporum,</hi> a treatise on the chronology of
                    Scripture, in which he enters upon speculations regarding the end of the world,
                    and an <hi rend="italic">Exposition of the Apocalypse,</hi> which enjoyed for a
                    time extraordinary popularity in Germany, and was translated into several
                    foreign languages.</p>
