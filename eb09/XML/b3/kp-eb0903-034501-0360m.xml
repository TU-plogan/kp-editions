                    years represented Peterborough in parliament. Very little is known of Joseph’s
                    early life and education. He appears to have been sent at the age of nine to
                    Harrow, and after spending four years there, was removed to Eton. Here he seems
                    first to have acquired a taste for botanical pursuits, and was accustomed to
                    spend all his leisure hours in the beautiful lanes and fields round the school.
                    He carried the same fondness for natural history to Oxford, where he was entered
                    as a gentleman commoner of Christ’s College; and by his exertions a lecturer on
                    natural science was for the first time brought into the university. After taking
                    an honorary degree he left Oxford; and at the age of twenty-one he found himself
                    possessed of ample means, <pb break="no"

                    he made his first scientific expedition to Newfoundland and Labrador, and
                    brought back a rich collection of plants and insects. Shortly after his return,
                    Government resolved to send out Captain Cook to observe the transit of Venus in
                    the Pacific Ocean, and Banks, through the influence of his friend Lord Sandwich,
                    obtained leave to join the expedition. He made the most careful preparations, in
                    order to be able to profit by every opportunity, and induced Dr Solander, a
                    distinguished pupil of Linnøeus, to accompany him. He even engaged draughtsmen
                    and painters to delineate such objects of interest as did not admit of being
                    transported or preserved. The voyage occupied three years, and many hardships
                    had to be undergone; but the rich harvest of discovery—many natural phenomena
                    being for the first time brought to light—was more than adequate compensation.
                    Banks was equally anxious to join Cook’s second expedition, and expended large
                    sums in engaging assistants and furnishing the necessary equipment; but, owing
                    to ill-feeling on the part of some Government officials, he was compelled to
                    relinquish his purpose. He, however, employed the assistants and materials he
                    had collected in a voyage to Iceland, returning by the Hebrides and Staffa, the
                    geological formation of which he was the first to describe. In 1778 Banks was
                    elected president of the Royal Society, of whieh he had been a fellow from 1766.
                    His predecessor had been compelled to resign owing to some disagreement with the
                    court, but Banks was always a favourite with the king. In 1781 he was made a
                    baronet; in 1795 he received the Order of the Bath; and in 1797 he was admitted
                    to the Privy Council. During the long tenure of his office as president, Sir
                    Joseph did much to raise the state of science in Britain, and was at the same
                    time most assiduous and successful in cultivating friendly relations with
                    scientific men of all nations. His kindness and liberality were beyond praise,
                    and he was most generous in affording to other naturalists the free use of his
                    vast materials. It has, however, been made matter of objection to him, that from
                    his own predilections he was inclined to overlook and depreciate the labours of
                    the mathematical and physical sections of the Royal Society. Sir Joseph died on
                    the 19 th March 1820, at the age of 77. He bequeathed his valuable collections
                    of books and botanical specimens to the British Museum. His only writings are
                    two small tracts of little importance; he seems to have given up his intention
                    of writing an elaborate treatise after the death of his friend and
                    fellow-labourer, Dr Solander. His fame rests mainly on his numerous <hi
