                        rend="italic">Institutiones</hi><hi rend="italic">Physiologicoe,</hi> a
                    condensed, well-arranged view of the animal functions, expounded without
                    discussion of minute anatomical details. This work appeared in 1787, and between
                    its first publication and 1821 went through many editions in Germany, where it
                    was the general text-book of the science. It was translated into English in
                    America by Caldwell in 1798, and in London by Elliotson in 1807.</p>
                <p>Blumenbach was perhaps still more extensively known by his admirable <hi
                        rend="italic">Handbuch</hi> of comparative anatomy, of which the German
                    editions were numerous, from its appearance in 1805 to 1824. It was translated
                    into English in 1809 by the eminent surgeon Lawrence, and again, with the latest
                    improvements and editions, by Coulson in 1827. This manual of Blumenbach’s,
                    though slighter than the subsequent works of Cuvier, Carus, and others, and not
                    to be compared with such recent expositions as that of Gegenbaur, will always be
                    esteemed for the accuracy of the author’s own observations, and his just
                    appreciation of the labours of his predecessors.</p>
                <p>One of the most extensive of Blumenbach’s works was the <hi rend="italic">Decas
                        Collectionis</hi><hi rend="italic">suoe</hi><hi rend="italic">Craniorum
                        Diversarum Gentium illustrata,</hi> in which accurate though slight
                    delineations of the skulls in his noble collection are given, with brief
                    descriptions of each. It appeared in <hi rend="italic">fasciculi,</hi> until
                    sixty crania were represented,—exhibiting in a striking manner the peculiarities
                    in form of the skulls of different nations, and justifying the division of the
                    human race into several great varieties or families, of which he enumerated
                    five— the Caucasian or white race, the Mongolian or Tatar, the Malayan or brown
                    race, the Negro or black race, and the American or red race. The classification
                    he thus proposed has been very generally received, and most later schemes have
                    been modifications of it. For these see the article <hi rend="smallcaps"
                        >Anthropology,</hi> vol. ii. p. 113.</p>
                <p>Although the greatest part of Blumenbach’s long life was passed at Göttingen, in
                    1789 he found leisure to visit Switzerland, and gave a curious medical
                    topography of that country in his <hi rend="italic">Bibliothek.</hi> He was in
                    England in 1788 and 1792. The Prince Regent conferred on him the office of
                    physician to the royal family in Hanover in 1816, and made him knight companion
                    of the Guelphic order in 1821. The Royal Academy of Paris elected him a member
                    in 1831. He died at Göttingen on the 22d of January 1840.</p>
