                    was born at Paris on the 1st November 1636. Crone, not far from the capital, ha3
                    been frequently stated to be his birthplace, but the matter seems to be pretty
                    nearly settled by the researches of M. Labat <hi rend="italic">^Recherches
                    historiques sur V</hi><hi rend="italic">Hotel</hi><hi rend="italic">de la
                    Préfecture de Police),</hi> who has discovered the very house in the Rue de
                    Jérusalem where the poet was born. He was educated at the College of Beauvais,
                    and was at first destined for the legal profession. From this, however, after a
                    short trial, he recoiled in disgust, complaining bitterly of the amount of
                    chicanery which passed under the name of law and justice. To escape such a
                    course of life he began to study for the church, and actually received a priory
                    of a small annual value, but his wishes soon turned in another direction. He
                    gave up his clerical profession, and, his father having left him a small
                    provision suffi - cient for his wants, thenceforward devoted himself to letters.
                    Such of his early poems as have been preserved hardly contain the promise of
                    what he ultimately became. The first piece in which his peculiar powers were
                    displayed was a satirical poem, <hi rend="italic">Adieus of a Poet to the City
                    of Pams,</hi> published in 1660. This was quickly followed by eight others, and
                    the number was at a later period increased to twelve. A twofold interest
                    attaches to the satires. In the first place the author skilfully parodies and
                    attacks writers who at the time were placed in the very first rank, such as
                    Chapelain, Cotin, Quinault, and Scudéri; he openly raised the standard of revolt
                    against the older poets. But in the second place he showed, both by precept and
                    practice, what were the poetical capabilities of the French language. Prose, in
                    the hands of such writers as Descartes and Pascal, had proved itself a flexible
                    and powerful instrument of expression, with a distinct mechanism and form. But
                    except with Malherbe, there had been no attempt to fashion French versification
                    according to rule or method. In Boileau for the first time appeared terseness
                    and vigour of expression, with perfect regularity of verse structure. His fame
                    was quickly established; he received a pension, and was made historiographer
                    along with his friend Racine. In 1664 he composed his prose <hi rend="italic"
                    >Dialogue des</hi><hi rend="italic">heros</hi><hi rend="italic">de roman,</hi>
                    which is a refined satire on the elaborate romances of the time. It may be said
                    to have once for all abolished them. From 1669 onwards appeared the <hi
                    rend="italic">Epistles,</hi> graver in tone than the satires, maturer in
                    thought, more exquisite and polished in style. In 1674 his two master-pieces,
                    <hi rend="italic">L'Art</hi><hi rend="italic">Poetique</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">Le Lutrin,</hi> were published. The first, in imitation of the <hi
                    rend="italic">Ars Poetica</hi> of Horace, lays down the code for all future
                    French verse, and may be said to fill in French literature a parallel place to
                    that held by its prototype in Latin. On our own literature the maxims of
                    Boileau, through the translation revised by Dryden, and through the magnificent
                    imitation of them in Pope’s <hi rend="italic">Art of Criticism,</hi> have
                    exercised no slight influence. Boileau does not merely lay down rules for the
                    language of poetry, but analyses carefully the various kinds of verse
                    composition, and enunciates the principles peculiar to each. Of the four books
                    of the <hi rend="italic">Art</hi><hi rend="italic">Poetique,</hi> the first and
                    last consist of general precepts, inculcating mainly the great rule of <hi
                    rend="italic">bon sens;</hi> the second treats of the pastoral, the elegy, the
                    ode, the epigram, and satire; and the third of tragic and epic poetry. Though
                    the rules laid down are of value, their tendency is rather to hamper and render
                    too mechanical the efforts of poetry. Boileau himself, though a great critic in
                    verse, cannot be considered a great poet. The <hi rend="italic">Lutrin,</hi> a
                    mock heroic poem, of which four cantos appeared in 1674 <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit03newyrich/page/n881/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0903-0881-0864"/> is by French critics considered the best of
                    Boileau’s works. It has furnished the model for the <hi rend="italic">Rape of
                    the Lock,</hi> but the English poem is superior in richness of imagination aud
                    subtilty of invention. The fifth and sixth cautos, afterwards added by Boileau,
                    rather detract from the beauty of the poem; the last canto in particular is
                    quite unworthy of his genius. In the same year which saw the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Art</hi><hi rend="italic">Poetique</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">Lutrin</hi>
                    was published his translation of Longinus <hi rend="italic">On the Sublime,</hi>
                    to which were afterwards added certain critical reflections. His later
                    publications were chiefly occasional poems, in which his better powers did not
                    shine. He died 13th March 1711. Boileau was extremely delicate in youth, and his
                    constitution seems never to have been very strong. He was a man of warm aud
                    kindly feelings, honest, outspoken, and benevolent Many anecdotes are told of
                    his frankness of speech at court, and of his generous actions. He holds a
                    weU-defined place in French literature, as the first who reduced its
                    versification to rule and who taught the value of workmanship for its own sake.
                    His influence on English literature, through Pope and his contemporaries, was
                    not less strong, though less durable. Editions of Boileau's works are very
                    numerous. Perhaps the best is that published by Garnier in 1860, <hi
                    rend="italic">Oeuvres complètes,</hi> with copious notes, an essay by
                    Sainte-Beuve, and <hi rend="italic">Boloeana.</hi></p>
