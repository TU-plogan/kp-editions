                <p><label type="entry">BEGHARDS <hi rend="smallcaps">and</hi></label> BEGUINES. The
                    nature and history of the Beghards is one of the obscurest problems in mediaeval
                    times, and nothing very certain has been ascertained. During the Middle Ages
                    there were formed, alongside of the regular orders, companies of men and women
                    who devoted themselves to a religious life, but did not bind themselves by
                    strict vows. The design was to enable men and women, who did not mean to
                    separate themselves entirely from the world, to lead, nevertheless, what, in the
                    Middle Ages, was esteemed <hi rend="italic">the</hi> religious life. Such
                    companies were the Tertiarii of the Dominican and Franciscan orders, and at
                    first the Beghards and Beguines were similarly constituted. The first notices we
                    have of them tell us that, in the end of the 12th century, in several of the
                    towns of the Netherlands, companies of women formed themselves together, under a
                    simple rule, for the purpose of taking care of the sick and for other charitable
                    objects. They were generally widows and maidens of high rank, and were called
                    Beghinae, or Beguinae, or Beguttae. The origin of the word is very obscure. Some
                    time later, companies of men were formed in a similar way, and under the same
                    rule. They took no vows, and were at liberty to leave the company when they
                    liked. The men were called Beghards. In the 14th century these Beghards seem to
                    have attached themselves to the Franciscans, and to have been instrumental in
                    exciting to revolt that portion of the order which rebelled against the Pope.
                    For some period, indeed, the terms Fratricelli or Spirituales (the two names for
                    the rebel Franciscans) are used synonymously with Beghards. It is believed that
                    the Arabian pantheism of Averroes had became diffused among many of the mystical
                    sects, and that societies, originally purely religious, had become partly
                    political. We know, at all events, that, in the 14th century, the Beghards were
                    in close alliance with the communistic and pantheistic “Brethren of the Free
                    Spirit.” Clement V. denounced them at the Council of Vienna, and launched two
                    bulls against them; the Inquisition was ordered to suppress them; and Pope John
                    XXII., while he protected the Beguines, persecuted the Beghards. Such Beghards
                    as still remained were absorbed in the Tertiarii of the Franciscans in the 17th
                    century; but small communities of Beguines—Beguinages, as they are called—still
                    exist in the Netherlands, and in their organization are somewhat similar to many
