                    reservation of one half of the revenues to himself during his lifetime. The
                    great ability of Beaton and the patronage of his uncle ensured his rapid
                    promotion to high offices in the church and kingdom. He was sent by King James
                    V. on various missions to France, and in 1528 was appointed keeper of the privy
                    seal. He took a leading part in the negotiations connected with the king’s
                    marriages, first with Magdalen of France and afterwards with Mary of Lorraine.
                    At the French court he was held in high estimation by King Francis I., and was
                    presented to the bishopric of Mirepoix in Languedoc, to which he is said to have
                    been consecrated on 5th December 1537. On the 20th of December 1538 he was
                    appointed a cardinal priest by Pope Paul III., under the title of St Stephen in
                    the Coelian Hill. He was the only Scotsman who had been named to that high
                    office by an undisputed right, Cardinal Wardlaw, bishop of Glasgow, having
                    received his appointment from the Antipope Clement VII. On the death of
                    Archbishop James Beaton in 1539, the cardinal was raised to the primatial see of
                    Scotland. He showed his sense of the additional responsibility he had now
                    undertaken by requesting the Pope to relieve him, to some extent, by the
                    nomination of a suffragan or coadjutor in the diocese of St Andrews; and this
                    was effected by the appointment to that office of William Gibson, dean of
                    Restalrig, who received consecration as titular bishop of Libaria.</p>
                <p>Beaton was one of King James’s most trusted advisers, and is said to have taken a
                    part in dissuading him from his proposed interview with Henry VIII. at 'York. On
                    the death of James in December 1542 he attempted to assume office as one of the
                    regents for the infant sovereign Mary, founding his pretensions on an alleged
                    will of the late king; but his claims were disregarded, and the Earl of Arran,
                    head of the great house of Hamilton, and next heir to the throne, was raised to
                    the regency. The cardinal was imprisoned by order of the regent, but after some
                    time was set at liberty. He was subsequently reconciled to Arran, and in
                    September 1543 crowned the young queen at Stirling. Soon afterwards he was
                    raised to the highest office under the regent, that of Chancellor of Scotland,
                    and was appointed legate <hi rend="italic">a latere</hi> by the Pope. The
                    cardinal, in virtue of the latter dignity and of his primatial authority,
                    claimed precedence over Archbishop Dunbar of Glasgow, even within the precincts
                    of the cathedral of St Kentigern. This led to an unseemly brawl between the
                    attendants of the two archbishops, as set forth in a formal complaint made by
                    the cardinal to the Pope, and related at more length and with characteristic
                    glee by Knox. The attention, however, of the cardinal was directed to matters of
                    more importance than disputes with a brother metropolitan.</p>
                <p>The two questions which agitated Scotland at this time were the struggle for
                    ascendency between the supporters of English and French influence, and that
                    between the friends of the hierarchy and the teachers of the Reformed opinions,
                    —questions which frequently became complicated in consequence of the assistance
                    given by France to the bishops, and the encouragement which, for political
                    reasons, the king of England secretly gave to the adherents of the Reformation.
                    In this contest the cardinal supported the interests of France, resolutely
                    opposing the selfish intrigues of King Henry and his party, which had for their
                    object the extinction of the ancient independence of the Scottish kingdom and
                    its subjection to the supremacy of England. Had he been content with this he
                    would have won for himself the gratitude of his countrymen; but his evil deeds
                    as an ecclesiastic made them overlook his patriotic exertions as a statesman.
                    During the lifetime of his uncle he had taken his share in the persecuting
                    policy of the hierarchy, and the same line of conduct was still more
                    systematically adopted after his elevation to the primacy. Having won over the
                    regent to his opinions he became more open and severe in his proceedings. The
                    popular accounts of the persecution are no doubt exaggerated, and it sometimes
                    ceased for considerable periods so far as capital punishments were concerned.
                    When the sufferers were of humble rank <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit03newyrich/page/n481/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0903-0481-0466"/> general attention was not much directed to them.
                    It was otherwise when a more distinguished victim was selected in the person of
                    George Wishart·. This preacher, whose ecclesiastical opinions resembled those of
                    Patrick Hamilton and Hamilton’s teacher, Francis Lambert, returned to Scotland
                    after an absence of several years about the end of 1544. His sermons produced a
                    great effect, and he was protected by several of the barons who were leading men
                    in the English faction. These barons, with the knowledge and approbation of King
                    Henry, were engaged in a plot against the cardinal, in which his assassination
                    was contemplated as the speediest mode of removing the chief obstacle to the
                    influence of England. Of the reality of the plot and the intentions of the
                    conspirators there can be no doubt; whether Wishart was aware of these has been
                    a matter of controversy during the present century. There are strong suspicions
                    against him but no sufficient evidence; and all the presumptions which may be
                    drawn from his personal character are entirely in his favour. The cardinal,
                    though ignorant of the details of the plot, perhaps suspecting Wishart’s
                    knowledge of it, and in any event desirous to seize one of the most eloquent
                    supporters of the new opinions, endeavoured, with the aid of the regent, to
                    apprehend him, but was baffled in his efforts for some time. He was at last
                    successful in seizing the preacher, and bringing him a prisoner to his castle of
                    St Andrew’s. On the 28th of February 154G Wishart was brought to trial within
                    the cathedral church, before the cardinal and other ecclesiastical judges, the
                    regent declining to take any. active part. He defended his opinions with temper
                    and moderation; but as he admitted certain of them which were held by his judges
                    to be heretical, he w as condemned to death and burnt.</p>
                <p>The persecution of Wishart, and the meekness with which he bore his sufferings,
                    produced a deep effect on the mind of the Scottish people, and the cardinal
                    became an object of general dislike. Those who hated him on other grounds were
                    encouraged to proceed with the design they had formed against him. Naturally
                    resolute and fearless, he seems to have undervalued the strength and character
                    of his enemies, and even to have relied on the friendship of some of the
                    conspirators. He crossed over to Angus, and took part in the magnificent
                    ceremonials of the marriage of his illegitimate daughter with the heir of the
                    Earl of Crawford. On his return to St Andrews he took up his residence in the
                    castle. The conspirators, the chief of whom w ere Norman Leslie, Master of
                    Rothes, and William Kirkaldy of Grange, contrived to obtain admission at
                    daybreak of the 29th of May 1546, and murdered the cardinal under circumstances
                    of horrible mockery and atrocity. The assassination excited very different
                    feelings among the partisans on either side. The zealous adherents of the Church
                    of Rome, as a matter of course, viewed it as a cruelmurder aggravated by
                    sacrilege; the most violent of the Protestant party justified and even applauded
                    it. Those w ho, w ithout any strong feelings either way <hi rend="subscript"
                    >;</hi> disliked the cardinal on account of his arrogance and cruelty, spoke of
                    the deed as a wicked one, but hardly professed to regret the victim. Ignorant of
                    the treasonable designs of his enemies, viewing him as the champion of
                    ecclesiastical supremacy, and attributing to him all the evils of the
                    unsuccessful war with England, they looked upon his death as an advantage to the
                    Scottish kingdom. The men of that age were too much accustomed to such violent
                    deeds to entertain a great abhorrence of assassination, and such feelings and
                    crimes were not confined to the adherents of the Reformation. A few years
                    afterwards Martinuzzi, the cardinal archbishop of Gran, was murdered by the
                    express command of a Roman Catholic prince, Ferdinand, king of the Romans,
                    brother of the Emperor Charles V.</p>
                <p>The character of Beaton has already been indicated. As a statesman he was able,
                    resolute, and in his general policy patriotic. As an ecclesiastic he maintained
                    the privileges of the hierarchy and the dominant system of belief
                    conscientiously, but always with harshness and sometimes with cruelty. The
                    immoralities of the cardinal, like his acts of persecution, were exaggerated by
                    his opponents; but his private life was undoubtedly a scandal to religion and
                    the church, and has only the poor excuse that it was not worse than that of most
                    of his order at the time. The authorship of the writings ascribed to him in
                    several biographical notices rests on no better authority than the apocryphal
                    statements of Dempster. <hi rend="smallcaps">(g. g.)</hi></p>
