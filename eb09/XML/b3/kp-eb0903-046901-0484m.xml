                    order, what little can now be known of their lives. It may suffice here to
                    extract from this complete and careful record a few main facts and necessary
                    dates, taking as little note as need be of any supplementary or hypothetical
                    matters. Six or seven years before the birth of his brother in art, John
                    Fletcher was born in December 1579 at Rye in Sussex, and baptized on the 20th of
                    the same month. Richard Fletcher, his father, afterwards queen’s chaplain, dean
                    of Peterborough, and bishop successively of Bristol, Worcester, and London, was
                    then minister of the parish in which the son was born who was to make their name
                    immortal. That son was just turned of seven when the dean distinguished and
                    disgraced himself as the spiritual tormentor of the last moments on earth of
                    Mary Stuart. When not quite twelve he was admitted pensioner of Bene’t College,
                    Cambridge, and two years later was made one of the Bible-clerks: of this college
                    Bishop Fletcher had been president twenty years earlier, and six months before
                    his son’s admission had received from its authorities a first letter of thanks
                    for various benefactions, to be followed next year by a second. Four years later
                    than this, when John Fletcher wanted five or six months of his seventeenth year,
                    the bishop died suddenly of over much tobacco and the displeasure of Queen
                    Elizabeth at his second marriage,—this time, it appears, with a lady of such
                    character as figures something too frequently on the stage of his illustrious
                    son. He left eight children by his first marriage in such distress that their
                    uncle, Dr Giles Fletcher, author of a treatise on the Russian commonwealth which
                    is still held in some repute, w as obliged to draw up a petition to the queen on
                    their behalf, which was supported by the intercession of Essex, but with what
                    result is uncertain. From this date w e know nothing of the fortunes of John
                    Fletcher, till the needy orphan boy of seventeen reappears as the brilliant and
                    triumphant poet whose name is linked for all time with the yet more glorious
                    name of Francis Beaumont, third and youngest son of Sir Francis Beaumont of
                    Grace-Dieu, one of the justices of the Common Pleas,—born, according to general
                    report, in 1586, but, according to more than one apparently irrefragable
                    document, actually born at least a year earlier. The first record of his
                    existence is the entry of his name, together with those of his elder brothers
                    Henry and John, as a gentleman-commoner of Broadgates Hall, Oxford, now
                    supplanted by Pembroke College. But most lovers of his fame will care rather to
                    remember the admirable lines of Wordsworth on the “eager child” who played among
                    the rocks and woodlands of Grace-Dieu; though it may be doubted whether even the
                    boy’s first verses were of the peaceful and pastoral character attributed to
                    them by the great laureate of the lakes. That passionate and fiery genius which
                    was so soon and for so short a time to “shake the buskined stage” w ith heroic
                    and tragic notes of passion and of sorrow, of scorn and rage and slighted love
                    and jealousy, must surely have sought vent from the first in fancies of a more
                    ardent and ambitious kind; and it would be a likelier conjecture that when Frank
                    Beaumont (as we know on more authorities than one that he was always called by
                    his contemporaries, even in the full flush of his adult fame— “never more than
                    Frank,” says Heywood) w ent to college at the ripe age of twelve, he had already
                    committed a tragedy or two in emulation of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Tamburlaine,</hi><hi rend="italic">Andronicus,</hi> or <hi rend="italic"
                    >Jeronymo.</hi> The date of his admission was 4th February 1597; on April 22d of
                    the following year his father died; and on the 3d of November 1600, having left
                    Oxford without taking his degree, the boy of fifteen was entered a member of the
                    Inner Temple, his two brothers standing sponsors on the grave occasion. But the
                    son of Judge Beaumont w^as no fitter for success at the bar than the son of
                    Bishop Fletcher for distinction in the church: it is equally difficult to
                    imagine either poet invested with either gown. Two years later appeared the poem
                    of <hi rend="italic">Salmacis</hi><hi rend="italic">and</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Hermaphroditus,</hi> a voluptuous and voluminous expansion of the Ovidian
                    legend, not on the whole discreditable to a lad of seventeen, fresh from the
                    popular love-poems of Marlowe and Shakespeare, which it naturally exceeds in
                    long-winded and fantastic diffusion of episodes and conceits. At twenty-two
                    Beaumont prefixed to the magnificent masterpiece of Ben Jonson some noticeable
                    verses in honour of his “dear friend” the author; and in the same year (1607)
                    appeared the anonymous comedy of <hi rend="italic">The Woman-Hater,</hi> usually
                    assigned to Fletcher alone; but being as it is in the main a crude and puerile
                    imitation of Jonson’s manner, and certainly more like a man’s work at twenty-two
                    than at twenty-eight, internal evidence would seem to justify, or at least to
                    excuse, those critics who in the teeth of high authority and tradition w ould
                    transfer from Fletcher to Beaumont the principal responsibility for this first
                    play that can be traced to the hand of either. As Fletcher also prefixed to the
                    first edition of <hi rend="italic">Volpone</hi> a copy of commendatory verses,
                    we may presume that their common admiration for a common friend was among the
                    earliest and strongest influences which drew together the two great poets whose
                    names w ere thenceforward to be for ever indivisible. During the dim eleven
                    years between the death of his father and the dawn of his fame, we cannot but
                    imagine that the career of Fletcher had been unprosperous as well as obscure.
                    From seventeen to twenty-eight his youth may presumably have been spent in such
                    painful struggles for success, if not for sustenance, as were never known to his
                    younger colleague, who, as we have seen, was entered at Oxford a few months
                    after Fletcher must in all likelihood have left Cambridge to try his luck in
                    London; a venture most probably resolved on as soon as the youth had found his
                    family reduced by the father’s death to such ruinous straits that any smoother
                    course can hardly have been open to him. Entering college at the same age as
                    Fletcher had entered six years earlier, Beaumont had before him a brighter and
                    briefer line of life than his elder. But whatever may have been their respective
                    situations when, either by happy chance or, as Mr Dyce suggests, by the good
                    offices of Jonson, they were first brought together, their intimacy soon became
                    so much closer than that of ordinary brothers that the household which they
                    shared as bachelors was conducted on such thoroughly communistic principles as
                    might have satisfied the most trenchant theorist who ever proclaimed, as the
                    cardinal point of his doctrine, a complete and absolute community of bed and
                    board, with <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit03newyrich/page/n485/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0903-0485-0470"/> all goods thereto appertaining. But in the year
                    following that in which the two younger poets had united in homage to Jonson,
                    they had entered into a partnership of more importance than this in “the same
                    clothes and cloak, &lt;fcc.∕ ’ with other necessaries of life specified by
                    Aubrey. In 1608, if we may trust the reckoning which seems trust-worthiest, the
                    twin stars of our stage <hi rend="subscript">;</hi> rose visibly together for
                    the first time. The loveliest, though not the loftiest, of tragic plays that we
                    owe to the comrades or the successors of Shakespeare, <hi rend="italic"
                    >Philaster,</hi> has always been regarded as the first-born issue of their
                    commcn genius. The noble tragedy of <hi rend="italic">Thierry and Theodoret</hi>
                    has generally been dated earlier and assigned to Fletcher alone; but we can be
                    sure neither of the early date nor the single authorship. The main body of the
                    play, comprising both the great scenes which throw out into full and final
                    relief the character of either heroine for perfect good or evil, bears
                    throughout the unmistakable image and superscription of Fletcher; yet there are
                    parts which for gravity and steady strength of style, for reserve and temperance
                    of effect, would seem to suggest the collaboration of a calmer and more patient
                    hand; and these more equable and less passionate parts of the poem recall rather
                    the touch of Massinger than of Beaumont. In the second act, for example, the
                    regular structure of the verse, the even scheme of the action, the exaggerated
                    braggardism which makes of the hero a mere puppet or mouthpiece of his own
                    self-will, are all qualities which, for better or for worse, remind us of the
                    strength or the weakness of a poet with whom we know that Fletcher, before or
                    after his alliance with Beaumont, did now and then work in common. Even the
                    Arbaces of Beaumont, though somewhat too highly coloured, does not “write
                    himself down an ass,” like Thierry on his first entrance, after the too frequent
                    fashion of Massinger’s braggarts and tyrants; does not proclaim at starting or
                    display with mere waatonness of exposure his more unlovely qualities in the
                    naked nature of their deformity. Compare also the second with the first scene of
                    the fourth act. In style and metre this second scene is as good an example of
                    Massinger as the first is of Fletcher at his best. Observe especially in the
                    elaborate narrative of the pretended self-immolation of Ordella these
                    distinctive notes of the peculiar style of Massinger; the excess of parenthetic
                    sentences, no less than five in a space of twenty lines; the classical
                    common-place of allusion to Athens, Home, and Sparta in one superfluous breath;
                    the pure and vigorous but somewhat level and prosaic order of language, with the
                    use of certain cheap and easy phrases familiar to Massinger as catchwords; the
                    flat and feeble terminations by means of which the final syllable of one verse
                    runs on into the next without more pause or rhythm than in a passage of prose;
                    th? general dignity and gravity of sustained and measured expression. These are
                    the very points in which the style of Massinger differs from that of Fletcher;
                    whose lightest and loosest verses do not overlap each other without sensible
                    distinction between the end of one line and the beginning of the next; who is
                    often too fluent and facile to be choice or forcible in hi3 diction, but seldom
                    if ever prosaic or conventional in phrase or allusion, and by no means
                    habitually given to weave thoughts within thoughts, knit sentence into sentence,
                    and hang whole paragraphs together by the help of loops and brackets. From these
                    indications we might infer that this poem belongs altogether to a period later
                    than the death of Beaumont; though even during his friend’s life it appears that
                    Fletcher λvas once at least allied with Massinger and two lesser dramatists in
                    the composition of some play now unknown to men.</p>
                <p>Hardly eight years of toil and triumph, of joyous and glorious life, were spared
                    by destiny to the younger poet between the date assigned to the first radiant
                    revelation of his genius in <hi rend="italic">Philaster</hi> and the date which
                    mark3 the end of all his labours. On the Gth of March 161G Francis Beaumont
                    died,—according to Jonson and tradition, “ere he was thirty years of age,” but
                    this we have seen to be inconsistent with the registry of his entrance at
                    Oxford. If we may trust the elegiac evidence of friends, he died of his own
                    genius and fiery overwork of brain; yet from the magnificent and masculine
                    beauty of his portrait one should certainly never have guessed that any strain
                    of spirit or stress of invention could have worn out so long before its time so
                    fair and royal a temple for so bright and affluent a soul. A student of
                    physiognomy will not fail to mark the points of likeness and of difference
                    between the faces of the two friends; both models of noble manhood, handsome and
                    significant in feature and expression alike;— Beaumont’s the statelier and
                    serener of the two, with, clear thoughtful eyes, full arched brows, and strong
                    aquiline nose, with a little cleft at the tip; a grave and beautiful mouth, with
                    full and finely curved lips; the form of face a long pure oval, and the imperial
                    head with its “fair large front” and clustering hair sei firm and carried high
                    with an aspect at once of quiet command and kingly observation: Fletcher’s a
                    more keen and fervid face, sharper in outline every way, with an air of bright
                    ardour and glad fiery impatience; sanguine and nervous, suiting the complexion
                    and colour of hair; the expression of the eager eyes and lips almost recalling
                    that of a noble hound in act to break the leash it strains at;—two heads as
                    lordly of feature and as expressive of aspect as any gallery of great men can
                    show. That spring of 1616, we may note in passing, was the darkest that ever
                    dawned upon England or the world; for, just forty-eight days afterwards, it
                    witnessed, on the 23d of April, the removal from earth of the mightiest genius
                    that ever dwelt among men. Scarcely more than a month and a half divided the
                    death-days of Beaumont and of Shakespeare. Some three years earlier by Mr Dyce’s
                    estimate, when about the age of twenty-eight, Beaumont had married Ursula,
                    daughter and coheiress to Henry Isley of Sundridge in Kent, by whom he left two
                    daughters, one of them posthumous. Fletcher survived his friend just nine years
                    and five months; he died “in the great plague, 1625,” and was buried on the 29th
                    of August in St Saviour’s, Southwark; not, as we might have wished, beside his
                    younger fellow in fame, who but three days after his untimely death had added
                    another deathless memory to the graves of our great men in Westminster Abbey,
                    which he had sung in such noble verse. Dying when just four months short of
                    forty-six, Fletcher had thus, as well as we can now calculate, altogether some
                    fourteen years and six months more of life than the poet who divides with him
                    the imperial inheritance of their common glory.</p>
                <p>The perfect union in genius and in friendship which has made one name of the two
                    names of these great twin brothers in song is a thing so admirable and so
                    delightful to remember, that it would seem ungracious and unkindly to claim for
                    either a precedence which we may be sure .he w ould have been eager to disclaim.
                    But if a distinction must be made between the Dioscuri of English poetry, we
                    must admit that Beaumont was the twin of heavenlier birth. Only as Pollux was on
                    one side a demigod of diviner blood than Castor can it be said that on any side
                    Beaumont was a poet of higher and purer genius than Fletcher; but so much must
                    be allowed by all who have eyes and ears to discern in the fabric of their
                    common work a distinction without a difference. Few things are stranger than the
                    avowal of so great and exqu13ite a critic as Coleridge, that he could trace no
                    faintest line of demarcation between the plays which we owe mainly to Beaumont
                    <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit03newyrich/page/n486/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0903-0486-0471"/> and the plays which we owe solely to Fletcher. To
                    othere this line has always appeared in almost every case unmistakable. Were it
                    as hard and broad as the line which marks off, for example, Shakespeare’s part
                    from Fletcher’s in <hi rend="italic">The Two Noble Kinsmen,</hi> the harmony
                    would of course be lost which now informs every work of their common genius, and
                    each play of their writing would be such another piece of magnificent patchwork
                    as that last gigantic heir of Shakespeare’s invention, the posthumous birth of
                    his parting Muse which was suckled at the breast of Fletcher’s as a child of
                    godlike blood might be reared on the milk of a mortal mother—or in this case, we
                    might sometimes be tempted to say, of a she-goat who left in the veins of the
                    heaven-born suckling somewhat too much of his nurse Amalthaea. That question
                    however belongs in any case more properly to the study of Shakespeare than to
                    the present subject in hand. It may suffice here to observe that the
                    contributions of Fletcher to the majestic temple of tragedy left incomplete by
                    Shakespeare show the lesser workman almost equally at his best and at his worst,
                    at his weakest and at his strongest. In the plays which we know by evidence
                    surer than the most trustworthy tradition to be the common work of Beaumont and
                    Fletcher, there is indeed no trace of such incongruous and incompatible
                    admixture as leaves the greatest example of romantic tragedy—for <hi

                    though not guiltless of blood, are in their issues no more tragic than <hi
                    rend="italic">Pericles</hi> or the <hi rend="italic">Tempest—</hi> an unique
                    instance of glorious imperfection, a hybrid of heavenly and other than heavenly
                    breed, disproportioned and divine. But throughout these noblest of the works
                    inscribed generally with the names of both dramatists we trace on every other
                    page the touch of a surer hand, we hear at every other turn the note of a deeper
                    voice, than we can ever recognize in the work of Fletcher alone. Although the
                    beloved friend of Jonson, and in the field of comedy his loving and studious
                    disciple, yet in that tragic field where his freshest bays were gathered
                    Beaumont was the worthiest and the closest follower of Shakespeare. In the
                    external but essential matter of expression by rhythm and metre he approves
                    himself always a student of Shakespeare’s second manner, of the style in which
                    the graver or tragic part of his historical or romantic plays is mostly written;
                    doubtless, the most perfect model that can be studied by any poet who, like
                    Beaumont, is great enough to be in no danger of sinking to the rank of a mere
                    copyist, but while studious of the perfection set before him is yet conscious of
                    his own personal and proper quality of genius, and enters the presence of the
                    master not as a servant but as a son. The general style of his tragic or
                    romantic verse is as simple and severe in its purity of note and regularity of
                    outline as that of Fletcher’s is by comparison lax, effusive, exuberant. The
                    matchless fluency and rapidity with which the elder brother pours forth the
                    stream of his smooth swift verse gave probably the first occasion for that
                    foolish rumour which has not yet fallen duly silent, but still murmurs here and
                    there its suggestion that the main office of Beaumont was to correct and contain
                    within bounds the over-flowing invention of his colleague. The poet who while
                    yet a youth had earned by his unaided mastery of hand such a crown as was
                    bestowed by the noble love and the loving “envy” of Ben Jonson was, according to
                    this tradition, a mere precocious pedagogue, fit only to revise and restrain the
                    too liberal effusions of fiis elder in genius as in years. Now, in every one of
                    the plays common to both, the real difficulty for a critic is not to trace the
                    hand of Beaumont, but to detect the touch of Fletcher. Throughout the better
                    part of every such play, and above all of their two masterpieces, <hi
                    rend="italic">Philaster</hi> and <hi rend="italic">The Maid’s Tragedy,</hi> it
                    should be clear to the most sluggish or cursory of readers that he ha3 not to do
                    with the author of <hi rend="italic">Valentinian</hi> and <hi rend="italic">The
                    Double Marriage.</hi> In those admirable tragedies the style is looser, more
                    fluid, more feminine. From the first scene to the last we are swept as it were
                    along the race of a running river, always at full flow of light and buoyant
                    melody, with no dark reaches or perilous eddies, no stagnant pools or sterile
                    sandbanks; its bright course only varied by sudden rapids or a stronger ripple
                    here and there, but in rough places or smooth still stirred and sparkling with
                    summer wind and sun. But in tho3e tragic poems of which the dominant note is the
                    note of Beaumont’s genius a subtler chord of thought is sounded, a deeper key of
                    emotion is touched, than ever was struck by Fletcher. The lighter genius is
                    palpably subordinate to the stronger, and loyally submits itself to the
                    impression of a loftier spirit. It is true that this distinction is never grave
                    enough to produce a discord: it is also true that the plays in which the
                    predominance of Beaumont’s mind and style is generally perceptible make up
                    altogether but a small section of the work that bears their names conjointly;
                    but it is no less true that within this section the most precious part of that
                    work is comprised. Outside it we shall find no figures so firmly drawn, no such
                    clearness of outline, no such cunning of hands as we recognize in the three
                    great studies of Bellario, Evadne, and Aspatia. In his male characters, as for
                    instance in the parts of Philaster and Arbaces, Beaumont also is apt to show
                    something of that exaggeration or inconsistency for which his colleague is
                    perhaps more frequently and more heavily to blame; but in these there is not a
                    jarring note, not a touch misplaced; unless, indeed, a rigid criticism may
                    condemn as unfeminine and incongruous with the gentle beauty of her pathetic
                    patience the device by which Aspatia procures herself the death desired at the
                    hand of Amintor. This is noted as a fault by Mr Dyce; but may well be forgiven
                    for the sake of the magnificent scene which follows, and the highest tragic
                    effect ever attained on the stage of either poet. That this as well as the
                    greater part of those other scenes which are the glory of the poem is due to
                    Beaumont might readily be shown at length by the process of comparison. The
                    noble scene of regicide, which it was found expedient to cancel during the
                    earlier years of the Restoration, may indeed be the work of Fletcher; but the
                    part of Evadne must undoubtedly be in the main assigned to the more potent hand
                    of his fellow. There is a fine harmony of character between her naked audacity
                    in the second act and her fierce repentance in the fourth, which is not unworthy
                    a disciple of the tragic school of Shakespeare; Fletcher is less observant of
                    the due balance, less heedful of the nice proportions of good and evil in a
                    faulty and fiery nature, compounded of perverse instinct and passionate
                    reaction. From him we might have had a figure as admirable for vigour of
                    handling, but hardly in such perfect keeping as this of Beaumont’s Evadne, the
                    murderess-Magdalen, whose penitence is of one crimson colour with her sin. Nor
                    even in Fletcher’s Ordella, worthy as the part is throughout even of the
                    precious and exquisite praise of Lamb, is there any such cunning touch of
                    tenderness or delicate perfume of pathos as in the parts of Bellario and
                    Aspatia. These have in them a bitter sweetness, a subtle pungency of mortal
                    sorrow and tears of divine delight, beyond the reach of Fletcher. His highest
                    studies of female character have dignity, energy, devotion of the heroic type;
                    but they never touch us to the quick, never waken in us any finer and more
                    profound sense than that of applause and admiration. There is a modest pathos
                    now and then in his pictures of feminine submission and slighted or outraged
                    love; but this submission he is apt to make too servile, this love too dog-like
                    in its abject devotion to retain that tender reverence which so many generations
                    of readers have paid to the sweet memories of <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit03newyrich/page/n487/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0903-0487-0472"/> Aspatia and Bellario. To excite compassion was
                    enough for Fletcher, as in the masculine parts of his work it was enough for him
                    to excite wonder, to sustain curiosity, to goad and stimulate by any vivid and
                    violent means the interest of readers or spectators. The single instance of
                    noble pathos, the one scene he has left us which appeals to the higher and purer
                    kind of pity, is the death of the child l·Iengo in <hi rend="italic"
                    >Bonduca,—</hi> a scene which of itself would have sufficed to enrol his name
                    for ever on the list of our great tragic poets To him we may probably assign the
                    whole merit of that fiery and high-toned tragedy, with all its spirit and
                    splendour of national and martial passion; the conscious and demonstrative
                    exchange of courtesy between Roman and Briton, which is one of the leading notes
                    of the poem, has in it a touch of overstrained and artificial chivalry
                    characteristic of Fletcher; yet the parts of Cara-tach and Poenius may be
                    counted among the loftiest and most equal of his creations. But no surer test or
                    better example can be taken of the distinctive quality which denotes the graver
                    genius of either poet than that supplied by a comparison of Beaumont’s <hi
                    rend="italic">Triumph of Love</hi> with Fletcher’s <hi rend="italic">Triumph of
                    Death.</hi> Each little play, in the brief course of its single act, gives proof
                    of the peculiar touch and special trick of its author’s hand: the deeper and
                    more delicate passion of Beaumont, the rapid and ardent activity of Fletcher,
                    have nowhere found a more noticeable vent for the expression respectively of the
                    most tender and profound simplicity of quiet sweetness, the most buoyant and
                    impatient energy of tragic emotion.</p>
                <p>In the wider field of their comic or romantic drama it is yet easier to
                    distinguish the respective work of either hand. The bias of Fletcher was towards
                    mixed comedy; his lightest and wildest humour is usually crossed or tempered by
                    an infusion of romance; like Shakespeare in this one point at least, he has left
                    no single play without some touch on it of serious interest, of poetic eloquence
                    or fancy, however slight and fugitive. Beaumont, evidently under the imperious
                    influence of Ben Jonson’s more rigid theories, seems rather to have bent his
                    genius with the whole force of a resolute will into the form or mould prescribed
                    for comedy by the elder and greater comic poet. The admirable study of the
                    worthy citizen and his wife, who introduce to the stage and escort with their
                    applause <hi rend="italic">The Knight of the Burning Pestle</hi> through his
                    adventurous career to its untimely end, has all the force and fulness of
                    Jonson’s humour at its best, with more of freshness and freedom. In pure comedy,
                    varied with broad farce and mock-heroic parody, Beaumont was the earliest as
                    well as the ablest disciple of the master whose mantle was afterwards to be
                    shared among the academic poets of a younger generation, the Randolphs and
                    Cartwrights who sought shelter under the shadow of its voluminous folds. The
                    best example of the school of Jonson to be found outside the ample range of his
                    own work is <hi rend="italic">The Scornful Lady,</hi> a comedy whose exceptional
                    success and prolonged popularity must have been due rather to the broad effect
                    of its forcible situations, its wealth and variety of ludicrous incidents, and
                    the strong gross humour of its dialogue, than to any finer quality of style,
                    invention, or character. It is the only work of Beaumont and Fletcher which a
                    critic who weighs the meaning of his words can admit to be as coarse as the
                    coarsest work of Ben Jonson. They are prone, indeed, to indulge elsewhere in a
                    wanton and exuberant licence of talk; and Fletcher, at least, is liable to
                    confuse the shades of right and wrong, to deface or efface the boundary lines of
                    good and evil, to stain the ermine of virtue and palliate the nakedness of vice
                    with the same indecorous and incongruous laxity of handling. Often, in mere
                    haste to despatch the business of a play, to huddle up a catastrophe or throw
                    out some particular scene into sharp and immediate relief, he will sacrifice all
                    seemliness and consistency of character to the present aim of stage effect,
                    and’the instant impression of strong incident or audacious eloquence. His
                    heroines are too apt to utter sentiments worthy of Diana in language unworthy of
                    Doll Tearsheet. But in this play both style and sentiment are throughout on a
                    lower level, the action and emotion are of a baser kind than usual; the precept
                    of Aristotle and the practice of Jonson have been so carefully observed and
                    exaggerated that it might almost be said to offer us in one or two places an
                    imitation not merely of the sorrier but of the sorriest qualities of human
                    nature; and full as it is of spontaneous power and humorous invention, the
                    comedy extolled by the moral Steele (with just so much of reservation as permits
                    him to deprecate the ridicule cast upon the clerical character) is certainly
                    more offensive to artistic law and aesthetic judgment by the general and
                    ingrained coarseness of its tone, than the tragi-comedy denounced by the immoral
                    Dryden as exceeding in licence his own worst work and that of his fellow
                    playwrights; an imputation, be it said in passing, as groundless as the protest
                    pleaded on their behalf is impudent; for though we may hardly agree with the
                    uncompromising panegyrist who commends that play in particular to the approval
                    of “the austere scarlet” (remembering, perhaps, that Aristophanes was the chosen
                    bedfellow of Chrysostom), there is at least no such offence against art or taste
                    in the eccentricity of its situations or the daring of its dialogue. The buoyant
                    and facile grace of Fletcher’s style carries him lightly across quagmires in
                    which a heavier-footed poet, or one of slower tread, would have stuck fast, and
                    come forth bemired to the knees. To Beaumont his stars had given as birthright
                    the gifts of tragic pathos and passion, of tender power, and broad strong
                    humour; to Fletcher had been allotted a more, fiery and fruitful force of
                    invention, a more aerial ease and swiftness of action, a more various readiness
                    and fulness of bright exuberant speech. The genius of Beaumont was deeper,
                    sweeter, nobler than his elder’s: the genius of Fletcher more brilliant, more
                    supple, more prodigal, and more voluble than his frieud’s. Without a taint or a
                    shadow on his fame of such imitative servility as marks and degrades the mere
                    henchman or satellite of a stronger poet, Beaumont may fairly be said to hold of
                    Shakespeare in his tragedy, in his comedy of Jonson; in each case rather as a
                    kinsman than as a client, as an ally than as a follower: but the more special
                    province of Fletcher was a land of his own discovering, where no later colonist
                    has ever had power to settle or to share his reign. With the mixed or romantic
                    comedy of Shakespeare it has nothing in common except the admixture or
                    alternation of graver with lighter interest, of serious with humorous action.
                    Nothing is here of his magic exaltation or charm of fairy empire. The rare and
                    rash adventures of Fletcher on that forbidden track are too sure to end in
                    pitiful and shameful failure. His crown of praise is to have created a wholly
                    new and wholly delightful form of mixed comedy or dramatic romance, dealing
                    merely with the humours and sentiments of men, their passions and their chances;
                    to have woven of all these a web of emotion and event with such gay dexterity,
                    to have blended his colours and combined his effects with such exquisite
                    facility and swift light sureness of touch, that we may return once and again
                    from those heights and depths of poetry to which access was forbidden him, ready
                    as ever to enjoy as of old the fresh incomparable charm, the force and ease and
                    grace of life, which fill and animate the radiant world of his romantic
                    invention. Neither before him nor after do w e find, in this his special field
                    of fancy and of work, more than shadows or echoes of his coming or departing
                    genius. Admirable as are his <pb break="no"

                    eloquence and strong in large grasp of character as is the Roman history of <hi

                    loveliness of passion as is the one scene of perfect beauty and terror which
                    crowne this latter tragedy, Fletcher may claim a yet higher and more special
                    station among his great dramatic peers by right of his comic and romantic than
                    by right of his tragic and historic plays. Even in these he is more a romantic
                    than a tragic poet. The quality of his genius, never sombre or subtle or
                    profound, bears him always towards fresh air and sunshine. His natural work is
                    in a midday world of fearless boyish laughter and hardly bitter tears. There is
                    always more of rainbow than of storm in his skies; their darkest shadow is but a
                    tragic twilight. What with him is the noon of night would seem as sunshine on
                    the stage of Ford or Webster. There is but one passage in all these noble plays
                    which lifts us beyond a sense of the stage, which raises our admiration out of
                    speech into silence, tempers and transfigures our emotion with a touch of awe.
                    And this we owe to the genius of Beaumont, exalted for an instant to the very
                    tone and manner of Shakespeare’s tragedy, when Amintor stands between the dead
                    and the dying woman whom he has unwittingly slain with hand and tongue. The
                    first few lines that drop from his stricken lips are probably the only verses of
                    Beaumont or Fletcher which might pass for Shakespeare’s even with a good judge
                    of style—</p>
                <l part="N"> “This earth of mine doth tremble," &amp;c. </l>
                <p>But in Fletcher’s tragedy, however we may be thrilled and kindled with high
                    contagious excitement, we are never awed into dumb delight or dread, never
                    pierced with any sense of terror or pity too deep or even deep enough for tears.
                    Even his Brunhalts and Martias can hardly persuade us to forget for the moment
                    that “they do but jest, poison in jest.” A critic bitten with the love of
                    classification might divide those plays of Fletcher usually ranked together as
                    comedies into three kinds: the first he would class under the head of pure
                    comedy, the next of heroic or romantic drama, the third of mixed comedy and
                    romance; in this, the last and most delightful division of the poet’s work the
                    special qualities of the two former kinds being equally blended and delicately
                    harmonized. The most perfect and triumphant examples of this class are <hi
                    rend="italic">The Spanish Curate, Monsieur Thomas, The Custom of the
                    Country,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">The Elder Brother.</hi> Next to these, and
                    not too far below them, we may, put <hi rend="italic">The Little French
                    Lawyer</hi> (a play which in its broad conception of a single eccentric humour
                    suggests the collaboration of Beaumont and the influence of Jonson, but in style
                    and execution throughout is perfect Fletcher), <hi rend="italic">The Humorous
                    Lieutenant</hi> (on which an almost identical verdict might be passed), <hi
                    rend="italic">Women Pleased, Beggars' Bush,</hi> and perhaps we might add <hi
                    rend="italic">The Fair Maid of the Inn;</hi> in most if not in all of which the
                    balance of exultant and living humour with serious poetic interest of a noble
                    and various kind is held with even hand and the skill of a natural master. In
                    pure comedy <hi rend="italic">Bule a Wife and Have a Wife</hi> is the
                    acknowledged and consummate masterpiece of Fletcher. Next to it we might class,
                    for comic spirit and force of character, <hi rend="italic">Wit without Money,
                    The Wildgoose Chase, The Chances,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">The Noble
                    Gentleman,—</hi> a broad poetic farce to whose overflowing fun and masterdom of
                    extravagance no critic has ever done justice but Leigh Hunt, who has ventured,
                    not without reason, to match its joyous and preposterous audacities of
                    superlative and sovereign foolery with the more sharp-edged satire and practical
                    merriment of <hi rend="italic">King and no King,</hi> where the keen prosaic
                    humυur of Bessus and his swordsmen is as typical of the comic style in which
                    Beaumont had been trained up under Ben Jonson as the high interest and graduated
                    action of the serious part of the play are characteristic of his more earnest
                    genius. Among the purely romantic plays of Fletcher, or those in which the comic
                    effect is throughout subordinate to the romantic, <hi rend="italic">The Knight
                    of Malta</hi> seems most worthy of the highest place for the noble beauty and
                    exaltation of spirit which informs it with a lofty life, for its chivalrous
                    union of heroic passion and Catholic devotion. This poem is the fairest and the
                    first example of those sweet fantastic paintings in rose-colour and azure of
                    visionary chivalry and ideal holiness, by dint of which the romance of more
                    recent days has sought to cast the glamour of a mirage over the darkest and
                    deadliest “ages of faith.” The pure and fervent eloquence of the style is in
                    perfect keeping with the high romantic interest of character and story. In the
                    same class we may rank among the best samples of Fletcher’s workmanship <hi
                    rend="italic">The Pilgrim, The Loyal Subject, A Wife for a Month, Love's
                    Pilgrimage,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">The Lover’s Progress,—</hi> rich all of
                    them in exquisite writing, in varied incident, in brilliant effects and graceful
                    or passionate interludes. In <hi rend="italic">The Coxcomb</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">The Honest Man's Fortune—</hi> two plays which, on the whole, can
                    hardly be counted among the best of their class—there are tones of homelier
                    emotion, touches of a simpler and more pathetic interest than usual; and here,
                    as in the two admirable first scenes between Leucippus and Bacha, which relieve
                    and redeem from contempt the tragic burlesque of <hi rend="italic">Cupid’s
                    Revenge,</hi> the note of Beaumont’s manner is at once discernible.</p>
                <p>Even the most rapid revision of the work done by these great twin poets must
                    impress every capable student with a sense of the homage due to this living
                    witness of their large and liberal genius. The loss of their names from the roll
                    of English poetry would be only less than the loss of the few greatest inscribed
                    on it. Nothing could supply the want of their tragic, their comic or romantic
                    drama; no larger or more fiery planet can ever arise to supplant or to eclipse
                    the twin lights of our zodiac. Whatever their faults of shortcoming or excess,
                    there is in their very name3 or the mere thought of their common work a kind of
                    special and personal attraction for all true lovers of high dramatic poetry.
                    There is the glory and grace of youth in all they have left us; if there be also
                    somewhat too much of its graceless as well as its gracious qualities, yet there
                    hangs about their memory as it were a music of the morning, a breath and savour
                    of bright early manhood, a joyous and vigorous air of free life and fruitful
                    labour, which might charm asleep for ever all thought or blame of all mortal
                    infirmity or folly, or any stain of earth that may have soiled in passing the
                    feet of creatures half human and half divine while yet they dwelt among men. For
                    good or for evil, they are above all things poets of youth; we cannot conceive
                    of them grown grey in the dignity of years, venerable with the authority of long
                    life, and weighted with the wisdom of experience. In the Olympian circle of the
                    gods and the giants of our race who on earth were their contemporaries and
                    corrivals, they seem to move among the graver presences and figures of sedater
                    fame like the two spoilt boys of heaven, lightest of foot and heart and head of
                    all the brood of deity. Shakespeare may have smiled as Jonson may have nodded
                    approval of their bright swift work, neither of these great elders grudging his
                    praise to the special charm which won for it a preference during one generation
                    at least even over their own loftier and weightier verse; and indeed the advance
                    in natural ease, in truth and grace of dialogue, is alike manifest whether we
                    turn to such of their comic characters as Valentine and Don John, Rutilio and
                    Monsieur Thomas, from the Truewit of Jonson or even from the Mercutio of
                    Shakespeare; the one too stiff with classic starch, the <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit03newyrich/page/n489/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0903-0489-0474"/> other too full of more verbal catches and forced
                    conceits, to persuade us that either can in any age have fairly represented the
                    light free talk and facile humour of its youth. In another field than this
                    Beaumont and Fletcher hold as high and secure a station of their own as any poet
                    of their race. In perfect workmanship of lyrical jewellery, in perfect bloom and
                    flower of song-writing, they equal all compeers whom they do not excel; the
                    blossoms of their growth in this kind may be matched for colour and fragrance
                    against Shakespeare’s, and for morning freshness and natural purity of form
                    exceed the finest grafts of Jonson. <hi rend="italic">The Faithful
                    Shepherdess</hi> alone might speak for Fletcher on this score, being as it is
                    simply a lyric poem in semi-dramatic shape, to be judged only as such, and as
                    such almost faultless; but in no wise to be classed for praise or blame among
                    the acting plays of its author, whose one serious error in the matter was the
                    submission of his Dryad to the critical verdict of an audience too probably in
                    great part composed of clowns and satyrs far unlike the loving and sweet-tongued
                    sylvan of his lovely fancy. And whether we assign to him or to Beaumont the
                    divine song of melancholy <hi rend="italic">(incestius</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >lacrymis</hi><hi rend="italic">Simonideis'),</hi> perfect in form as Catullus
                    and profound in sentiment as Shelley, which Milton himself could but echo and
                    expand, could not heighten or deepen its exquisite intensity of thought and word
                    alike, there will remain witness enough for the younger brother of a lyric power
                    as pure and rare as his elder’s.</p>
                <p>The excess of influence and popularity over that of other poets usually ascribed
                    to the work of Beaumont and Fletcher for some half century or so after their own
                    time has perhaps been somewhat overstated by tradition. Whatever may have been
                    for a season the fashion of the stage, it is certain that Shakespeare can show
                    two editions for one against them in folio; four in all from 1G23 to 1685, while
                    they have but their two of 1647 and 1679. Nor does one see how it can accurately
                    or even plausibly be said that they were in any exact sense the founders of a
                    school either in comedy or in tragedy. Massinger, for some years their survivor,
                    and in some points akin to them as a workman, cannot properly be counted as
                    their disciple; and no leading poet of the time had so much in common with them
                    as he. At first sight, indeed, his choice of romantic subject and treatment of
                    foreign stories, gathered from the fertile tale-tellers of the south, and
                    ranging in date from Boccaccio to Cervantes, may seem to mark him out as a
                    member of the same school; but the deepest and most distinctive qualities of his
                    genius set it far apart from theirs; though undoubtedly not so far that any
                    discrepancy or discord should impair the excellence or injure the keeping of
                    works in which he took part with Fletcher. Yet, placed beside theirs, the tone
                    of his thought and speech seems by comparison severe as well as sober, and sad
                    as well as severe. Their extravagant and boyish insanity of prostrate royalism
                    is not more alien from his half pensive and</p>
