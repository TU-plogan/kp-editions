                    there for some time on jurisprudence. Thence he proceeded to Paris, and began to
                    practise at the bar. His want of success is said to have been the reason of his
                    applying himself to literature; but this we may reasonably doubt, as he was only
                    twenty-five years of age when he published his first work, a translation of
                    Oppian’s <hi rend="italic">Cynegeticοn</hi> into Latin verse, with a commentary.
                    Almost immediately on its publication the celebrated scholar, Turnebus,
                    complained that some of his emendations had been appropriated without
                    acknowledgment. A discourse on public instruction, <hi rend="italic"
                    >Oratio</hi><hi rend="italic">de</hi><hi rend="italic">Instituenda</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">in Republica</hi><hi rend="italic">Juventute,</hi> which Bodin had
                    delivered at Toulouse, was printed in 1559, and his <hi rend="italic"
                    >Methodus</hi><hi rend="italic">ad</hi><hi rend="italic">Facilem Historiarum
                    Cognitionem</hi> appeared in 1566. The latter is a work of considerable interest
                    and value. It has, indeed, no title to the high honour which M. Baudrillart
                    assigns to it of having laid the foundation of the philosophy of history; but it
                    contains several thoughts of essential importance to that philosophy, as, for
                    example, those relative to the nature of history, to progress and law in
                    history, and to historical causation. Two years later Bodin published a work in
                    refutation of the views of Μ. de Malestroict, who maintained that there had been
                    no rise of prices in France during the three preceding centuries. The <hi
                    rend="italic">Responsio</hi><hi rend="italic">ad</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Paradoxa</hi><hi rend="italic">Malestretti</hi> not only completely established
                    the contrary, but for the first time explained in a nearly satisfactory manner
                    the revolution of prices which took place in the 16th century, pointing out not
                    only its primary but most of its secondary causes with remarkable perspicacity.

                    on public revenues in the sixth book of the <hi rend="italic">Republic,</hi>
                    undoubtedly entitle Bodin to a distinguished position among the earlier
                    cultivators of political economy. His learning, genial disposition, and
                    conversational powers recommended him to the favour of Henry III. and of his
                    brother, the duke of Alençon. The former appointed him to the office of king’s
                    attorney at Laon in 1576. This was the most eventful year of his life, being
                    that in which he married, performed his most brilliant service to his country,
                    and completed his greatest literary work. Elected by the Tiers État of
                    Vermandois to represent it in the states-general of Blois, he contended with
                    great skill and boldness in extremely difficult circumstances for freedom of
                    conscience, justice, and peace. The nobility and clergy favoured the League, and
                    urged the king to force his subjects to abjure Protestantism and profess the
                    Catholic religion. When Bodin found he could not prevent this <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit03newyrich/page/n865/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0903-0865-0848"/> resolution being carried, he contrived to get
                    inserted in the petition drawn up by the states the clause “without war,” which
                    practically rendered all its other clauses nugatory. While he thus resisted the
                    clergy and nobility and their dependents, he opposed the demand of the king to
                    be allowed to alienate the public lands and royal demesnes, and had influence
                    sufficient to get it refused, although the chief deputies had been won over to
                    assent to it. This lost him the favour of the king, who wanted money on any
                    terms. His <hi rend="italic">magnum opus—Les six livres</hi><hi rend="italic">de
                    la République</hi> (Paris, 1576)—passed through various editions in its author’s
                    lifetime, that of 1583 having as an appendix <hi rend="italic">L</hi> ’ <hi
                    rend="italic">apologie</hi><hi rend="italic">de Rene Herpin</hi> (Bodin
                    himself). In 1586 he issued a Latin version, for the use chiefly of English
                    students of law and politics. It is the first elaborate attempt in modern times
                    to construct a system of political science. “From the time,” says Sir William
                    Hamilton, “when Aristotle wrote his eight books of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Politics,</hi> until the time when Montesquieu wrote his thirty-one books on
                    <hi rend="italic">The Spirit of Laws,</hi> the six books of the <hi
                    rend="italic">Republic</hi> of Bodinus is the ablest and most remarkable
                    treatise extant on the philosophy of government and legislation; and even until
                    the present day these three authors stand out as the great political
                    triumvirate.” Bodin was, of course, greatly indebted to Aristotle for his
                    knowledge of the working of political causes, but he made use of what his
                    illustrious predecessor taught him in no servile way, and added much from his
                    own reflections, his large acquaintance with history, and his vivid personal
                    experience. The <hi rend="italic">Republic</hi> is a work of which it is quite
                    impossible to give a brief account, and as there have been many lengthened
                    summaries of it, it may suffice to say that those to be found in Hallam’s Zii.

                    Bluntschli’s <hi rend="italic">Geschichte des Staatsrechts,</hi> give a good
                    general view of its character, while that in Professor Baudrillart’s <hi
                    rend="italic">J. Bodin</hi><hi rend="italic">et</hi><hi rend="italic">son
                    Temps</hi> is so exceedingly careful and excellent that scarcely a thought of
                    any value in the original has escaped being indicated. With all his brcadth and
                    liberality of mind Bodin was an exceedingly credulous believer in witchcraft,
                    the virtues of numbers, and the power of the stars, and in 1580 he published^
                    the <hi rend="italic">Demonomαnie</hi><hi rend="italic">des Sorciers,</hi> a
                    work which is a most humbling evidence that even the greatest men may not be
                    exempt from the most irrational prejudices of their age. Although he was himself
                    regarded by most of his contemporaries as a sceptic, and by some as an atheist,
                    he denounced all who dared to doubt of sorcery, and zealously urged the burning
                    of witches and wizards. It might, perhaps, have gone hard with himself if his
                    counsel had been strictly followed, as he confessed to have had from his
                    thirty-seventh year a friendly demon who, if properly invoked, touched his right
                    ear when he purposed doing what was wrong, and his left when he meditated doing
                    good. To the duke of Alençon Bodin owed several important preferments. In 1581
                    he accompanied his patron as secretary when that prince came over to England to
                    seek the hand of Queen Elizabeth. Here he had the pleasure of finding that the
                    <hi rend="italic">Republic</hi> was studied at London and Cambridge, although in
                    a barbarous Latin translation. This was what determined him to translate his
                    work into Latin himself. The latter part of Bodin’s life was spent at Laon, the
                    inhabitants of which he is said to have persuaded to declare for the League in
                    1589, and for Henry IV. five years afterwards. He died of the plague in that
                    city in 1596, and was buried in the church of the Carmelites. In the year during
                    which he died there appeared his <hi rend="italic">Universale</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Naturoe</hi><hi rend="italic">Theatrum,</hi> which was translated
                    into French by Fongerolles in the following year. He left behind him a very
                    famous MS., the <hi rend="italic">Colloquium Ηeptaplomeres de</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">abditis rerum sublimium arcanis,</hi> which was published for the
                    first time in a complete form by Noack in 1857, although it had been previously
                    studied by others, <hi rend="italic">e.g.,</hi> Grotius, Huet, Ménage, Diecmann,
                    &amp;c. It is composed in the form of a conversation between seven learned men—a
                    Jew, a Mahometan, a Lutheran, a Zwinglian, a Roman Catholic, an Epicurean, and a
                    Theist. The conclusion to which they are represented as coming is that they will
                    live together in charity and toleration, and cease from further disputation as
                    to religion.</p>
