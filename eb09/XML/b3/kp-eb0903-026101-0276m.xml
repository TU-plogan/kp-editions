                <p><label type="entry">BALANCE</label>. For the measurement of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >“mass”</hi> of (i.e., of the quantity of matter contained in) a given body we
                    possess only <hi rend="italic">one</hi> method, which, being independent of any
                    supposition regarding the nature of the matter to be measured, is of perfectly
                    general applicability. The method—to give it at once in its customary
                    form—consists in this, that after having fixed upon a <hi rend="italic">unit
                    mass,</hi> and procured a sufficiently complete set of bodies representing each
                    a known number of mass-units (a “set of weights ”), we determine the ratio of
                    the <hi rend="italic">weight</hi> of the body under examination to the <hi
                    rend="italic">weight</hi> of the unit piece of the set, and identify this ratio
                    with the ratio of the <hi rend="italic">masses.</hi> Machines constructed for
                    this particular <hi rend="italic">modus</hi> of weighing are called <hi
                    rend="italic">balances.</hi> Evidently the weight of a body as determined by
                    means of a balance—and it is in this sense that the term is always used in
                    everyday life, and also in certain sciences, as, for instance, in chemistry—is
                    independent of the magnitude of the force of gravity; what the merchant (or
                    chemist) calls, say, a “pound” of gold is the same at the bottom as it is at the
                    top of Mont Blanc, although its real weight, <hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> the
                    force with which it tends to fall, is greater in the former than it is in the
                    latter case.</p>
                <p>To any person acquainted with the elements of mechanics, numerous ideal
                    contrivances for ascertaining which of two bodies is the heavier, and for even
                    determining the ratio of their weights, will readily suggest themselves; but
                    there would be no use in our noticing any of these many conceivable balances,
                    except those which have been actually realised and successfully employed. These
                    may be conveniently arranged under six heads.</p>
                <p>1. <hi rend="italic">Spring Balances.</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi> The general
                    principle of this class of balances is that when an elastic body is acted upon
                    by a weight suspended from it, it undergoes a change of form, which, <hi
                    rend="italic">caeteris paribus,</hi> is the greater the greater the weight. The
                    simplest form of the spring balance is a straight spiral of hard steel (or other
                    kind of elastic) wire, suspended by its upper end from a fixed point, and having
                    its lower end bent into a hook, from which, by means of another hook crossing
                    the first, the body to be weighed is suspended,— matters being arranged so that
                    even in the empty instrument the axis of the spiral is a plumb-line. Supposing a
                    body to be suspended at the lower hook, it is clear that the point where the
                    hooks intersect each other will descend from the level it originally occupied,
                    and that it must fall through a certain height <hi rend="italic">h</hi> before
                    it can, by itself, remain at rest. This height, provided the spiral was not
                    strained beyond its limit of elasticity <hi rend="italic">{i.e.,</hi> into a
                    permanent change of form), is proportional to the <hi rend="italic">weight</hi>
                    P of the body, and consequently has to the mass Μ the relation Λ = cyM, where c
                    is a constant and <hi rend="italic">g</hi> the acceleration of gravity. Hence,
                    supposing in a first case <hi rend="italic">h</hi> and Μ to have been <hi
                    rend="italic">h'</hi> and M', and in a second case, <hi rend="italic">h!'</hi>
                    and M*, we have <hi rend="italic">h': h"</hi><hi rend="italic">::</hi> &lt;7′M′:
                    <hi rend="italic">f'W;</hi> and it is only as long as <hi rend="italic">g</hi>
                    is the same that we can say <hi rend="italic">K</hi><hi rend="italic">:</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">h!</hi> ’ <hi rend="italic">∙.</hi>: M': Μ*. Spring balances are
                    very extensively used for the weighing of the cheaper articles of commerce and
                    other purposes, where a high degree of precision is not required. In this class
                    of instruments, to combine compactness with relatively considerable range, the
                    spring is generally made rather strong; and sometimes the exactitude of the
                    reading is increased by inserting, between the index and that point the
                    displacement of which serves to measure the weight, a system of levers or
                    toothed wheels, constructed so as to magnify into convenient visibility the
                    displacement corresponding to the least difference of weight to be determined.
                    Attempts to convert the spring balance into a precision instrument have scarcely
                    ever been made; the only case in point known to the writer is that of an elegant
                    little instrument constructed by Professor Jolly, of Munich, for the
                    determination of the specific gravity of solids by immersion, which consists of
                    a long steel-wire spiral, suspended in front of a vertical strip of silvered
                    glass bearing a millimetre scale. To read off the position of equilibrium of the
                    index on the scale, the observing eye is placed in such a position that the eye,
                    its image in the glass, and the index are in a line, and the point on the scale
                    noted down with which the index apparently coincides.</p>
                <p>2. <hi rend="italic">Chain Balances.</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi> This invention
                    of Wilhelm Weber’s having never, so far as we know, found its way into actual
                    practice, we confine ourselves to an illustration of its principle. Imagine a
                    flexible string to have its two ends attached to the two fixed points C and D
                    (fig. 1), forming the terminal points of a horizontal line CD shorter than the
                    string. Suppose two weights to be suspended, the one at a point A, the other at
                    a point B of the string; the form of the polygon CDBA will depend, <hi
                    rend="italic">caeteris paribus,</hi> on the ratio of the two weights. Assuming,
                    for simplicity’s sake, CA to be equal to DB, then, if the weights are equal,
                    say, each = P units, the line AB will be horizontal. But if now, say, the weight
                    at B be replaced by a heavier weight Q, the point A will ascend through a height
                    <hi rend="italic">h,</hi> the point B will descend through a lesser height <hi
                    rend="italic">h'</hi> in accordance with equation PΛ = QΛ', and the angle
                    between what is now the position of rest of the base line A'B', and the original
                    line AB will depend on the ratio of P: Q. The exact measurement of this angle
                    would be difficult, but it would be easy to devise very exact means for
                    ascertaining whether or not it was horizontal, and, if not, whether it slanted
                    down the one way or the other; and thus the instrument might serve to determine
                    whether P was equal to, or greater or less than, Q; and this obviously is all
                    that is required to convert the contrivance into an exact balance.</p>
                <p>3. <hi rend="italic">Lever Balances.</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi> This class of
                    balances, being more extensively used than any other, forms the most important
                    division of our subject. There is a great variety of lever balances; but they
                    are all founded upon the same principles, and it is consequently expedient to
                    begin by summing up these into one general theory.</p>

                    xml:id="kp-eb0903-0277-0262"/>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Theory of the Lever Balance</hi> (fig. 2).—In developing the
                    “theory” of a machine, the first step always is and must be that we substitute
                    for the machine as it is a <hi rend="italic">fictitious</hi> machine, which,
                    while it closely corresponds in its working to the actual thing, is free from
                    its defects. In this sense what now follows has to be understood. Imagine an <hi
                    rend="italic">inflexible beam</hi> suspended from a stand in such a manner that,
                    while it can <hi rend="italic">rotate freely</hi> about a certain horizontal
                    axis fixed in its position with respect to both the stand and the beam, and
                    passing through the latter somewhere <hi rend="italic">above</hi> its centre of
                    gravity, it cannot perform any other motion. Imagine the beam at each end to be
                    provided with a vertical slit, and each slit to be traversed by a rigid line
                    fixed in the beam in such a situation that both lines are parallel to, and in
                    one and the same plane with, the axis of rotation; and suppose the mass of the
                    beam to be so distributed that the line connecting the centre of gravity S with
                    its projection 0 on the axis of rotation stands perpendicular on that plane.
                    Suppose now two weights, P' and P", to be suspended by means of absolutely
                    flexible strings, the former from a point A on the rigid line in the left, the
                    other from a point B on the rigid line in the right slit, and clearly, whatever
                    may be the effect, it will <hi rend="italic">not</hi> depend on the length of
                    the strings. Hence we may replace the two weights by two material points
                    situated in A and B, and weighing P' and P* respectively. But two such points
                    are equivalent, statically, to one point (weighing P' + P") situated somewhere
                    in D within the right line connecting A with B. Suppose the beam to be arrested
                    in its <hi rend="italic">“normal position”</hi> (by which we mean that position
                    in which AB stands horizontal and the line SO is a plumb-line), and then to be
                    released, the statical effect will depend on the situation of the point D, and
                    this situation, supposing the ratio <hi rend="italic">l': I"</hi> to be given,
                    on the ratio P': P' ’. If P ’ <hi rend="italic">l'</hi> = P" <hi rend="italic"
                    >I",</hi> D lies in the axis of rotation; the beam remains at rest in its normal
                    position, and, if brought out of it, will return to it, being in <hi
                    rend="italic">stable</hi> equilibrium. This at once suggests two modes of
                    constructing the instrument and two corresponding methods of weighing.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">First Method.—</hi> We so construct our instrument that while
                    <hi rend="italic">ΐ</hi> is constant, <hi rend="italic">I"</hi> can be made to
                    vary and its ratio to <hi rend="italic">ΐ</hi> be measured. In order then to
                    determine an unknown weight P', we suspend it at the point pivot A; we then take
                    a standard weight P" and, by shifting it forwards and backwards on AB, find that
                    particular position of the point of suspension B, at which P* exactly
                    counterpoises P'. We <hi rend="italic">I" I"</hi> then read off y , and have P'
                    = P*y. But, practically, the body to be weighed cannot be directly suspended
                    from A, but must be placed in a <hi rend="italic">pan</hi> suspended from A, and
                    consequently the weight <hi rend="italic">p</hi><hi rend="italic subscript">
                    0</hi> of the pan and its appurtenances would always have to be deducted from
                    the total weight P', as found by the experiment, to arrive at the weight of the
                    object <hi rend="italic">p ≈</hi> P' - <hi rend="italic">p</hi><hi rend="italic
                    subscript"> 0</hi><hi rend="italic">.</hi> Hence, what is actually done in
                    practice is so to shape the right arm that its back coincides with the line AB,
                    and to lay down on it a scale, the degrees of which are equal to one another,
                    and to <hi rend="italic">l'</hi> (or some convenient submultiple or multiple of
                    <hi rend="italic">l')</hi> in length, and so to adjust <hi rend="italic"
                    >p</hi><hi rend="italic subscript"> 0</hi> and number the scale, that when the
                    sliding weight P" is suspended at the zero-point, it just counterpoises the pan;
                    so that when now it is shifted successively to the points 1, 2, 3 . . . <hi
                    rend="italic">p,</hi> it balances exactly 1, 2, 3 . . . <hi rend="italic">p</hi>
                    units of weight placed in the pan. This is the principle of the common <hi
                    rend="italic">steel-yard,</hi> which, on account of the rapidity of its working,
                    and as it requires only <hi rend="italic">one</hi> standard weight, is very much
                    used in practice for rough weighings, but which, when carefully constructed and
                    adjusted, is susceptible of a very considerable degree of precision. In the case
                    of a precision steel-yard, it is best so to distribute the mass of the beam that
                    the right arm balances the left one + the pan, to divide that arm very exactly
                    into, say, only 10 equal parts, and instead of one sliding weight of P" units to
                    use a set of standards weighing P <hi rend="superscript"> ,,</hi>, <hi
                    rend="subscript"> τ</hi> ⅛ <hi rend="italic">P",</hi><hi rend="italic

                    1</hi><hi rend="subscript"> 0 σ</hi> P", &amp;c. The great difficulty is to
                    ensure to the heavier sliding weights a sufficiently constant position on the
                    beam. To show the extent to which this difficulty can be overcome it may be
                    stated that in an elegant little steel-yard, constructed by Mr Westphal of Celle
                    (for the determination of specific gravities), which we had lately occasion to
                    examine, even the largest rider, which weighs about 10 grammes, was so constant
                    in its indications that, when suspended in any notch, it always produced the
                    same effect to within less than <hi rend="subscript"> 3 0</hi><hi

                <p><hi rend="italic">Second Method.—</hi> We so construct our instrument that both
                    <hi rend="italic">l'</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Γ</hi> have constant values, and
                    are nearly or exactly equal to each other, and provide it with pans, whose
                    weights p <hi rend="subscript"> 0</hi> ' and <hi rend="italic">pf</hi> are so
                    adjusted against each other that <hi rend="italic">p' l' = pfl',</hi> and,
                    consequently, the empty instrument is at rest in its normal position. We next
                    procure a sufficiently complete set of weights, <hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> a
                    set which, by properly combining the several pieces with one another, enables us
                    to build up any integral multiple of the smallest difference of weight δ we care
                    to determine, a set, for instance, which virtually contains any term of the
                    series 0Ό01, 0Ό02, 0.003 100'000 grammes. In order now to determine an unknown
                    weight <hi rend="italic">p',</hi> we place it, say, in the left pan, and then,
                    by a series of trials, find that combination of standards <hi rend="italic"
                    >p&gt;'</hi> which, when placed in the right pan, establishes equilibrium to

                    we want to know the absolute value of <hi rend="italic">p</hi> in true grammes,

                    find out the number of grammes <hi rend="italic">p"</hi> which has to be <hi

                    reference to the ideal machine meant to be realised) is the theory of the <hi
                    rend="italic">common balance</hi> as we see it working in every grocer’s shop,
                    and also that of the modern <hi rend="italic">precision balance,</hi> which, in
                    fact, is nothing but an equal-armed beam and scales refinedly constructed. In
                    the case of the latter class of balances the inconvenience involved in the use
                    of very small weights may be avoided (and is generally avoided) by dividing the
                    right arm of the beam, or rather the line AB, into 10 equal parts, and
                    determining differences of less than, say, 0Ό1 gramme by means of a sliding
                    weight possessing that value. But evidently, instead of dividing the whole
                    length of the right arm, it is better to divide some portion of it which is so
                    situated that the rider can be shifted from the very zero to the “10,” and so to
                    adjust the rider, that when it is shifted successively from 0 to 1, 2, 3 . . .
                    <hi rend="italic">n</hi> it is the same as if 1, 2, 3 . . . <hi rend="italic"
                    >n</hi> tenths of its weight were placed in the right pan. The rider in this
                    case must, of course, form part and parcel of the beam. It is singular that none
                    of our precision-balance makers have ever thought of this very obvious
                    improvement on the customary system. In the very excellent instrument made by
                    Messrs Becker and Company of New York, this, it is true, is realised partially
                    in a rider weighing 12 milligrammes and a beam divided into 12 equal parts
                    (instead of 10 and 10 respectively); but this does not enable one to shift the
                    rider to where it would indicate from 0 to say -⅛ or <hi rend="subscript">
                    1</hi> ⅛∙ of a milligramme. Whichever of these modes of weighing we may adopt,
                    we must have an arrangement to see whether the balance is in its normal
                    position, and it is desirable also to have some means to enable us, in the
                    course of our trials, to form at least an idea as to the additional weight which
                    would have to be added to the standards on the pan (or to be taken away) in
                    order to establish equilibrium. To define the normal position, all that is
                    required is to provide the beam with a sufficiently long “needle,” the axis of
                    which is parallel to the line OS, and which plays against a circular limb fixed
                    to the stand and constructed so that the upper edge of the limb coincides very
                    nearly with rhe path of the point of the vibrating needle, and to graduate the
                    limb so that, as fig. 2 shows, the zero point indicates the normal position of
                    the beam. In order to see how the graduation must be made to be as convenient as
                    possible a means for translating deviations of the needle into differences of
                    weight, let us assume the balance to be charged with P' grammes from A and with
                    P" + Δ grammes from B, and P' and P" to satisfy the equation P' <hi
                    rend="italic">l' =</hi> P"Z ’ '. The two weights P' and P' being equivalent to
                    one point P' + P" in the axis of rotation, the effect is the same as if these
                    two weights did not exist and the beam was only under the influence of two
                    weights, viz., the weight W of the beam acting in S and the weight Δ acting in
                    B. But this comes to the same as if both W and Δ were replaced by one point
                    weighing W + Δ, and situated somewhere at C <hi rend="subscript"> o</hi>
                    between, and on a line with, B and S. Hence, supposing the beam to be first
                    arrested in its normal position and then to be left to itself, the right arm
                    will go down and not be able by itself to remain at rest before it has reached
                    that position in which C <hi rend="subscript"> o</hi> lies vertically below the
                    axis of rotation. <hi rend="italic">Coeteris</hi><hi rend="italic">paribus</hi>
                    C <hi rend="subscript"> o</hi> will be the nearer to B, and consequently the
                    angle α, through which the beam (and with it the needle) has to turn to assume
                    what now is its position of stable equilibrium, will be the greater the greater
                    Δ is, and for the same Δ and W the angle of deviation will be the greater the
                    less the distance <hi rend="italic">s</hi> of the centre of gravity of the beam
                    S is from the axis of rotation. The former proposition enables one in a given
                    case to form an idea of the amount Δ which has to be taken away from the right
                    pan to establish equilibrium. To find the exact mathematical relation between Δ
                    and the corresponding angle α, let us remember that the position of C <hi
                    rend="subscript"> o</hi> is the same whatever may be the direction of gravity
                    with regard to the beam. Assuming gravity to act parallel to OS, we have (W + Δ)
                    CC <hi rend="subscript"> 0</hi> = ΔZ", where C stands for the projection of C
                    <hi rend="subscript"> o</hi> on OS. Assuming, secondly, gravity to act parallel
                    to the line OB, we have (W + Δ). C0 = W. OS;</p>
                <p>CC <hi rend="subscript"> 0</hi> ÷ ∕O&lt;</p>
                <p>CO Ws <hi rend="superscript"> v</hi> '</p>
                <p>Obviously, the right way of graduating the limb is to place the marks so that
                    their radial projections on the tangent to the circle at the zero-point divide
                    that line into parts of equal length. In the Ordinary balance where Z" is a
                    constant, the factor — has a constant value, which can be determined by <hi
                    rend="italic">one</hi> experiment with a known Δ—always supposing that in the
                    instrument used the requirements of our theory were exactly fulfilled. In good
                    precision balances they <hi rend="italic">are</hi> fulfilled, to such an extent
                    at least, that although the factor named is not absolutely constant, but a
                    function of P, it can be looked upon as a <hi rend="italic">relative</hi>
                    constant, so that by determining the deviations produced by a given Δ, say Δ = 1
                    milligramme, for a series of charges (z.e., values of P"), one is enabled to
                    readily convert deviations of the needle, as read off on the scale, into
                    differences of weight. This method is very generally followed in the exact
                    determinations of weights as required in chemical assaying, in the adjusting of
                    sets of weights, &amp;c. Only, instead of letting the needle come to rest and
                    then reading off its position, what is done is to note down 2, 3, 4 . . . <hi
                    rend="italic">n</hi> consecutive excursions of the needle, and from the readings

                    according as they lie to the left or to the right of the zero-point, α <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 0</hi> might be identified with <hi rend="italic">any</hi> of

                    as possible the influences of the resistance of the air and</p>
                <p>(let us at once add by anticipation of what ought to be reserved for a subsequent
                    paragraph) of the friction in the pivots of the balance, it is expedient to let
                    <hi rend="italic">n</hi> be an <hi rend="italic">odd</hi> number. Theoretically
                    this method is. of course, <hi rend="italic">not</hi> confined to small Δ⅛, and
                    it is easy to conceive a balance in which the limb is so graduated that it gives
                    directly the weight of an object placed in the right pan; this is the principle
                    of the <hi rend="italic">Tangent Balance,</hi> a class of instruments which used
                    to be very generally employed for the weighing of letters, parcels, &amp;c., but
                    is now almost entirely superseded by the spring balance.</p>
                <p>After having thus given a general theory of the <hi rend="italic">ideal,</hi> let
                    us now pass to the <hi rend="italic">actual</hi> instrument. But in doing so we
                    must confine ourselves mainly to the consideration of that particular class of
                    instruments called precision balances, which are used in chemical assaying, for
                    the adjustment of standard weights, and for other exact gravimetric work.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Precision Balance</hi> being, as already said, quite
                    identical in principle with the ordinary <hi rend="superscript"> u</hi> pair of
                    scales,” there is no sharp line of demarcation between it and what is usually
                    called “a common balance,” and it is equally <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit03newyrich/page/n279/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0903-0279-0264"/> impossible to name the inventor of the more
                    perfect form of the instrument. But taking the precision balance in what is now
                    considered its most perfected form, we may safely say that all which
                    distinguishes it from the common balance proper is, in the main, the invention
                    of the late Mr Robinson of London. In Robinson’s, as in most modern precision
                    balances, the beam consists of a perforated flat rhombus or isosceles triangle,
                    made in one piece out of gun-metal or hard-hammered brass. The substitution for
                    either of those materials of <hi rend="italic">hard steel</hi> would greatly
                    increase the relative inflexibility of the beam, but, unfortunately, steel is
                    given to rusting, and, besides, is apt to become magnetic, and has therefore
                    been almost entirely abandoned. The perforations in the beam are an important
                    feature, as they considerably diminish its weight (as compared with what that
                    would be if the perforations were filled up) without to any great extent
                    reducing its relative solidity. In fact, the loss of carrying power which a
                    solid rhombus suffers in consequence of the middle portions being cut out, is so
                    slight that a very insignificant increase in the size of the minor diagonal is
                    sufficient to compensate for it. <hi rend="italic">Why</hi> a balance beam
                    should be made as light as possible is easily seen; the object (and it is as
                    well here to say at once, the <hi rend="italic">only</hi> object) is to diminish
                    the influence of the unavoidable imperfections of the central pivot. To reduce
                    these imperfections to a minimum, the beam in all modern balances is supported
                    on a polished horizontal plane of <hi rend="italic">agate</hi> or <hi
                    rend="italic">hard steel</hi> fixed to the stand, by means of a perfectly
                    straight <hi rend="italic">“knife-edgef</hi> ground to a prism, of hard steel or
                    agate, which is firmly connected with the beam, so that the edge coincides with
                    the intended axis of rotation. In the best instruments the bearing plane is
                    continuous, and the edge rests on it along its entire length; in less expensive
                    instruments the bearing consists of two separate parts, of which the one
                    supports the front end, the other the hind end of the edge. Every complete
                    balance is provided with an “arrestment,” one of the objects of which is, as the
                    name indicates, to enable one to arrest the beam, and, if desired, to bring it
                    back to its normal position; but the most important function of it is to secure
                    to <hi rend="italic">every point of the central edge</hi> a perfectly fixed
                    position on its bearing. So far all modern precision balances agree; but the way
                    in which the <hi rend="italic">point-pivots</hi> A and B of our fictitious
                    machine are sought to be realised varies very much in different instruments. In
                    Robinson’s, and in the best modern balances, the beam is provided at its two
                    extremities with two knife-edges similar to the central one (except that they
                    are turned upwards), which, in intention at least, are parallel to, and in the
                    same plane as, the central edge; on each knife-edge rests a plane agate or steel
                    bearing, with which is firmly connected a bent wire or stirrup, provided at its
                    lower end with a circular hook, the plane of which stands perpendicular to the
                    corresponding knife-edge; and from this hook the pan is suspended by means of a
                    second hook crossing the first, matters being arranged so that, supposing both
                    end-bearings to be in their proper places and to lie horizontally, the working
                    points A' and B' of the two hook-and-eye arrangements are vertically below the
                    intended point-pivots A and B on the edges. In this construction it is an
                    important function of the arrestment to assign to each of the two terminal
                    bearings a <hi rend="italic">perfectly constant</hi> position on its knife-edge.
                    How this is done a glance at figs. 3 and 4 (of which the former is taken from an
                    excellent instrument constructed by L. Oertling of London, and the latter from
                    an equally good balance, represented in fig. 5, made by Messrs Becker &lt;fc
                    Co., of New York) shows better than any verbal explanation. But what cannot be
                    seen from these sketches is that the range of the arrestment is regulated, and
                    its catching contrivances are placed, so that when the arrestment is at its
                    highest place, the central edge is just barely lifted from its bearing, and the
                    terminal bearings are similarly lifted from their respective knife-edges, so
                    that the beam is now at rest in its normal position. In other balances, as, for
                    instance, in the justly celebrated instruments of Mr Staudinger of Giessen,
                    Robinson’s plane terminal bearings are replaced by roof-shaped ones (fig. 6), so
                    that their form alone suffices to secure to them a fixed position on their
                    knife-edges. Another construction (which offers the great advantage of being
                    easy of execution and facilitating the adjustment of the instrument) is to give
                    to the terminal edges the form of circular rings, the planes of which stand
                    parallel to the central edge, and from which the pans are suspended directly by
                    sharp hooks, so that the points A' and B' coincide with A and B respectively. In
                    either case the terminal bearings are independent of the arrestment, which must
                    consequently be provided with some extra arrangement, by means of which the
                    beam, when the central edge is lifted from its support, is steadied and held
                    fast in its normal position. In second and third class instruments even the
                    central edge is made independent of the arrestment, by letting it work in a
                    semi-cylindrical or, what is better, a roof-shaped bearing, which, by its form,
                    assigns to it (in intention at least) a definite position.</p>
                <p>In order now to develop a complete theory of the precision balance, let us first
                    imagine an instrument, which, for distinctness, we will assume to be constructed
                    on Robinson’s model, the knife-edges and bearings, &amp;c., being exactly and
                    absolutely what they are <hi rend="italic">meant</hi> to be, except that the
                    terminal edges, while still parallel to the axis of rotation, are slightly
                    shifted out of their proper places. ' Supposing such a balance were charged with

                    right edge, and, consequently, the statical condition of the balance is the same
                    as if the weights W, P', P" were all concentrated in one fixed point C <hi
                    rend="subscript"> o</hi> (fig. 7), the position of which, in regard to the beam,
                    is independent of the extent to which the latter may have turned, and
                    independent of the direction of gravity. It is also easily seen that in a given
                    beam the position of C <hi rend="subscript"> o</hi> will depend only on P <hi
                    rend="superscript"> z</hi> and P", and supposing P' to remain constant it will
                    change its position whenever P" changes its value. The point C <hi
                    rend="subscript"> o</hi> will in general lie outside of the axis of rotation,
                    and consequently there will in general be only two positions of the beam in
                    which it can remain at rest, namely, first, that position in which C <hi
                    rend="subscript"> o</hi> lies vertically above, and, secondly, that position in
                    which it lies vertically below the axis of rotation. Only one of these two
                    positions can possibly lie within the angle of free play which the beam has at
                    its disposal. The second of the two positions, if it is within this angle, can
                    easily be found experimentally, because it is the position of stable
                    equilibrium, which the beam, when left to itself in any but the first position,
                    will always by itself tend to assume. The first position, viz., that of unstable
                    equilibrium, is <hi rend="italic">practically</hi> beyond the reach of
                    experimental determination. Hence the points A, B, and S must be situated so
                    that, at least whenever P7 <hi rend="superscript"> z</hi> = P <hi
                    rend="superscript"> z</hi> 7 <hi rend="superscript"> zz</hi> exactly or very
                    nearly, the beam <hi rend="italic">has</hi> a definite position of stable
                    equilibrium, and that this position is within the angle of free play. To
                    formulate these conditions mathematically, assume a system of rectangular
                    co-ordinates, X, Y, Z, to be connected with the beam, so that the axis of the Z
                    coincides with the central edge and the origin with the projection 0 of the
                    centre of gravity on that edge, while the Y-axis passes through the centre of
                    gravity. Let the values of the co-ordinates of the points A, B, S, C <hi

                <p>If, in particular cases, one or more of the points A, B, S should lie above the

                    negative, and the equations (as can easily be shown) remain in force. Taking
                    equation 3, together with what was said before, we at once see that if a balance
                    is to be at all available for what it has been made for, and supposing two of
                    the co-ordinates <hi rend="italic">h', h!'</hi> to have been chosen at random,
                    the third must be chosen so that, at least whenever P <hi rend="superscript">
                    z</hi> exactly or nearly counterpoises P <hi rend="superscript"> zz</hi>, Ws <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 0</hi> + P <hi rend="superscript"> z</hi> Λ <hi

                    = 0, then, in case of P7 <hi rend="superscript"> z</hi> = P'7, <hi
                    rend="superscript"> zz</hi> the balance would have no definite position of
                    equilibrium, and if it were negative, <hi rend="italic">y</hi><hi rend="italic
                    subscript"> a</hi> would be negative, and the position of stable equilibrium
                    would lie outside the angle of free play. Obviously, the best thing the maker
                    can do is so to adjust the balance that <hi rend="italic">h'</hi> = Λ" = 0 and
                    <hi rend="italic">l' = I",</hi> because then the customary method of weighing
                    (see above) assumes its greatest simplicity, and, especially, the factor with
                    which the deviation of the needle has to be multiplied to convert it into the
                    corresponding excess of weight present on the respective pan assumes its highest
                    degree of relative constancy. We speak of a degree of constancy because this
                    factor can never be absolutely constant, for the simple reason that no beam is
                    absolutely inflexible, and consequently <hi rend="italic">h</hi><hi rend="italic
                    superscript"> ,</hi> as well as <hi rend="italic">h!'</hi> is a function of P
                    <hi rend="superscript"> z</hi>, and P <hi rend="superscript"> zz</hi> of the
                    form <hi rend="italic">h = h</hi><hi rend="italic subscript"> 0</hi> + γP, where
                    γ has a very obvious meaning. What is actually done in the adjusting of the best
                    instruments is so to place the terminal edges that, for a certain medium value
                    of P <hi rend="superscript"> z</hi> + P <hi rend="superscript"> zz</hi>, <hi
                    rend="italic">h ' + h"</hi> «= 0, so that the sensibility of the balance is
                    about the same when the pans are empty as when they are charged with the largest
                    weights they are intended to carry. The condition <hi rend="italic">l</hi> ’ <hi
                    rend="italic">= I"</hi> also cannot be fulfilled absolutely in practice, but
                    mechanicians now-a-days have no difficulty in reducing the difference y - 1 to
                    less than ÷ <hi rend="subscript"> 60</hi> ⅞ <hi rend="subscript"> c</hi>- <hi
                    rend="subscript"> σ</hi>, and even a greater value would create no serious
                    inconvenience. We shall therefore how assume our balance to be exactly
                    equal-armed; and, substituting for <hi rend="italic">h' + h!'</hi> the symbol
                    2Λ, and understanding it to be that (small) value which corresponds to the
                    charge, substitute for equation 3 the simpler expression <hi rend="superscript">
                    tan α</hi> = W¾ + 2PΛ · · · · &lt; <hi rend="superscript"> 4</hi>)’</p>
                <p>which, on the understanding that P <hi rend="superscript"> zz</hi> = P <hi
                    rend="superscript"> z</hi> + Δ, and that A is a very small weight, gives the
                    tangent-value corresponding to P and Δ. Sometimes it is convenient to look upon
                    the pans (weighing <hi rend="italic">p</hi><hi rend="italic subscript"> 0</hi>
                    each) as forming part and parcel of the beam; the equation then assumes the
                    form—</p>

                <p>In a precision balance the sensibility, <hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> the

                <p>Δ ws' <hi rend="italic">+ 2ph</hi><hi rend="italic superscript"> k 7</hi> must
                    have a pretty considerable value, and at the same time ought to be as nearly as
                    possible independent of the charge. Hence what the equation (4) indicates with
                    reference to a balance to be constructed is, that, so far as these two qualities
                    are concerned, we may choose the weight of the beam as we like; and in regard to
                    the sensibility which the instrument is meant to have when charged to a certain
                    <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit03newyrich/page/n281/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0903-0281-0266"/> extent, we have even the free choice of the
                    arm-length, because, whatever <hi rend="italic">I</hi> or W be, if only the
                    centre of gravity of the empty beam is brought to the proper distance from the
                    central edge, we can give to the sensibility any value we please. What is
                    actually done is so to construct the beam that its centre of gravity lies
                    decidedly lower than one would ever care to have it, and then to connect with
                    the beam a small movable weight (called the “bob <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi>
                    ’) in such a manner that it can be shifted up and down along a wire, the axis of
                    which coincides with the Y-axis, and thus the value s <hi rend="subscript">
                    0</hi> of the distance of the centre of gravity of the beam from the central
                    edge be caused to assume any value, from a certain maximum down to nothing, and
                    even a little beyond nothing. As to the relative independence of the sensibility
                    of the charge, equation 5 shows that a given balance will possess this quality
                    in the higher a degree the less the distance <hi rend="italic">h</hi> of the
                    central edge is from the plane of the two terminal ones, and, supposing <hi
                    rend="italic">h</hi> to be constant <hi rend="italic">(i,e.,</hi> the adjustment
                    to be finished), the less the initial sensibility α <hi rend="subscript">
                    rt</hi> exhibited by the empty instrument. Passing from one balance to the
                    other, but supposing <hi rend="italic">h</hi> and <hi rend="italic">a</hi><hi
                    rend="italic subscript"> 0</hi> to remain constant, we readily see that the
                    sensibility is the more nearly independent of the charge <hi rend="italic"
                    >p</hi> in the pans, the greater the <hi rend="italic">arm-length I</hi> is.
                    From what has been said above, it would appear that by means of a balance
                    provided with a gravity-bob, we could attain any degree of precision we liked,
                    but evidently this is not possible practically, because in the actual instrument
                    neither the knife-edges and their bearings nor the arrestment are what we have
                    hitherto supposed them to be; and, consequently, both <hi rend="italic">l'</hi>
                    and <hi rend="italic">Γ</hi> as well as <hi rend="italic">h,</hi> instead of
                    being constants, are <hi rend="italic">variable quantities.</hi> Obviously, the
                    nonconstancy of the ratio <hi rend="italic">l': I"</hi> is the most important
                    point, and to this point we shall therefore confine our attention. Let us
                    imagine that the imaginary balance hitherto considered has been charged equally
                    on both sides (with P = <hi rend="italic">p</hi><hi rend="italic subscript">
                    0</hi><hi rend="italic">+ p),</hi> so that its normal position is its position
                    of rest, and then assume, first, that the <hi rend="italic">middle edge</hi>
                    (which hitherto has been an absolutely rigid line) is now a narrow and slightly,
                    but irregularly, curved rough surface. The effect will be, that, supposing the
                    balance to be repeatedly arrested and made to vibrate, the axis of rotation,
                    instead of being constant, will shift irregularly between <hi rend="italic"
                    >X</hi> = + λ and <hi rend="italic">x =</hi>- λ where λ means a small length.
                    But this comes to the same as if the central pivot <hi rend="italic">were</hi>
                    absolutely perfect, but had the common centre of gravity C <hi rend="subscript">
                    o</hi>, instead of being fixed at <hi rend="italic">x</hi> = 0, oscillating
                    between <hi rend="italic">x =</hi> ± λ <hi rend="subscript"> 0</hi><hi
                    rend="superscript"> ,</hi>. In other words, the balance may possibly come to
                    rest at any position within a certain angle ± <hi rend="italic">β,</hi> which,
                    as an angle of deviation, corresponds to the overweight</p>
                <p>⅞={2(P.+1&gt;) + W}½.</p>
                <p>Assume now, secondly, that, say, the right terminal edge was slightly turned so
                    as no longer to be parallel to the middle edge. This <hi rend="italic">in
                    itself</hi> would not matter much, because although it might produce a change in
                    the length of the right arm, this change would be permanent, and the arm-length
                    again be constant, provided the hook-and-eye arrangement for the suspension of
                    the pan, and the arrestment, were ideally perfect. But, practically, they are
                    <hi rend="italic">not,</hi> and, moreover, the knife-edge and its bearing are
                    not what theory supposes them to be; and the effect, is the same as if the
                    virtual point of application A of the charge <hi rend="italic">Po + Pi</hi>
                    instead of being at the constant distance <hi rend="italic">I</hi> from the
                    centre, oscillated irregularly between <hi rend="italic">I</hi> + λ' and <hi
                    rend="italic">I -</hi> λ', where λ ’ has a similar meaning to that of λ <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 0</hi>. The joint effect of the imperfections of the three
                    pivots is that the indications of the balance, instead of being constant, are
                    variable within ± e, where e means a small weight determined approximately by
                    the equation—</p>
                <p>&lt;=∣{‰+2&gt;) + W]λ,+ 2(<hi rend="subscript"> i</hi> &gt; <hi rend="subscript">
                    0</hi> +p)λ} . (7X-</p>
                <p>Hence, in a balance to be constructed for a given purpose, <hi rend="italic"
                    >I</hi> must be made long enough to make sure of its compensating the effects of
                    the λ ’ s, which, for a given set of knife-edges, and a given degree of absolute
                    exactitude in their adjustment, may be assumed to have constant values.
                    Evidently in a given balance e has nothing to do with the sensibility, and
                    consequently it would be useless to increase the sensibility beyond what is
                    required to make the angle <hi rend="italic">β,</hi> corresponding to e <hi
                    rend="italic">(i.e.,</hi> that angle within which the balance is, so to speak,

                    further would, in general, be a mistake, because the greater the sensibility the
                    more markedly it varies with the charge, the less is the maximum overweight
                    which can be determined by the method of vibration, and, last not least, the
                    more slowly the balance will vibrate, because the time of vibration <hi

                <p>4. <hi rend="italic">Compound Lever Balances.—</hi> Of these numerous
                    inventions—in all of which a high degree of practical convenience is obtained at
                    the expense of precision—we must content ourselves with noticing two which, on
                    account of their extensive use, cannot be passed over. We here allude, in the
                    first place, to that particular kind of equal-armed lever balances, in which the
                    pane are situated above the beam, and which are known as “<hi rend="italic"
                    >Boberval’s balances;”</hi> and secondly, to those peculiar complex <hi
                    rend="italic">steel-yards</hi> which are used for the weighing of heavy loads by
                    means of comparatively small weights.</p>
                <p>In <hi rend="italic">Roberval’s</hi> balance (fig. 8), the beam consists of a
                    parallelogram, in which each of the four corners A, B, A', B' is a joint, and
                    which by means of two joints situated in the centres of the two longer sides AB
                    and A'B' is suspended from a vertical rod so that the two shorter sides A A' and
                    BB' under all circumstances stand vertical. With these two sides the pans are
                    rigidly connected; and the main feature in the machine is, that wherever the
                    charge in the pan may lie, <hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> whatever maybe the
                    virtual point of application of the whole charge P in regard to the vertical
                    side of the beam, its statical effect is the same as if P was concentrated in a
                    point D in the axis of the rod AA ’ or BB'. That this really is so is easily
                    proved. Imagine the particle weighing P units to be rigidly connected with, say,
                    A A,' but situated to the left of that line, and, whatever may be its distance
                    from AA', when the beam descends through a certain angle, the vertical
                    projection of the path described by the point D, <hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi>
                    its fall <hi rend="italic">h,</hi> has the same value whatever its distance from
                    AA ’. Hence the work done, say, against an elastic string tending to hold the
                    beam in its place, invariably is = P7⅛ as it would be if D was situated in
                    AA'.</p>

                <p>The ordinary <hi rend="italic">Decimal Balance</hi> is a combination of levers

                    suspended a pan for the weight. The pan is so adjusted that it balances the
                    bridge. Suppose the load P to be placed so that its centre of gravity is at <hi

                    several instruments bearing this name, the majority are no balances at all, but
                    machines for measuring horizontal forces (electric, magnetic, &lt;kc.), by the
                    extent to which they are able to distort an elastic wire vertically suspended
                    and fixed at its upper end. In the torsion <hi rend="italic">balances</hi>
                    proper the wire is stretched out horizontally, and supports a beam so fixed to
                    it that the wire passes through its centre of gravity. Hence the elasticity of
                    the wire here plays the same part as the weight of the beam does in the common
                    balance. An instrument of this sort was invented by Ritchie for the measurement
                    of very small weights, and for this purpose it may offer certain advantages;
                    but, clearly, if it were everto be used for measuring larger weights, the beam
                    would have to be supported by knife-edges and bearings, and in regard to such
                    application therefore <hi rend="italic">(he.,</hi> as a means for serious
