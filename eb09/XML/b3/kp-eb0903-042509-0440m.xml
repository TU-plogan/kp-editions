                    to drinking are not quarrelsome. They inhabit the densest jungles, and are very
                    shy, avoiding contact with strangers, and flying to the hills on the least
                    alarm; but they bear a good character for honesty and truthfulness. They are
                    very scantily dressed, wear a variety of trinkets, with a knife, hatchet, spear,
                    bow and arrow, the only weapons they use. Their hair is generally shaved,
                    excepting a topknot; and tvhen not shaved it gets into a matted, tangled mass,
                    gathered into a knot behind or on the crown. The Mhris, a class of the Markts,
                    live in still denser jungles, and have little or no communication with the
                    outside world. The Mâriâs and the Jhuriâs are supposed to be a subdivision of
                    the true Gond family. All the aboriginal tribes of Bastâr worship the deities of
                    the Hindu pantheon along with their own national goddess Danteswari.</p>
                <p>The eastern part of Bastir is a flat elevated plateau, from 1600 to 2000 feet
                    above the level of the sea, the centre and north-west portions are very
                    mountainous, and the southern parts are a mixture of hill and plain. On the
                    plateau there are but few hills; the streams run slowly, and the country is a
                    mixture of plain and undulating ground covered by dense <hi rend="italic"
                    >sàl</hi> forests. Principal mountains of the district—(1), A lofty range which
                    separates it from the Sironcha district; (2), a range of equal height called the
                    Bela Dili lying in the centre of the district; (3), a range running north and
                    south near Niriyanpur; (4), Tdngri Dongri range, running east and west; (5),
                    Tulsi Dongri, bordering on the Sabari River and the Jaipur state. There is also
                    a small range running from the River Indravati to the Godavari. The Indravati,
                    the Sabari, and the Til or Tilper, are the chief rivers of the district; all of
                    them affluents of the Godavari The soil throughout the greater portion of Bastir
                    consists of light clay, with an admixture of sand, suited for raising rice and
                    wet crops. Rice, sugar, and a little wheat and gram are the agricultural
                    products of Bastir. In the jungles the Marias and Maris rear kosri <hi
                    rend="italic">(Panicum</hi><hi rend="italic">italicum)</hi> and other inferior
                    grains. The aboriginal races generally follow the migratory system of tillage,
                    clearing the jungle on selected patches, and after taking crops for two or three
                    years abandoning them for new ground. Min's do not use the plough; nor do they
                    possess buffaloes, bullocks, or cows; their only agricultural implement is a
                    long-handled iron hoe. Lac, resin, wax, galls, horns, rice, a red dye called <hi
                    rend="italic">scndrt,</hi> wild arrow-root, molasses, teakwood, and tasar-silk
                    cocoons, are the chief staples of export. 'The imports, -which considerably
                    exceed tho exports, consist of salt, piece-goods, brass utensils, cocoa-nuts,
                    pepper, spices, opium, tuπneric, cotton, wheat, &amp;c. Iron-ore is found
                    towards the eastern portion of the state, but is not much worked; gold is also
                    found in certain places. Bastir is divided into two portions—that held by the
                    Raja or chief himself, and that possessed by feudatory chiefs under him. There
                    is not a single made road within the principality. The climate of Bastar is
                    unhealthy— fever, smallpox, dysentery, diarrhoea, and rheumatism being the
                    prevailing diseases. Jagdalpur, Bijipur, Madder, and Bhupàlpatnam are the only
                    places of any note in the dependency, the first-named being the residence of the
                    Raja and the chief people of the state. The grossest ignorance and superstition
                    prevail, and the people live in constant fear of being bewitched or ruined by
                    malicious magicians. The family of the Raja of Bastar claims to be of the purest
                    Rajput blood, and traces its origin to Warangal in the Dakhin, about the
                    commencement of the 14th century. The revenue of Bastar is supposed to be £3610;
                    the tribute paid by the chief to the British Government is £305, 12s.</p>
