                    the indoor follows the same plan, modified only by circumstances affecting a

                    Turf or asphalt is the best The size of the ground varies from 40ft. by 20 ft.
                    to 30 ft. by 15 ft., according to the space at command and the activity of the
                    players.</p>
                <p>The ground is divided into <hi rend="italic">courts</hi> as shown in the diagram,

                    defined by means of whiting and water, or pegged-down tape, the former being
                    preferable.</p>
                <p>On each of the spots marked “post,” half-way between the service lines, and 15
                    ft. apart, a <hi rend="italic">post</hi> about 6 ft. high must be erected,
                    either on a stand or driven into the ground, and supported by guy-ropes.</p>
                <p>A <hi rend="italic">net,</hi> about 5 ft. 6 in. or 5 ft. high should be stretched
                    from post to post. The depth of the net is of but little consequence. Where
                    expense is no object, it should reach to the ground.</p>
                <p>The implements required in playing the game are</p>
                <p>(1), <hi rend="italic">shuttlecocks,</hi> and (2), <hi rend="italic">rackets</hi>
                    or <hi rend="italic">battledores.</hi> The former should be about 5 in. high,
                    and about 1 oz. in weight. For outdoor play the shuttlecocks are sometimes made
                    heavier by being loaded with lead. The body should be covered with india-rubber.
                    The rackets should be similar to those used at the game of the same name, only
                    smaller about 2 ft. 6 in. long.</p>
                <p>The game consists in sending the shuttlecock with the racket over the net,
                    forwards and backwards, until one of the players fails to return it. The players
                    decide by lot which shall commence or have first <hi rend="italic">hand-in</hi>
                    and choice of ends. The player who is hand-in (say A) stations himself in one of
                    the courts at his end, his adversary (say B) in the diagonally opposed court at
                    the other end. A. then <hi rend="italic">serves</hi> to B., <hi rend="italic"
                    >i.e.,</hi> A. standing in the court chosen by him, strikes the shuttlecock over
                    the net with the racket into the diagonally opposed court. B. then has to <hi
                    rend="italic">return the service</hi> by striking the shuttlecock back over the
                    net without allowing it to touch the ground, and so on alternately until one
                    player fails. If this is the player who served, he is hand-out, his adversary
                    becomes hand-in, and serves, and no score accrues. But if the player failing is
                    the one who was served to, his adversary scores one point towards game, called
                    an <hi rend="italic">ace.</hi> The player who first scores 15 aces wins the
                    game; but if the score arrives at 14 all, it is necessary for one player to
                    score two consecutive aces in order to win.</p>
                <p>The server must serve according to the following conditions :—He must stand with
                    both feet in the court served from; he must send the shuttlecock clean over the
                    net <hi rend="italic">(i.e.,</hi> without touching net or posts), and so that it
                    will drop into or beyond the service line bounding the court served into, and
                    into the diagonally opposed court. If he fails to comply with these conditions
                    it is a <hi rend="italic">fault,</hi> and he has to serve again. Two consecutive
                    faults put his hand out.</p>
                <p>The server’s hand is also out if he fails to send the shuttlecock over the net;
                    if he hits the shuttlecock beyond the external boundary of the ground, or more
                    than once; or, if after the server has loosed it, it touches him. No fault is
                    allowed for these failures, as they are considered more serious than those first
                    enumerated. After service is properly given, if either player fails to return
                    the shuttlecock clean over the net, and so that it drops within the external
                    boundary of the ground on the side of the net furthest from the striker, the
                    player failing loses an ace, or is hand-out as the case may be. It will be
                    observed that in the service the shuttlecock must be s,ent from right court to
                    right court, or from left to left, but in the return, by either player, it is
                    only required that the shuttlecock shall drop within any part of the ground,
                    bounded by the external line of all. In addition the shuttlecock must be struck
                    before it touches the ground, and must be touched only with the racket, and must
                    only be hit once, otherwise it counts against the striker. If the shuttlecock
                    drops on the line enclosing the court served into, or in the return drops on the
                    boundary line, it is generally reckoned as a <hi rend="italic">let, i.e.,</hi>
                    the stroke or innings goes for nothing, and the server serves again. But this is
                    an utterly useless rule, and it is better to count everything that drops on the
                    line to the striker.</p>
                <p>In the case of a fault, or in the case of returns that are not according to the
                    conditions, if the adversary returns or attempts to return the shuttlecock, the
                    service or return counts the same as though it had been properly made. If the
                    server scores he serves again, this time from his other court, and so on
                    alternately from one court to the other as long as he scores. When he is
                    hand-out, his adversary commences serving from either of the courts at his end,
                    and, on scoring, serves from his other court, and so on. In partner games the
                    disposition of the players, and the rules by which they conduct the game, as to
                    the two hands in, and so forth, are identical with those which prevail at lawn
                    tennis. See <hi rend="smallcaps">Tennis. (h. j.)</hi></p>
