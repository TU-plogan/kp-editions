                    aversion and contempt. At the age of twelve he was sent to the École Centrale,
                    newly established at Grenoble, and continued in attendance for four years,
                    during which time he distinguished himself in all his studies, <hi

                    École Polytechnique when his plans were disturbed by an offer from Μ. Daru, a
                    distant relative, cf some appointment connected with the ministry for war. In
                    the following year he accompanied Μ. Daru to Milan, on the chance of some
                    suitable post offering itself. He was present at the battle of Marengo; and
                    carried away, apparently, by the military enthusiasm consequent on <pb

                    enlisted . as quartermaster in a dragoon regiment. In a month’s time he was made
                    sub-lieutenant, and for about a year and a half acted as aide-de-camp to General
                    Michaud. But the routine of garrison life, to which he was soon afterwards
                    condemned, made him heartily tired of a military career. On the conclusion of
                    the peace of Amiens (1802) he threw up his commission, and went to reside with
                    his family at Grenoble. From them he obtained means to take up his abode in
                    Paris, where for some time he continued to devote himself to study and literary
                    work. In 1805 he suddenly accepted a situation as clerk in a mercantile house at
                    Marseilles, and remained there nearly a year,—in fact, till the actress, for
                    whose sake he had taken this curious step, married a wealthy Russian. In the
                    following year he again accompanied Μ. Daru into Germany, and was appointed to
                    superintend the possessions of the emperor in Brunswick. Whatever German
                    he.learnt there was afterwards completely forgotten. In his official capacity as
                    connected with the commissariat he took part in the ill-fated Russian campaign
                    of 1812, and remained loyal to the fallen emperor. He declined to lay himself
                    out for employment under the new régime, and retired to Milan, where he resided
                    till 1821. His early works, chiefly on painting and music, date from this period
                    of his life. The <hi rend="italic">Lettres écrites</hi><hi rend="italic">de

                    under the pseudonym of Alexandre César Bombet, were mainly plagiarized from
                    Carpani. With some slight alterations the work was reproduced in 1817 as <hi

                    to France, an unfounded suspicion that he was a French spy having somehow arisen
                    at Milan. During the following nine years he resided at Paris, and gradually
                    began to acquire his high reputation as an accomplished litterateur and man of
                    the world. He was an admirable talker and full of anecdote, which in his opinion
                    ought to form the staple of conversation. His fine analytic powers were
                    displayed to full advantage in the curious work, <hi rend="italic">De Ï</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Amour,</hi> which he published in 1822, but the book did not find
                    an appreciative audience. The <hi rend="italic">Vie de Rossini,</hi> which
                    followed, was more successful; and the pamphlet <hi rend="italic">Racine</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">et</hi><hi rend="italic">Shakespeare</hi> did good service for the
                    cause of Romanticism in its struggle with the rigid classical canons of older
                    French literature. In 1829 appeared his <hi rend="italic">Promenades dans
                    Rome,</hi> full of information, criticism, and original observation, but
                    somewhat chaotic in form. He was appointed consul at Trieste in 1830, and three
                    years later he quitted that place with the greatest joy for a similar post at
                    Civita Vecchia. There he remained till 1841, with frequent absences, one
                    extending from 1836 to 1839, during which he paid a short visit to London. In
                    1841 his health gave way, and he returned to Paris, where he died on the 22d
                    March 1842.</p>
                <p>Beyle, during his lifetime, was known to but a very small circle of readers;
                    within the last twenty years, however, his popularity has greatly increased, and
                    his many fine powers have received due recognition. It is not probable that he
                    will ever have a very extended influence; his writings are “caviare to the
                    general,” and can only be appreciated by those qualified to take pleasure in the
                    cynical reflections of mere egotism. For Beyle’s philosophical creed, so far as
                    he can be said to have had one, was materialism, and his ideal of humanity
                    aesthetically refined selfishness. His strength lay in keen criticism and in
                    acute psychological analysis, qualities which gave value to his writings on art,
                    but debarred him from success in the department of fiction. His principal
                    novels, <hi rend="italic">Le</hi><hi rend="italic">Rouge</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >et le</hi><hi rend="italic">Noir,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">La</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Chartreuse</hi><hi rend="italic">de Parme,</hi> fell comparatively
                    dead, though the latter was received with extravagant eulogy by Balzac, and has
                    recently become more popular. His genius was too analytic to be suited for
                    romance writings; the novels want consistency of plot and motive power in the
                    characters. Zα <hi rend="italic">Chartreuse,</hi> however, the best of them,
                    gives an admirable picture of the involved intrigues of a small Italian court, a
                    subject with which Beyle was specially qualified to deal. The peculiar value of
                    all his writings consists in the amount of thinking which they excite, though it
                    must be confessed that the subjects are frequently unworthy of the attention
                    devoted to them. The fullest account of Beyle is that by A. A. Paton, <hi
