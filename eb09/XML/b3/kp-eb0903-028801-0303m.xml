                    rend="italic">ballet,</hi> to the old English word <hi rend="italic"
                    >ballette,</hi> and to <hi rend="italic">ballad.</hi> In old French, according
                    to Rousseau, <hi rend="italic">ballet</hi> signifies “to dance, to sing, to
                    rejoice;” and thus it incorporates three distinct modern words, “ballet, ball,
                    and ballad.” Through the gradual changes in the amusements of different ages,
                    the meaning of the first two words has at length become limited to dancing, and
                    the third is now confined to singing. But, although ballads are no longer the
                    vocal accompaniments to danco3 round the maypole, our old ballads are still sung
                    to dance tunes. The present acceptation of the word <hi rend="italic"
                    >ballet</hi> is—a theatrical representation in which a story is told only by
                    gesture, accompanied by music which should be characterised by stronger emphasis
                    than would be employed with the voice. The dancing should be connected with the
                    story, but is more commonly incidental. The French word was found to be so
                    comprehensive as to require further definition, and thus the above-described
                    would be distinguished as the <hi rend="italic">ballet cΓaction</hi> or
                    pantomime ballet, while a single scene, such as that of a village festival with
                    its dances, would now be termed a <hi rend="italic">divertissement.</hi></p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">ballet d'action,</hi> to which the changed meaning of the
                    word is to be ascribed, and therewith the introduction of modern ballet, has
                    been generally attributed to the 16th century. Novelty of entertainment was then
                    sought for in the splendid courts of Italy, in order to celebrate events which
                    were thought great in their time, such as the marriages of princes, or the
                    triumphs of their arms. Invention was on the rack for novelty, and the skill of
                    the machinist was taxed to the utmost. It has been supposed that the art of the
                    old Roman <hi rend="italic">pantomimi</hi> was then revived, to add to the
                    attractions of court-dances. Under the Roman empire the <hi rend="italic"
                    >pantomimi</hi> had represented either a mythological story, or perhaps a scene
                    from a Greek tragedy, by mute gestures, while a chorus, placed in the
                    background, sang <hi rend="italic">cantica</hi> to narrate the fable, or to
                    describe the action of the scene. The question is whether mute pantomimic
                    action, which is the essence of modern ballet, was carried through those court
                    entertainments, in which kings, queens, princes, and princesses took parts with
                    the courtiers; or whether it is of later growth, and derived from professional
                    dancers upon the stage. The former is the general opinion, but an analysis of
                    the only ballet which is known to have been printed in a complete form during
                    the 16th century, would lead to the inference that the court entertainments of
                    Italy and France were masques, or masks, which included declamation and song,
                    like those of Ben Jonson with Inigo J0ne3 for the court of James I.</p>
                <p>The introduction of the Italian style of ballet into France was on the occasion
                    of the marriage of the Duc de Joyeuse with Mdlle. de Vaudemont, sister to the
                    queen. This was in 1581; and the ballet was printed in 1582, in a small folio of
                    eighty-two leaves, with music, dialogue, engravings of the scene and of the
                    fancy dresses, and full details of the plot. It is entitled <hi rend="italic"
                    >Balet</hi><hi rend="italic">Comique de la Royne,</hi> because the queen took a
                    part in it, as one of the naiades, with her ladies; but they were only posed
                    upon machinery to be looked at, and neither spoke nor sang. One lady of the
                    court sang a song, two others a duet, and, again, others a chorus. Jupiter and
                    Mercury each sang a song, but Circe and the rest spoke poetry. The king’s
                    musicians, as tritons, were the mainstays of the music; the ladies and gentlemen
                    of the court appeared in splendid fancy dresses, and danced the entrées. The
                    inventor of the ballet was Baltazarini Belgioioso, who had assumed the name of
                    Baltasar de Beaujoyeux upon his appointment as first musician to</p>
                <p>Catherine de Medicis, queen dowager of Trance. The disuse of dialogue and of
                    vocal music in ballet seems to have been arrived at only by degrees. One of the
                    most complete books upon the subject is by the Jesuit Le Père Menestrier (Claude
                    François) <hi rend="italic">Des Ballets</hi><hi rend="italic">Anciens et
                    Modernes,</hi> 12mo, 1681. He was the inventor of a ballet for Louis XIV. in
                    1658; and in his book he analyses about fifty of the early Italian and French
                    ballets. His definition is as follows :— “Ballets are dumb comedies, which
                    should be divided into acts and scenes, like other theatrical pieces.
                    Recitations divide them into acts, and the entrées of dancers are equal in
                    number to the scenes.” So recitation had not then been dispensed with. At length
                    the opinion gained ground that, iu stage representations, the actions, feelings,
                    and passions could be more faithfully, gracefully, and intelligibly expressed to
                    the eye by pantomimic action, than it would be possible to do to the ear. The
                    art of dramatic expression then became a greater object of study; and, perhaps,
                    from about the middle of the last century, or in the time of Noverre, the
                    spectators have been prepared only by a short printed summary of the story which
                    was to be represented. (w. <hi rend="smallcaps">ch.)</hi></p>
