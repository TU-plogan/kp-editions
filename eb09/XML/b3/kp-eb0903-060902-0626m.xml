                    celebrated Swiss chronometer-maker, was born in Neufchâtel. The date of his
                    birth is variously given as 1725, 1727, and 1729. His father was an architect,
                    and the son was intended for the church; but, showing a taste for mechanics, he
                    was placed under an experienced workman to be instructed in clock and watch
                    making, and was afterwards sent to Paris to improve himself in the knowledge and
                    practice of the art. He settled in Paris in 1745, and applied himself to the
                    making of chronometers, an art which was then in its infancy. He soon attained
                    distinction for the excellence of his workmanship and the accuracy of his
                    chronometers. Fleurieu and Borda, by order of the French Government, made a
                    voyage from La Rochelle to the West Indies and Newfoundland for the purpose of
                    testing them, and they found that they gave the longitude with an error of only
                    a quarter of a degree, after a cruise of six weeks. Satisfactory results were
                    also obtained in the expedition of Verdun, Borda, and Pingré, which was
                    appointed to try these chronometers and those of his only rival, Le Roy. Sully,

                    the first who in that city attempted the construction of chronometers for
                    finding the longitude; and this he did in 1724. In 1736 the chronometers of the
                    English artist Harrison were tried at sea. In France, however, there were no
                    chronometer-makers of note after Sully, till Pierre le Roy and Ferdinand
                    Berthoud, between whom there was some discussion about the priority of their
                    discoveries and improvements. Ferdinand Berthoud’s chronometers were long the
                    most esteemed of any in France. Louis Berthoud, his nephew and successor,
                    introduced some improvements, and made chronometers of a smaller size and
                    therefore more portable. Berthoud was a member of the French Institute, a fellow
                    of the Royal Society of London, and a member of the Legion of Honour. He was
                    regular in his habits, and retained the use of his faculties to the last. He
                    died of hydrothorax, at his country house, in the valley of Montmorency, in
                    1807, aged about eighty. The principal of his published works arc <hi
