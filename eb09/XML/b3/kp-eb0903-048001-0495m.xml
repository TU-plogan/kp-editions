                    While still an undergraduate, he published his <hi rend="italic">Bridés</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Tragedy,</hi> a piece less characterized by originality than his
                    subsequent performances, and altogether in the taste of the Elizabethan revival
                    of the day initiated by the publication of Lamb’s <hi rend="italic"
                    >Specimens.</hi> The notice it obtained from Barry Cornwall and other
                    representatives of this school, encouraged him to devote himself altogether to
                    the cultivation of dramatic poetry; and he speedily produced a number of superb
                    fragments, ranging down from the ambitious but unfinished sketches for tragedies
                    to be entitled <hi rend="italic">Torrismond</hi> and <hi rend="italic">The
                    Second Brother,</hi> to short descriptive passages of a few lines each,
                    unsurpassed for originality of conception and condensed force. His genius,
                    unfortunately, though highly poetical, was in no respect dramatic; he entirely
                    lacked the power of constructing a plot and deducing character from action; and
                    his endeavours to achieve a complete work proved abortive until 1829, when the
                    strangely fascinating but fantastic and incoherent drama of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Death's Jest-Book,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">The Fool's Tragedy,</hi> was
                    laboriously put together from a series of abortive attempts. By this time
                    Beddoes had become a resident in Germany, and a zealous student of physiology,
                    which, by affording another outlet for that intense curiosity respecting the
                    mysteries of life and death which had hitherto been the mainspring of his
                    poetical efforts, greatly contributed to repress the external manifestations of
                    his genius. Dissatisfaction with his tragedy, which he never cared to publish
                    during his lifetime, and the gradual disuse of his native language, conspired to
                    reduce him to silence. He led for several years an unsettled life on the
                    Continent, devoted to anatomical research, and actively participating in liberal
                    and democratic movements in Germany and Switzerland, until his death in 1849
                    from the effects of an accident. His literary remains were published in 1851 by
                    his friend Mr Kelsall, with a most interesting memoir, and copious selections
                    from his graphic and striking correspondence, which is distinguished by all the
                    characteristics of his verse. Beddoes is a poet for poets, and few other readers
                    will enjoy him. He is “of imagination all compact;” his works scarcely contain a
                    single passage of purely subjective feeling. He is, perhaps, the most concrete
                    poet of his day; the most disposed to express sentiment by imagery and material
                    symbolism. In this he resembles Keats, and may be termed a Gothic Keats, the
                    Teutonic counterpart of his more celebrated contemporary’s Hellenism. The spirit
                    of Gothic architecture seems to live in his verse, its grandeur and
                    grotesqueness, its mystery and its gloom. His relation to the Elizabethan
                    dramatists, moreover, is nearly the same as that of Keats to the Elizabethan
                    pastoral poets; but the resemblance is one of innate temperament: he borrowed
                    nothing, either from his Elizabethan precursors or the chief objects of his
                    admiration among his contemporaries, Keats and Shelley. The want of constructive
                    power which mars his dramas is even more prejudicial to his lyrics; but some few
                    songs, where the right key-note has been struck from the first, rank among the
                    most perfect in our language. The leading features of Beddoes’s personal
                    character were uncompromising independence, sterling integrity, and a thorough
                    disdain for the opinion of the world. His life was entirely devoted to ideal
                    aims, and his tastes were of the most simple and philosophic character. The
                    asperity of his demeanour repelled strangers, but he was highly valued by the
                    few whose intimacy he condescended to encourage.</p>
