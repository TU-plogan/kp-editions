                    Italian Jesuit and littérateur, was born at Mantua on the 18th of July 1718.
                    After studying under the Jesuits in his native city and at Bologna, he entered
                    the society in 1736. He taught the belles-lettres, from 1739 to 1744, at
                    Brescia, where the Cardinal Quirini, Count Mazzuchelli, Count Duranti, and other
                    scholars, formed an illustrious academy, He next went to Bologna to pursue the
                    study of divinity, and there he enjoyed the society of many learned and literary
                    men. At the age of thirty he went to Venice, where he became professor of
                    rhetoric, and was on friendly terms with the most illustrious persons of that
                    city and state. The superintendence of the college of nobles at Parma was
                    entrusted to him in 1751; and he had principal charge of the studies of poetry
                    and history, and the entertainments of the theatre. He remained there eight
                    years, visiting, at intervals, other cities of Italy, either on the affairs of
                    his order, for pleasure, or for health. In 1755 he traversed part of Germany,
                    proceeded as far as Strasburg and Nancy, and returned by way of Germany into
                    Italy, taking with him two young sons or nephews of the prince of Hohenlohe, who
                    had requested him to take charge of their education. He made, the year
                    following, another journey into France, along with the eldest of his pupils; and
                    during this excursion he wrote his famoue <hi rend="italic">Lettere died
                    di</hi><hi rend="italic">Virgilio</hi><hi rend="italic">agli</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Arcadi,</hi> which were published at Venice with his <hi
                    rend="italic">sciolti</hi> verses, and those of Frugoni and Algarotti. The
                    opinions maintained in these letters against the two great Italian poets and
                    particularly against Dante, created him many enemies, and embroiled him with
                    Algarotti. In 1758 he went into Lorraine, to the court of King Stanislaus, who
                    sent him on a matter of business to visit Voltaire. Voltaire presented him with
                    a copy of his works, with a flattering inscription in allusion to Bettinelli’s
                    <hi rend="italic">Letters of Virgil.</hi> From Geneva he returned to Parma,
                    where he arrived in 1759. He afterwards lived for some years at Verona and
                    Modena, and he had just been appointed professor of rhetoric there’ when, in
                    1773, the order of Jesuits was abolished in Italy. Bettinelli then returned into
                    his own country, and resumed his literary labours with new ardour. The siege of
                    Mantua by the French compelled him to leave the city, and he retired to Verona,
                    where he formed an intimate friendship with the Chevalier Hippolito Pindemonti.
                    In 1797 he returned to Mantua. Though nearly eighty years old he resumed his
                    labours and his customary manner of life. He undertook in 1799 a complete
                    edition of his works, which was published at Venice in 24 vols. 12mo. Arrived at
                    the age of ninety years, he still retained his gaiety and vivacity of mind, and
                    died on the 13th September 1808. The works of Bettinelli are now of little
                    value. The only one still deserving remembrance, perhaps, is the <hi
