                    of bodily activity, he became a great reader and diligent student. In 1807 he
                    entered Brasenose College, Oxford, intending at first to study for the
                    profession of the law. Circumstances, however, induced him to change his mind
                    and to enter the church. The choice seems surprising, for he had from childhood
                    displayed that propensity to fun in the form of parody and punning which
                    afterwards made him a reputation. In 1813 he was ordained and took a country
                    curacy; he married in the following year, and in 1821 removed to London on
                    obtaining the appointment of minor canon of St Paul’s Cathedral. Three years
                    later he became one of the priests in ordinary of his Majesty’s chapel royal. In
                    1826 he first contributed to <hi rend="italic">Blackwood's Magazine;</hi> and on
                    the establishment of <hi rend="italic">Bentley's Miscellany</hi> in 1837 he
                    began to furnish the series of grotesque metrical tales known as <hi
                    rend="italic">The Ingoldsby Legends.</hi> These became very popular, were
                    published in a collected form, and have since passed through numerous editions.
                    In variety and whimsicality of rhymes these verses have hardly a rival since the
                    days of <hi rend="italic">Hudibras.</hi> But beneath this obvious popular
                    quality there lies a store of solid antiquarian learning, the fruit of patient
                    enthusiastic research by the light of the midnight lamp, in out-of-the-way old
                    books, which few readers who laugh over his pages detect. If it were of any
                    avail we might regret that a more active faculty of veneration did not keep him
                    from writing some objectionable passages of the <hi rend="italic">Legends.</hi>
                    His life was grave, dignified, and highly honoured. His sound judgment and his
                    kind heart made him the trusted counsellor, the valued friend, and the frequent
                    peacemaker; and he was intolerant of all that was mean, and base, and false. In
                    politics he was a Tory of the old school; yet he was the life-long friend of the
                    liberal Sydney Smith, whom in many respects he singularly resembled. Theodore
                    Hook was one of his most intimate friends. Mr Barham was a contributor to the
                    <hi rend="italic">Edinburgh Review</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">Literary
                    Gazette;</hi> published a novel in 3 vols., entitled fl/y <hi rend="italic"
                    >Cousin Nicholas;</hi> and, strange to tell, wrote nearly a third of the
                    articles in Gorton’s <hi rend="italic">Biographical Dictionary.</hi> His life
                    was not without such changes and sorrows as make men grave. Ho had nine
                    children, and six of them died in his lifetime. But he retained vigour and
                    freshness of heart and mind to the last, and his latest verses show no signs of
                    decay. He died in London after a long, painful illness, June 17, 1845, leaving
                    his beloved wife, two daughters, and a son, surviving him. A short memoir, by
                    his son, was prefixed to a new edition of <hi rend="italic">Ingoldsby</hi> in
                    1847, and a fuller <hi rend="italic">Life and Letters</hi> was published in 2
                    vols, in 1870.</p>
