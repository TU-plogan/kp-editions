                    rend="smallcaps">Severinus,</hi> is described by Gibbon “as the last of the
                    Romans whom Cato or Tully could have acknowledged for their countryman.” The
                    events of his life are involved in uncertainty. The historians of the day give
                    us but imperfect records or make unsatisfactory allusions. Later chroniclers
                    indulged in the fictitious and the marvellous, and it is almost exclusively from
                    his own books that trustworthy information can be obtained.</p>
                <p>There is considerable diversity among authorities as to the name of Boetius. One
                    editor of his <hi rend="italic">De</hi><hi rend="italic">Consolatione,</hi>
                    Bertius, thinks that he bore the praenomen of Flavius, but there is no authority
                    for this supposition. His father bore the name of Flavius, and it is probable
                    that the Flavius Boetius who was praetorian praefect, and who was put to death
                    in 455 <hi rend="smallcaps">a.d.,</hi> by order of Valentinian HL, was the
                    grandfather of the subject of our notice; but these circumstances form no good
                    reason for supposing that he also had the praenomen of Flavius. Many of the
                    earlier editions inserted the name of Torquatus, but it is not found in any of
                    the best manuscripts. The last name is generally written Boethius, from the idea
                    that it is connected with the Greek <hi rend="italic">βοηθός',</hi> but here,
                    again, the best manuscripts agree in reading Boetius, and the latest editors
                    have adopted this form.</p>
                <p>The date of his birth is unknown; but it is conjectured on good grounds that he
                    was born at Rome somewhere about the year 475 <hi rend="smallcaps">a.d.</hi> He
                    was, therefore, too young to see the last of the Roman emperors (476), and his
                    boyhood was spent in Rome while Odoacer, king of the Heruli, was monarch of that
                    city. We know nothing of his early years. A passage in a treatise falsely
                    ascribed to him <hi rend="italic">(De</hi><hi rend="italic">Disciplina
                    Scholarium)</hi> and a misinterpretation of a passage in Cassiodorus, led early
                    scholars to suppose that he spent a long time in Athens pursuing his studies
                    there; but later biographers have seen that there is no foundation for this
                    opinion. His father, Flavius Manlius Boetius was consul in the year 487. It is
                    probable that he died soon after; for Boetius states that, when he was bereaved
                    of his parent, men of the highest rank took him under their charge <hi
                    rend="italic">(De Con.,</hi> lib. iil c. 3). He soon became well known for his
                    energy and ability, and his high rank gave him access to the noblest families.
                    He married Rusticiana, the daughter of the senator Symmachus. By her he had two
                    sons, Anicius Manlius Severinus Boetius and Q. Aurelius Memmius Symmachus. When
                    Theodoric, the king of the Ostrogoths, displaced Odoacer no change of fortune
                    for the worse seems to have befallen Boetius. On the contrary he became a
                    favourite with that monarch, and was one of his intimate friends. Boetius
                    attained to the consulship in 510, and his sons, while still young, held the
                    same honour together (522). Boetius regarded it as the height of his good
                    fortune when he witnessed his two sons, consuls at the same time, convoyed from
                    their home to the senatehouse by a crowd of senators amidst the enthusiasm of
                    the masses. On that day, he tells us, while his sons occupied the curule chairs
                    in the senate-house, he himself had the honour of pronouncing a panegyric on the
                    monarch, and placed between his two sons he distributed largesses among, the
                    people in the circus. But his good fortune did not last, and he attributes the
                    calamities that came upon him to the ill-will which his bold maintenance of
                    justice had caused, and to his opposition to every oppressive measure. “How
                    often,” he says, “have I opposed the attacks of Conigastus on the property of
                    the weak <hi rend="italic">Ί</hi> how often have I kept Trigguilla, the
                    chamberlain of the palace, from perpetrating acts of injustice? how often have I
                    protected, by influence exercised at my own peril, the miserable whom the
                    licensed avarice of the barbarians always harassed with endless insults?” And
                    then he mentions several particular cases. A famine had begun to rage. The
                    prefect of the praetorium was determined to satisfy the soldiers, regardless
                    altogether of the feelings of the provincials. He accordingly issued an edict
                    for a <hi rend="italic">coemptio,</hi> that is, an order compelling the
                    provincials <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit03newyrich/page/n873/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0903-0873-0856"/> to sell their corn to the Government, whether
                    they would or not. This edict would have utterly ruined Campania. Boetius
                    interfered. The case was brought before the king, and Boetius succeeded in
                    averting the <hi rend="italic">coemptio</hi> from the Campanians. He also
                    rescued Paulinus, a man of consular rank, from the jaws of those whom he calls
                    <hi rend="italic">palatinoe</hi><hi rend="italic">canes</hi> (dogs of the
                    palace), and who, he says, had almost devoured his riches. And he gives as a
                    third and crowning instance in that he exposed himself to the hatred of the
                    informer Cyprianus by preventing the punishment of Albinus, a man of consular
                    rank. He mentions in another place that when at Verona the king was anxious to
                    transfer the accusation of treason brought against Albinus to the whole senate,
                    he defended the senate at great risk. In consequence of the ill-will that
                    Boetius had thus roused, he was accused of treason towards the end of the reign
                    of Theodoric. Three accusers appeared against him. The first, Basilius, had been
                    expelled from the monarch’s service, and in consequence of debt he had become an
                    informer and now appeared against Boetius. The other two were Opilio and
                    Gaudentius, on whom sentence of banishment had been pronounced on account of
                    innumerable frauds. They first took refuge in a church, but when this fact
                    became known, a decree was issued that if they did not leave Ravenna before a
                    prescribed day, they were to be driven out with a brand upon their forehead. On
                    the very last day allowed them they gave information against Boetius, and their
                    information was received. The accusation which these villains brought against
                    him was that he had conspired against the king, that he was anxious to maintain
                    the integrity of the senate, and to restore Rome to liberty, and that for this
                    purpose he had written to the Emperor Justin. Justin had, no doubt, special
                    reasons for wishing to see an end to the reign of Theodoric. Justin was
                    orthodox. Theodoric was an Arian. The orthodox subjects of Theodoric were
                    suspicious of their ruler; and mauy would gladly have joined in a plot to
                    displace him. The knowledge of this fact may have rendered Theodoric suspicious.
                    But Boetius denied the accusation in unequivocal terms. He did indeed wish the
                    integrity of the senate. He would fain have desired liberty, but all hope of it
                    was gone. The letters addressed by him to Justin were forgeries, and he had not
                    been guilty of any conspiracy. Notwithstanding his innocence he was condemned
                    and sent to Ticinum (Pavia) where he was thrown into prison. It was during his
                    confinement in this prison that he wrote his famous work <hi rend="italic"
                    >De</hi><hi rend="italic">Consolatione</hi><hi rend="italic">Philosophioe.</hi>
                    His goods were confiscated, and after an imprisonment of considerable duration
                    he was put to death in 525. Procopius relates that Theodoric soon repented of
                    his cruel deed, and that his death, which took place soon after, was hastened by
                    remorse for the crime he had committed against his great counsellor.</p>
                <p>Two or three centuries after the death of Boetius writers began to view his death
                    as a martyrdom. Several Christian books were in circulation which were ascribed
                    to him, and there was one especially on the Trinity which they regarded as proof
                    that he had taken an active part against the heresy of Theodoric. It was
                    therefore for his orthodoxy that Boetius was put to death. And these writers
                    delight to paint with minuteness the horrible tortures to which he was exposed
                    and the marvellous actions which the saint performed at his death. He was
                    canonized as Saint Severinus. The brick tower in Pavia in which he was confined
                    was a hallowed building. And finally, in the year 996, Otho III. ordered the
                    bones of Boetius to be taken out of the place in which they had lain hid, and to
                    be placed in the church of St Augustine within a splendid marble tomb, for which
                    Gerbert, who afterwards became Pope under the name of Silvester II., wrote an
                    inscription.</p>
                <p>It should be mentioned also that some have given him a decidedly Christian wife,
                    of the name of Elpis, who wrote hymns, two of which are still extant (Daniel,
                    <hi rend="italic">Thes. Hymn.,</hi> i. p. 156). This is a pure supposition
                    inconsistent with chronology, unauthenticated by authority, and based only on a
                    misinterpretation of a passage in the <hi rend="italic">De</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Consolatione.</hi></p>
                <p>The contemporaries of Boetius regarded him as a man of profound learning.
                    Priscian the grammarian speaks of him as having attained the summit of honesty
                    and of all sciences. Cassiodorus, the chancellor of Theodoric and the intimate
                    acquaintance of the philosopher, employs language equally strong. And Ennodius,
                    the bishop of Pavia, knows no bounds for his admiration. “You surpass,” he says
                    to Boetius, “the eloquence of the ancients in imitating it.” The king Theodoric
                    had a profound idea of his great scientific abilities. He employed him in
                    setting right the coinage. When he visited Rome with Gunibald king of the
                    Burgundians, he took him to Boetius, who showed them, amongst other mechanical
                    contrivances, a sun-dial and a water-clock. The foreign monarch was astonished,
                    and, at the request of Theodoric, Boetius had to prepare others of a similar
                    nature, which were sent as presents to Gunibald. It was Boetius also whom
                    Theodoric consulted when Clovis, king of the Franks, wished a musician who could
                    sing to the accompaniment of the lyre, and Boetius was charged with the duty of
                    selecting him.</p>
                <p>The fame of Boetius increased after his death, and his influence during the
                    Middle Ages was exceedingly powerful. His circumstances peculiarly favoured this
                    influence. He appeared at a time when contempt for intellectual pursuits had
                    begun to pervade society. In his early years he was seized with a passionate
                    enthusiasm for Greek literature, and this continued through life. Even amidst
                    the cares of the consulship he found time for commenting on the <hi
                    rend="italic">Categories</hi> of Aristotle. The idea laid hold of him of
                    reviving the spirit of his countrymen by imbuing them with the thoughts of the
                    great Greek writers. He formed the resolution to translate all the works of
                    Aristotle and all the dialogues of Plato, and to reconcile the philosophy of
                    Plato with that of the Stagirite. He did not succeed in all that he designed;
                    but he did a great part of his work. “Through your translations,” says
                    Cassiodorus to him, “the music of Pythagoras and the astronomy of Ptolemaeus are
                    read by the Italians; the arithmetic of Nicomachus and the geometry of Euclid
                    are heard by the Westerns; the theology of Plato and the logic of Aristotle
                    dispute in the language of Quirinus; the mechanical Archimedes also you have
                    restored in a Latin dress to the Sicilians; and whatever discipline or arts
                    fertile Greece has produced through the efforts of individual men, Rome has
                    received in her own language through your single instrumentality.” Boetius
                    translated into Latin Aristotle’s <hi rend="italic">Analytica</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Priora et Posteriora,</hi> the <hi rend="italic">Topica,</hi> and
                    <hi rend="italic">Elenchi Sophistici;</hi> and he wrote commentaries on
                    Aristotle’s <hi rend="italic">Categories,</hi> on his book <hi rend="italic"
                    >π</hi><hi rend="italic">ϵ</hi><hi rend="italic">ρ</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >ὶ</hi><hi rend="italic">έρμην</hi><hi rend="italic">ϵ</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >ίας,</hi> also a commentary on the <hi rend="italic">Isagoge</hi> of
                    Porphyrius. These works formed to a large extent the source from which the
                    Middle Ages derived their knowledge of Aristotle. (See Stahr, <hi rend="italic"
                    >Aristoteles</hi><hi rend="italic">bei den Romern,</hi> pp. 196-234.)</p>
                <p>But Boetius did not confine himself to Aristotle. He wrote a commentary on the
                    <hi rend="italic">Topica</hi> of Cicero; and he was also the author of
                    independent works on logic :— <hi rend="italic">Introductio</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">ad Categoricos</hi><hi rend="italic">Syllogismos,</hi> in one

                <p>We have also seen from the statement of Cassiodorus that he furnished manuals for
                    the quadrivium of the schools of the Middle Ages (the “<hi rend="italic"
                    >guattuor malheseos discipline,”</hi><pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit03newyrich/page/n874/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0903-0874-0857"/> as Boetius calls them) on arithmetic, music,
                    geometry, and astronomy. The statement of Cassiodorus that he translated
                    Nicomachus is rhetorical. Boetius himself tells us in his preface addressed to
                    his father-in-law Symmachus that he had taken liberties with the text of
                    Nicomachus, that he had abridged the work when necessary, and that he had
                    introduced formulae and diagrams of his own where he thought them useful for
                    bringing out the meaning. His work on music also is not a translation from
                    Pythagoras, who left no writing behind him. But Boetius belonged to the school
                    of musical writers who based their science on the method of Pythagoras. They
                    thought that it was not sufficient to trust to the ear alone, to determine the
                    principles of music, as did practical musicians like Aristoxenus, but that along
                    with the ear, physical experiments should be employed. The work of Boetius is in
                    five books, and is a very complete exposition of the subject. It remained a
                    text-book of music in the Universities of Oxford and Cambridge till within
                    comparatively recent times. It is still very valuable as a help in ascertaining
                    the principles of ancient music, and gives us the opinions of some of the best
                    ancient writers on the art. The manuscripts of the geometry of Boetius differ
                    widely from each other. The latest editor, Godofredus Friedlein, thinks that
                    there are only two manuscripts which can at all lay claim to contain the work of
                    Boetius. He has published the <hi rend="italic">Ars</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Geometrioe,</hi> in two books, as given in these manuscripts; but critics are
                    generally inclined to doubt the genuineness even of these.</p>
                <p>By far the most important and most famous of the works of Boetius is his book <hi
                    rend="italic">De</hi><hi rend="italic">Consolatione</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Philosophioe.</hi> Gibbon justly describes it as “a golden volume, not unworthy
                    of the leisure of Plato or Tully, but which claims incomparable merit from the
                    barbarism of the times and the situation of the author.” It was a favourite book
                    of the Middle Ages, and deserves to be a favourite still. The high reputation it
                    had in mediaeval times is attested by the numerous translations, commentaries,
                    and imitations of it which then appeared. Among others Asser, the instructor of
                    Alfred the Great, and Robert Grosseteste, bishop of Lincoln, commented on it.
                    Alfred translated it into Anglo-Saxon. Versions of it appeared in German,
                    French, Italian, Spanish, and Greek before the end of the 15 th century. Chaucer
                    translated it into English prose before the year 1382; and this translation was
                    published by Caxton at Westminster, 1480. Lydgate followed in the wake of
                    Chaucer. It is said that, after the invention of printing, amongst others Queen
                    Elizabeth translated it, and that the work was well known to Shakespeare.</p>
                <p>This famous work consists of five books. Its form is peculiar, and is an
                    imitation of a similar work by Marcianus Capella, <hi rend="italic">De</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Nuptiis Philologia: et Mercurii</hi> It is alternately in prose
                    and verse. The verse shows great facility of metrical composition, but a
                    considerable portion of it is transferred from the tragedies of Seneca. The
                    first book opens with a few verses, in which Boetius describes how his sorrows
                    had turned his hair grey, and had brought him to a Îiremature old age. Λs he is
                    thus lamenting, a woman appears to ιim of dignified mien, whom for a time he
                    cannot distinguish in consequence of his tears, but at last he recognizes her as
                    his guardian, Philosophy. She, resolving to apply the remedy for his grief, puts
                    some questions to him for that purpose. She finds that he believes that God
                    rules the world, but does not know what he himself is; and this absence of
                    self-knowledge is the cause of his weakness. In the second book Philosophy
                    presents to Boetius Fortune, who is made to state to him the blessings he has
                    enjoyed, and after that proceeds to discuss with him the kind of blessings that
                    fortune can bestow, which are shown to be unsatisfactory and uncertain. In the
                    third book Philosophy promises to lead him to true happiness, which is to be
                    found in God alone, for since God is the highest good, and the highest good is
                    true happiness, God is true happiness. Nor can real evil exist, for since God is
                    all-powerful, and since he does not wish evil, evil must be non-existent. In the
                    fourth book Boetius raises the question,Why, if the governor of the universe is
                    good, do evils exist, and why is virtue often punished and vice rewarded?
                    Philosophy proceeds to show that this takes place only in appearance; that vice
                    is never unpunished nor virtue unrewarded. From this Philosophy passes into a
                    discussion in regard to the nature of providence and fate, and shows that every
                    fortune is good. The fifth and last book takes up the question of man’s free
                    will and God’s foreknowledge, and, by an exposition of the nature of God,
                    attempts to show that these doctrines are not subversive of each other; and the
                    conclusion is drawn that God remains a foreknowing spectator of all events, and
                    the ever-present eternity of his vision agrees with the future quality of our
                    actions, dispensing rewards to the good and punishments to the wicked.</p>
                <p>Several theological works have been ascribed to Boetius, as has been already
                    mentioned. The <hi rend="italic">Consolatio</hi> affords conclusive proof that
                    the author was not a practical believer in Christianity. The book contains
                    several expressions, such as <hi rend="italic">daemones,</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >angelica</hi><hi rend="italic">virtus,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">purgatoria
                    clementia,</hi> which have been thought to be derived from the Christian faith;
                    but they are used in a heathen sense, and are explained sufficiently by the
                    circumstance that Boetius was on intimate terms with Christians, and could not
                    help being influenced to some extent by their language. The writer nowhere finds
                    consolation in any Christian belief, and Christ is never named in the work. It
                    is not impossible, however, that Boetius may have been brought up a Christian,
                    and that in his early years he may have written some Christian books. This is
                    the conjecture to which the latest editor of his Christian treatises has had
                    recourse. Peiper thinks that the first three treatises are the productions of
                    the early years of Boetius. The first, <hi rend="italic">De</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Sancta Trinitate,</hi> is addressed to Symmachus (Domino Patri
                    Symmacho), and the result of the short discussion, which is of an abstract
                    nature, and deals partly with the ten categories, is that unity is predicated
                    absolutely, or, in regard to the substance of the Deify, trinity is predicated
                    relatively. The second treatise is addressed to John the deacon (“Ad Joannem
                    Diaconum”), and its subject is “Utrum Pater et Filius et Spiritus Sanctus de
                    divinitate substantialiter praedicentur.” The treatise is shorter than the
                    former, occupying only two or three pages, and the conclusion of the argument is
                    the same. The third treatise bears the title, <hi rend="italic">Quomodo</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">substantiae in</hi><hi rend="italic">eo</hi><hi rend="italic">quod
                    sint bonce sint cum non sint</hi><hi rend="italic">substantialia</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">bona.</hi> It contains nothing distinctly Christian, and it
                    contains nothing of great value; therefore its authorship is a matter of little
                    consequence. Peiper thinks that, as the best MSS. uniformly assign these
                    treatises to Boetius, they are to be regarded as his; that it is probable that
                    Symmachus and John (who afterwards became Pope) were the men of highest
                    distinction who took charge of him when he lost his father; and that these
                    treatises are the first-fruits of his studies, which he dedicates to his
                    guardians and benefactors. He thinks that the variations in the inscriptions of
                    the fifth treatise, which is not found in the best manuscript, are so great that
                    the name of Boetius could not have originally been in the title. The fourth book
                    is also not found in the best manuscript, and two manuscripts have no
                    inscription. He infers, from these facts, that there is no sure evidence for the
                    authorship of the fourth and fifth treatises. The fifth treatise is <hi
                    rend="italic">Contra Eutychen</hi><hi rend="italic">et</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Nestorium.</hi> Both Eutyches and Nestorius are spoken of as living. A council
                    is mentioned, in which a letter was read, expounding the opinion of the
                    Eutychians for the first time. The novelty of the opinion is also alluded to.
                    All these circumstances point to the Council of Chalcedon (451). The treatise
                    was therefore written before the birth of Boetius, if it be not a forgery; but
                    there is no reason to suppose that the treatise was not a genuine production of
                    the time to which it professes to belong. The fourth treatise, <hi rend="italic"
                    >De Fide</hi><hi rend="italic">Catholica,</hi> does not contain any distinct
                    chronological data; but the tone and opinions of the treatise produce the
                    impression that it probably belonged to the same period as the treatise against
                    Eutyches and Nestorius. Several inscriptions ascribe both these treatises to
                    Boetius. It will be seen from this statement that Peiper bases his conclusions
                    on grounds far too narrow; and on the whole it is far more probable that Boetius
                    wrote none of the four Christian treatises, particularly as they are not
                    ascribed to him by any of his contemporaries. Three of them express in the
                    strongest language the orthodox faith of the church in opposition to the Arian
                    heresy, and these three put in unmistakable language the procession of the Holy
                    Spirit from both Father and Son. The fourth argues for the orthodox belief of
                    the two natures and one person of Christ. When the desire arose that it should
                    be believed that Boetius perished from his opposition to the heresy of
                    Theodoric, it was natural to ascribe to him works which were in harmony with
                    this supposed fact. The works may really have been written by one Boethus, a
                    bishop of Africa, as Jourdain supposes, or by some Saint Severinus, as Nitzsch
                    conjectures, and the similarity of name may have aided the transference of them
                    to the heathen or neutral Boetius.</p>
                <p>The best editions of the entire works of Boetius are the Basel edition of 1570,
                    and Migne’s in his <hi rend="italic">Patrologice</hi><hi rend="italic">Cursus
                    Completus,</hi><hi rend="italic">Series Latina,</hi> vols, lxiii., lxiv. There
                    are many editions of the <hi rend="italic">De</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Consolatione.</hi> The most recent are—(1.) In Valpy’s <hi rend="italic"
                    >Delphin</hi><hi rend="italic">Classics,</hi> Nos. 54 and 55. This contains the

                    Boetius. It has also numerous notes. (2.) An edition by Theodorus Obbarius,
                    Jenae, 1843. This contains prolegomena on the life and writings of Boetius, on
                    his religion and philosophy, and on the manuscripts and editions, a critical
                    apparatus, and notes. (3.) An edition by Rudolfus Peiper, Lipsiøe, 1871. This
                    edition has the fullest collation of manuscripts, though a considerable number
                    of manuscripts still remain to be collated. In addition to an account of the
                    MSS. used, it gives the Book of Lupus “De Metris Boetii,” the “Vita Boetii”
                    contained m some MSS., “Elogia Boetii,” and a short list of the commentators,
                    translators, and imitators of the <hi rend="italic">Consolation.</hi> It
                    contains also an account of the metres used by Boetius in the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Consolatio,</hi> and a list of the passages which he has borrowed from the
                    tragedies of Seneca. The work also includes the five treatises, four of them
                    Christian, of which mention has been made above. In 1867 appeared a very
                    satisfactory edition of Boetius’s works, <hi rend="italic">De</hi><hi
