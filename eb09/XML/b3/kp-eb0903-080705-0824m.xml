                    speaking, but is more peculiarly restricted to an indignity offered to the Deity
                    by words or writing. The common law of England treats blasphemy as an indictable
                    offence. All blasphemies against God, as denying his being, or providence, all
                    contumelious reproaches of Jesus Christ, all profane scoffing at the Holy
                    Scriptures, or exposing any part thereof to contempt or ridicule, are punishable
                    by the temporal courts with fine, imprisonment, and also infamous corporal
                    punishment. The Act 1 Edw. VI. c. 1 (repealed 1 Mary, c. 2, and revived 1 Eliz.
                    c. 1 ), enacts that persons reviling the sacrament of the Lord’s supper, by
                    contemptuous words or otherwise, shall suffer imprisonment. Persons denying the
                    Trinity were deprived of the benefit of the Act of Toleration by 1 Will. III. c.
                    18. The 9 and 10 Will. III. c. 32, enacts that if any person, educated in or
                    having made profession of the Christian religion, should by writing, preaching,
                    teaching, or advised speaking, deny any one of the persons of the Holy Trinity
                    to be God, or should assert or maintain that there are more gods than one, or
                    should deny the Christian religion to be true, or the Holy Scriptures to be of
                    divine authority, he should, upon the first offence, be rendered incapable of
                    holding any office or place of trust, and for the second incapable of bringing
                    any action, of being guardian or executor, or of taking a legacy or deed of
                    gift, and should suffer three years’ imprisonment without bail. It has been held
                    that a person offending under the statute is also indictable at common law (Rex
                    v. Carlisle, where Mr Justice Best remarks, “In the age of toleration, when that
                    statute passed, neither churchmen nor sectarians wished to protect in their
                    infidelity those who disbelieved the Holy Scriptures.”) The 53 Geo. III. c. 160,
                    excepts from these enactments “persons denying a3 therein mentioned respecting
                    the Holy Trinity,” but otherwise the common and statute law on the subject
                    remains as stated. In the case of Rex <hi rend="italic">v.</hi> Woolston (2 Geo.
                    II.) the court declared that they would not suffer it to be debated whether to
                    write againet Christianity in <hi rend="italic">general</hi> was not an offence
                    punishable in the temporal courts at common law, but they did not intend to
                    include disputes between learned men on <hi rend="italic">particular</hi>
                    controverted points. The law against blasphemy has not recently been in active
                    operation. In 1841, Moxon was found guilty of the publication of a blasphemous
                    libel (Shelley’s <hi rend="italic">Queen Maty,</hi> the prosecution having been
                    instituted by Hetherington, who had previously been condemned to four months’
                    imprisonment for a similar offence, and wished to test the law under which he
                    was punished. In the case of Cowan <hi rend="italic">v.</hi> Milbourn, in 1867,
                    the defendant had broken his contract to let a lectureroom to the plaintiff, on
                    discovering that the intended lectures were to maintain that “the character of
                    Christ is defective, and his teaching misleading, and that the Bible is no more
                    inspired than any other book,” and the Court of Exchequer held that the
                    publication of such doctrine was blasphemy, and the contract therefore illegal.
                    On that occasion the court reaffirmed the dictum of C. J. Hale, that
                    Christianity is part of the laws of England. The Commissioners on Criminal Law
                    (sixth report) remark, that “although the law forbids <hi rend="italic">all</hi>
                    denial of the being and providence of God or the Christian religion, it is only
                    when irreligion assumes the form of an insult to God and man that the
                    interference of the criminal law has taken place.”</p>
                <p>Profane cursing and swearing is made punishable by 19 Geo. II. c. 21, which
                    directs the offender to be brought before a justice of the peace, and fined 5
                    shillings, 2 shillings, or 1 shilling, according as he is a gentleman, below the
                    rank of gentleman, or a common labourer, soldier, &amp;c.</p>
                <p>By the law of Scotland, as it originally stood, the punishment of blasphemy was
                    death. By an Act paseed in the first parliament of Charles IL, whoever, “not
                    being distracted in his wits,” should curse God or any person of the ble3sed
                    Trinity was punishable with death; and by a statute of King William’s reign
                    (1695, c. 11), any person reasoning against the being of God, or any person of
                    the Trinity, or the authority of the Holy Scriptures, or the providence of God
                    in the government of the world, was to be imprisoned for the first offence until
                    he should give public satisfaction in sackcloth to the congregation, to be
                    punished more severely for the second offence, and for the third doomed to
                    death; but by 6 Geo. IV. c. 47, amended by 7 Will. IV. and 1 Vict. c. 5,
                    blasphemy was made punishable by fine or imprisonment or both. <hi
