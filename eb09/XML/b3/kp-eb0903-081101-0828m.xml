                <p><label type="entry">BLEACHING</label></p>
                <p>BLEACHING is the process of whitening or depriving objects of colour, an
                    operation incessantly in activity in nature by the influence of light, air, and
                    moisture. The art of bleaching, of which we have here to treat, consists in
                    inducing the rapid operation of whitening agencies, and as an industry it is
                    mostly directed to cotton, linen, silk, wool, and other textile fibres, but it
                    is also applied to the whitening of paper-pulp, bees’-wax, and some oils and
                    other substances The term bleaching is derived from the Anglo-Saxon <hi
                    rend="italic">bloecoen</hi> to bleach, or to fade, from which also comes the
                    cognate German word <hi rend="italic">bleichen,</hi> to whiten or render pale.
                    Bleachers, down to the end of last century, were known in England as
                    “whitsters,” a name obviously derived from the nature of their calling.</p>
                <p>The operation of bleaching must from its very nature be of the same antiquity as
                    the work of washing textures of linen, cotton, or other vegetable fibres.
                    Clothing repeatedly washed, and exposed in the open air to dry, gradually
                    assumes a whiter and whiter hue, and our ancestors cannot have failed to notice
                    and take advantage of this fact. Scarcely anything is known with certainty of
                    the art of bleaching as practised by the nations of antiquity. Egypt in early
                    ages was the great centre of textile manufactures, and her white and coloured
                    linens were in high repute among contemporary nations. As a uniformly
                    well-bleached basis is necessary for the production of a satisfactory dye on
                    cloth, it may be assumed that the Egyptians were fairly proficient in bleaching,
                    and that still more so were the Phoenicians with their brilliant and famous
                    purple dyes. We learn, from Pliny, that different plants, and likewise the ashes
                    of plants, which no doubt contained alkali, were employed as detergents. He
                    mentions particularly the <hi rend="italic">StrutJιiιιm</hi> as much used
                    forbleaching in Greece, a plant which has been identified by some with <hi
                    rend="italic">Gypsophila Struthium.</hi> But as it does not appear from
                    Sibthorp’s <hi rend="italic">Flora</hi><hi rend="italic">Groeca,</hi> published
                    by Sir James Smith, that this species is a native of Greece, Dr Sibthorp’s
                    conjecture that <hi rend="italic">↑</hi><hi rend="italic">λιo Struthium</hi> of
                    the ancients was <hi rend="italic">∖</hi><hi rend="italic">heSapοnaria
                    officinalis,</hi> a plant common in Greece, is certainly more probable.</p>
                <p>In modern times, down to the middle of the 18th century, the Dutch possessed
                    almost a monopoly of the bleaching trade, although we find mention of
                    bleach-works at Southwark near London as early as the middle of the 17th
                    century. It was customary to send all the brown linen, then largely manufactured
                    in Scotland, to Holland to be bleached. It was sent away in the month of March,
                    and not returned till the end of October, being thus out of the hands of the
                    merchant more than half a year.</p>
                <p>The Dutch mode of bleaching, which was mostly conducted in the neighbourhood of
                    Haarlem, was to steep the linen first in a waste lye, and then for about a week
                    in a potash lye poured over it boiling hot. The cloth being taken out of this
                    lye, and washed, was next put into wooden vessels containing butter-milk, in
                    which it lay under a pressure for five or six days. After this it was spread
                    upon the grass, and kept wet for several months, exposed to the sunshine of
                    summer.</p>
                <p>In 1728 James Adair from Belfast proposed to the Scotch Board of Manufactures to
                    establish a bleachfield in Galloway; this proposal the board approved of, and in
                    the same year resolved to devote £2000 as premiums for the establishment of
                    bleachfields throughout the country. In 1732 a method of bleaching with kelp,
                    introduced by R. Holden, also from Ireland, was submitted to the board; and with
                    their assistance Holden established a bleachfield for prosecuting his process at
                    Pitkerro, near Dundee.</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit03newyrich/page/n829/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0903-0829-0812"/>
                <p>The bleaching process, as at that time performed, was very tedious, occupying a
                    complete summer. It consisted in steeping the cloth in alkaline lyes for several
                    days, washing it clean, and spreading it upon the grass for some weeks. The
                    steeping in alkaline lyes, called <hi rend="italic">bucking,</hi> and the
                    bleaching on the grass, called <hi rend="italic">crofting,</hi> were repeated
                    alternately for five or six times. The cloth was then steeped for some days in
                    sour milk, washed clean, and crofted. These processes were repeated, diminishing
                    every time the strength of the alkaline lye, till the linen had acquired the
                    requisite whiteness.</p>
                <p>For the first improvement in this tedious process, which was faithfully copied
                    from the Dutch bleachfields, manufacturers were indebted to Dr Francis Home of
                    Edinburgh, to whom the Board of Trustees paid £100 for his experiments in
                    bleaching. He proposed to substitute water acidulated with sulphuric acid for
                    the sour milk previously employed, a suggestion made in consequence of the new
                    mode of preparing sulphuric acid, contrived some time before by Dr Roebuck,
                    which reduced the price of that acid to less than one-third of what it had
                    formerly been. When this change was first adopted by the bleachers, there was
                    the same outcry against its corrosive effects as arose when chlorine was
                    substituted for crofting. A great advantage was found to result from the use of
                    sulphuric acid, which was that a souring with sulphuric acid required at the
                    longest only twenty-four hours, and often not more than twelve; whereas, when
                    sour milk was employed, six weeks, or even two months, were requisite, according
                    to the state of the weather. In consequence of this improvement, the process of
                    bleaching was shortened from eight months to four, which enabled the merchant to
                    dispose of lι is goods so much the sooner, and consequently to trade with less
                    capital.</p>
                <p>No further modification of consequence was introduced in the art till the year
                    1787, when a most important change was initiated by the use of chlorine, an
                    element which had been discovered by Scheele in Sweden about thirteen years
                    before. Berthollet repeated the experiments of Scheele in 1785, and by the
                    prosecution of further investigations he added considerably to the facts already
                    known. He showed that this substance (called by Scheele <hi rend="italic"
                    >dephlogisticated muriatic acid)</hi> is a gas soluble in water, to which it
                    gives a yellowish green colour, an astringent taste, and the peculiar smell by
                    which the body is distinguished.</p>
                <p>The property which this gas possesses of destroying vegetable colours, led
                    Berthollet to suspect that it might be introduced with advantage into the art of
                    bleaching, and that it would enable practical bleachers greatly to shorten their
                    processes. In a paper on dephlogisticated muriatic acid, read before the Academy
                    of Sciences at Paris in April 1785, and published in the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Journal de Physique</hi> for May of the same year (vol. xxvi. p. 325), he
                    mentions that he had tried the effect of the gas in bleaching cloth, and found
                    that it answered perfectly. This idea is still further developed in a paper on
                    the same substance, published in the <hi rend="italic">Journal de Physique</hi>
                    for 1786. In 1786 he exhibited the experiment to Mr James Watt, who, immediately
                    upon his return to England, commenced a practical examination of the subject,
                    and was accordingly the person who first introduced the new method of bleaching
                    into Great Britain. We find from Mr Watt’s own testimony that chlorine was
                    practically employed in the bleachfield of his father-in-law, Mr Macgregor, in
                    the neighbourhood of Glasgow in March 1787. Shortly thereafter the method was
                    introduced at Aberdeen by Messrs Gordon, Barron, and Co., on information
                    received from M. de Saussure through Professor Copland of Aberdeen. Mr Thomas
                    Henry of Manchester was the first to bleach with chlorine in the Lancashire
                    district, and to his independent investigations several of the early
                    improvements in the application of the material were due.</p>
                <p>No very great amount of success, however, attended the efforts to utilize
                    chlorine in bleaching operations till the subject was taken up by Mr Tennant of
                    Glasgow. He, after a great deal of most laborious and acute investigation, hit
                    upon a method of making a saturated liquid of chloride of lime, which was found
                    to answer perfectly all the purposes of the bleacher. This was certainly a most
                    important improvement, without which, the prodigious extent of business carried
                    on by some bleachers could not possibly have been transacted. Such was the
                    acceleration of processes effected by the new method that, it is stated, a
                    bleacher in Lancashire received 1400 pieces of gray muslin on a Tuesday, which
                    on the Thursday immediately following were returned bleached to the
                    manufacturers, at the distance of sixteen miles, and were packed up and sent off
                    on that very day to a foreign market.</p>
                <p>In the year 1798 Mr Tennant took out a patent for his new invention, and offered
                    the use of it to practical bleachers, for a fair and reasonable portion of the
                    savings made by its substitution for potash, then in general use. Many of the
                    bleachers, however, used it without paying lιim, and a combination was formed to
                    resist the right of the patentee. In December 1802, an action for damages was
                    brought against Messrs Slater and Varley, nominally the defendants, but who, in
                    fact, were backed and supported by a combination of almost all the bleachers in
                    Lancashire. In consequence of this action, the patent right was set aside by the
                    verdict of a jury and the decision of Lord Ellenborough, who used very strong
                    language against the patentee. The grounds of this decision were, that the
                    patent included a mode of <hi rend="italic">bucking</hi> with quicklime and
                    water, which was not a new invention. It was decided that, because one part of
                    the patent was not new, therefore the whole must be set aside. Lime was indeed
                    used previous to the patent of Mr Tennant; but it was employed in a quite
                    different manner from his, and he would have allowed the bleachers to continue
                    their peculiar method without any objection, because it would have been
                    productive of no injury to his emolument.</p>
                <p>In consequence of this decision the use of liquid chloride of lime in bleaching
                    was thrown open to all, and speedily came to be universally employed by the
                    bleachers in Britain. Mr Tennant, thus deprived of the fruits of several years
                    of anxious and laborious investigation, advanced a step farther, to what may be
                    considered as the completion of the new method. This consisted in impregnating
                    quicklime in a dry state with chlorine, an idea originally suggested by Mr
                    Charles MTntosh of Cross-Basket, then a partner with Messrs Tennant and Knox. A
                    patent for this was taken out on the 13th of April 1799, and he began his
                    manufacture of solid chloride of lime at first upon a small scale, which has
                    ever since been gradually extending, and the manufactory is now the largest of
                    the kind in Great Britain.</p>
                <p>The various processes for the preparation of the so-called chloride of lime, or
                    bleaching-powder, as conducted at the present day, and its other applications in
                    arts, will be found described under the head of <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Chlorine.</hi></p>
                <p>Bleaching of Cotton.</p>
                <p>Of the two great staples, cotton and linen, to the whitening of which the art of
                    the bleacher is directed, cotton is the more easily and expeditiously bleached.
                    The basis of all vegetable fibres is cellulose or ligneous tissue, a pure white
                    substance, and it is to obtain this body in a state of purity, free from the
                    resinous matter naturally associated with it as well as from adventitious
                    impurities <pb break="no"

                    that is the object of bleaching. The operations, although apparently complex and
                    numerous, are essentially simple, though frequently repeated, and the greatest
                    variety of detail is connected with the finishing of cloth, which is in reality
                    a separate industry, frequently conducted in distinct establishments under the
                    name of calendering and finishing works. Bleaching proper resolves itself into
                    washing with suitable detergents, and subjecting the washed material to the
                    influence of chlorine, whereby the colouring matter either belonging to the
                    fibre or imparted to it is oxidized and discharged.</p>
                <p>The general arrangements of a bleach-house will be made plain from the
                    ground-plan (fig. 1). The various pieces of apparatus, the positions of which
                    are there indicated, will be described in connection with the sequence of
                    operations through which the cloth passes in the process of bleaching. In the
                    best arranged works, it should be mentioned, where power is required to work any
                    machine, it is generally supplied by a separate engine attached to the machine
                    itself, instead of by gearing carried from one engine for all the machinery. For
                    this plan, as well as for the greater portion of the illustrations which follow,
                    we are indebted to Mr William Mather, of the eminent firm of Mather and Platt,
                    Salford, to whom we are also under obligation for much valuable practical
                    information. We have also to express our indebtedness to Mr Alexander Crum of
                    Thornliebank, for the fullest access to the important works of his firm, and for
                    the cordial assistance afforded by the managers of its various departments.</p>
                <p>The sequence of operations in the bleaching and finishing of calico has undergone
                    no change in its general details since the bleaching-powder process was first
                    introduced; but the mechanical arrangements by which the operations are
                    conducted have been the subject of frequent improvements. The ingenuity of
                    engineers and bleachers has been chiefly directed towards the decreasing of
                    manual labour, economy of fuel and materials, and the rapid completion of the
                    various processes. The application of factory legislation to bleach-works by the
                    Bleaching and Dyeing Works Act of 1860, by imposing a necessity for regular and
                    stated hours of work, still further stimulated the production of apparatus and
                    arrangements for prompt and certain completion of the various operations.
                    Consequently a great part of the old machinery and arrangements of a
                    bleach-house have now disappeared, and the processes are carried on in a
                    continuous series of operations by machinery and appliances to a large extent
                    self-acting. Formerly each piece of goods was separately treated and carried by
                    hand or on barrows from one stage to the next; now the pieces are sewn end to
                    end, as many as 1000 pieces, measuring perhaps 20 miles, being operated on in
                    one stretch.</p>
                <p>As various pieces of old machinery are yet in use for certain kinds of work, it
                    has been considered desirable to give descriptions and figures of some of them,
                    and these, at the same time, will serve the further purpose of indicating the
                    nature of the mechanical improvements which have been carried out, in recent
                    years, in bleaching establishments. The important and frequently repeated
                    operation of washing was formerly conducted either at the wash-stocks or
                    washing-mill or in the dash-wheel. The wash-stocks, which are yet in use in many
                    large works, especially where linen is the bleacher’s staple, consists of a
                    trough or box for holding the goods to be washed, through which a constant
                    stream of water is passing. A pair or more of heavy hammer-headed wooden beams,
                    hung by long shafts, and playing into the trough, are alternately tilted,
                    against the cloth, causing the water by their momentum to work through and
                    squirt out of the mass. This process of washing is rather tedious, occupying on
                    an average about half an hour, and requiring besides a great amount of manual
                    labour. The dash-wheel (fig. 2) is a cylindrical box revolving on its axis. It
                    has four divisions, as shown by the dotted lines, and an opening into each
                    division. A number of pieces are put into each, abundance of water is admitted
                    behind, and the knocking of the pieces as they alternately dash from one side of
                    the division to the other during the revolution of the wheel effects the
                    washing. The process lasts from four to six minutes. The dashwheel is used to
                    the present day in the bleaching of curtain materials and fine muslins. In
                    nothing have greater improvements been effected than in the arrangement of the
                    kiers or vessels in which the cloth is boiled or “bowked.” An old form of kier
                    is seen in fig. 3. It consisted of a cylindrical vessel AA, 9 feet wide, of wood
                    or iron, having a false bottom BB, on which the goods were placed, about 6
                    inches from the real one. A small pipe E, in the centre of a wider one CC,
                    conveyed the steam from the steam - boiler.</p>
                <p>When the liquid boiled at the bottom, where the steam issued, the steam forced
                    its way up the pipe CC, carrying with it a quantity of the lye, which was thrown
                    back by the small cover D, spreading itself over the surface of the goods, and
                    filtering through them into the space below the false bottom, where it was again
                    heated by the steam, reascended the pipe CC, and so on in constant succession,
                    till the boiling was completed. FF is a wooden cover which prevented the cooling
                    of the materials below a boiling heat.</p>
                <p>The bleaching of common calico is divided into two branches—lsi, print bleaching,
                    in the case of which the goods are bleached as a preliminary to the process of
                    calico printing; and 2&lt;7, white bleaching, which applies to goods to be
                    finished white or unprinted. The processes differ in some of their details, as
                    in white bleaching it is only necessary<pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0903-0831-0814"/> to satisfy the eye, whereas in print-bleaching
                    the material must be rendered chemically pure, otherwise the colours in the
                    subsequent printing process would be dull and blotchy. The print bleaching must
                    therefore be more thoroughly done than the other; but as the processes are
                    generally the same, it will be sufficient to indicate the points of difference
                    in the various stages through which the material in both cases passes. A process
                    preliminary to bleaching is <hi rend="italic">Singeing.—</hi> Gray calico aβ
                    received from the looms is generally in lengths of 37∣ and 50 yards. A large
                    number of these, sometimes as many as 1000, measuring more than 20 miles in
                    length, are sewn into a continuous web. At the extremities of each owner’s
                    lengths, the name of the firm, or some distinguishing mark, is either stamped on
                    in tar, or marked by means of coloured threads. These long lengths are then
                    submitted to the operation of singeing, which has for its object the removal of
                    the downy pile and short threads from the surface of the cloth, which would
                    interfere with the appearance of finished white goods, and with the uniformity
                    and sharpness of patterns in the case of prints. Several methods of
                    accomplishing this have been employed, but that most commonly used is the system
                    of plate singeing illustrated in fig. 4. A pair of singe-plates, <hi
                    rend="italic">a</hi> and <hi rend="italic">b,</hi> made of thick bent sheets of
                    copper, are mounted over the flues of a fire sufficient to raise a white heat.
                    The plate <hi rend="italic">b</hi> is most highly heated, <hi rend="italic"
                    >a</hi> being at the end of the flue furthest removed from the fire. The cloth
                    enters over a rail <hi rend="italic">a,</hi> and in passing over the plate <hi
                    rend="italic">a</hi> is thoroughly dried and prepared for the singeing it
                    receives when it comes to the highly-heated plate <hi rend="italic">b.</hi> A
                    block <hi rend="italic">d,</hi> carrying two rails in the space between the
                    plates, can be raised or lowered at pleasure so as to increase or lessen the
                    pressure of the cloth against the plates, or, if necessary, to lift it quite
                    free of contact with them. The system of plate singeing is found generally
                    sufficient in practice, but the caking of paste and dirt on the plates from the
                    cloth as it passes over them, and variations in the heat of the plates, often
                    lead to irregularities in singeing. A combination of plate and gas singeing is
                    frequently employed to overcome the deficiencies of plate singeing alone. In
                    this case the cloth is passed first over an ordinary plate, and then on to
                    another, along the ridge of which is a long narrow slit, which allows the issue
                    of a gas flame produced from coke burning immediately under it. By this means
                    long loose threads are more effectually burned off than in plate singeing, and a
                    more uniform heat is applied to the gray cloth. Fig. 5 is a sectional view of a
                    very efficient singeing apparatus introduced by Messrs Mather and Platt. The
                    figure represents the first half of the machine, the second portion being
                    precisely similar in arrangement. The singeing in this case is accomplished by
                    the burning of a mixture of coal-gas and atmospheric air admitted by a pipe <hi
                    rend="italic">a,</hi> and driven by a fan Diast to the burners <hi rend="italic"
                    >b, b,</hi> which are regulated by stop-cocks. The mixture burns with an intense
                    heat and a blue smokeless flame. The cloth is carried by a series of rollers to
                    the gas jets, and in passing over the rollers <hi rend="italic">c, c, c, c</hi>
                    the one side of the cloth impinges laterally four times against the flame, which
                    is never permitted to pass through the fabric, but only shaves its surface. The
                    back is thus singed in the first portion of the apparatus, and being turned over
                    on roller <hi rend="italic">d</hi> it is carried forward to another pair of
                    jets, where, being thoroughly dry, the face side of the cloth is completely
                    singed by going over exactly the same course through which the back is carried
                    in the first part. By an arrangement not shown in the illustration, the
                    attendant of the machine can instantaneously lower the gas burners by a treadle
                    movement in case of any stoppage or accident, and thus prevent the cloth from
                    being burned. With a proper pressure of gas this machine singes at the rate of
                    60 yards per minute.</p>
                <p>At this stage the cloth has now in addition to the brown coloured incrusting
                    substance and the resinous material proper to the fibre, a dark-coloured
                    carbonized surface, caused by the singeing process, the weaver’s paste or
                    dressing, tallow or other fat introduced in the process of weaving, and the
                    accumulation of dirt which the handling of weavers and others may have produced.
                    The object of the subsequent processes is to wash out the mechanical impurities
                    and resinous substances from the cloth, to render soluble by chemical agencies
                    such as are otherwise insoluble in water, and to oxidize the colouring matter of
                    the cotton by the chloride of lime as already explained.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Liming.—</hi> In some cases it is the practice immediately
                    after singeing to steep the pieces in water and pile them up wet for a night, in
                    order to loosen and partly ferment the weaver’s paste, which is then in large
                    part removed by washing in a machine to be subsequently described. The
                    “gray-backs” which have been used in calico-printing have always to be thus
                    steeped, and at one time it was the practice to leave the cloth so long in this
                    steep that it acquired a most offensive odour. This preliminary steeping and
                    washing facilitates the percolation of the liquor through the fabric in the
                    process of boiling, but notwithstanding this advantage it is generally dispensed
                    with, and the goods pass direct from the singeing to the liming process. The
                    pieces are formed into a loose coil or rope by being passed through circular
                    rings of glass or pottery called “pot-eyes,” and worked up and down several
                    times in a strong milk of lime, in order that the whole may be uniformly and
                    thoroughly impregnated. The arrangement for liming will be understood from fig.
                    6, which is a sectional view of a “squeezer,” an apparatus used repeatedly in
                    subsequent operations as well as in this of liming. . The cloth passes up and
                    down as indicated by the arrows, dipping several times into the solution, and
                    before passing finally on to the kiers for boiling it is slightly “nipped”
                    between the <pb break="no"

                    moisture. These bowls are thick cylinders of wood, usually in this case made of
                    beech. From the lime squeezer the cloth is carried over winches, and guided
                    through pot-eyes into the kiers.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Bowking.—</hi> A bowking kier is an apparatus in which the
                    cloth is boiled. To one old form of kier allusion has already been made. Bowking
                    is now mostly accomphshed in closed kiers worked up to a considerable pressure
                    of steam. In the boiling for white bleaching about 80 δ&gt; of lime are required
                    for 2700 lb of cloth, and the boiling is continued for ten hours at a pressure
                    of about 30 5&gt;. A form of kier very generally employed consists of a strong
                    vessel made of boiler plate, with a man-hole in the upper part, which can be
                    screwed tightly down. The vessel is about 10 feet in depth, and 5 or 6 feet in
                    diameter, and has a false bottom made of a gird of wood or iron, on which the
                    lowest layer of cloth rests. Up the centre of the kier passes a pipe or tube
                    which reaches higher than the cloth can be piled, and is surmounted by an
                    umbrella-shaped plate. Steam is admitted at the lower part of the kier, and as
                    the pressure accumulates it gradually forces the liquor upwards through the
                    central pipe till, by-and-by, it is dashed with great violence against the
                    umbrella-shaped plate, and thrown over the upper sùrface of the cloth. It
                    gradually percolates down through the cloth to the bottom, where it is again
                    caught and forced up through the central pipe, and thus a constant circulation
                    is maintained. A very efficient circulating kier, the invention of Mr Taylor of
                    Berchvale, has recently been introduced, of which a sectional representation is
                    given in fig. 7. This kier in outline is like the previous, but it has no
                    central distributing pipe. Instead, the liquor is carried by an external pipe to
                    the top of the kier, where it enters and is forcibly thrown against the surface
                    of the cloth. The kier A has a false bottom B as in the previous case, and when
                    filled with cloth and liquor, the liquor percolates by a pipe C into the
                    receiver D, where it finds its own level in the ascending pipe E. Steam is
                    admitted at the lower part of the receiver by the steam-pipe F, and forces the
                    liquor upwards through the pipe E to the top of the kier. The vacuum created in
                    the receiver is supplied from the lower part of the kier, and the flow is
                    facilitated by the pressure of steam from above, and thus a constant steady
                    circulation is maintained. This kier is very useful in cases where a
                    comparatively low pressure is desirable, as in white bleaching, where the
                    coloured headings of the cloth (Turkey red or other coloured threads introduced
                    at the end of a web) have to be preserved.</p>
                <p>The bowking apparatus generally used by printers is Barlow’s high-pressure kiers,
                    an arrangement in which the kiers are worked in pairs. A pair is shown in fig.
                    8, one being seen in section; the dimensions of the vessels are inserted in the
                    figure.</p>
                <p>The novelty these kiers introduced when first brought out, was that in using
                    steam of 40 lb instead of 5 lb, a greater economy of time and drugs would be
                    effected. Their world-wide application has proved that the inventor’s theory has
                    found ample confirmation. The cloth is carried or rather drawn by winches, and
                    dropped into the wrought iron boilers or kiers AA', through the man-holes in the
                    top, two pieces in all cases running side by side. As the pieces are delivered
                    continuously in the kiers, a lad in each spreads a pile of the cloth all round
                    the kier, as equally as possible, so that, when full, the kier shall be packed
                    uniformly to the top. This cloth rests on what is termed a false bottom, simply
                    a grid or plate with holes in it, as shown at B. Upon the grid are generally
                    placed a few smooth stones, through the spaces between which the liquor drains
                    from the cloth.</p>
                <p>Down the centre of the kier is a pipe C, perforated with holes, for the purpose
                    of distributing the liquor freely into the mass of cloth. The kiers are
                    connected by a pipe D, leading from the bottom of one to the top of the other,
                    and <hi rend="italic">vice versa.</hi> The steam is introduced through the
                    valves EE'. After the kiers are filled with cloth, each holding about 6000 lb,
                    the man-hole lide are screwed down and all made steam tight. A little steam is
                    then turned on to discharge the air from the cloth, which escapes through the
                    pipes FF'. This steam, moreover, gradually warms the goods. The alkaline liquor
                    or lime water, having been mixed to the proper strength, <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit03newyrich/page/n833/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0903-0833-0816"/> is then let into the kier A, through the tap G,
                    until the necessary quantity has been supplied, about 20 gallons of caustic soda
                    at 70° Tw., and 400 ft&gt; lime for the full charge being used. The steam is
                    then turned on slowly, and by its pressure the liquor in kier A is made to pass
                    with great force through the cloth, and then up the pipe D, through the 3-way
                    valve, into the kier A'. When all the liquor has passed over, the steam valve E
                    ’ is reversed, steam is shut off from A, communication is opened to pipe D', and
                    valve E' turned so as to admit steam to A', when the action of forcing the
                    liquor through the cloth up the pipe E ’ into kier A is performed. This
                    alternate passing of the liquor backwards and forwards, see-saw fashion, through
                    the cloth, constitutes the operation of boiling. The steam also has great effect
                    if left in contact with the cloth for a few minutes in one kier, after the
                    liquor has gone over to the other kier. This process is continued for eight
                    hours (nearly one-third the time formerly required in what are termed
                    low-pressure kiers), with steam of from 30 to 50 lb, during which time the
                    liquor passes about 16 times from one kier to the other; then the valves HH' are
                    opened, and all the liquor expelled by the steam from the cloth into a drain.
                    The steam is then shut off, the man-hole lids removed, and the ends of the two
                    chains of cloth taken out and passed through pot eyes, which guide the pieces to
                    the washing-machine.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>For

                    the kiers is found to have assumed a very dirty brown aspect. Formerly, the
                    apparatus used for washing was either the wash-stocks or the dash-wheel, to
                    which allusion has already been made. The machine now generally employed is
                    represented in section in fig. 9. It consists of a pair of wooden bowls or
                    cylinders <hi rend="italic">a</hi> and <hi rend="italic">b,</hi> about 9 feet
                    long, mounted in a strong framework, and arranged to press against each other in
                    their revolution. Plane tree is the wood most suitable for making these bowls.
                    Running underneath the whole length of the bowls is a box or trough <hi
                    rend="italic">c</hi> filled with water, near the bottom of which a rectangular
                    roller <hi rend="italic">d</hi> is fixed. The water in the box is constantly
                    renewed during washing operations by a current flowing in at the middle and
                    escaping at each end. Two chains of cloth are washed in this machine at the same
                    time, one being introduced at each extremity of the roller. The cloth passes
                    down into the water under the roller <hi rend="italic">d</hi> and up to the
                    wooden bowls, between which it is caught and nipped, and down again into the
                    water, working its way in a spiral manner from the end to the centre of the
                    machine, passing nine times through the water and between the bowls in its
                    progress. Its course inwards is guided by a strong wooden rail, from which pegs
                    project, arranged according to the number of turns to be given to the cloth. In
                    the centre part of the upper bowl there is a lapping of cotton rope, which
                    projects a little above the surface of the wood, and serves to give the cloth,
                    as it finally issues from the machine, a much stronger squeeze than it would
                    obtain between the long even bowls, and thereby expels a large proportion of
                    moisture. As the cloth travels inwards towards the centre of the trough, while
                    the flow of water is outward to escape at each end, the cloth on each revolution
                    is meeting water more nearly pure, till just at the point where it issues from
                    the trough for the last time, the clean water entering the trough is powerfully
                    spurted upon it, thus giving it a thorough rinse before it is finally squeezed.
                    It is usual tc pass the cloth from the lime boil either through a pair of such
                    washing-machines, or twice through the same, in ordeι to expel the last trace of
                    calcareous soap and uncombined lime from the texture.</p>
                <p>In addition to this machine various other devices have from time to time been
                    proposed and introduced to perform the important operations of washing. Among
                    these the continuous washer of Mr Henry Bridson of Bolton-le-Moors, Lancashire,
                    patented in 1852, is deserving of notice as a simple and efficient
                    washing-machine. Mr Bridson’s washer consists of an oblong tank or trough of
                    cast-iron which, in use, is kept about half filled with water. Within this tank,
                    just dipping into the water, two cross shafts are fixed, which are geared to
                    revolve in the same direction by spur-gearing mounted outside the trough. Each
                    shaft carries a pair of discs of large diameter, and between the discs of the
                    two shafts a pair of bars placed diametrically opposite each other are mounted.
                    These bars form flat winces or revolving frames, by the revolution of which the
                    fabric is not only carried forward, but is in its progress caused to strike with
                    great violence against the surface of the water. The intermittent flapping and
                    shaking motion thus communicated to the material has a powerful effect in
                    detaching adhering impurities from the cloth. Another form of washing-machine in
                    use in Lancashire consists of a row of eight vats or troughs arranged in an
                    ascending series, so that the overflow of water from the highest or last runs
                    into the second highest, and so downwards till it escapes from the lowest or
                    first. The cloth enters at the lowest trough, and is carried by guide-rollers up
                    and down through the entire series, issuing at the top between a pair of
                    squeezing rollers.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Gray Sour.—</hi> From the washing-machine the chain of cloth is
                    passed through a pair of squeezers, by which a large proportion of moisture is
                    expelled. The operation of souring, which comes next, is performed in an
                    apparatus of the same construction as the washing-machine, the trough under
                    which contains the souring liquor. For white bleaching a solution of
                    hydrochloric acid of a strength of 2° Twaddle (sp. gr. 1010) is used, and for
                    print bleaching the solution is made up to 4° Tw. Through this the cloth is
                    passed up and down twice by the revolution of the bowls, and piled up in the
                    sour in stillages for some hours. The object of the souring is to dissolve any
                    traces of free lime which may have been left in the washing, and to decompose
                    the calcareous soap.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Second BoU.—</hi> After having lain in the sour for a
                    sufficient length of time the cloth is passed through squeezers to expel as much
                    as possible of the acid, and again washed in the machine. It is next passed into
                    a kier or set of kiers, precisely as after liming, for the second boil, which in
                    the <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit03newyrich/page/n834/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0903-0834-0817"/> case of print bleaching is done with a solution
                    of soda-ash and rosin. For a pair of Barlow kiers boiling 12,000 lb of cloth,
                    the quantities used are 350 lb of soda-ash and 200 tt&gt; of rosin dissolved
                    with 30 gallons of caustic soda at 70° Tw. The boiling is carried on for ten
                    hours, in a like manner and at the same pressure as in the case of the lime
                    boiling. The soda-ash and rosin form a soap, which dissolves out the free fatty
                    acid in the cloth, and acts on the calcareous soap remaining by forming
                    carbonate of lime and a soluble soda soap. In the white bleaching of 2700 lb of
                    cloth, the boiling solution is 8 gallons of caustic soda at 70° Tw., but by some
                    bleachers soda-ash is employed in the proportion of 80 δ&gt; to 2700 lb of
                    cloth. From this boil the cloth is passed on to the washing-machine, and then
                    squeezed, when it is ready for “chemicking” with the bleachingpowder
                    solution.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Chemicking.—</hi> When the previous processes have been
                    efficiently carried out, the cloth will, at this point, have attained a
                    considerable appearance of whiteness and purity. The “chemicking” or liquoring
                    with bleaching-powder which it now undergoes is. conducted in a similar manner
                    to the souring already described. The chemick is used as weak as possible, the
                    solution varying from ⅜ <hi rend="superscript"> 0</hi> to ∣ <hi
                    rend="superscript"> 0</hi> Tw. (sp. gr. 1 ’ 000625 to 1Ό0125) according to the
                    weight and condition of the cloth under treatment. It is run through this
                    liquor, gently squeezed, and piled up for four or six hours. It is then squeezed
                    and washed; and at this stage the bleacher has to judge whether the cloth
                    requires to be chemicked a second time, which, in the case of heavy goods, is
                    frequently necessary. If a repetition of the process is required, the cloth is
                    again passed into the kiers, boiled with a solution of soda-ash, and the other
                    processes repeated as before.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">White Sour.—.</hi> After lying in the chemick the goods are
                    again washed and squeezed, and afterwards soured in machine with sulphuric acid,
                    used at a strength of about 4° Tw. (sp. gr. 1 ’ 020), and piled up for a period
                    of at least three hours. Thereafter, in order thoroughly to expel all acid the
                    goods are twice washed, and finally squeezed, which concludes the operation of
                    bleaching proper. The calico should now present a snow-white aspect, and should
                    be fit to take the most delicate shades of colour when it is to be used for
                    printing purposes.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Opening.—</hi> In passing through the numerous processes
                    detailed in the foregoing statement, the cloth has been always in the form of a
                    coil cr loose rope. In the drawing from one machine to another it has been also
                    pulled somewhat to the length at the expense of breadth, and in places it is
                    likely to have become a little twisted. The pieces have therefore now to be
                    opened out to their full width, and, if necessary, evened. The opening out is
                    effected by passing the pieces to a winch placed at a considerable height when
                    the weight of the cloth itself in passing upwards unfolds it, and the selvedges
                    are caught and extended by a boy just before it passes on to the winch. When
                    necessary it is caught beyond the winch by an opening-machine, such as that
                    patented in 1871 by Mr Wm. Birch of Salford. It is a complex apparatus, working
                    by endlese bands, on which are toothed projections, and these, travelling from
                    the centre to the sides in opposite directions, open and spread out the cloth
                    before it passes over the roller which is mounted on the machine. From the
                    opener the cloth passes at once to the drying-machine (hereafter described),
                    after passing over which cloth intended for printing is folded or batched on
                    rollers, and its further treatment belongs to the art of calico-printing.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Finishing.—</hi> So far as regards bleaching proper the process
                    is now at an end, and the further operations which white calicoes undergo have
                    only for their object the ιimprovernent of their appearance for the market. But
                    although the finishing adds in no way to the quality of the material, it is
                    regarded as of great value by the merchants, and the finish of a bleacher is of
                    more importance than his bleaching. A great variety of finishing operations have
                    to be employed, according to the different qualities of textiles, and the
                    purposes to which they are devoted. Finishes are “beetled,” “calendered” (either
                    “stiff,” “medium,” or “soft,”or “glazed,”) and, fordress muslins,&amp;c.,
                    “elastic.” As the processes and appliances for these finishing operations are
                    very numerous and varied, they cannot here be described in detail. In most cases
                    they are the same as used in the finishing of calico prints, and more
                    information will be found under that head. We shall here confine our remarks
                    chiefly to the finishing of ordinary white beetled calicoes.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Water Mangle.—</hi> The cloth, when brought into the
                    finishing-room, is passed over a stretching rail into a trough of boiling water
                    and between a series of calender rollers, in which it is powerfully pressed. A
                    common arrangement of the cylinders of the water mangle is to have a series of
                    four, two of small diameter being made of copper, and two larger of condensed
                    cotton; but wooden bowls are also sometimes employed with only a single
                    intermediate copper cylinder. By this mangling process the water is equalized
                    throughout the whole piece, the threads are flattened, and the cloth stretched,
                    smoothed, and wound upon a roller, and thus rendered fit for receiving the <hi
                    rend="italic">starch.</hi><hi rend="italic">Starching.—</hi> It is in this stage
                    that so much is done by some bleachers to give cloth a factitious appearance of
                    weight and bulk by filling up the interstices between the fibres with compounds
                    which have no other object than to please or deceive the eye, and some of which
                    have a decidedly deleterious influence on the tissue they are intended to
                    improve in appearance. A great variety of mixtures, both cheap and nasty, are
                    used by some finishers in place of starch with a view to produce weight and
                    appearance, but, naturally, as little information as possible on this point is
                    permitted to leak out to the public. What ought to be, and by reputable
                    bleachers really is, used is pure starch, either of Indian corn or wheat, or
                    both, made up into a stiff mucilage and blued with ultramarine or indigo. The
                    cloth passes over a stretching rail into a trough of this starch, in which a
                    roller is mounted. As it comes out of the starch it is caught between a pair of
                    bowls, by which the superfluous starch is squeezed out and thrown back into the
                    trough, the cloth passing on to the drying machine. The starching mangle and
                    drying-machine are seen together in fig. 10.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Drying.—</hi> The drying-machine (fig. 10), consists of a
                    number of cylinders made of tinned iron or copper, and filled with steam of low
                    pressure. The cloth passes alternately back and face over one and the other, and
                    emerges to be placed down at the end perfectly dry. This system of drying was
                    introduced among the first mechanical appliances used in calico-printing, and
                    has not as yet been superseded by any other plan. Various improvements in
                    detail, we learn from Mr William Mather, as to the construction of the cylinders
                    and the mode of applying steam to them have been recently introduced, but the
                    machine remains the same. One important defect has been recently <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0903-0835-0818"/> removed by an alteration in the construction of
                    the cylinders, to prevent collapse, in case a vacuum were formed by the rapid
                    condensation of the steam. A spiral rib or stay is made to run from end to end
                    of the body of the cylinder, giving support uniformly the whole length, and
                    serving at the same time as a screw to drive the condensed water, as the
                    cylinder revolves, to one end, where it is ejected through a nozzle. The steam
                    enters at a nozzle, from the framing which is cast hollow, and serves as a pipe
                    to distribute the steam to all the cylinders in the machine, while the framing
                    on the other side serves in like manner to receive and discharge the water.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Damping.—</hi> From the drying cans the cloth is passed on to
                    the damping-machine, where it is uniformly moistened by an exceedingly fine
                    spray of water thrown upon it. The spray is thrown up by a circular brush, the
                    tips of which are allowed to dip into water in a trough over which it revolves.
                    Mather and Platt have introduced a manifest improvement on this plan by throwing
                    the water in fine jets on the brush from a pipe which runs parallel with it. By
                    this means the quantity of water and degree of moisture can be regulated with
                    the utmost nicety. Fig. 11 shows the damping-machine in section as modified
                    by</p>
                <p>Mather and Platt, <hi rend="italic">a</hi> represents the circular brush
                    revolving in a trough, and <hi rend="italic">b</hi> is the pipe from which the
                    water is squirted on the brush. The spray from the brush is confined by two
                    sloping boards <hi rend="italic">c, c,</hi> which work on quadrants, and the
                    lever <hi rend="italic">d</hi> raises or depresses the brush at pleasure. The
                    course of the cloth over the machine is indicated by arrows, and after damping
                    it is batched on an iron or wooden beam <hi rend="italic">e,</hi> when it is
                    ready for the process of beetling. When goods are to be finished of any
                    particular width, they are at this stage breadthened by such an apparatus as the
                    belt-stretching machine of Mather and Platt shown in elevation in fig. 12 and in
                    plan in fig, 13. In this machine the full width of the cloth is obtained by the
                    selvedges being held firmly by a belt and pulley on each side, the pulleys
                    revolving at such an angle that the stretch on the cloth has to compensate for
                    the difference in distance between these pulleys at A and B.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Beetling.—</hi> The beetles ordinarily employed are a series of
                    long heavy wooden piles arranged in a frame. These piles are alternately raised
                    and allowed to fall with their full weight against the beamed cloth by the
                    revolution of roller having a spiral series of notches, which catch a
                    corresponding range of projections on the piles. The beam with the cloth is made
                    to revolve gently by a ratchet motion as it is submitted to this hammering,
                    which goes on for two or three hours. Recently Mr John Patterson of Belfast has
                    patented and introduced a form of beetlingmachine (fig. 14), which from its
                    highly effective action is likely to come into very extensive use. The
                    advantages claimed for his machine over the common beetle Mr Patterson thus
                    states: “Heretofore, the beetling of textile fabrics has been done by means of
                    beetles, or stampers, falling upon the fabric by the action of gravitation, each
                    stamper or beetle falling 55 or 60 times per minute through a space of 13 to 15
                    inches. This rate of speed cannot be accelerated by gravitation, and the
                    consequence has been that in order to increase the quantity of work done by the
                    ordinary beetles, very bulky and massive machinery has been employed, requiring
                    large and expensive buildings and driving gear. The new beetling-machine
                    requires not one-tenth of the space, very much lighter gearing, and <pb
                    break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit03newyrich/page/n836/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0903-0836-0819"/> instead of making 60 blows per minute, each
                    beetle makes from 420 to 500 blows per minute. The blows are not by the action
                    of gravitation, but are actuated by a series of cranks cut upon a solid steel
                    shaft. There are connecting rods from the steel cranks to semicircular springs.
                    The beetles are attached to, or suspended between, the points of the
                    semicircular springs by means of leather straps. When the crank shaft is set in
                    motion the beetles are snatched up in regular sequence by the upward motion of
                    the cranks, and the springs are compressed by the weight of the beetles, as in
                    fig. 15, and by the combined upward motion of the cranks and the springs the
                    beetle is thrown upwards with great impetus. The upward motion is stopped as the
                    crauks pass the top centres, and the beetles are thus met by the springs and
                    thrown violently into them, causing them to be again compressed, as in fig.
                    16.</p>
                <p>When by the downward motion of the cranks the springs are allowed to throw the
                    beetles on the cloth beam, a rapid forcible whipping blow is imparted to the
                    cloth, which does not cut or injure it in the manner often done by the slow
                    dropping blows of the ordinary beetles. The weight of the blows can be instantly
                    varied by varying the speed of the crank shaft, from the slightest touch to the
                    heaviest penetrating blow. It is found that twice or thrice the number of folds
                    of cloth can be beetled effectively on the cloth beams more than can be done on
                    ordinary beetles, that is, instead of 200 folds on the beam, 400 or 600 folds
                    can be equally well beetled on the new machine.”</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Calendering.</hi> —When it is desired to finish cloth with a
                    stiff or with a glazed finish, instead of being submitted to the operation of
                    beetling, it is finished in the calender. The calender, as its name <hi
                    rend="italic">κύλινδρος</hi> implies, is a series of cylinders mounted above
                    each other in a strong framework. The number of cylinders and the material of
                    which they are constructed vary. In some only three cylinders or bowls are
                    employed, and in others they are four or five. One or two of the bowls are made
                    of metal, and two or three are either of wood, of condensed cotton, or of paper,
                    and they must always be turned with great accuracy and be free from all warping.
                    Cylinders of paper or condensed cotton have a very smooth surface and a
                    considerable amount of elasticity. Between these cylinders the cloth as it comes
                    from the damping-machine is passed, and twice, thrice, or four times, according
                    to the construction of the calender, it is powerfully pressed. The pressure
                    gives the cloth a very even surface, condensing the fibres, and produces a
                    shining lustre. When the cloth is submitted to friction, as well as to pressure
                    in a heated calender, a glazed finish is produced. The frictional effect is
                    produced by the cylinders being geared to move at different rates of rapidity,
                    so that in their revolution they rub over the surfaces of each other in addition
                    to communicating pressure. Fig. 17 shows a finishing or friction calender in
                    section. The metal cylinder <hi rend="italic">a</hi> is made hollow so that it
                    may be heated by the introduction of steam or gas, <hi rend="italic">b</hi> and
                    <hi rend="italic">d</hi> are of compressed cotton or paper of the same diameter
                    as <hi rend="italic">a,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">c</hi> is a smaller metal
                    cylinder. The pressure of the cylinders is regulated by means of the screw <hi
                    rend="italic">e,</hi> and the compound lever/, which is adjusted by the double
                    screw on the connecting rod at <hi rend="italic">g.</hi> The cloth enters over
                    stretching rails and rollers, passes through the calender in the manner
                    indicated by the arrows, and is batched on roller <hi rend="italic">h.</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Elastic Finish.—</hi> This particular kind of finish is applied to
                    muslins and similar thin fabrics, and has to be done in highly-heated apartments
                    called stentering stoves. Formerly the work was entirely done by manual labour,
                    and consisted in holding the fabric by the selvedges, and pulling it forward and
                    backward while it was drying in the heated air. In this way the threads were
                    made to rub against each other, and the cloth was thus deprived of the hard,
                    stiff board-like appearance it would have possessed if left motionless when
                    drying. Mr Ridgway Bridson was the first who introduced a machine which
                    successfully supplanted hand labour in producing the elastic finish in muslins.
                    His stentering frame is thus described :—Two horizontal rails or frames extend
                    side by side the whole length of the machine, carrying at each end a large wheel
                    or pulley, with small pins fixed at equal distances in its periphery. These pins
                    pass through corresponding holes in an endless band which passes round the
                    pulleys. On the surface of the endless bands are fastened very fine needle or
                    tenter points to hold the selvedges of the fabric as it passes through the
                    machine. The horizontal rails can be moved away from each other laterally, so as
                    to stretch the fabric breadthwise. The rails are of equal length with the fabric
                    to be treated, which is fastened by the selvedges at one end to the centre pins,
                    and the pulleys being set in motion, the entire piece is carried on and
                    stretched out over the machine, and the rails are then moved outwards to
                    breadthen the fabric. The elastic finish is given by communicating alternate
                    vibrating motions to the two rails, by which a diagonal stretching is given to
                    the muslin while in the process of drying.</p>
                <p>At the conclusion of any of these various finishing processes, the goods are
                    folded either in a plaiting-machine or by girls hooking plaits of definite
                    length by the selvedges on steel spikes. The end of each separate piece is then
                    stamped with some device or motto intended to serve as a trade-mark. After the
                    goods have been regularly folded, they are placed piece by piece, separated by
                    sheets of <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit03newyrich/page/n837/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0903-0837-0820"/> pasteboard, in a Bramah pres3, and after a
                    certain interval an iron plate is substituted for the pasteboard, to prevent any
                    inequality in the pile. Finally, the folded pieces are prepared for the market
                    by fastening a band of gilt and ornamented paper around each end, which with the
                    imprinted device is in some way regarded as a guarantee of good quality.</p>
                <p>The whole operations of bleaching and finishing occupy on an average eight days,
                    although goods can be hurried through much quicker if occasion arises. The cost,
                    which of course will vary with the price of fuel and other circumstances, is
                    very small as compared with the value of the material, and does not on an
                    average, for shirting calicoes and the like, exceed ljd. per lb weight of
                    cloth.</p>
                <p>Bleaching of Thread.</p>
                <p>We have been favoured by Messrs J. and P. Coats of Paisley with the following
                    outline of the processes in the bleaching of thread :—</p>
                <p>1. The various Nos. of thread are prepared before boiling.</p>
                <p>2. The first boil. The kier used is a common vomiter, into which are put water
                    and a solution of caustic lye,—the proportions being regulated by the number of
                    pounds of thread to be treated.</p>
                <p>3. The first bleach. . The thread is placed in a box, and a sieve let down upon
                    it. Underneath the box is a well which is filled with water and chlorine. The
                    liquor is drawn up by a pump, and thrown upon the sieve, through which it
                    passes, and filters through the thread into the well.</p>
                <p>4. The thread is next moved into a souring-box, also covered with a sieve, where
                    it is washed to take out the chlorine of the previous process.</p>
                <p>5. A souring-well under the souring-box is now filled with water and sulphuric
                    acid, and this mixture, called the <hi rend="italic">sour,</hi> is pumped up on
                    the sieve over the souring-box, through which it runs back into the
                    souring-well, in the same manner as described in process No 3.</p>
                <p>6. Before removing the thread from the souring-box it is washed with water
                    through the sieve.</p>
                <p>7. It is next washed in a washing-machine.</p>
                <p>8. The scald, or second boil in kier. Various mixtures are used for it. Some
                    prefer black soap and crystals of soda; others use caustic lye.</p>
                <p>9-13. Repetition of Nos. 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7.</p>
                <p>14. The thread is now extracted, i.e., dried in hydro-extractors.</p>
                <p>15. Stocking. The stocks are boxes about 3 ft. long, by 2 ft. wide, and 2 ft.
                    deep, with a large wooden mallet hung in each, similar to those used in
                    bleaching linen. The thread hanks having been properly prepared, so that they
                    will not get loose, are put into the stocks with a mixture of hot soap and
                    water, and beat there till of the proper colour. It is then taken out, and</p>
                <p>16. Washed in washing-machine, and</p>
                <p>17. Extracted.</p>
                <p>18. The blueing process is done in a box filled with a solution of water and
                    extract of indigo. As much thread is put in as the box will contain. It is let
                    stand for a time, after which it is taken out and thrown on a barrow.</p>
                <p>19. It is next taken to extractor and dried, and</p>
                <p>20. Placed in the stove. After being a sufficient time there it is</p>
                <p>21. Removed to cooling shed, where it is hung up to cool.</p>
                <p>22. It is now taken to stretching-machine, where it is passed over hot rollers to
                    take out the curl and moisture received in cooling shed.</p>
                <p>23. Taken to warehouse, where Nos. are classed and made up in bundles.</p>
                <p>Bleaching of Linen.</p>
                <p>The bleaching of linen is a much more tedious and difficult operation than the
                    bleaching of cotton. The process of water-retting, or rotting, by which the
                    fibre is separated from the woody portion of the stalk, lodges a large
                    proportion of colouring matter in the fibre, with which it enters into very
                    intimate combination. The amount of colouring matter which has thus to be dealt
                    with in the bleaching of linen is very great, being as much as one-third of the
                    entire weight of the fibre. In the early part of the century a great amount of
                    public attention was given to a plan proposed by Mr James Lee for preparing flax
                    fibre without the process of steeping or retting, by which it was affirmed that,
                    among other advantages, it would only be necessary simply to wash, in soap,
                    linen fabrics made from fibre so prepared, to render them pure and white. Mr Lee
                    obtained a special Act of parliament allowing the specification of his patent to
                    remain sealed for seven years, and his plans were entered into in a most full
                    and laborious manner by the Irish Linen Board. After the expenditure of many
                    thousands of pounds on his machines and experiments, the plan had to be entirely
                    abandoned as a failure. More recently, Chevalier Claussen renewed the attempt to
                    prepare flax without steeping, by breaking it by means of machinery, separating
                    the refuse part of the stalk from it, and then by a chemical process splitting
                    the hollow fibres, so as to reduce them to a soft cottony state fit for spinning
                    by means of the cotton-spinning machinery. The fibre was proposed to be split by
                    steeping the prepared flax in a solution of carbonate of soda, and then plunging
                    it into dilute sulphuric acid. The sudden evolution of carbonic acid gas within
                    the hollow tube of the flax was said to have the effect of splitting up the
                    fibre and reducing it to fine flat threads possessing the felting properties of
                    cotton. Sir Robert Kane, in his Report to the House of Commons, May 20, 1852,
                    states that the whole process failed. The machinery for the beating and
                    cleansing of the flax failed to separate it sufficiently from the refuse part of
                    the stalk; and the chemical process for the splitting of the hollow tube only
                    broke up small portions of the exposed ends, leaving the greater portion
                    untouched. Various other plans of preparing flax fibres without water or
                    dewretting have from time to time been proposed and patented, but hitherto none
                    of them has stood the test of extended practical operation. Till towards the end
                    of last century the bleaching of linen both in the north of Ireland and Scotland
                    was accomplished by bowking in cow’s dung and souring with sour milk. In the
                    year 1764 Dr James Ferguson of Belfast received a premium of £300 from the Irish
                    Linen Board for the application of lime in the bleaching of linen.
                    Notwithstanding this reward the use of lime in the bleaching of linen was for a
                    long time afterwards forbidden in Ireland under statutory penalties, and so late
                    as 1815 “Mr James Barklie, a respectable linen-bleacher of Linen Vale, near
                    Keady, was prosecuted for using lime in the whitening of linens in his
                    bleachyard.” The bleaching of linen to the present day is conducted much more in
                    the primitive fashion of last century than is the practice with
                    cotton-bleaching. Owing to the stiffness and inelasticity of flax fibres, a
                    great part of the machinery used for cotton is not available for linen, and
                    solutions of acid and bleaching-powder require to be used in a very dilute
                    condition for linen fabrics, involving frequent repetitions of the various
                    processes before a satisfactory white is produced. “Crofting,” or exposure to
                    the air on grass, is also very largely resorted to in the bleaching of linens,
                    especially for plain shirting and sheeting, which necessitates the possession of
                    very extensive grass parks in connection with works, and renders the process
                    both tedious and subject to the influences of the weather. A large proportion of
                    linen cloth is half-bleached or improved in the yarn before being woven, and it
                    consequently requires less bleaching than that which comes in its original
                    “green” condition. The following is an outline of the two chief methods, with
                    and without crofting, as pursued in the principal Scotch linen bleachfields at
                    the present day :—</p>

                <p>Bleaching of Paper-Making Materials.</p>
                <p>In addition to cotton and linen rags, esparto or Spanish grass <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Macrochloa</hi><hi rend="italic">tenacissima)</hi> is now very largely used
                    for the manufacture of the better classes of paper. Wood, especially the wood of
                    the aspen <hi rend="italic">(Populus tremula),</hi> is also now applied as a
                    paper-making material. Jute has been used for printing paper, and straw is very
                    largely employed, but chiefly for brown and packing papers. These and the
                    numerous other substances used for paper-making are all reduced to the condition
                    of “half-stuff” before they come to undergo the operation of bleaching, and the
                    treatment they receive in this stage varies only in the amount of whitening
                    required, and consequently in the proportions of bleachiug solution used. It is
                    therefore unnecessary to notice more than the process followed in the bleaching
                    of the “half-stuff,” which in Great Britain is very frequently prepared from a
                    mixture of esparto fibre and rags. The bleaching solution of chloride of lime is
                    either prepared in specially constructed cisterns, fitted with revolving
                    agitators and stored in a reservoir for use, or prepared for immediate use in a
                    wooden vessel. When the solution is made up to the requisite strength, and all
                    insoluble sediment has sunk to the bottom of the vessel, it is ready for pouring
                    into the engine. From 4 to 10 lb of ordinary bleaching-powder are used for every
                    100 lb of rag half-stuff, but a much larger proportion is required for esparto.
                    Sulphuric acid in not more than a proportion of 1 lb to 4 lb of bleaching-powder
                    is thereafter added in a highly dilute condition, and the whole, after mixing in
                    the engine, is turned into the drainer, which is a large tank provided with a
                    false bottom of perforated wood covered with wire-netting or bagging. In some
                    cases the bleaching-liquids are not added to the pulp material till it is
                    deposited in the drainer; and the acid solution may be poured in first, or both
                    solutions may be alternately used in small quantities. The bleaching precess is
                    sometimes carried on in separate engines constructed of materials not affected
                    by the corrosive action of acid substances. Drained half-stuff may also be
                    bleached in a suitable apparatus by the direct application of chlorine gas.</p>
                <p>It is of the greatest importance to free the pulpy material from the last traces
                    of chlorine before it is made into paper, as it would react upon the
                    manufactured product and render it brittle. To eliminate the free chlorine and
                    acid, &amp;c., the pulp is washed in the beater with pure water till it ceases
                    to redden litmus paper, or give other characteristic indications of the presence
                    of such compounds. The prejudicial effects of chlorine and its combinations are
                    also overcome by the addition of “antichlor,” the hyposulphite of soda or of
                    lime, which forms with them compounds that do not affect the colour of the
                    paper, although it is desirable, as far as possible, to remove such compounds
                    also by washing with water.</p>
                <p>Bleaching of Straw.</p>
                <p>The fine wheat-straw used in Tuscany and elsewhere for straw-plaiting, after
                    being cut, dried, and tied up in bundles, is stacked for a month. It is then
                    spread out in a meadow, and exposed to the action of the sun and air, being
                    frequently turned during that period. The lower joint of the straw is then
                    separated, leaving only the upper joint with the ear attached,—this being the
                    only part of the straw used. It is then steamed, and after that exposed to the
                    action of sulphurous acid gas prepared by burning sulphur, which complete the
                    bleaching. It is then tied up in bundles, in which state it is ready for the
                    market. In the strawplait-making centres of Great Britain—Luton, Dunstable,
                    &amp;c., in Bedfordshire—straw is bleached, chiefly after plaiting, by the
                    influence of sulphurous acid gas.</p>
                <p>Whitening and Cleaning Prints, Maps, Books, and other Articles of Paper.</p>
                <p>Chlorine was first applied to this purpose by Chaptal, and his method was
                    employed with the greatest success by Vialard and Heudier, who by Chaptai’s
                    process restored several of the most valuable books of the French .National
                    Library. Chaptai’s <hi rend="italic">modus</hi><hi rend="italic">operandi</hi>
                    is thus described in his own words :—</p>
                <p>“They begin by unsewing the book and separating it into leaves, which they place
                    in cases formed in a leaden tub, with very thin slips of wood or glass, so that
                    the leaves, when laid flat, are separated from each other by intervals scarcely
                    sensible. The acid is then poured in, making it fall on the sides of the tub, in
                    order that the leaves may not be deranged by its motion. When the workman
                    judges, by the whiteness of the paper, that it has been sufficiently acted upon
                    by the acid, it is drawn off by a cock at the bottom of the tub, and its place
                    is supplied by clear fresh water, which weakens and carries off the remains of
                    the acid, as well as its strong smell. The leaves are then to be dried, and,
                    after being pressed, may be again bound up.</p>
                <p>“The leaves may be placed also vertically in the tub; and this position seems to
                    possess some advantage, as they will then be less liable to be tom. With this
                    view I constructed a wooden frame, which I adjusted to the proper height,
                    according to the size of the leaves which I wished to whiten. This frame
                    supported very thin slips of wood, leaving only the space of half a line between
                    them. 1 placed two leaves in each of these intervals, and kept them fixed in
                    their place by two small wooden wedges, which I pushed in between the slips.
                    When the paper was whitened, I lifted up the frame with the leaves, and plunged
                    them into cold water, to remove the remains of the acid, as well as the smell.
                    This process I prefer to the other.</p>
                <p>“By this operation books are not only cleaned, but the paper acquires a degree of
                    whiteness superior to what it possessed when first made. The use of this acid is
                    attended also with the valuable advantage of destroying ink spots. This liquor
                    has no action upon spots of oil, or animal grease; but it has been long known
                    that a weak solution of potash will effectually remove stains of that kind.</p>

                <p>“When I had to repair prints so torn that they exhibited only scraps pasted upon
                    other paper, I was afraid of losing these fragments in the liquid, because the
                    paste became dissolved. In such cases I enclosed the prints in a cylindrical
                    glass vessel, which I inverted on the water in which I had put the mixture
                    proper for extricating the oxygenated muriatic acid gas. This vapour, by filling
                    the whole inside of the jar, acted upon the print, extracted the grease as well
                    as ink spots, and the fragments remained pasted to the paper.”</p>

                    the action of sulphurous vapours.</p>
                <p>Bleaching of Wool.</p>
                <p>The bleaching of wool and animal fibres generally is a much simpler and less
                    important operation than is the whitening of vegetable fibres. Wool is covered
                    with a peculiar varnish or greasy matter which impairs its qualities, and which
                    it is the object of the bleacher to remove. To this varnish the name of “yolk”
                    or “suint” is given. It is a fatty unctuous matter, chiefly derived from the
                    cutaneous perspiration, but, no doubt, also secreted by the pores of the wool
                    itself; and it imparts that peculiar heavy odour to sheep with which all must be
                    familiar. From the researches of Vauquelin it would appear that this unctuous
                    varnish consists chiefly of a kind of soap, together with a small quantity of
                    waxy matter, a peculiar odorous animal substance, a mixture of potash salts, and
                    a little lime. This varnish, in consequence of its soapy nature, is soluble in
                    water, so that washing in pure water would remove the greater portion of it; but
                    it is found more advantageous to remove it by the process termed “scouring.”</p>
                <p>Scouring is performed by means of an ammoniacal lye, prepared of river or other
                    soft water mixed with stale purified urine, which is found to contain a large
                    quantity of ammonia, upon which its action probably depends. The mixture is
                    heated by steam to a temperature at which the hand of the workman can be easily
                    held in it for a considerable time, In this bath the wool is left for from half
                    an hour to two hours, according to the quantity of greasy matter it contains. It
                    is then to be taken out and drained into a basket, so that the drainings may
                    drop into the vessel in which it was steeped, that nothing may be lost. It must
                    now be completely rinsed by exposing it in baskets to a continuous stream of
                    clear water, while a workman is perpetually employed in stirring it with a pole,
                    till the water passes off perfectly clear. As a substitute for urine pig’s dung
                    is sometimes used, and various other substances have been proposed and
                    introduced, such as ammoniacal salts, soda-ash, phosphate of soda, and soluble
                    glass. Recently a machine, Petrie’s wool-washer, has been introduced for
                    scouring wools. It consists of a range of three or four long tanks, clean water
                    entering at one end of the series and flowing through the whole. The wool is
                    introduced at the end of the range where the water escapes, and where it is
                    consequently most highly charged with the impurities of the washing process, and
                    it is carried forward from one tank to another till it is lifted out at the
                    point where the pure water enters.</p>
                <p>It is known that the wool is properly scoured by its filaments being smooth,
                    long, slender, white, and perfectly free from foreign substances, and not having
                    lost their natural tenacity. If this scouring be properly done there is no need
                    of further washings in soaps, or otherwise, till the wool is subjected to the
                    process called “sulphuring;” and in pi int of fact it is very rarely passed
                    through any other process. Some, however, recommend for the finer wools, where a
                    very delicate white is wished, that they should be passed through one, two, or
                    more baths of soft soap. No caustic alkaline lyes can be employed, as they
                    destroy the wool altogether, dissolving it, and forming with it a kind of
                    soap.</p>
                <p>The process of sulphuring is applied to yarns and woven goods only when they are
                    intended to be finished white or light bright colours. Formerly, the method of
                    sulphuring woollen goods was to expose them in a close apartment to the vapour
                    of burning sulphur. The goods were hung on poles, and when the chamber was
                    filled, a quantity of sulphur placed in very flat and broad dishes was allowed
                    to burn away gradually in the chamber, while every aperture by which the vapour
                    could escape was carefully closed. After exposure to the sulphurous acid vapours
                    from six to twenty-four hours the bleaching process was complete, and the goods
                    withdrawn from the chamber. The same process is now much more expeditiously
                    performed by Thom’s sulphuring process. The goods-are passed on a long chain up
                    and down over a series of rollers in a small chamber filled with sulphurous acid
                    vapours, and a few minutes suffice for the operation. Sulphite of soda acidified
                    with hydrochloric acid is also used in France for the bleaching of woollen
                    fabrics.</p>
                <p>Cloth which is to be finished white after the sulphuring process is run through a
                    bath containing some indigo carmine, which increases the brilliancy of the
                    white. When it is to be dyed it is treated with dilute sulphuric acid,
                    thoroughly washed, and dried.</p>
                <p>Bleaching of Silk.</p>
                <p>Raw silk is covered with a kind of varnish, the nature of which was first
                    thoroughly investigated by M. Board. He showed that this varnish, instead of
                    being a gum, as was usually believed, resembled a mixture of bees’ wax and oil,
                    with a resinous colouring matter, and in raw silk constituted 23 or 24 per cent,
                    of the weight. The varnish is soluble in water, and affords a solution which
                    forms a lather like soap. The yellow varnish is of a resinous nature, and is
                    insoluble in water, but is soluble in alcohol. The waxy substance exists in all
                    silks, but the whiter the silk the less wax does it contain.</p>
                <p>The comparative composition of yellow and white raw silk is shown by M. Mulder’s
                    analysis :—</p>

                <p>This varnish, or “gum,” as it is technically called, gives the silk a stiffness
                    and elasticity which, for many of the purposes to which silk is applied, it is
                    desirable to remove. This is called “ungumming” by the bleachers of silk. Though
                    many different processes have been suggested for this purpose, none seems to
                    answer so well as the old process of scouring in a weak solution of soap. If,
                    however, the silk be kept in the soap too long after the varnish is removed, it
                    begins to lose bcdy, and has its qualities impaired, becoming dull, stiff, and
                    discoloured, in consequence of being partly dissolved. White or yellow silks may
                    be completely scoured in one hour in the soap bath, using about 15 lb of water
                    for each pound of silk, and a suitable quantity of the finest soap. The soap and
                    silk should be put into the water half an hour before it is brought to the
                    boiling point, and then be boiled one hour. They are then removed, wrung out,
                    washed in pure water, and either exposed to the vapour of sulphur or passed
                    through a solution of sulphurous acid gas in water.</p>
                <p>The following is the process usually followed by the scourer of silks. A quantity
                    of water is put into a boiler over a fire, and for every 100 S&gt; of silk tobe
                    scoured, 30 ft&gt; <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit03newyrich/page/n840/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0903-0840-0823"/> of very fine soap are dissolved. The solution is
                    generally boiled; but before the silk is put into it, the heat must be lowered
                    to about 90° Fahr., and at this temperature it must be kept during the process.
                    The silks are to be hung in the liquor on rods or frames, and left till the gum
                    is sufficiently destroyed,—care being taken to alter their position now and
                    then, so that every part may be exposed to the action of the bath. When
                    perfectly ungummed, they are flexible and of a dull whiteness; in this state
                    they are to be wrung out to clear them of the soapy water, then well shaken, and
                    put into coarse linen bags, in parcels of from 20 to 30 lb each.</p>
                <p>These bags are now to be steeped in a fresh bath, or, as the workmen say, are to
                    be baked. The bath is prepared in a manner and proportion much as before, except
                    that the quantity of soap may be somewhat diminished as the heat is to be
                    increased; for the silk is now to be boiled for an hour and a half, taking care
                    to keep the bags from sticking to the bottom of the boiler, by frequently
                    stirring them with a stick. For silk that is intended to be dyed, the former
                    steeping in the lukewarm soap-bath is unnecessary, and the boiling only is
                    employed, using a greater quantity of soap in proportion to the fineness of the
                    colour. After boiling the silk is wrung as before, and then washed, and if it is
                    found to be not sufficiently or not uniformly scoured, it must be submitted to a
                    fresh bath.</p>
                <p>The white silk usually sold has a bluish shade given it by a bath impregnated
                    with litmus or indigo. This is prepared by dissolving a pound and a half of fine
                    soap in about 90 gallons of water, in which a small quantity of litmus or indigo
                    has been diffused. This process gives to the silk the tints known by the names
                    of “silver white,” “azure white,” and “thread white,” according to the depth of
                    shade which has been imparted. The “China white” tint is given by adding arnotto
                    to the bath instead of indigo.</p>
                <p>From these processes the silk acquires a tolerably clear white, but the highest
                    degree is given to it by the action of sulphurous acid, the silk being either,
                    as is usually the case, subjected to the acid in the state of vapour, or
                    immersed in a solution. At Lyons no soap is used in the tinting process; but,
                    after being boiled, the silk is washed, wrung dry, sulphured, and then passed
                    through water properly blued.</p>
                <p>Bleaching of Bees’-Wax, &amp;c.</p>
                <p>Bees’-wax in its raw condition, as it is first melted up from the comb, is a
                    yellowish coloured substance somewhat greasy to the touch, and having a faint
                    honey-like odour. It often contains mechanical impurities, besides traces of
                    honey, and to remove these and discharge the colour the following process is
                    adopted :—The wax is broken up into small pieces and melted in a copper boiler,
                    with water sufficient to keep it from burning. When melted it is run into a tub
                    containing hot water, and while in the hot fluid condition the mechanical
                    impurities it may have contained subside to the bottom. From this tub the melted
                    wax flows into a vessel, the bottom of which is perforated with small holes.
                    Through these thin streams of wax are received on a cylinder kept revolving in
                    water below; and thus fine threads of solid wax are produced. These are exposed
                    on moistened sheets to the air and light for some days, during which they are
                    occasionally turned and watered. By this exposure the wax loses much of its
                    colour. It is then melted up into solid blocks and left for some time, after
                    which the operations of melting, forming into threads, and bleaching in the
                    light are repeated till it has attained a pure white translucent lustre, is of
                    very firm consistency, and is free from all odour. Yellow wax is also
                    decolorized by treatment with nitric acid , but chlorine, although it bleaches
                    most expeditiously, is not available, as it leaves traces incorporated with the
                    wax, which on burning evolves irritating fumes of hydrochloric acid. Palm oil,
                    used in the manufacture of soap and candles, is bleached by the action of
                    bichromate of potash and acid.</p>
                <p>For bleaching generally, but especially for the bleaching of animal fibres and
                    substances, the use of a considerable variety of processes, and of chemicals
                    other than chlorine and sulphur compounds, have from time to time been proposed
                    and to some extent put into operation. To some of these proposals incidental
                    allusion has already been made, and generally their success has not been such as
                    to warrant special notice. Among other substances which have been recommended
                    for scouring wools and silk are feeble solutions of sulphides of sodium and of
                    potassium, or aluminates of these alkalies, the cyanide of potassium, and a
                    mixture of common salt and oxalic acid. The alkaline permanganates have also
                    been frequently regarded as hopeful bleaching chemicals; and a few years ago the
                    permanganate of potash was introduced and used by MM. Tessié du Motay and
                    Maréchal, who, in connection with the permanganate, used a solution of the
                    peroxide of hydrogen. To this latter substance a peculiar bleaching application
                    has recently been given. Under the name of <hi rend="italic">golden hair
                    water,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">auricome,</hi> a liquid is sold by
                    hair-dressers which is found to hold in solution a large percentage of peroxide
                    of hydrogen. The use of this solution gives to the hair the brilliant golden
                    yellow tinge which has come to be regarded as a highly fashionable colour. Other
                    applications of this powerful oxidizing and reducing agent have been suggested
                    by its toilet use, and it has been employed for the bleaching of ornamental
                    feathers, hair, &amp;c. Doubtless, if it could be prepared in stable solution at
                    moderate price it would be found extensively useful in bleaching and other
                    industrial applications. It has also long been hoped that a means of applying
                    ozone as a direct bleaching agent might be devised, but hitherto little success
                    has been attained in this direction. In Germany ivory is bleached by steeping it
                    a week in light naphtha or other volatile oil, and exposing it thereafter to the
                    air and sunlight, by which the atmospheric oxygen becomes ozonized in contact
                    with the ivory and thus whitens it. (J. <hi rend="smallcaps">pa.)</hi></p>
