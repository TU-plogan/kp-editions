                    eminent German philosopher and theologian, born 27th March 1765 at Munich, was
                    the third son of F. P. Baader, court physician to the elector of Bavaria. His
                    two elder brothers were both distinguished, the eldest, Clemens, as an author,
                    the second, Joseph, as an engineer. Franz when young was extremely delicate, and
                    from his seventh to his eleventh year was afflicted with a species of mental
                    weakness, which singularly enough disappeared entirely when he was introduced
                    for the first time to the mathematical diagrams of Euclid. His progress
                    thenceforth was very rapid. At the age of sixteen he entered the university of
                    Ingolstadt, where he studied medicine, and graduated in 1782. He then spent two
                    years at Vienna, and returning home, for a short time assisted his father in his
                    extensive practice. This life he soon found unsuited for him, and he decided on
                    becoming a mining engineer. He studied under Werner at Freiberg, travelled
                    through several of the mining districts in North Germany, and for four years,
                    1792-1796, resided in England. There he became acquainted with the works of
                    Jakob Böhme, and at the same time was brought into contact with the
                    rationalistic 18th-century ideas of Hume, Hartley, and Godwin, which were
                    extremely distasteful to him. For Baader throughout his whole life had the
                    deepest sense of the <hi rend="italic">reality</hi> of religious truths, and
                    could find no satisfaction in mere reason or philosophy. “God is my witness,” he
                    writes in his journal of 1786, “how heartily and how often I say with Pascal,
                    that with all our speculation and demonstration we remain without God in the
                    world.” Modern philosophy he thought essentially atheistic in its tendencies,
                    and he soon grew to be dissatisfied with the Kantian system, by which he had
                    been at first attracted. Particularly displeasing to him was the ethical
                    autonomy, or the position that man had in himself a rule of action, that duty
                    contained no necessary reference to God. This Baader called “a morality for
                    devils,” and passionately declared that if Satan could again come upon earth, he
                    would assume the garb of a professor of moral philosophy. The mystical, but
                    profoundly religious, speculations of Eckhart, St Martin, and above all of
                    Böhme, were more in harmony with his mode of thought, and to them he devoted
                    himself. In 1796 he returned from England, and in his passage through Hamburg
                    became acquainted with Jacobi, the <hi rend="italic">Faith</hi> philosopher,
                    with whom he was for many years on terms of close friendship. He now for the
                    first time learned something of Schelling, and the works he published during
                    this period were manifestly influenced by that philosopher. Yet Baader is no
                    disciple of Schelling, and probably, in the way of affecting the future course
                    of Schelling’s thought, gave out more than he received. Their personal
                    friendship continued till about the year 1822, when Baader’s vehement
                    denunciation of modern <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0903-0189-0174"/> philosophy in his letter to the Czar of Russia
                    entirely alienated Schelling.</p>
                <p>While prosecuting his philosophical researches, Baader had continued to apply
                    himself diligently to his profession of engineer. He gained a prize of 12,000
                    gulden (about £1000) for his new method of employing Glauber’s salts instead of
                    potash in the making of glass. From 1817 to 1820 he held the post of
                    superintendent of mines, and was raised to the rank of nobility for his
                    services. He retired from business in 1820, and soon after published one of the
                    best of his works, <hi rend="italic">Fermenta Cognitionis,</hi> 6 pts., 1822-25,
                    in which he combats modern philosophy, and recommends the study of J. Böhme. In
                    1826, when the new university was opened at Munich, he was appointed professor
                    of philosophy and speculative theology. Some of the lectures delivered there he
                    published under the title, <hi rend="italic">Spekulative Dogmatik,</hi> 4 pts.,
                    1827-1836. In 1838 he opposed the interference in civil matters of the Roman
                    Catholic Church, to which he belonged, and in consequence was, during the last
                    three years of his life, interdicted from lecturing on the philosophy of
                    religion. He died 23d May 1841.</p>
                <p>It is extremely difficult to give in moderate compass an adequate view of
                    Baader’s philosophy; for he himself generally either gave expression to his
                    deepest thoughts in brief, obscure aphorisms, or veiled them under mystical
                    symbols and analogies. In this respect his style of exposition is not
                    undeserving of Zeller’s strictures <hi rend="italic">(Ges. d.</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">deut.</hi><hi rend="italic">Phil.,</hi> 732, 736). Further, he has
                    no systematic works; his doctrines were for the most part thrown out in short
                    detached essays, in comments on the writings of Böhme and St Martin, or in his
                    extensive correspondence and journals. For his own part, he was distinctly of
                    opinion that philosophy is not as yet capable of reduction to scientific form,
                    and it would consequently be an error to demand from him a rigidly coherent body
                    of truth. At the same time, the general tendency of his thought is very
                    apparent, and there are some salient points which stand out with a clearness
                    sufficient to render possible an outline of his whole course of speculation. In
                    the mode in which he approaches the problems of philosophy, Baader is entirely
                    opposed to the modern speculative spirit, which, beginning with Descartes, has
                    endeavoured to erect a rational or coherent system on the basis of
                    self-consciousness alone, and has protested against the presupposition of
                    anything which can fetter reason, and against the acceptation of any truth which
                    cannot be rationally construed. He starts from the position that human reason is
                    in a corrupt condition, and by itself can never reach the end it aims at, and
                    maintains that we cannot throw aside the presuppositions of faith, church, and
                    tradition. His point of view may, with some truth, be described as
                    Scholasticism; for, like the great scholastic doctors, he believes that theology
                    and philosophy are not opposed sciences, but that reason has to make clear the
                    truths given by authority and revelation. But in his attempt to draw still
                    closer the realms of nature and of grace, of faith and knowledge, of human
                    thought and divine reason, he approaches more nearly to the mysticism of
                    Eckhart, Paracelsus, and Böhme. All self-consciousness, he thinks, is at the
                    same time God-consciousness; our knowledge is never mere <hi rend="italic"
                    >sdentia,</hi> it is invariably <hi rend="italic">con-sdentia—</hi> a knowing
                    with, consciousness of, or participation in God. Of this knowledge, as of
                    knowledge in general, there are three grades :—(1.) Where the thing known
                    impresses itself upon us without or against the will, where the knowledge is
                    necessary,—such, <hi rend="italic">e.g.,</hi> is the knowledge <hi rend="italic"
                    >that</hi> God is; (2.) Where the thing known is cognised by an act on our part,
                    where knowledge is free,—such, <hi rend="italic">e.g.,</hi> is the voluntary
                    belief or trust <hi rend="italic">in</hi> God; (3.) Where the thing known enters
                    into, and forms part of, the very process of knowing,—such is the <hi
                    rend="italic">speculative</hi> knowledge of God, wherein we recognise that
                    without God we are not, and that we know Him only in and through His knowledge
                    of us. The notion of God is thus the fundamental thought of Baader; his
                    philosophy is in all essentials a theosophy, and its first great problem is to
                    determine accurately the nature of the divine Being. Now God, who is, according
                    to Baader, the primary will which lies at the basis of all things, is not to be
                    conceived as mere abstract Being, <hi rend="italic">substantia,</hi> but as
                    everlasting process, activity, <hi rend="italic">actus.</hi> Of this everlasting
                    process, this self-generation of God, we may distinguish two aspects—the
                    immanent or esoteric, and the emanent or exoteric. God has reality only in so
                    far as He is absolute spirit, and only in so far as the primitive will cognises
                    or is conscious of itself can it become spirit at all. But, in this very
                    cognition of self is involved the distinction of knower and known, producer and
                    produced, from which proceeds the power to become spirit. This immanent process
                    of self-consciousness, wherein indeed a trinity of persons is not given but only
                    rendered possible, is mirrored in, and takes place through, the eternal and
                    impersonal idea or wisdom of God, which exists beside, though not distinct from,
                    the primitive will. Concrete reality or personality is given to this divine <hi
                    rend="italic">Temar,</hi> as Baader calls it, through <hi rend="italic"
                    >nature,</hi> the principle of self-hood, of individual being, which is
                    eternally and necessarily produced by God. Only in nature is the trinity of <hi
                    rend="italic">persons</hi> attained. These processes, it must be noticed, are
                    not to be conceived as successive, or as taking place in time; they are to be
                    looked at <hi rend="italic">sub specie</hi><hi rend="italic">aeternitatis,</hi>
                    as the necessary elements or moments in the self-evolution of the divine Being.
                    Nor is <hi rend="italic">nature</hi> to be confounded with created substance, or
                    with matter as it exists in space and time; it is pure non-being, the mere
                    otherness, <hi rend="italic">alteritas,</hi> of God—his shadow, desire, want, or
                    <hi rend="italic">desiderium sui,</hi> as it is called by mystical writers.
                    Creation is itself a free and non-temporal act of God’s love and will, and on
                    this account its reality cannot be speculatively deduced, but must be accepted
                    as an historic fact. Created beings were originally of three orders — the
                    intelligent, or angels; the non-intelligent natural existences; and man, who
                    mediated between these two orders. Intelligent beings are endowed with freedom;
                    it is possible, but not necessary, that they should fall. Hence the fact of the
                    fall is not a speculative, but an historic truth. The angels fell through
                    pride—through desire to raise themselves to equality with God; man fell by
                    lowering himself to the level of nature. Only after the fall of man begins the
                    creation of space, time, and matter, or of the world as we now know it; and the
                    motive of this creation was the desire to afford man an opportunity for taking
                    advantage of the scheme of redemption, for bringing forth in purity the image of
                    God according to which he has been fashioned. The physical philosophy and
                    anthropology which Baader, in connection with this, unfolds in various works, is
                    but little instructive, and coincides in the main with the semi-intelligible
                    utterances of Böhme. In nature and in man he finds traces of the dire effects of
                    sin, which has corrupted both, and has destroyed their natural harmony. As
                    regards ethics, it has been already pointed out that Baader rejects the Kantian
                    or any autonomic system of morals. Not obedience to a moral law, but realisation
                    in ourselves of the divine life, through and in which we have our being, is the
                    true ethical end. But man has lost the power to effect this by himself; he has
                    alienated himself from God, and therefore no ethical theory which neglects the
                    facts of sin and redemption is satisfactory or even possible. The history of man
                    and of humanity is the history of the redeeming love of God. The means whereby
                    we put ourselves so in relation with Christ as to receive from Him his healing
                    virtue, are chiefly prayer and <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit03newyrich/page/n190/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0903-0190-0175"/> the sacraments of the church, though it must be
                    noted that mere works are never sufficient. With regard to man in his social
                    relations there are two great institutions or systems of rules under which, or
                    in connection with which, he stands. One is temporal, natural, and limited—the
                    state; the other is eternal, cosmopolitan, and universal— the church. In the
                    state two things are requisite: first, common submission to the ruler, which can
                    only be secured or given when the state is Christian, for God alone is the true
                    ruler of men; and, secondly, inequality of rank, without which there can be no
                    organisation. A despotism of mere power, and liberalism, which naturally
                    produces socialism, are equally objectionable. The ideal state is a perfectly
                    organised church society, a civil community ruled by a universal or Catholic
                    church, and the principles of this church are equally distinct from mere passive
                    pietism, or faith which will <hi rend="italic">know</hi> nothing, and from the
                    Protestant doctrine, which is the very radicalism of reason.</p>
                <p>Baader is, without doubt, the greatest speculative theologian of modern
                    Catholicism, and his influence has extended itself even beyond the precincts of
                    his own church. The great work of Rothe, <hi rend="italic">Theologische
                    Ethik,</hi> is thoroughly impregnated with his spirit; and, not to mention
                    others, J. Müller, <hi rend="italic">Christ.</hi><hi rend="italic">Lehre</hi><hi

                    his influence.</p>
                <p>His works have been collected and published by a number of his
                    adherents—Hoffmann, Hamberger, E. v. Schaden, Lutterbeck, Von Osten-Sacken, and

                    Valuable introductions by the editors are prefixed to the several volumes. Vol.
                    xv. contains a full biography; vol. xvi., an index, and an able sketch of the
                    whole system by Lutterbeck. Among the most valuable works in elucidation or
                    development of Baader’s philosophy may be named :—Hoffmann, <hi rend="italic"
