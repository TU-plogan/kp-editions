                    except those derived from the Cyrillic original (see <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Alphabet,</hi> vol. i. p. 613), such as the Russian. In these a modified form,
                    in which only the top of the upper loop appears, stands as the second letter,
                    with the value of the original sound <hi rend="italic">b</hi>; whilst the old
                    symbol B comes third with the phonetic value <hi rend="italic">v</hi> or <hi
                    rend="italic">w.</hi> In Egypt this letter was originally a hieroglyph for a
                    crane, and afterwards represented also the sound <hi rend="italic">b</hi>. The
                    symbol and its phonetic value were borrowed by the Phoenicians, but not its
                    name, as we infer from finding it called in Hebrew <hi rend="italic">beth,
                    i.e.,</hi> a house. In its oldest known Phoenician form the upper loop only
                    exists in a more or less rounded shape. In different alphabets even the upper
                    loop was gradually opened, so that in the square Hebrew the original form can no
                    longer be detected. The Greeks, when they borrowed it from the Phoenicians,
                    closed up the lower loop as well as the upper for convenience of writing.
                    Sometimes the loops were angular, but more generally they were rounded. There is
                    little variation of the form, except in the old alphabets of Corinth and
                    Corcyra, where the original is hardly recognisable. In old Latin both the
                    rounded and the pointed loops appear.</p>
                <p>The original sound which this symbol represented, and which it still represents
                    in most European languages, is a closed labial, <hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> one
                    in which perfect closure of the lips is necessary, the sound being heard as the
                    lips open. Like all closed sounds, it is not capable of prolongation. It differs
                    from <hi rend="italic">p,</hi> which is also a closed labial, as a sonant from a
                    surd. A sonant is heard when the breath, as it passes through the glottis, is
                    vocalised by the tension or approximation of its edges. When there is no such
                    action of the glottis, mere breath alone passes through; but the explosiveness
                    of the breath when the vocal organs are opened produces a sound, and this is
                    called a surd. The vocal organs are in precisely the same position for <hi
                    rend="italic">p</hi> as for <hi rend="italic">b;</hi> but in producing <hi
                    rend="italic">p</hi> they act upon breath only; in producing <hi rend="italic"
                    >b</hi> they articulate voice.</p>
                <p>In the earliest stage to which we can trace back the language spoken by the
                    forefathers of the Indo-European nations, it cannot be certainly proved that the
                    sound <hi rend="italic">b</hi> was ever heard at the beginning of a word.
                    Perhaps in this position it may have been sounded indistinctly as a labial <hi
                    rend="italic">v.</hi> In English and all Low German languages <hi rend="italic"
                    >p</hi> has taken the place of original <hi rend="italic">b,</hi> which is
                    preserved in Greek and Latin; thus the <hi rend="italic">b</hi> in <hi
                    rend="italic">κάνναβη</hi> is replaced by <hi rend="italic">p</hi> in English
                    “hemp.” We do not certainly know the reason of this shifting of sound, which
                    affects all momentary sounds, and which is commonly known in England by the name
                    of “Grimm’s law.” By the same law English <hi rend="italic">b</hi> has taken the
                    place of original <hi rend="italic">bh.</hi> Thus our “beech” stands for
                    original “bhaga,” which is represented, according to the phonetic laws of the
                    languages, by Greek <hi rend="italic">φηγός</hi> and Latin “fagus.” In the
                    middle of a Latin word, and consequently generally in the languages derived from
                    the Latin, <hi rend="italic">b</hi> represents original <hi rend="italic"
                    >bh.</hi></p>
                <p>There is a tendency among some peoples to allow the <hi rend="italic">b</hi>
                    sound to pass into a <hi rend="italic">v,</hi> in which the lips are not firmly
                    closed, and so the sound is capable of prolongation, because it does not consist
                    (as <hi rend="italic">b</hi> proper does) in the momentary escape of the voice
                    after the lips have been compressed and then opened. This <hi rend="italic"
                    >v,</hi> in the production of which the lips alone are concerned, must be
                    carefully distinguished from our English <hi rend="italic">v,</hi> which is the
                    result of pressure between the upper teeth and lower lip; it is more like our
                    English <hi rend="italic">w.</hi></p>
                <p>It is the sound which has taken the place of <hi rend="italic">b</hi> in modern
                    Greek. The same confusion is found in Latin inscriptions of the 3d and 4th
                    centuries after Christ, when the symbol <hi rend="italic">v</hi> represents
                    original <hi rend="italic">b;</hi> thus <hi rend="italic">sivi</hi> stands for
                    <hi rend="italic">sibi,</hi><hi rend="italic">livido</hi> for <hi rend="italic"
                    >libido</hi> (see Corssen, <hi rend="italic">Aussprache,</hi> &amp;c., i. 131);
                    and still more frequently <hi rend="italic">b</hi> appears for <hi rend="italic"
                    >v,</hi> as <hi rend="italic">bixit</hi><hi rend="italic smallcaps"> íqt</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">vixit.</hi> The change would be inconceivable if the symbol <hi
                    rend="italic">v</hi> in these cases had had the same sound as with us, that of a
                    labiodental. The same indistinctness appeared locally in dialects, as is shown
                    by Martial’s well-known epigram—</p>
                <p>“Haud temere antiquas mutat Vasconia voces, Cui nil est aliud <hi rend="italic"
                    >vivere</hi> quam <hi rend="italic">bibere."</hi></p>
