                    but afterwards to pure philosophy, studying particularly English writers, and
                    the German modifiers of Kantianism, such as Jacobi, Fries, and Schopenhauer. In
                    1820 he published his <hi rend="italic">Theory of Knowledge,</hi> his <hi
                    rend="italic">Empirical Psychology as the Foundation of all Knowledge,</hi> and
                    his inaugural dissertation <hi rend="italic">De</hi><hi rend="italic">Veris
                    Philosophice Initiis.</hi> In all these writings appeared very strongly his
                    fundamental view, that philosophical speculation must be limited to the facts of
                    inner experience, and that a true psychology, which is the basis of all
                    knowledge, must be formed by treating these facts according to the rigid methods
                    of physical science. His marked opposition to the philosophy of Hegel, then
                    dominant in Berlin, came to the front still more clearly in the short tιact, <hi
                    rend="italic">New Foundation of Metaphysics,</hi> intended to be the programme
                    for his lectures as <hi rend="italic">privat-docent,</hi> and in the able
                    treatise, <hi rend="italic">Ground-work of a Physic of Ethics,</hi> written in
                    direct antagonism to Kant’s <hi rend="italic">Metaphysic of Ethics,</hi> and
                    attempting to deduce ethical principles from a basis of empirical feeling. In
                    the same year (1822) his lectures were prohibited at Berlin, according to his
                    own belief through the influence of Hegel with the Prussian authorities, who
                    also prevented him from obtaining a chair from the Saxon Government. He retired
                    to Göttingen, lectured there for some years, and was then allowed to return to
                    Berlin. In 1832 he received an appointment as <hi rend="italic"
                    >Professor</hi><hi rend="italic">Extraordinarius</hi> in the university, which
                    he continued to hold till his death. On 1st March 1854 he disappeared from his
                    home; and some months later his body was found in the canal near Charlottenburg.
                    There was some suspicion that he had committed suicide in a fit of mental
                    depression.</p>
                <p>Beneke was a most prolific writer, and besides the works mentioned above,
                    published large treatises in the several departments of philosophy, both pure
                    and as applied to education and ordinary life. A complete list of his writings
                    will be found in the appendix to Dressier’s edition of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Lehrbuch der Psychologie als Naturwissenschaft,</hi> 1861.</p>
                <p>The distinctive peculiarity of Beneke’s system consists, first, in the firmness
                    with which he maintained, and the consistency with which he carried out the
                    proposition, that in empirical psychology is to be found the basis of all
                    philosophy; and secondly, in his rigid treatment of mental phenomena by the
                    genetic, or, as Professor Bain has called it, the natural history method.
                    According to him, the formed or perfected mind with its defined faculties is a
                    development from simple elements, and the first problem of philosophy is the
                    determination of these elements and of the laws or processes by which the
                    development takes place. In his <hi rend="italic">Neue Psychologie</hi> (essays
                    iii., viii., and ix.), he clearly marked out his position with regard to his
                    predecessors and contemporaries, and both there and in the introduction to his
                    <hi rend="italic">Lehrbuch,</hi> signalized as the two great stages in the
                    progress of psychology the negation of innate ideas by Locke, and of faculties,
                    in the ordinary acceptation of the term, by IIerbart. The next step was made by
                    himself, when he insisted that psychology must be treated as one of the natural
                    sciences. As is the case with them, its content is given by experience alone,
                    and differs from theirs only in being the object of the internal as opposed to
                    the external sense. But by a scientific psychology Beneke in no wise meant what
                    is now almost invariably thought of under that designation, a psychology founded
                    on physiology. These two sciences, in his opinion, had quite distinct provinces,
                    and gave no mutual assistance. Just as little help is to be expected from the
                    science of the body as from mathematics and metaphysics, both of which had been
                    pressed by Herbart into the service of psychology. The true method of study is
                    that applied with so much success in the physical sciences,— critical
                    examination of the given experience, and reference of it to ultimate causes,
                    which may not be themselves perceived, but are nevertheless hypotheses necessary
                    to account for the facts. (See on method, <hi rend="italic">Neue</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Psych.,</hi> essay i.)</p>
                <p>Beneke, therefore, starting from the two assumptions that there is nothing, or at
                    least no formed product, innate in the mind, and that definite faculties do not
                    originally exist, and from the fact that our minds nevertheless actually have a
                    definite content and definite modes of action, proceeds to state somewhat
                    dogmatically his scientifically verifiable hypotheses as to the primitive
                    condition of the soul, and the laws according to which it develops. Originally
                    the soul is possessed of, or is, an immense variety of powers, faculties, or
                    forces (conceptions which Beneke, in opposition to Herbart, holds to be
                    metaphysically justifiable), differing from one another only in tenacity,
                    vivacity, receptivity, and grouping. These primitive immaterial forces, so
                    closely united as to form but one being (essence), acquire definiteness or foπn
                    through the action upon them of <hi rend="italic">stimuli</hi> or excitants from
                    the outer world. This action of external impressions which are appropriated by
                    the internal powers, is the first fundamental process in the genesis of the
                    completed mind. If the union of impression and faculty be sufficiently strong,
                    consciousness (not se7∕-consciousness) arises, and definite sensations and
                    perceptions begin to be formed. These primitive sensations, however, are not to
                    be identified with the sensations of the special senses, for each of these
                    senses is a system of many powers which have grown into a definite unity, have
                    been educated by experience. From various facts of ordinary experience it must
                    be concluded that a second fundamental process is incessantly going on, viz.,
                    the formation of new powers of faculties, which takes place principally during
                    sleep. The third and most important process results from the fact that the
                    combination between stimulus and power may be weak or strong-if<pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit03newyrich/page/n576/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0903-0576-0561"/> weak, then the two elements ai e said to be
                    movable, and they may flow over from one to another of the already formed
                    psychical products. Any formed faculty does not cease to exist on the removal of
                    its stimulus; in virtue of its fundamental property, <hi rend="italic"
                    >tenacity,</hi> it sinks back as a trace <hi rend="italic">(Spur)</hi> into
                    unconsciousness, whence it may be recalled by the application to it of another
                    stimulus, or by the attraction towards it of some of the movable elements or
                    newly-formed original powers. These traces and the flowing over of the movable
                    elements are the most important conceptions in Beneke’s psychology; by means of
                    them he gives a rationale of reproduction and association, and strives to show
                    that all the formed faculties are simply developments from traces of earlier
                    processes. Lastly, similar forms, according to the degree of their similarity,
                    attract one another or tend to form closer combinations.</p>
                <p>All psychical phenomena are explicable by the relation of impression and power,
                    and by the flow of movable elements; the whole process of mental development is
                    nothing but the result of the action and interaction of the above simple laws.
                    In general this growth may be said to take the direction of rendering more and
                    more definite by repetition and attraction of like to like the originally
                    indefinite activities of the primary faculties. Thus the sensations of the
                    special senses are gradually formed from the primary sensuous feelings <hi
                    rend="italic">(Sinnliche Empfindungen)</hi>; concepts are formed from intuitions
                    of individuals by the attraction of the common elements, and the consequent flow
                    towards them of movable forms. Judgment is the springing into consciousness of a
                    concept alongside of an intuition, or of a higher concept alongside of a lower.
                    Reasoning is merely a more complex judgment. Nor are there special faculties of
                    judging or reasoning. The understanding is simply the mass of concepts lying in
                    the background of unconsciousness, ready to be called up and to flow with force
                    towards anything closely connected with them. Even memory is not a special
                    faculty; it is simply the fundamental property of tenacity possessed by the
                    original faculties. The very distinction between the great classes, Knowledge,
                    Feeling, and Will, may be referred to elementary differences in the original
                    relations of faculty and impression.</p>
                <p>To follow Beneke into the details of any one of his psychological developments
                    would be impossible within moderate compass. It may be sufficient to say, that
                    on nearly all questions concerning the psychical mechanism, his works contain a
                    mass of unusually rich and instructive material. They are particularly deserving
                    of careful comparison with the association psychology of modern British
                    thinkers, most of whose results and processes will be found there thoroughly
                    handled and worked into a comprehensive system.</p>
                <p>In logic, metaphysics, and ethics, Beneke’s speculations are completely dependent
                    on the results of the psychological analysis. Thus thinking has been by him
                    separated, into analytical and synthetical. The first, which consists
                    essentially in the subsumption of one concept under another, is the subject of
                    elementary, pure, or formal logic, which, as an art, has to lay down the
                    universal rules according to which such subsumption takes place. Logical
                    reasoning, which adds nothing to our knowledge, but merely clears it up, is at
                    bottom a substitution of one notion for another. In the elaborate theory of
                    syllogism, founded on this principle, Beneke to some extent anticipates
                    Hamilton’s New Analytic. (It cannot, however, be thought that Hamilton borrowed
                    his principle from Beneke, as the latter seems to have suspected;—see Dressier’s
                    remark, <hi rend="italic">Lehrbuch der</hi><hi rend="italic">Psy.,</hi> 299. The
                    two approached the matter from quite different sides, and the peculiarity of
                    Hamilton’s system, the definite, explicit, quantification of the predicate, is
                    by no means necessarily implied in anything said by Beneke.) Synthetical
                    thinking, on the other hand, leads to new knowledge, but in its progress it
                    makes use of principles involving the relation of thought to existence, and
                    which, therefore, find justification in metaphysics. In that science Beneke’s
                    fundamental proposition is that in inner experience we cognize things as they
                    are, whereas in outer experience we only know their effects. Real being is given
                    in our intuitions, from which we gradually form a notion of self, and then of
                    other conscious beings like ourselves. The inference to the real existence of
                    external things is an unconscious reasoning, involving the same elements as the
                    inference to the existence of other conscious beings. The relations which give
                    definiteness and universality to experience, such as substance and cause, are
                    known directly in inner experience, in the systematic relations of the several
                    psychical elements, and are transferred by us to outer beings. In this part of
                    his metaphysical theory Beneke owes much to Schleiermacher.</p>
                <p>In his ethical theory, which is worked out with great fulness, and which was, in
                    his own opinion, his most valuable contribution to philosophy, Beneke is
                    thoroughly empirical. The worth of an object is defined to be the degree of
                    pleasurable feeling with which it affects us, and ethical judgments are founded
                    on the relations of worth among the feelings; with which we regard objects.
                    There is a gradation of moral worth, because there are higher and lower
                    faculties; and, as the mental constitutions of all men are fundamentally alike,
                    this gradation of worth becomes a <hi rend="italic">norm</hi> or general rule
                    for estimating moral qualities. An estimate founded on this normal scale appears
                    as morally necessary, or as duty.</p>
                <p>The special value of Beneke’s works, as has been already said, consists in the
                    many specimens of acute psychological analysis scattered throughout them. As a
                    complete explanation of psychical facts, the theory seems singularly defective.
                    The original hypotheses, peculiar to Beneke and on which the whole depends, are
                    hastily assumed, are never subjected to critical examination, and after all,
                    like Locke’s earlier theory, rest on a clumsy mechanical metaphor. As is the
                    case with all empirical theories of mental development, the higher categories or
                    notions, which are apparently shown to result from the simple elements, are
                    really presupposed at every step. Particularly unsatisfactory is the account of
                    consciousness, which is said to arise from the union of impression and faculty.
                    The necessity of consciousness for any mental action whatsoever is apparently
                    granted, but the conditions involved in it are never discussed or referred to.
                    So too the explanation of the origin of the notions, substance and cause, always
                    a crucial test for an empirical theory, is completely irreconcilable with the
                    fundamental principle of the system. The same defect appears in the account of
                    ethical judgment; no amount of empirical fact can ever yield the notion of
                    absolute duty. It is not, perhaps, to be altogether attributed to the ideal
                    character of German speculation, that Beneke has been almost entirely neglected,
                    and that his results have found acceptance mainly with practical teachers.
                    Undoubtedly, for the science of education his minute analysis of temperament and
                    careful exposition of the means whereby the young, unformed mind may be trained
                    are of infinite value; but the truth of many of his doctrines on these points
                    lends no support to the fundamental hypotheses, from which indeed they might be
                    almost entirely severed.</p>
                <p>Among German writers, not professed followers of Beneke, but who have been
                    largely influenced by him, may be mentioned Ueberweg (particularly in the first
                    part of his Logic) and Fortlage. In England, perhaps the only writer who shows
                    traces of acquaintance with his works is Morell <hi rend="italic">(Introd, to
                    Mental Philosophy).</hi> The most eminent members of the school are Dressier
                    (whose <hi rend="italic">Beneke</hi><hi rend="italic">oder Seelenlehre als
                    Naturwissenschaft</hi> is an admirable exposition), Dittes, and Raue. The
                    compendium by the last-named author has passed through four editions in Germany,
                    and has been translated into French, Flemish, and English. The English
                    translation, <hi rend="italic">Elements of Psychology,</hi> 1871, gives a lucid
                    and succinct view of the whole system. (R. AD.)</p>
