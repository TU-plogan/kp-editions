                    was born near Ulverston, in Lancashire, June 19, 1764. His early opportunities
                    of instruction were limited; but by self-education he matured those powers which
                    eventually were turned to so good an account. He displayed at an early age a
                    decided inclination for mathematical pursuits. He passed some years of his youth
                    as superintending clerk of an iron foundry at Liverpool, and he afterwards
                    taught mathematics at an academy in Greenwich. While in the latter situation he
                    was fortunate in obtaining, through the interest of Sir George Staunton, a place
                    in the first British embassy to China. He was thus enabled to put his foot on
                    the first step of the ladder of ambition; but each step in his subsequent career
                    may be fairly said to have been achieved by himself. The account of the embassy
                    published by Sir George Staunton records many of Barrow’s valuable contributions
                    to literature and science connected with China. This work, together with his own
                    subsequently published volume of <pb break="no"

                    been employed. Few persons could, within the space of a few months, overcome all
                    the practical difficulties of such a language as the Chinese; but Barrow soon
                    began to converse in it. and acquired a complete knowledge of its theory. His
                    papers on this subject in the <hi rend="italic">Quarterly Review</hi> (to which
                    periodical he was for many years a very frequent contributor) contain a very
                    admirable account of that singular language.</p>
                <p>Although Barrow ceased to be personally connected with Chinese affairs after the
                    return of the embassy in 1794, he always continued to take a lively interest in
                    them, and on critical occasions was frequently consulted by the British
                    Government. His services were secured by Lord Macartney in his important and
                    delicate mission to settle the government of the newly-acquired colony of the
                    Cape of Good Hope. Barrow was entrusted with opening communications with the
                    Kaffres, in which he displayed a spirit, judgment, and humanity, which
                    unfortunately were less conspicuous in subsequent transactions with those
                    tribes. The two volumes of his history of the colony made the public fully
                    acquainted with the extent, capacities, and resources of that important, but
                    till then little understood, acquisition of the British Crown. There is little
                    doubt that it was the perusal of this valuable work which mainly decided Lord
                    Melville to appoint Barrow, though then a perfect stranger to him, as his second
                    secretary of the Admiralty. Barrow’s subsequent career for forty years at the
                    Admiralty (embracing the whole period of the war with France), will be for ever
                    historically associated with the civil administration of the British navy for
                    the same period. He enjoyed the esteem and confidence of all the eleven chief
                    lords who successively presided at the Admiralty Board during that period, and
                    more especially of King William IV., while lord high admiral, who honoured him
                    with tokens of his personal regard. Barrow was a fellow of the Royal Society,
                    and had the degree of LL.D. The honour of a baronetcy was conferred on him by
                    Sir Robert Peel in 1835; the letter in which the honour was announced
                    acknowledged, in highly gratifying terms, his literary and scientific eminence,
                    and his “Jong, most able, and most faithful public service.”</p>
                <p>Besides the works already mentioned, Barrow published the lives of Lord
                    Macartney, Lord Anson, Lord Howe, and Peter the Great; and he was also the
                    author of several valuable contributions to the seventh edition of the <hi
                    rend="italic">Encyclopaedia Britannica.</hi></p>
                <p>He retired from public life in 1845, in consideration of his advanced years,
                    although still in vigorous possession of all the mental and bodily powers
                    required for the due discharge of the functions of his office. In the course of
                    the three following years his vital energies gradually declined, but he
                    nevertheless continued so fully in the enjoyment of his faculties, writing a
                    history of the modern Arctic voyages of discovery, of which he was a great
                    promoter, as well as his autobiography, published in 1847, that his friends and
                    relatives entertained no apprehension that his end was so near. He expired
                    suddenly on the 23d November 1848, in the 85th year of his age, much honoured
                    and respected by his friends and the public at large.</p>
