                    which at the lowest ebbs has only six feet of water, and at no time has more
                    than fourteen. The general appearance of Bangkok is very striking, alike from
                    its extent, the strange architecture of its more important buildings, and the
                    luxuriant greenness of the trees with which it is profusely interspersed. The
                    streets are in many cases traversed by canals, and the houses raised on piles,
                    while a large part of the population dwell in floating houses moored along the
                    river sides in tiers three or four deep. The nucleus of the city on the eastern
                    bank is surrounded by a wall 30 feet high, and 10 or 12 feet thick, relieved by
                    numerous towers and bastions; but the rest of the city stretches irregularly for
                    full seven miles along each side of the river, and in some places attains nearly
                    as great a breadth,—the Menam itself being about a quarter of a mile across. All
                    the ordinary buildings are composed of wood or bamboo work; but the temples and
                    palaces are of more solid construction, and are gorgeously ornamented. The
                    spires, and in some cases the whole edifices, are covered with gilding, or
                    many-coloured mosaic of the most grotesque description, while the roofs are
                    adorned with fantastic ridges and gables. In all there are upwards of a hundred
                    temples in the city and suburbs. The palace of the “First King” is enclosed by
                    high white walls, which are about a mile in circumference. It consists of a
                    large number of different buildings for various purposes—temples, public
                    offices, seraglios, the stalls for the sacred elephant, and accommodation for
                    thousands of soldiers, cavalry, artillery, and war elephants, an arsenal, a
                    theatre, &lt;tc. The hall of audience, in which the throne of the king stands,
                    is situated in the middle of the principal court. The temples are of great
                    richness, floored with mats of silver, and stored with monuments and relics. In
                    one of them is a famous jasper statue of Buddha. The population of the city is
                    of various nationalities,—Burmese, Peguans, Cambodians, Cochin-Chinese, Malays,
                    Indo-Portuguese, and others, besides the <pb break="no"

                    There is great commercial activity, the principal articles of trade being sugar,
                    pepper, and rice. The supplies of the last article can be brought from a long
                    way inland by means of the river and various canals, such as the <hi
                    rend="italic">Petrio,</hi> which joins the Bang-Pa-Kong at Kanat. Cardamoms,
                    timber, and tin are also largely exported. European manufactures are extensively
                    imported, the natives being very ready to adopt new methods and machinery; and
                    steam-mills for various purposes are being set up. The river is kept clear by a
                    steam-dredger, and iron bridges of European construction are built acrose the
                    canals. Gas is used in the palaces of the kings and the houses of many of the
                    nobility. A considerable number of European firms carry on business in the city,
                    and the English Government maintains a consul. Christian missions, both
                    Protestant aud Roman Catholic, are maintained, the latter church having
                    established a bishopric. The population is said to amount to 400,000.</p>
