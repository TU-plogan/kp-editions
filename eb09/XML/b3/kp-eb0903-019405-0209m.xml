                    1517. He received the first elements of his artistic education from Cosimo

                    acquaintance of Savonarola, who quickly acquired great influence over him; and
                    Baccio was so affected by his cruel death, that he soon after entered the
                    convent, and for some years gave up his art. He had not long resumed it, in
                    obedience to his superior, when, the celebrated Raffaelle came to Florence and
                    formed a close friendship with him, Bartolommeo learned from the younger artist
                    the rules of perspective, in which he was so skilled, while Raffaelle owes to
                    the <hi rend="italic">frate</hi> tħe improvement in his colouring and handling
                    of drapery, which was noticeable in the works he produced after their meeting.
                    Some years afterwards he visited Rome, and was struck with admiration and a
                    feeling of his own inferiority when he contemplated the masterpieces of Michel
                    Angelo and Raffaelle. With the latter, however, he remained on the most friendly
                    terms, and when he departed from Rome, left in his hands two unfinished pictures
                    which Raffaelle completed, Bartolommeo’s figures had generally been small and
                    draped. These qualities were alleged against him as defects, and to prove that
                    his style was not the result of want of power, he painted the magnificent figure
                    of St Mark, and the undraped figure of St Sebastian. The latter was so well
                    designed, so naturally and beautifully coloured, and so strongly expressive of
                    suffering and agony, that it was found necessary to remove it from the place
                    where it had been exhibited in the chapel of a convent. The majority of
                    Bartolommeo’s compositions are altar-pieces, and few of them are to be met with
                    out of Tuscany. They are remarkable for skill in the massing of light and shade,
                    richness and delicacy of colouring, and for the admirable style in which the
                    drapery of the figures is handled, Bartolommeo having been the first to
                    introduce and use the lay-figure with joints.</p>
