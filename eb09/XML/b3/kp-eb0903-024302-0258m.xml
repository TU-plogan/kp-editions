                    his sister Joanna was the poet. Dr Baillie was for several years a student in
                    the university of Glasgow, where he heard the lectures of Dr Reid on moral
                    philosophy. His professional career was determined by the advice of his uncle,
                    Dr William Hunter, who undertook to superintend his education. On his father’s
                    death he obtained an exhibition to Balliol College, Oxford, where he remained a
                    year before removing to London. His studies were there carried on under the
                    personal direction of his uncle, and after two years he began to be associated
                    with Dr Hunter in his anatomical lectures as an assistant and demonstrator,
                    visiting Oxford occasionally, so as to keep the terms necessary for the degree
                    of bachelor of medicine. Dr Hunter, at his death, bequeathed the use of his
                    magnificent collections to his nephew, together with the lecture-rooms in
                    Windmill Street, an annuity of £100 a year, and a small family estate in
                    Scotland. The last was resigned by Baillie to his other uncle, Dr John Hunter,
                    whom he considered as the natural heir. Within two years after Dr Hunter’s death
                    his nephew became the principal teacher in that celebrated school of anatomy;
                    and in 1787, although only a bachelor of medicine, he was appointed physician to
                    St George’s Hospital. In 1789 he married Sophia, daughter of the eminent
                    accoucheur Dr Denman, a connection favourable to his practice. In 1795 he
                    published his <hi rend="italic">Morbid Anatomy,</hi> a work which was speedily
                    translated into French, Italian, and German, into the last by the anatomist
                    Sömmering. After this he had the honour of being enrolled a doctor of medicine
                    of Oxford, and Fellow of the Royal College of Physicians. As a practising
                    physician he was universally respected, and his decease, which took place on the
                    23d of September 1823, in the 63d year of his age, was sincerely regretted.</p>
                <p>The second edition of the <hi rend="italic">Morbid Anatomy</hi> appeared in 1797;
                    and two years afterwards it was illustrated by a 4to volume of engravings, with
                    descriptions of the plates. His <hi rend="italic">Anatomical Lectures and
                    Medical Observations</hi> were printed privately after his death. The <hi
                    rend="italic">Works,</hi> 2 vols. 8vo, edited, with a biographical sketch, by Mr
                    Wardrop, contain only the <hi rend="italic">Morbid Anatomy</hi> and
                    miscellaneous medical papers.</p>
