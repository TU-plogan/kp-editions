                    political agent resides at Barodâ. The town is fortified, but has no great
                    strength. Thornton states the population at 140,000. Barodâ contains the chief
                    court of the state, the Gaikwâr himself presiding in appeals from the decisions
                    of the other courts in his territory. The town contains only one higher class
                    school, the High School,—attended in 1872 by 658 pupils, of whom 155 were
                    learning English, 221 Marhâthï, and 282 Gujrâthi. There are also two vernacular
                    schools in the town. The late Gaikwâr, Malhâr Bâo, was installed in 1871. The
                    princes of Barodâ date their importance from the Marhattâ confederacy, which in
                    the last century spread devastation and terror over India. Shortly after 1721
                    the ruling chief, one Pelâji, carved a fertile slice of territory out of
                    Gujârât. Another enjoyed the title of “Leader of the Royal Troops” under the
                    Peshwâ. During the last thirty-two years of the century the house fell a prey to
                    one of those bitter and unappeasable family feuds which are the ruin of great
                    Indian families. In 1800 the inheritance descended to a prince feeble in body
                    and almost idiotic in mind. British troops were sent in defence of the
                    hereditary ruler against all claimants; a treaty was signed in 1802, by which
                    his independence of the Peshwâ, and his dependence on our own Government, were
                    secured. Three years later these and various other engagements were consolidated
                    into a systematic plan for the administration of the Barodâ territory, under a
                    prince with a revenue of three quarters of a million sterling, perfectly
                    independent in all internal matters, but practically kept on his throne by
                    subsidiary British troops. Since then the history of the Gaikwârs has been very
                    much the same as that of most territorial houses in India: an occasional able
                    minister, more rarely an able prince; but, on the other hand, a long dreary list
                    of incompetent heads, venal advisers, and taskmasters oppressive to the people.
                    Of late years they have been more than usually unfortunate. Family feuds raged
                    fiercer than ever, and the late Gaikwâr was long imprisoned by his brother, the
                    former ruler, on a charge of attempted fratricide. The miserable scandals of the
                    Barodâ Râj need not be revived here. Suflice it to say, that Malhâr Râo found
                    himself suddenly brought from prison and placed upon the throne, and that his
                    conduct as ruler was what might have been expected in such a case. Frequent
                    complaints of his mismanagement and oppression were brought before the British
                    Government, and in 1873 a commission of English officers was appointed to
                    inquire into the affairs of the state, and its management by the Gaikwâr. Since
                    then misrule has advanced with a rapid foot. After one or two feints at
                    reforming his government, the Gaikwâr returned to his old courses. An attempt in
                    1874 to poison the British Resident at his court brought affairs to a crisis,
                    and early in 1875 the Gaikwâr was tried by a mixed commission of eminent British
                    officers and natives of rank. A unanimous verdict was not obtained touching the
                    particular attempt at poisoning; but Lord Northbrook, as Viceroy of India, found
                    it necessary to depose the Gaikwâr, and to appoint another member of the Barodâ
                    family to rule in his stead.</p>
