                <p><label type="entry">BERLIN</label> is the chief city of the province of
                    Brandenburg, the capital of the kingdom of Prussia, and since 1871 the
                    metropolis of the German empire. It is situated in 52° 30' 16' ’ N. lat. and 13°
                    23' 16" E. long., and lies about 120 feet above the level of the Baltic. Its
                    longest day is 16 hours 47 minutes; its shortest day is 7 hours 36 minutes. Its
                    average annual temperature is 48 ’ 2° Fahr., the maximum recorded heat being
                    99*5° in 1819, and the maximum cold - 16 ’ l <hi rend="superscript"> 0</hi>
                    Fahr, in 1823. The average rainfall is 21 "74 Prussian inches, and Berlin has on
                    the average 120 rainy, 29 snowy, and 17 foggy days in a year.</p>
                <p>The city is built on what was originally in part a sandy and in part a marshy
                    district on both sides of the River Spree, not far from its junction with the
                    Havel, one of the principal tributaries of the Elbe. By its canals it has also
                    direct water communication with the Oder. The Spree rises in the mountain region
                    of Upper Lusatia, is navigable for the last 97 English miles of its course,
                    enters Berlin on the S.E. as a broad sluggish stream, retaining an average width
                    of 420 feet, and a depth of 6 or 7 feet, until it approaches the centre of the
                    city, where it has a sudden fall of 4 feet, and leaves the city on the N. W.,
                    after receiving the waters of the Panke, again as a dull and sluggish stream,
                    with an average width of only 160 feet, but with its depth increased to from 12
                    to 14 feet. Within the boundaries of the city it feeds canals, and divides into
                    branches, which, however, reunite. The river, with its canals and branches, is
                    crossed by about 50 bridges, of which very few have any claim to architectural
                    beauty. Among these latter may be mentioned the Schlossbrücke, built after
                    designs by Schinkel in the years 1822-24, with its eight colossal figures of
                    white marble, representing the ideal stages of a warrior’s career. The statues
                    are for the most part of high artistic merit. They stand on granite pedestals,
                    and are the work of Drake, Wolff, and other eminent sculptors. The
                    Kurfürstenbrücke is another bridge which merits notice, on account of the
                    equestrian bronze statue of the Great Elector by which it is adorned.</p>
                <p>The etymology of the word “Berlin” is doubtful. Some derive it from Celtic roots—
                    <hi rend="italic">ber,</hi> small, short, and <hi rend="italic">lyn,</hi> a
                    lake. Others regard it as a Wend word, meaning a free, open place. Others,
                    again, regard it as coming from the word <hi rend="italic">wert,</hi> a river
                    island. Professor Paul Cassel, in a recently published dissertation, derives it
                    from the German word “Brühl,” a marshy district, and the Slavonic termination
                    “in;” thus Brühl, by the regular transmutation Bürhl (compare Germ, δren-nen and
                    Eng. burn), Bürhlin. The question is likely to remain in the stage of more or
                    less probable conjecture.</p>
                <p>Similar obscurity rests on the origin of the city. The hypotheses which carried
                    it back to the early years of the Christian era have been wholly abandoned. Even
                    the Margrave Albert the Bear (d. 1170) is no longer unquestionably regarded as
                    its founder, and the tendency of opinion now is to date its origin from the time
                    of his great-grandsons, Otho and John. When first alluded to, what is now Berlin
                    was spoken of as two towns, Coin and Berlin. The first authentic document
                    concerning the former is from the year 1237, concerning the latter from the year
                    1244, and it is with these dates that the trustworthy history of the city
                    begins. Fidicin, in his <hi rend="italic">Diplomatische Beiträge zur Geschichte
                    der Stadt Berlin,</hi> voL iii., divides the history of the town, from its
                    origin to the times of the Reformation, into three periods. The first of these,
                    down to the year 1307, is the period during which the two towns had a separate
                    administration; the second, from 1307 to 1442, dates from the initiation of the
                    joint administration of the two towns to its consummation. The third period
                    extends from 1442 to 1539, when the two towns embraced the reformed faith.</p>
                <p>In the year 1565 the town had already a population of 12,000. About ninety years
                    later, after the close of the Thirty Years’ War, it had sunk to 6000. At the
                    death of the Great Elector in 1688, it had risen to 20,000. The Elector
                    Frederick III., afterwards King Frederick I., sought to make it worthy of a
                    royal “residence,” to which rank it had been raised in 1701. From that time
                    onwards Berlin grew steadily in extent, splendour, and population. Frederick the
                    Great found it, at his accession in 1740, with 90,000 inhabitants. At the
                    accession of Frederick William IV. in 1840 it had 331,894, and in the month of
                    July 1874, thirty-four years later, the population had nearly trebled, the exact
                    numbers in that year being 949,144. The two original townships of Coin and
                    Berlin have grown into the sixteen townships into which the city is now divided,
                    covering about 25 English square miles of land, and Berlin now takes its place
                    as the fourth, perhaps the third, greatest city in Europe, surpassed only by
                    London, Paris, and possibly Vienna. Its importance is now such that a bill, at
                    present submitted by the Government to the consideration of the Legislature,
                    proposes to raise it to the rank of a province of the kingdom.</p>
                <p>Progress and prosperity have, however, been chequered by reverses and
                    humiliations. The 17th century saw the Imperialists and Swedes, under
                    Wallenstein and under Gustavus Adolphus, as enemies, within its walls; the 18th
                    century, the Austrians and Russians, during the Seven Years’ War; the 19th
                    century, Napoleon I. and the French; and the year 1848 witnessed the bloody
                    scenes of the March Revolution. But the development of constitutional
                    government, and the triumphs of 1866 and 1870, have wiped out the memory of
                    these dark spots in the history of the Prussian capital.</p>
                <p>The town has grown in splendour as it has increased in numbers. Daniel, in the
                    fourth volume of his <hi rend="italic">Handbook</hi><pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit03newyrich/page/n611/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0903-0611-0594"/><hi rend="italic">of Geography,</hi> gives the
                    number of its public buildings as 700. Of these, its churches are the structures
                    which lay daim to the highest antiquity, four of them dating from the 13th and
                    14th centuries. But in respect of its churches, both in their number and their
                    beauty, Berlin is, relatively speaking, probably the poorest of the capitals of
                    Christendom. It has only 48 churches and chapels belonging to the State Church,
                    5 Roman Catholic churches and chapels, 8 foreign and free chapels, and 3
                    synagogues, to satisfy the religious wants of a million of people. Nor are these
                    over-filled. Dr Schwabe, the statistician, fixes the number of actual
                    worshippers in all the churches on an average Sunday at less than <hi
                    rend="italic">2</hi> per cent, of the entire population. On the 1st of December
                    1871 the different creeds were found to be represented in the following
                    proportions :— 732,351 were Protestants of the State Church, 2570 Dissenters,
                    51,517 Roman Catholics, 36,015 Jews, 34 of nonChristian creeds, 3854 persons
                    whose creed was uncertain.</p>
                <p>In secular public buildings Berlin is very rich. Entering the city at the Potsdam
                    Gate, traversing a few hundred yards of the Leipzigerstrassc, turning into the
                    Wilhelm-strasse, and following its course until it reaches the street, Unter den
                    Linden, then beginning at the Brandenburg Gate and going along the Unter den
                    Linden until its termination, there will be seen within the limits of half an
                    hour’s walk the following among other buildings, many of them of great
                    architectural merit :—The Admiralty, the Upper House of the Prussian
                    Legislature, the Imperial Parlia ment, the War Office, the residence of the
                    Minister of Commerce, the palaces of Prince Carl and the Princes Pless and
                    Radziwill, the Foreign Office, the Impérial Chancery, the palaces of the
                    Ministers of the Royal House and of Justice, the palaces of the Princes
                    Alexander and George, the Brandenburg Gate, the Royal School of Artillery and
                    Engineering, the residences and offices of the Ministers of the Interior and of
                    Worship, the Russian Embassy, the Great Arcade, the Netherland Palace and the
                    palace of the Emperor, the Royal Academy, the University, the Royal Library, the
                    Opera, the Arsenal, the palace of the Crown Prince, the palace of the Commandant
                    of Berlin, the Castle Bridge, the Academy of Architecture, the Castle, the
                    Cathedral, the Old and New Museums, and the National Gallery. At a short
                    distance from this line are the Exchange, the Rathhaus, the Mint, the Bank, and
                    the Royal Theatre. Further away are the various barracks, the palace of the
                    general staff, and the eight railway termini. Berlin differs from other great
                    capitals in this respect, that with the exception of the castle,—a large
                    building enclosing two courts, and containing more than G00 rooms, and which
                    dates back in its origin to the 16th century,—all its public buildings are
                    comparatively modern, dating in their present form from the 18th and 19th
                    centuries. The public buildings and monuments which render it famous, such as
                    the palaces, museums, theatre, exchange, bank, rathhaus, the Jewish synagogue,
                    the monuments and columns of victory, date almost without exception from later
                    <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit03newyrich/page/n612/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0903-0612-0595"/> than 1814, the close of the great conflict with
                    Napoleon I. The Exchange, finished in 1863, at a cost of £180,000 sterling; the
                    Synagogue, a proud building in Oriental style, finished in 1866, at a cost of
                    £107,000; and the Rathhaus, finished in 1869, at a cost of £500,000 sterling,
                    including the land on which it stands, are the most recent of its great
                    buildings. The New National Gallery is nearly completed, and the Imperial Bank
                    is being rebuilt. It is probable that no city in the world can show so large a
                    number of fine structures so closely clustered together.</p>
                <p>Up to a very recent date Berlin was a walled city. Those of its nineteen gates
                    which still remain have only an historical or architectural interest. The
                    principal of these is the Brandenburg Gate, an imitation of the Propylaea at
                    Athens. It is 201 feet broad and nearly 65 feet high. It is supported by twelve
                    Doric columns, each 44 feet in height, and surmounted by a car of victory,
                    which, taken by Napoleon to Paris in 1807, was brought back by the Prussians in
                    1814. It has recently been enlarged by two lateral colonnades, each supported by
                    16 columns.</p>
                <p>The streets, about 520 in number, are, with the excep- ,ion of the districts in
                    the most ancient part of the city, long, strait, and wide, lined with high
                    houses, for the old typical Berlin house, with its ground floor and first floor,
                    is rapidly disappearing. The Unter den Linden is 3287 feet long by 160 broad.
                    The new boulevard, the Königgrätz-erstrasse, is longer still, though not so
                    wide. The Friedrichstrasse and the Oranienstrasse exceed 2 English miles in
                    length. The city has about 60 squares. It has 25 theatres and 14 large halls for
                    regular entertainments. It has an aquarium, zoological garden, and a floral
                    institution, with park, flower, and palm houses. It has several hospitals, of
                    which the largest is the Charité, with accommodation for 1500 patients. The
                    Bethany, Elizabeth, and Lazarus hospitals are attached to establishments of
                    Protestant deaconesses. The St Hedwig’s hospital is under the care of Roman
                    Catholic sisters. The Augusta hospital, under the immediate patronage and
                    control of the empress, is in the hands of lady nurses, who nurse the sick
                    without assuming the garb and character of a religious sisterhood. The people’s
                    parks are the Humboldt’s Hain, the Friedrich’s Hain, the Hasenheide, and, above
                    all, the Thiergarten, a wood covering 820 Prussian acres of ground, and reaching
                    up to the Brandenburg Gate.</p>
                <p>As has been seen, the population has trebled itself within the last 34 years,
                    naturally not so much by the excess of births over deaths, as by an unbroken
                    current of immigration. In 1873 the births were 35,954, the deaths 26,427,
                    leaving an excess of 8527 births. But the increase in the population of the city
                    in the same year was 50,184, leaving 41,657 as the increase through the influx
                    from without. It will thus be seen at a glance that only a minority of the
                    population are native Berliners. In the census of 1867 it •was found that,
                    taking the population above 20 years of age, only one-third were natives of the
                    city. The immigration is almost exclusively from the Prussian provinces, and
                    among these principally from Brandenburg and from the eastern and north-eastern
                    provinces. In 1871 it was round that out of every 10,000 inhabitants, 9725 were
                    Prussian subjects, 165 were from other German states, 55 from foreign lands, and
                    47 were of a nationality not ascertained. The foreign element almost vanishes,
                    and the German element is represented principally by the north, so that in blood
                    and manners Berlin remains essentially a northeastern German city, <hi
                    rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> a city in which German, Wend, and Polish blood flows
                    commingled in the veins of the citizens. In past times Berlin received a strong
                    infusion of foreign blood, the influence of which is perceptible to the present
                    day in its intellectual and social life. Such names as Savigny, Lancizolle, De
                    la Croix, De le Coq, Du Bois-Reymond, tell of the French refugees who found a
                    home here in the cold north when expelled from their own land. Daniel, in his
                    <hi rend="italic">Geography,</hi> vol. iv. p. 155, says that there was a time
                    when every tenth man in the city was a Frenchman. Flemish and Bohemian elements,
                    to say nothing of the banished Salzburgers, were introduced in a similar manner.
                    Add to these the 36,013 Jews now resident in the city, and the picture of the
                    commingled races which make up its population is pretty complete.</p>
                <p>The 826,341 inhabitants of the city were found at the census of 1871 to be living
                    in 14,478 dwelling-houses, and to consist of 178,159 households. These numbers
                    show that the luxury of a single house for a single family is rare, and this
                    holds good also of the wealthier classes of the people. These numbers fall far
                    short of the present (1875) number of houses and of households, as will be seen
                    from the fact that the value of the household property of the city in 1874
                    exceeded that of 1871 by £18,000,000 sterling, of which the greatest part falls
                    to newly-built houses or houses enlarged. In 1871 the average number of persons
                    comprised in a household was found to be 4 ’ 6, the number of households
                    dwelling in a house 12 <hi rend="superscript"> -</hi> 3, and the number of
                    persons dwelling in a house 57 ’ 1. These numbers throw light on the moral and
                    social life of the city, and compared with the past, show the change in the
                    domestic habits of the people. ' In 1540 the average number of inmates in a
                    house was 6, in 1740 it was 17, in 1867 it had risen to 32, and in 1871 to 57.
                    Between the years 1864 and 1871 the one-storied houses of the city decreased 8
                    per cent, the two and three-storied houses 4⅜ per cent., while the number of
                    four-storied houses increased 11 per cent., and the five-storied and higher
                    houses 50 per cent. With the increase of high houses, the underground cellar
                    dwellings, which form so striking a feature in the house architecture of the
                    city, increase in a like proportion, and these and the attics are the dwellings
                    of the poor. In 1867 there were 14,292 such cellar dwellings, in 1871 they had
                    increased to 19,208. Taking the average of 1867— 4 inmates to a cellar
                    dwelling—we get 76,832 persone living under ground. In 1871 there were 4565
                    dwellings which contained no room which could be heated. This class of dwelling
                    had doubled between the two census years of 1867 and 1871. Taking 3 inmates (the
                    ascertained average of 1867) to such a dwelling, we have 13,695 persons who pass
                    the winter in unheated dwellings, in a climate where the cold not unfrequently
                    sinks below the zero of Fahrenheit. Of the remaining dwellings of the city,
                    95,423 had only one room -which could be heated. This number, at 4 persons to a
                    dwelling, give us an insight into the domestic life of 381,692 of the
                    inhabitants of the city; that is, with the 13,695 persons mentioned above, of
                    nearly half the population. Such dwellings engender no feeling of home, and the
                    habits of the people are in a certain sense nomadic. In 1872, 74,568 changes of
                    dwelling took place, involving an expense at a very moderate calculation of
                    £158,900. In the poorer townships there were 70 removals to every 100
                    dwellings!</p>
                <p>The rate of mortality is high. In 1873, a favourable year, it was 28 to every
                    1000 of the population. Taking the deaths as a whole, 58 per cent, were of
                    children under 10 years of age. The rate of mortality is on the increase.
                    Professor Virchow, in a report to the municipal authorities, stated that,
                    dividing the last 15 years into periods of 5 years each, the general mortality
                    in each of the three periods was as 5, 7, 9. The mortality of children under 1
                    year in the same three periods was as 5, 7,11; that is, it had more than
                    doubled. In the year 1872, out of 27,800 deaths, 11,136 were of children under 1
                    year.</p>
                <p>The city is well supplied with water by works constructed by an English company,
                    which have now become <pb break="no"

                    companies supply the city with gas. A system of underground drainage is at
                    present in process of construction. Internal communication is kept up by means
                    of tramways, omnibuses, and cabs. In 1873 there were 54 tram-carriages, 185
                    omnibuses, and 4424 cabs licensed, served by. 10,060 horses.</p>
                <p>Berlin is governed by the president of police, by the municipal authorities, and
                    in military matters by the governor and commandant of the city. The police
                    president stands under the minister of the interior, and has the control of all
                    that stands related to the maintenance of public order. The municipal body
                    consists of a burgomaster-in-chief, a burgomaster, a body of town councillors
                    (Stadt-räthe), and a body of town deputies (Stadtverordnete). For municipal
                    purposes the city is divided into 16 townships and 210 districts. For police
                    purposes the <hi rend="italic">work</hi> is divided into six departments, and an
                    extra department for the fire brigade and street cleaning, and the <hi
                    rend="italic">town</hi> into six larger and fifty smaller districts. At the head
                    of each larger district is a police captain, at the head of each smaller
                    district a police lieutenant.</p>
                <p>With the exception of a few of the higher schools, which are under the direct
                    supervision of the provincial authorities, the Berlin schools are either under
                    the direct supervision of the municipal body or of its committee for school
                    purposes. The schools, public and private, are divided into higher, middle, and
                    elementary. In 1872 there were 24 higher public schools. Of these, 10 were
                    gymnasia or schools for the highest branches of a learned education. In these
                    schools there were 138 classes and 5073 pupils, of whom 2142 were over, and 2931
                    under, 14 years of age. The second class of high schools, the so-called
                    Realschulen, give instruction in Latin, but otherwise devote almost exclusive
                    attention to the departments of mathematics, science, history, modern languages,
                    and the requirements of the higher stages of general or commercial life. Of this
                    class of school there were also 10, with 143 classes, 5770 pupils, of whom 1931
                    were over, and 3839 under, 14 years of age. The remaining 4 high schools were
                    for girls, with 54 classes, 2522 pupils, of whom 529 were over, and 1993 under,
                    14 years of age. In addition to these public schools there were 7 higher schools
                    for boys, with 55 classes and 2098 pupils, and 36 higher schools for girls, with
                    243 classes and 6629 pupils.</p>
                <p>Within the last five years (1875) no new school of this class has been
                    established, but several are in process of erection. Between 1869 and 1873 the
                    city voted about £328,747 sterling for the purchase of sites, and for enlarging
                    and rebuilding schools of this class; and the sum still required for schools of
                    this class, up to 1877, is £352,500 sterling.</p>
                <p>The total number of schools of all sorts, higher, middle, and elementary, public
                    and private, in 1872, was 232, with 1072 boys’ classes, 1009 girls’ classes, and
                    4 mixed classes— together, 2085; attended by 50,316 boys, 44,959 girls—
                    together, 95,275 children, of whom 7309, or 7’35 per cent., were over 14 years
                    of age. The extent to which the schools are used under the law of compulsory
                    education is very difficult to determine. In 1867 there were 103,383 children of
                    the school age. but only 71,814, or 69∙5 per cent., were in the schools. Dr
                    Schwabe, by a criticism of these numbers, reduces the percentage of
                    non-attendance to 13 per cent., and maintains that even these are not all to be
                    regarded as absolutely without instruction. In 1871 it was found that out of
                    every 10,000 persons of 70 years of age and upwards, there were 1529 who could
                    neither read nor write; and that out of a like number from 60 to 70, there were
                    860; 50 to 60, 446: 40 to 50, 234; 30 to 40, 158; 25 to 30, 155; 20 to 25, 71;
                    15 to 20, 58; and from 10 to 15, 48.</p>
                <p>The scholastic life of Berlin culminates in its university, which is, of course,
                    not a municipal, but a national institution. It is, with the exception of Bonn,
                    the youngest of the Prussian universities, but the first of them all in
                    influence and reputation. It was founded in 1810. Prussia had lost her
                    celebrated university of Halle, when that city was included by Napoleon in his
                    newly created “kingdom of Westphalia.” It was as a weapon of war, as well as a
                    nursery of learning, that Frederick William III., and the great men whose names
                    are identified with its origin, called it into existence, for it was felt that
                    knowledge and religion are the true strength and defence of nations. William v.
                    Humboldt was at that time at the head of the educational department of the
                    kingdom, and men like Fichte and Schleiermacher worked the popular mind. It was
                    opened on the 15th of October 1810. Its first rector was Schmalz; its first
                    deans of faculty, Schleiermacher, Biener, Hufeland, and Fichte. Within the first
                    ten years of its existence it counted among its professors such names as De
                    Wette, Neander, Marheineke; Savigny, Eichhorn; Böckh, Bekker, Hegel, Raumer,
                    Wolff, Niebuhr, and Buttmann. Later followed such names as Hengstenberg and
                    Nitzsch; Homeyer, Bethman-Hollweg, Puchta, Stahl, and Heffter; Schelling,
                    Trendelenburg, Bopp, the brothers Grimm, Zumpt, Carl Ritter; and at the present
                    time it can boast of such names as Twesten and Domer; Gneist and Hinschius;
                    Langenbeck, Bardeleben, Virchow, and Du Bois-Reymond; von Ranke, Mommsen,
                    Curtius, Lepsius, Hoffman the chemist, and Kiepert the geographer. Taking
                    ordinary, honorary, and extraordinary professors, licensed lecturers <hi
                    rend="italic">{privatdocenten)</hi><hi rend="italic subscript"> f</hi> and
                    readers together, its present professorial strength consists of 15 teachers in
                    the faculty of theology, 14 in the faculty of law, 63 in the faculty of
                    medicine, and 96 in the faculty of philosophy— together, 188. The number of
                    matriculated and unmatriculated attendants on the various lectures averages 3000
                    in the summer term, and 3500 in the winter. During the last two or three years,
                    however, the number has been steadily decreasing. Berlin, in point of numbers,
                    still stands at the head of the Prussian universities, but no longer of the
                    German universities, being now outstripped by Leipsic.</p>
                <p>In addition to its schools and its university, Berlin is rich in institutions for
                    the promotion of learning, science, and the arts. It has a Royal Academy of
                    Sciences, with 46 members, 23 in the class of physics and mathematics, and 23 in
                    the class of philosophy and history. It was founded, on the 11th of June 1700,
                    and the name of Leibnitz is associated with its foundation. It was raised to the
                    rank of a Royal Academy by Frederick the Great in 1743. Berlin has also a Royal
                    Academy of Arts, consisting of 39 ordinary members (1875), under the immediate
                    protection of the king, and governed by a director and a senate, composed of 15
                    members in the departments of painting, sculpture, architecture, and engraving,
                    and 4 members in the section for music. Berlin has also its academy for vocal
                    music, and its royal high school for music in all its branches, theoretical and
                    applied, and learned bodies and associations of the most various kinds. It has 9
                    public libraries, at the head of which stands the royal library, with 710,000
                    volumes and 15,000 manuscripts. In addition to these, there are 15 people’s
                    libraries established in various parts of the city.</p>
                <p>Berlin possesses eight public museums, in addition to the Royal Museums and the
                    National Gallery. The Royal Museums are the Old and the New Museums. The former,
                    which stands on the north-east side of the Lustgarten, facing the castle, is the
                    most imposing building in Berlin. It was built in the reign of Frederick William
                    III., from designs by Schinkel. Its portico, supported by 18 colossal Ionic
                    columns, is reached by a wide flight of steps. The museum covers 47,000 square
                    feet of ground, and is 276: <pb break="no"

                    back and side walls of the portico are covered with frescoes, from designs by
                    Schinkel, executed under the direction of Cornelius, and representing, in
                    mythical and symbolical figures, the world’s progress from shapeless and chaotic
                    to organic and developed life. The sides of the flight of steps support the
                    well-known equestrian bronze groups of the Amazon by Kiss, and the Lion-slayer
                    by Albert Wolff. Under the portico are monuments of the sculptors Rauch and
                    Schadow, the architect Schinkel, and the art critic Winckelmann. The interior
                    consists of a souterrain, containing the collection of antiquities, and of a
                    first floor, entered from the portico through bronze doors of artistic merit,
                    made after designs by Stiiler, weighing 7∣ tons, and executed at a cost of
                    £3600. This floor consists of a rotunda, and of halls and cabinets of sculpture.
                    The second floor, in a series of cabinets running round the entire building,
                    contains the national collection of paintings. These are divided into three
                    classes,—the Italian, French, and Spanish; the Dutch, Flemish, and German; and
                    the Byzantine, Italian, Dutch, and German pictures down to the end of the 15th
                    century—each of the classes being chronologically arranged. The gallery, then
                    containing 1300 paintings, was enriched in 1874 by the valuable pictures of the
                    Suermondt gallery, purchased by the nation at a cost of £51,000. The Suermondt
                    gallery was rich in pictures of the old Netherland and German schools, and of
                    the Dutch and Flemish schools. It also contained a few Spanish, Italian, and
                    French pictures.</p>
                <p>The New Museum is connected with the Old Museum by a covered corridor. In its
                    interior arrangements and decoration it is undoubtedly the most splendid
                    structure in the city. Like the Old Museum, it has three floors. The lowest of
                    these contains the Ethnographical and Egyptian Museums and the Museum of
                    Northern Antiquities. In the first floor, plaster casts of ancient, mediaeval,
                    and modern sculpture are found in thirteen halls and in three departments. On
                    the walls of the grand marble staircase, which rises to the full height of the
                    building, Kaulbach’s renowned cyclus of stéréochromie pictures is painted,
                    representing the six great epochs of human progress, from the confusion of
                    tongues at the Tower of Babel and the dispersion of the nations to the
                    Reformation of the 16th century. The uppermost story contains the collection of
                    engravings and the gallery of curiosities.</p>
                <p>The National Gallery is an elegant building, after designs by Stiiler, situated
                    between the New Museum and the Spree, and is intended to receive the collection
                    of modern paintings now exhibited provisionally in the apartments of the
                    Academy.</p>
                <p>The public monuments are the equestrian statues of the Great Elector on the Lange
                    Brücke, erected in 1703; Rauch’s celebrated statue of Frederick the Great,
                    “probably the grandest monument in Europe,” opposite the emperor’s palace, Unter
                    den Linden; and the statue of Frederick William III. in the Lustgarten. In the
                    Thiergarten is Drake’s marble monument of Frederick William III.; and in the
                    neighbouring Charlottenburg, Rauch’s figures of the same king and the Queen
                    Louise in the mausoleum in the Park. A second group of monuments on the
                    Wilhelm’s Platz commemorates the generals of the Seven Years’ War; and a third,
                    in the neighbourhood of the Opera, the generals who fought against Napoleon I.
                    On the Kreuzberg, the highest spot in the neighbourhood of Berlin, a Gothic
                    monument in bronze was erected by Frederick William III. to commemorate the
                    victories of 1813-15; and in the Königsplatz the present emperor has erected a
                    column of victory in honour of the triumphs of 1864, 1866, and 1870. This
                    monument rises to the height of 197 feet, the gilded figure of Victory on the
                    top being 40 feet high.</p>
                <p>Literature, science, and art are represented in different parts of the city by
                    statues and busts of Rauch, Schinkel, Thaer, Beuth, Schadow, Winckelmann,
                    Schiller, Hegel, Jahn; while the monuments in the cemeteries and churche3 bear
                    the names of distinguished men in all departments of political, military, and
                    scientific life.</p>
                <p>Next to Leipsic, Berlin is the largest publishing centre in Germany. In the year
                    1872 there were 1540 works published in Berlin, of which 20 per cent, had to do
                    with literature, 15 per cent, with philology and pedagogy, 14 per cent, with law
                    and politics, 7 per cent, with history, 6 per cent, were military works, 5 per
                    cent, theological, 5 per cent, had to do with agriculture, and 4 per cent, with
                    medicine. Turning to journals and periodical literature, 265 newspapers and
                    magazines, daily, w eekly, or monthly, appeared in the same year. The political
                    journals in Berlin do not, however, sustain the same relation to the political
                    life of Germany as do the political journals of London and Paris to that of
                    England and France.’</p>
                <p>Berlin is not only a centre of intelligence, but is also an important centre of
                    manufacture and trade. Its trade and manufactures appear to be at present in a
                    transition state—old branches are dying out, and new branches are springing into
                    existence. Direct railway communication between the corn lands of north-eastern
                    Germany, Poland, and Russia on the one hand, and the states of Central and
                    Western Germany on the other, have deprived Berlin of much of its importance as
                    a centre of trade in corn and flour. In like manner the spirit trade and
                    manufacture have suffered. The 20,892,493 litres exported in 1870 had sunk to
                    9,737,597 litres in 1872. On the other hand, for petroleum, Berlin has become an
                    emporium for the supply of the Mark of Brandenburg, part of Posen, Silesia,
                    Saxony, and Bohemia. Silk and cotton manufacture, which in former times
                    constituted a principal branch of Berlin manufacture, has died out. As late as
                    1849 Berlin had 2147 silk looms; now it has few or none. Woollen manufacture
                    maintained its ground for a time, occupying about 8000 looms and 11,404 workmen
                    as late as 1861. In 1874 the number of hands employed in spinning and weaving in
                    all branches had sunk to 2918. The chief articles of manufacture and commerce
                    are locomotives and machinery; carriages; copper, brass, and bronze wares;
                    porcelain; and the requisites for building of every description. The manufacture
                    of sewing-machines has assumed large proportions, from 70,000 to 75,000 being
                    manufactured annually. According to the report of the Government inspector of
                    factories for the city of Berlin, presented to the minister of trade and
                    commerce, the number of persons employed in all the Berlin factories in the year
                    1874 was 64,466. By a “factory” was understood any wholesale manufacturing
                    establishment employing more than 10 persons. In 1874 there were 1906 such
                    factories at work, employing 51,464 males and 11,004 females above 16 years of
                    age; 1137 males and 760 females under 16 and above 14 years of age; and 66 male
                    and 14 female children under 14 years of age. The manufacture of steam-engines
                    and machinery occupied 14,737 persons; brassfounding, metallic belt and lamp
                    manufacture, 9074; carpentry, joinery, and wood-carving, 4548; printing, 3620;
                    spinning and weaving, 2918; sewing-machines and telegraphic apparatus, 2788; the
                    finer qualities of paper, 2585; porcelain and ware, 1741; dyeing, 1712; gas
                    works, 1518; tobacco and cigars, 1477; manufacture of linen garments, 1355;
                    pianos and harmoniums, 1198; dressmaking and artificial flowers, 1127; brewing,
                    1061. None of the other branches found occupation for 1000 persons. The value of
                    the annual exports to the United States of articles of Berlin manufacture has
                    risen to about £1,000,000 sterling.' The exports to the Brazils, the Argentine
                    Republic, and <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0903-0615-0598"/> Japan are also increasing. Berlin is growing in
                    importance as a money market and centre of industrial undertakings. The Berlin
                    Cassenverein, through which the banking houses transact their business, passed
                    £1,351,988,967 sterling through its books in 1872, as compared with £644,431,255
                    sterling in 1871. In 1872, 23 new banking establishments were enrolled in the
                    trade register, with a capital of £7,565,000 sterling; and in the same year 144
                    new joint-stock companies were enrolled, representing a capital of £18,000,000
                    sterling. Since that time the tide of enterprise has ebbed, but the majority of
                    these undertakings continue to exist.</p>
                <p>In the progress of its growth Berlin has lost much of its original character. The
                    numerical relations of class to class have been greatly modified. New political
                    institutions have sprung into existence, of which the Berlin of the early years
                    of Frederick William IV. had not a trace. It has become the seat of a parliament
                    of the realm, and of a parliament of the empire. Manufacture and trade have come
                    to absorb 70 per cent, of the entire population. But these have also changed
                    their character; old branches which constituted a marked feature of its
                    commercial and manufacturing activity have almost suddenly died out, while new
                    branches have with equal rapidity more than supplied their place. While the
                    commercial and manufacturing element has thus increased, other elements have
                    undergone a relative decline. The learned professions and the civil service
                    numbered in 1867 7 ’ 9 per cent, of the population. In 1871 the proportion had
                    sunk to 6 11, and since then the percentage has gone on decreasing. In this
                    altered state of affairs Berlin will have to cherish and nurture the scientific,
                    educational, ethical, and religious elements in her life with double care, not
                    only to keep up her old reputation abroad, but also for the purpose of
                    preventing the degeneration of her people at home.</p>
