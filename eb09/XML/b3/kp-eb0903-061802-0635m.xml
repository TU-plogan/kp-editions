                    and in the United Kingdom it has spread to such an extent amongst all grades of
                    society during the last twenty years that the interference of the Legislature
                    has been found necessary. The evils it has been productive of are too well known
                    to call for comment here, and the principles require to be treated solely from
                    mathematical and legislative points of view.</p>
                <p>The first principle of all betting is that “you cannot win where you cannot
                    lose.” Accordingly no bets are “play or pay” except those on certain events
                    enumerated below, or unless such a stipulation is laid down at the time the bet
                    is made. Betting may be divided into “bookmaking” and “backing.” The former
                    consists in laying the odds, and, theoretically speaking, secures a small though
                    certain profit, were all debts paid and the number of starters for the event
                    large. During the first half of the 19th century bookmaking was a far more
                    lucrative business than now, because betting was confined to the wealthier
                    classes and bad debts were fewer. Also, betting commenced many months before a
                    great race, and so the bookmaker had more opportunities of laying against all
                    the entries, whereas most betting on play or pay events is now done just before
                    the start. Taking the St Leger (always a play or pay event) of 1875, the
                    following table represents a &lt;£100 book opened a week before the race,
                    according to the Continental betting quotations, September 7, 1875. Those marked
                    t did not eventually start.</p>

                <p>In this instance twenty horses are quoted in the betting. Assuming that the
                    bookmaker finds a customer to back each of these, and that he encounters no bad
                    debts, he receives £120, 2s. 6d., and has to pay £100 to the person with whom he
                    laid £100 to £4 <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit03newyrich/page/n636/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0903-0636-0619"/> against Craigmillar, the winner. This leaves a
                    gain of £20, 2s. 6d. or 201 per cent., but even then travelling and other
                    expenses have not been taken into consideration, and the fewer horses that are
                    backed the less accordingly will be the bookmaker’s profit. In fact, the
                    non-backing of any one horse in this instance materially reduces the profit. The
                    race in question was particularly favourable for bookmakers, both because so
                    many horses were scratched (representing a gain of £26, 17s. 10d.), and because
                    at the date supposed the winner was at such long odds. At the actual start the
                    odds against the beaten horses were 9 to 2, and 6, 7, 9, 10, 12, 20, 25, 25, 50,
                    and 66 to 1 respectively, and against the winner 20 to 3. This will be found to
                    leave the bookmaker, had he commenced his book the day of the race, a profit of
                    £1, 12s. 6d. only, and had the first favourite won there would have been a loss
                    of £5, Ils. lid. There were 178 entries for this St Leger, and if the book had
                    been opened many months before the race, and the bookmaker had been able to
                    obtain customers, the favourites would have been backed at longer odds, bringing
                    less profit from this source, but then more eventual non-starters are backed,
                    which is certain profit. The chief principles of bookmaking are the same,
                    whether the number of starters for an event be unlimited, or two only, though,
                    in the latter case, there is no certain profit, as there are not sufficient
                    starters to enable the bookmaker to save his stake. His only chance then is that
                    he has been circumspect enough to have laid his odds on the winner.</p>
                <p><hi rend="superscript"> w</hi> Backing” is a very plain matter, but in the
                    long-run invariably a losing method of betting. It simply consists in taking the
                    odds laid by a bookmaker against one or more starters for any event. If it be a
                    play or pay event, and the possible starter be scratched, the backer loses his
                    money at once. Although a backer may become possessed of such special
                    information as may enable him to win large sums occasionally, his losses will in
                    the long-run exceed them.’ In fact, the bookmaker virtually keeps a bank against
                    him.</p>
                <p>“Hedging” consists in laying off at shorter odds part of the sums various
                    starters may have been backed for. Thus, a backer has taken <hi rend="italic"
                    >£50</hi> to £1 about A, B, and C respectively for a play or pay event some time
                    before the date fixed for the contest. A turns out a nonstarter, so there is a
                    certain loss of <hi rend="italic">£1.</hi> At starting the odds have come down
                    to say 2 to 1 against B, and 3 to 1 against C. So the backer lays £50 to £25
                    against B, and £50 to £16, 13s. 4d. against C. If neither wins he receives £41,
                    13s. 4d., out of which he has to pay £3 to the bookmaker, leaving a profit of
                    £38, 13s. 4d. Should B win he receives £50 from the bookmaker, and £16, 13s. 4d.
                    on account of C’s defeat, out of which he has to pay £2 to the bookmaker on
                    account of A and C, and the £50 he has laid against B, so the profit left is
                    £14, 13s. 4d. Should C win, the hedger receives £50 from the bookmaker, and £25
                    on account of B’s defeat, out of which he has still to pay the bookmaker £2 on
                    account of A and B, and the £50 he has laid against C, so the profit left is
                    £23.</p>
                <p>The only events that are now play or pay are the Derby, Oaks, St Leger, Two
                    Thousand Guineas, One Thousand Guineas, Cesarewitch, and Cambridgeshire Stakes,
                    the Ascot, Goodwood, and Doncaster Cups, and all handicaps above £200 value,
                    with two forfeits, the minor whereof is not less than £5. In all other betting
                    the backer is entitled to a start for his money, unless the contrary is
                    stipulated at the time the bet is made.</p>
                <p>In the United Kingdom betting has been the source of considerable legislation
                    during the past thirty years. Curiously enough, by the 9th of Queen Anne, if any
                    one gained over £10 by betting, the loser was entitled to pursue for repayment
                    of the stake if he had paid it, and if he did not do so within three months any
                    one might sue for treble the amount with costs. After it had become a dead
                    letter some informers raked up this Act in 1844, and the result was the
                    insertion of a clause in the Gaming Act, 8 and 9 Vict. c. 109, annulling the old
                    statute. During the next seven years betting on horse races increased to an
                    enormous extent. “List shops,” where the proprietors kept a bank against all
                    comers, and backers could stake their money in advance on a horse, sprung up in
                    the metropolis and large towns, leading to many acts of flagrant dishonesty. Sir
                    Alexander Cockburn, then attorney-general, accordingly introduced the Betting
                    Houses Act, 16 and 17 Vict. c. 119, whereby all houses or places kept for such
                    purposes were brought under the above-mentioned Gaming Act, and might be
                    proceeded against as a common nuisance and contrary to law,—heavy penalties
                    being incurred by the owners, occupiers, or advertizers of such houses or
                    places. Betting on race-courses, or at TattersalΓs and similar private clubs,
                    where money is not received in advance, was not meant to be interfered with. For
                    sometime this legislation had the desired effect till attempts were made to
                    evade it by receiving money through the post. These were successful till the
                    summer of 1869, when the Government suddenly bestirred itself, and several
                    prosecutions took place. As the Act, however, did not extend to Scotland, the
                    bettinghouse keepers removed there or went abroad, and their advertisements at
                    such addresses were still legal. This led to 37 Vict. c. 14, extending 16 and 17
                    Vict. c. 119 to Scotland, and making all advertisements of betting-houses,
                    whether in or out of the United Kingdom, illegal. It came into force on 31st
                    July 1874, and almost exterminated the receiving of money in advance, especially
                    as it is now enforced very strictly.</p>
                <p>In 1866 a system of betting, termed <hi rend="italic">Paris</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >mutuels,</hi> was started in France. It consisted of agencies where any one may
                    back a probable starter for any sum or sums he pleases. The whole of the money
                    thus staked on all starters is added together, a commission deducted by the
                    agent for his trouble, and the balance divided in “equal shares,” or <hi
                    rend="italic">Paris</hi><hi rend="italic">mutuels,</hi> amongst those who have
                    backed the victor. In this instance the agent’s gain is, of course, certain. It
                    has been found, however, that unlicensed opportunities of staking money in
                    advance have produced the same evils in France as in England. During the past
                    three years the French Government have taken the matter up strongly, and
                    betting-houses and agencies are now as effectually doomed on the French as on
                    the English side of the Channel</p>
                <p>In the United States betting is also illegal. Under the Gambling Act, whenever
                    any money has been staked for a bet, either side can sue the stakeholder and
                    recover his portion of the money, either before or after the bet has been
                    decided. Owing, however, to the strong public sentiment which naturally condemns
                    such a course, proceedings against stakeholders are excessively rare. Any voter
                    betting on the result of an election forfeits his franchise, yet the heaviest
                    betting in the States is on elections, and the betters go unchallenged to the
                    poll. <hi rend="smallcaps">(h. f. w.)</hi></p>
