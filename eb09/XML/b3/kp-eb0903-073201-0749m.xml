                <p><label type="entry">BIRDS RECENTLY EXTIRPATED</label>.</p>
                <p>From the consideration of Fossil Birds we are naturally led to treat of those
                    which have been extirpated in modern times, and are made known to us by evidence
                    of various kinds, and more or less old. The most remarkable of these is the Dodo
                    <hi rend="italic">{Didus ineptus),</hi> which, on the discovery of Mauritius by
                    the Portuguese under Mascaregnas in the beginning of the 16 th century, was
                    found to inhabit that island. Voyagers have vied with each other in describing
                    or depicting its uncouth appearance, and its name has almost passed into a
                    byword expressive of all that is effete. Clumsy, flightless, and defenceless, it
                    soon succumbed, not so much to the human invaders of its realm as to the
                    domestic beasts which accompanied them, and there gaining their liberty,
                    unchecked by much of the wholesome discipline of nature, ran riot, to the utter
                    destruction (as will be seen) of no inconsiderable portion of the Mauritian
                    fauna. The latest known testimony of the Dodo’s existence is furnished by the
                    copy of a journal (now in the British Museum) kept by one Benjamin Harry, mate
                    of the ship “Berkley Castle,” which shews that it survived until July 1681. It
                    had its life most likely sometime longer, but of this there is no evidence
                    forthcoming. For a century and a half all that was known of it was derived from
                    the quaint and sometimes questionable accounts of early voyagers; certain
                    pictures, mostly by Dutch artists—for the bird was not unfrequently sent alive
                    to Europe, and the traffic of the East Indies w as then chiefly in the hands of
                    the Netherlanders—which pictures, however grotesque, were doubtless for the most
                    part faithful portraits; and a few scattered relics—a foot in the British
                    Museum, a head and foot at Oxford, a perfect skull at Copenhagen, and a
                    fragmentary one at Prague. Still these (or indeed the Danish specimen alone)
                    were enough to enable Professor Reinhardt to determine the affinity of the lost
                    bird to the Pigeons, an alliance not before surmised, but one which scarcely
                    anybody now disputes. In 1866, however, Mr George Clark of Mauritius discovered
                    in the peat of a pool (the Mare aux Songes) in that island an abundance of
                    Dodos’ bones <hi rend="italic">{Ibis,</hi> 1866, p. 141); and these, when
                    transmitted to Europe, informed naturalists as to nearly every part of its
                    osseous structure, which was soon after described in detail by Professor Owen
                    <hi rend="italic">{Trans. Zool. Soc..</hi> vi. p. 49).</p>
                <p>But the Dodo is not the only member of its family that has vanished. The little
                    island which has successively borne the name of Mascaregnas, England’s Forest,
                    Bourbon, and Réunion, and lies to the southward of Mauritius, had also an allied
                    Bird, now dead and gone. Of this not a relic has been handled by any naturalist.
                    The latest description of it, by Du Bois in 1674, is meagre in the extreme, and
                    though two figures—one by Bontekoe <hi rend="italic">{circa</hi> 1646), and
                    another by Pierre Witthoos <hi rend="italic">{ob.</hi> 1693) have been thought
                    to represent it <hi rend="italic">{Trans. Zool. Soc.</hi> vi. p. 373, plate 62),
                    their identification is but conjectural. Yet the existence of such a bird is
                    indubitable.</p>
                <p>Far to the eastward of these two sister islands lies a third—Rodriguez. Here
                    there formerly lived another Didine bird, sufficiently distinct from the Dodo of
                    Mauri tius to form a genus of its own— <hi rend="italic">Pezophaps</hi><hi

                    passing some time in 1691-93 on that island, has left, with a very inferior
                    figure, a charmingly naive account of its appearance and habits, the general
                    truth of which has been amply substantiated by Mr Edward Newton’s discovery in
                    large numbers of its bones <hi rend="italic">{Phil. Trans.</hi> 1869, p. 327);
                    and a nearly complete skeleton of either sex may be seen in the museum of the
                    University of Cambridge, by the side of the most perfect specimen existing of
                    that of its bulkier relative, the Mauritian Dodo.</p>
                <p>Nor does this group of Didine birds contain all the lost forms of the Mascarene
                    islands. From Mauritius have disappeared at least two species of Parrot, a Dove,
                    a large Coot, and a second Ralline bird, abnormal, flightless, and long-billed—
                    <hi rend="italic">Aphanapteryx.</hi> A painting of this last was found by Von
                    Frauenfeld in the emperor’s library at Vienna, and some of its bones, rescued by
                    Mr Edward Newton from the peat of the Mare aux Songes, have been fully described
                    by Μ. A. Milne-Edwards. Remains of the Coot and one of the extinct Parrots were
                    found also in the same spot, while skins of the other Parrot and of the Dove
                    still exist in a few museums. Réunion, also, once had other birds now lost, and
                    so had Rodriguez. In the former, a somewhat abnormal Starling <hi rend="italic"
                    >{Fregilupus)</hi> existed until some forty years ago <hi rend="italic">{Proc.
                    Zool. Soc.</hi> 1874, p. 474), and its skin and skeleton are among the treasures
                    of three or four museums. Perhaps, also, there were other Ralline birds, but the
                    evidence on this head is inconclusive. In Rodriguez, the greater part of its
                    original <hi rend="italic">avifauna</hi> has vanished. There was a small but
                    peculiar Owl <hi rend="italic">{Athene murivora'),</hi> a big Parrot <hi
                    rend="italic">{Necropsittacus rodericanus^),</hi> a Dove <hi rend="italic"
                    >{Erythroena?</hi> sp. ign.), a large brevipennate Heron <hi rend="italic"
                    >{Ardea megacephala),</hi> and a singular Rail <hi rend="italic">{Miserythrus
                    leguati)—</hi> in some respects allied to the Mauritian <hi rend="italic"
                    >Aphanapteryx—</hi> besides other birds of which we know from old voyagers,<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi rend="italic">Proc. Zool.

                    determined (as those of the species above mentioned have been) from the numerous
                    caverns of the island. A second Parrot, or rather Parrakeet <hi rend="italic"
                    >{Palceornis exsuΓ),</hi> still exists, but in very small numbers, and the
                    unique specimen known was obtained in the year 1871.</p>
                <p>With the examples of these Mascarene Islands before us, it is not without reason
                    that we suppose a like fate to have befallen many of the feathered inhabitants
                    of other places exposed to similar ravages. We cannot read the accounts not
                    merely of the earliest voyages to the Antilles, but even of those performed
                    within the last hundred years, without being aware that the writers met with
                    many Birds which are not now known to inhabit them. These lost species, there is
                    some ground for believing, were mainly; if not wholly, peculiar to the locality,
                    and after having made good their existence, maybe, for ages, fell easy and
                    helpless victims to the forces which European civilization brought into play.
                    Chief among these forces was fire. In all countries and at all times it has been
                    the habit of colonists to burn the woods surrounding their settlements — partly
                    to clear the ground for future crops, and partly (in tropical climates
                    especially) to promote the salubrity of their stations. When fire was set to the
                    forest and bush of a small island, the whole of which could be burnt at once,
                    the disastrous effect on its fauna can easily be conceived. Even the animals
                    which happened to escape the conflagration itself would speedily starve, owing
                    to the at least temporary destruction of the native flora whence, either
                    directly or indirectly, they derived their wonted sustenance. Thus in certain of
                    the Virgin Islands the “dead” shells of many species of terrestrial Gasteropods
                    are everywhere found in astounding numbers, while not a living individual of
                    several of the species has ever been met with by the conchologists <pb
                    break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit03newyrich/page/n751/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0903-0751-0734"/> of our day. The only assignable cause of the
                    extinction of these creatures lies in the fact that these islands are known to
                    have been laid waste by fire. The shells have resisted destruction but how many
                    more animals must have perished without leaving a trace of their existence 1
                    Even at the present time, few parts of the world so overrun by people of
                    European descent are from a naturalist’s point of view so little known as the
                    West-India Islands. Still less is known of their state a century ago; and it
                    would be a long and wearisome task to collect from old voyages the meagre,
                    scattered, and often inaccurate information they contain as to the zoology of
                    these islands. One example may, perhaps, be sufficient. Ledru accompanied an
                    expedition sent out in 1796 by the French Government to the West Indies. In his
                    work he gives a list of the birds he found in the islands of St Thomas and St
                    Croix (<hi rend="italic">Voyage, aux Isles de Tenerife, dec.,</hi> Paris, 1810,
                    ii. p. 29). He enumerates <hi rend="italic">fourteen</hi> kinds of birds as
                    having occurred to him then. Of these there is now no trace of <hi rend="italic"
                    >eight</hi> of the number; and, if he is to be believed, it must be supposed
                    that within fifty or sixty years of his having been assured of their existence,
                    they have become extinct<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"
                    ><p>One of the survivors (a Parrakeet, <hi rend="italic">Conurus
                    xantholaεmus)</hi> was a few years ago restricted to a single hill-top in St
                    Thomas, and so reduced in numbers that the present writer was ridiculed by many
                    of the inhabitants for believing that such a bird ever existed in the island.
                    Found, however, it was at last, but it must be regarded as verging upon
                    extinction.</p></note> And yet the period just mentioned was long subsequent to
                    that in which the primeval woods of the islands were burnt. What, then, must not
                    have been the changes which tho forest-fires produced?</p>
                <p>If this be not enough we may cite the case of the French islands of Guadeloupe
                    and Martinique, in which, according to Μ. Guyon <hi rend="italic">(Comptes
                    Rendus,</hi> lxiii. p. 589), there were once found <hi rend="italic">six</hi>
                    species of <hi rend="italic">Psittaci,</hi> all now exterminated; and it may
                    possibly be that the Maccaws stated by Mr Gosse <hi rend="italic">(B.
                    Jamaica,</hi> p. 260) and Mr Marsh <hi rend="italic">(Proc. Acad. N^.S.
                    Philad.</hi> 1863, p. 283) to have formerly frequented certain parts of Jamaica,
                    but not apparently noticed there for some twenty-five or thirty years, have
                    fallen victims to colonization and its consequences.</p>
                <p>Mention has already been made of the Gare-fowl <hi rend="italic">(Alca
                    impennis),</hi> whose bones have been found in the kitchen-middens of Denmark,
                    and more lately in similar deposits in Caithness. This species, nearly allied to
                    our common Razor-bill <hi rend="italic">(A. torda),</hi> but flightless and
                    about twice as big, seems to have become extinct since 1844, in which year the
                    last two examples known to have lived were taken on a rocky islet—one of a group
                    called Fuglaskér, or Fowlskerries, off the south-west point of [Iceland. Ten
                    years before, one had been caught alive at the entrance of Waterford harbour;
                    and in 1821 or 1822 one was taken near St Hilda, to which lonely island, as
                    appears from old authors, the bird had been accustomed to resort in the breeding
                    season. In 1812 a pair were killed at Papa-Westray, which was also a breeding
                    station of the species, and the stuffed skin of one of them is preserved in the
                    British Museum, while that of the Waterford specimen may be seen in the museum
                    of Trinity College, Dublin. In the Faeroes the species was formerly common, but
                    it certainly ceased from appearing there about the beginning of the present
                    century. In the Iceland seas there are three localities called after the bird’s
                    name, but on only one of them has it been observed for many years, having
                    probably been as long extirpated in the rest as in the Faeroes. On the locality
                    where it continued latest, there is ample evidence to show that it once was
                    plentiful. There was a large skerry—the Geirfuglaskér proper—on which, in 1813,
                    the crew of a Faeroese vessel made a descent and slaughtered a large number of
                    Gare-fowls; but this, like the rest of the group, was a place very difficult of
                    access, and, in 1821, Faber, the well-known faunist of Iceland, failed to land
                    upon it, though some of his companions reached the Geirfugladrângr, a smaller
                    islet lying further to seaward. In 1830 the large skerry, through a submarine
                    volcanic eruption, disappeared beneath the λvaves, and immediately after a
                    colony of Gare-fowls was discovered on another rock lying nearer the mainland,
                    and known as Eldey.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"
                    ><p>Whether on the subsidence of the large skerry another portion of the birds
                    which frequented it colonized the outermost islet is not known, for this spot
                    does not seem to have been visited by any human being since Faber’s time, more
                    than fifty years ago.</p></note> In the course of the next fourteen years, not
                    fewer probably than sixty birds were killed on this newly-chosen station, and a
                    nearly corresponding number of eggs were brought off; but the colony gradually
                    dwindled until, as above said, in 1844 the last two were taken <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Ibis,</hi> 1861, p. 374).</p>
                <p>In Greenland, for the last three hundred years, the Garefowl has only been known
                    as an occasional straggler, but it would appear that in 1574 a party of
                    Icelanders found it so plentiful at a spot on the east coast—since identified
                    <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit03newyrich/page/n752/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0903-0752-0735"/> with DanelΓs or Graah’s Islands—that they loaded
                    one of their boats with their captives. All recent explorations of this
                    inhospitable coast prove the utter vanity of the notion that the Gare-fowl is
                    able there to find an asylum.</p>
                <p>But it was in the seas of Newfoundland that this species, known to the settlers
                    and fishermen as the “Penguin,”— a corruption of the words “pin-wing,”—was most
                    abundant, as a reference to Hakluyt’s and similar collections of voyages will
                    prove. In 1536, or forty years after the discovery of the country, we find an
                    island taking its name from the bird, and others are even now so called. English
                    and French mariners alike resorted to these spots, driving the helpless and
                    hapless birds on sails or planks into a boat, “as many as shall lade her,” and
                    salting them for provision. The French crews, indeed, trusted so much to this
                    supply of victual, as to take, it is said, but “small store of flesh with them.”
                    This practice, we learn from Cartwright <hi rend="italic">(Journal,</hi>
                    &lt;fcc., iii. p. 55), was carried on even in 1785, and he then foresaw the
                    speedy extirpation of the birds, which at that time had only one island left to
                    breed upon. In 1819, Anspach reported their entire disappearance, but it is
                    possible that some few yet lingered. On Funk Island, their last resort, rude
                    enclosures of stones are, or recently were, still to be seen, in which the
                    “Pinwings” were impounded before slaughter; and a large quantity of their bones,
                    and even natural mummies, preserved partly by the antiseptic property of the
                    peat and partly by the icy subsoil, have been discovered. One of the last has
                    furnished the chief materials from which the osteology of the species has been

                    317). Some 70 specimens of the bird’s skin, about as many eggs, and nearly
                    half-a-dozen more or less perfect skeletons, with detached bones of perhaps an
                    hundred individuals, are preserved in collections; but even if there be any
                    truth in the various reports of the appearance of the species since 1844 (some
                    of which seem to rest on fairly good testimony), so that it may still survive,
                    it is obvious that its rediscovery will most likely seal its fate.</p>
                <p>Far less commonly known, but apparently quite as certain, is the doom of a large
                    Duck which even fifty years ago was commonly found in summer about the mouth of
                    the St Lawrence and the coast of Labrador, migrating in winter to the shores of
                    Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, New England, and perhaps further southward. For many
                    years past, according to the best-informed American ornithologists, not a single
                    example has been met with in any of the markets of the United States, where
                    formerly it was not at all uncommon at the proper season, and the last known to
                    the writer to have lived was killed by Col. Wedderburn in Halifax harbour in the
                    autumn of 1852.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>It is
                    needless to observe that no one at that time had any notion of its approaching
                    extinction.</p></note> This bird, the <hi rend="italic">Anas labradora</hi> of
                    the older ornithologists, was nearly allied to the Eiders <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Somateria},</hi> and like them used to breed on rocky islets, where it was
                    safe from the depredations of foxes and other carnivorous quadrupeds. This
                    safety was however unavailing when man began yearly to visit its
                    breeding-haunts, and, not content with plundering its nests, mercilessly to
                    shoot the birds. Most of such islets are, of course, easily ransacked and
                    depopulated. Having no asylum to turn to, for the shores of the mainland were
                    infested by the four-footed enemies just mentioned, and (unlike some of its
                    congeners) it had not a high northern range, its fate is easily understood. No
                    estimate has yet been made of the number of specimens existing in museums, but
                    it is believed to be not very great.</p>
                <p>Another bird which has become extinct within the last few years is one of a group
                    of Parrots <hi rend="italic">(Nestor}</hi> peculiar to the New-Zealand
                    Subregion, and though some of its congeners still exist in the less-frequented
                    and alpine parts of that country, this species <hi rend="italic">(N.</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">productus}</hi> seems to have been confined to Phillip Island. The
                    last known to have lived, according to information supplied to the writer by Mr
                    Gould, was seen by that gentleman in a cage in London about the year 1851. Not
                    much more than a dozen specimens are believed to exist in collections.</p>
