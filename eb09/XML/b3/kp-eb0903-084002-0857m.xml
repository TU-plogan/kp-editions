                <p><label type="entry">BLUMEN BACH, <hi rend="smallcaps">Johann
                    Friedrich</hi></label>, a distinguished physiologist, was born at Gotha on the
                    11 th of May 1752. He studied medicine at Jena, and afterwards at Göttingen,
                    where he took the degree of doctor in 1775. His thesis on that occasion <hi
                    rend="italic">De Generis</hi><hi rend="italic">Humani Varietate Nativa,</hi>
                    published in quarto, was the germ of those craniological researches to which so
                    many of his subsequent inquiries were directed; and such was the opinion
                    entertained of his acquirements, that he was appointed an adjunct or
                    extraordinary professor of medicine in the following year, and ordinary
                    professor in 1778; soon after which period he began to enrich the pages of the
                    <hi rend="italic">Medizinische Bibliothek,</hi> of which he was editor from 1780
                    to 1794, with various contributions on medicine, physiology, and anatomy. In
                    physiology lie was of the school of Haller, and was in the habit of illustrating
                    his theory by a careful comparison of the animal functions of man with these of
                    the lower animals. His reputation was much extended by <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0903-0858-0841"/> the publication of his excellent <hi
                    rend="italic">Institutiones</hi><hi rend="italic">Physiologicoe,</hi> a
                    condensed, well-arranged view of the animal functions, expounded without
                    discussion of minute anatomical details. This work appeared in 1787, and between
                    its first publication and 1821 went through many editions in Germany, where it
                    was the general text-book of the science. It was translated into English in
                    America by Caldwell in 1798, and in London by Elliotson in 1807.</p>
                <p>Blumenbach was perhaps still more extensively known by his admirable <hi
                    rend="italic">Handbuch</hi> of comparative anatomy, of which the German editions
                    were numerous, from its appearance in 1805 to 1824. It was translated into
                    English in 1809 by the eminent surgeon Lawrence, and again, with the latest
                    improvements and editions, by Coulson in 1827. This manual of Blumenbach’s,
                    though slighter than the subsequent works of Cuvier, Carus, and others, and not
                    to be compared with such recent expositions as that of Gegenbaur, will always be
                    esteemed for the accuracy of the author’s own observations, and his just
                    appreciation of the labours of his predecessors.</p>
                <p>One of the most extensive of Blumenbach’s works was the <hi rend="italic">Decas
                    Collectionis</hi><hi rend="italic">suoe</hi><hi rend="italic">Craniorum
                    Diversarum Gentium illustrata,</hi> in which accurate though slight delineations
                    of the skulls in his noble collection are given, with brief descriptions of
                    each. It appeared in <hi rend="italic">fasciculi,</hi> until sixty crania were
                    represented,—exhibiting in a striking manner the peculiarities in form of the
                    skulls of different nations, and justifying the division of the human race into
                    several great varieties or families, of which he enumerated five— the Caucasian
                    or white race, the Mongolian or Tatar, the Malayan or brown race, the Negro or
                    black race, and the American or red race. The classification he thus proposed
                    has been very generally received, and most later schemes have been modifications
                    of it. For these see the article <hi rend="smallcaps">Anthropology,</hi> vol.
                    ii. p. 113.</p>
                <p>Although the greatest part of Blumenbach’s long life was passed at Göttingen, in
                    1789 he found leisure to visit Switzerland, and gave a curious medical
                    topography of that country in his <hi rend="italic">Bibliothek.</hi> He was in
                    England in 1788 and 1792. The Prince Regent conferred on him the office of
                    physician to the royal family in Hanover in 1816, and made him knight companion
                    of the Guelphic order in 1821. The Royal Academy of Paris elected him a member
                    in 1831. He died at Göttingen on the 22d of January 1840.</p>
