                    people of the northern part of Hindustan, inhabiting the tract of country now
                    included within the British district of Hissar, formerly called Bhatiânâ, the
                    eastern frontier of which is situated 125 miles north-west of Dehli. The Bhattis
                    present many peculiarities in manners and customs, distinguishing them from the
                    other people of Hindustân. They consist of two distinct races—the one being
                    composed of Mahometans of Râjput descent, who constitute the influential class,
                    and who report among themselves that their ancestors emigrated some centuries
                    ago from the district of Jasalmir, and after various vicissitudes settled in the
                    Bhatniâr country; the other comprising the common people, known as Jâts, who
                    have adopted the religion of their superiors, and are consequently treated with
                    great moderation. Most of these people are descended from dwellers on the
                    western bank of the Satlej, who were invited by a Râjâ of the Bhattis to cross
                    the river and settle in his country. Though tillers of the soil, the Bhattis are
                    more generally characterized as shepherds; and though they are mostly restricted
                    to the territory whence their name is derived, various tribes of them are to be
                    found in the Panjâb, and they are also scattered over the high grounds to the
                    east of the Indus.</p>
                <p>Notwithstanding they are Mahometans, their customs are in some respects at
                    variance with those observed by the majority of the followers of the prophet,
                    particularly in the females appearing, without reserve, unveiled in public, and
                    in their associating openly with the men. The wives of the Râjput chiefs form an
                    exception.</p>
                <p>The territory above described, anterior to British sway, was under the dominion
                    of a prince or Râjâ, whose authority was acknowledged by inferior chiefs. This
                    potentate could bring 20,000 or 30,000 men into the field, but they were quite
                    undisciplined, and despised the necessary principle of subordination. His
                    revenue arose chiefly from the plunder his troops secured; for their wars were
                    directed more to predatory purposes than to open contest, and the Râjâ, instead
                    of repressing the ravages of this immense banditti, willingly participated in
                    the spoils.</p>
                <p>While under the influence of native rule the Bhattis appear to have formed a
                    collection of hordes of freebooters. They have been described as of a cruel,
                    savage, and ferocious disposition, entertaining an abhorrence of the usages of
                    civilized life—thieves from their earliest infancy, and during their predatory
                    incursions into the neighbouring districts, not scrupling, though unresisted, to
                    add murder to robbery.</p>
                <p>Many of the Bhattis appear to be constantly changing their residence from place
                    to place as subsistence fails. Their exports are horses, camels, bullocks,
                    buffaloes, and ghi; occasionally they sell some surplus grain above what is
                    necessary for their own consumption, but their traffic is very inconsiderable. A
                    large portion of the country is unproductive, but along the banks of the River
                    Ghâgar, from Bhatniâr to the town of Sirsâ, and also in the vicinity of the
                    Naiwâl (Nalâ, or watercourse), the soil is uncommonly rich, and well adapted for
                    cultivation. The inundations of these rivers fertilize their banks, and the
                    subsidence of the waters leaves a broad margin prepared for plentiful crops of
                    wheat, rice, and barley, which amply reward the labours of the husbandman.</p>
                <p>The former capital of the Bhattis was Bhatniâr, which lies in a situation almost
                    inaccessible to an enemy, for no water is to be procured within 12 miles but
                    what supplies the inhabitants. It was taken, however, in 1398 by Timur, more
                    recently by the military adventurer George Thomas, and finally in 1805 by the
                    Râjâ of Bikânir, who still retains authority over it. The principal town is
                    Sirsâ, between which and Bhâwalpur a route for commercial purposes has been
                    opened. Numbers of the Bhattis have-emigrated from their native country to
                    establish themselves in the western parts of the dominions of Oudh; and several
                    families of them are to be met with in Rohilkhand. They are practised
                    travellers, and well trained to emigration by the laborious journeys undertaken
                    in crossing the great desert to the west of their territories. During the
                    independence of their native rulers, expeditions were frequently made in large
                    parties for the purpose of predatory incursions on peaceable countries more
                    remote; and these banditti displayed both skill and determination in attaining
                    their object. Camels previously laden with provisions were despatched to
                    different stations in the desert, which is about 130 miles in breadth, and their
                    loads deposited there. The most intelligent of the party about to follow were
                    then selected as guides, and enforced the most implicit obedience on their
                    companions during the journey, which closed at the frontier of the hostile
                    country, or rather that against which their hostility was directed. The guides
                    by long experience became expert without compass or landmark, and seldom failed
                    to conduct the party to the appointed station where the provisions were
                    deposited, and thence across the remainder of the desert in safety. If
                    accidentally they missed the points of rendezvous, or those where alone their
                    necessities could be relieved, they were exposed to inevitable destruction. The
                    adventurers steered their course by the sun in the day-time, and by the polar
                    star at night; and by similar aids they were enabled to retrace the way they had
                    travelled.</p>
                <p>The history of the Bhattis has attracted the notice of few European authors. They
                    seem to have carried on frequent wars with neighbouring states, and were the
                    most formidable enemies opposed to the Râjâ of Bikânir. The latter, however,
                    invaded their territories in the beginning of the present century, and obtained
                    some temporary advantages. He erected a fortress in Batinda, now a possession of
                    the Râjâ of Patiâlâ, and this contributed to overawe them for a time, and
                    repressed their incursions into his own dominions, as, independently of the
                    garrison, he stationed a large body of cavalry in the fort, whose frequent
                    sallies and captures of cattle annoyed the Bhattis so much that they
                    contemplated a total emigration from their own country. But George Thomas, the
                    military adventurer already noticed, an Irishman by birth, who, endowed with
                    singular talents and intrepidity, had founded for himself an independent state
                    in the north-west of India, was then at war with the province of Bikânir. Having
                    reached its frontiers, the Bhattis solicited his alliance, and, to induce him to
                    espouse their cause the more readily, offered him 40,000 rupees if he would
                    reduce the obnoxious <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0903-0647-0630"/> fort. In the prosecution of the war several
                    actions ensued, and various fortresses were taken; but it would appear that one
                    of the Bhatti chiefs at variance with General Thomas commenced hostilities
                    against him about the period now alluded to; and in this new warfare with his
                    late allies his forces were so much reduced by repeated encounters, that, being
                    scarcely able to stand an engagement, he fortified his camps. The Bhattis, after
                    frequent attacks, withdrew their troops by night; whereupon General Thomas took
                    and burned Fathiâbâd and other places, and might have occupied the whole
                    country, had not a neighbouring chief concluded an alliance with the Bhattis,
                    and seDt 1000 cavalry to their aid. General Thomas retreated to Jaijar, a town
                    within his own territory, leaving the Bhattis in possession of their capital</p>
                <p>The triumphs of the British arms proved fatal to the European adventurers who at
                    that period had established themselves in Northern India, and the arrangements
                    made with Sindia brought the British into contact with the country of the
                    Bhattis, against whom they were compelled in 1810 to march a force, which
                    expelled the chief, and transferred the greater part of the territory to his
                    son, who had voluntarily proceeded to the British camp.</p>
