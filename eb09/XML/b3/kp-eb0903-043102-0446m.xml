                <p><label type="entry">BATAVIA</label>, a large city and seaport on the north coast
                    of the island of Java, and the capital of all the Dutch settlements in the East.
                    It is situated on both sides of the river Jacatra or Tjiliwong, in a swampy
                    plain at the head of a capacious bay. The streets are for the most part straight
                    and regular, and many of them have a breadth of from 100 to 200 feet. In several
                    cases there is a canal in the centre lined with stone, and defended by low
                    parapets or banks, while almost every street and square is fringed with trees.
                    The old town has greatly changed from what it was in the 18th century. It was
                    then surrounded by strong fortifications, and contained a number of important
                    buildings, such as the town-house (built in 1652 and restored in 1706), the
                    exchange, the infirmary and orphan asylum, and the European churches. But the
                    ramparts were long ago demolished, and most of the public edifices have either
                    fallen into decay or been converted into magazines and warehouses. The great
                    church which was finished in 1760, at an expense of £80,000, had to be taken
                    down in consequence of its foundation having given way. Canals have been filled
                    up, streets have been altered, and the general character of the place
                    considerably modified. All the European inhabitants, except those immediately
                    connected with the shipping, have removed to the New Town, which has been
                    gradually formed by the integration of Weltevreden (<hi rend="italic"
                    >Well-content),</hi> Molenvliet <hi rend="italic">{Mill-stream),</hi> Rijswijk
                    <hi rend="italic">{Rice-town),</hi> Noordwijk <hi rend="italic"
                    >{North-town),</hi> Koningsplein <hi rend="italic">{King’s square),</hi> and
                    other suburban villages or stations. The situation of this modern part is higher
                    and healthier; and the grandeur and variety of its buildings far surpass
                    anything to be found in the older section of the city. The misplaced imitation
                    of Dutch arrangements has been happily avoided, and the natural advantages of
                    the situation and climate have been turned to account. The houses are frequently
                    separated from each other by rows of trees.</p>
                <p>As the chief city of the Dutch colonies in the East, Batavia contains numerous
                    buildings connected with the civil and military organization of the Government.
                    The chambers of the Council of the East Indies occupy a spacious edifice in
                    Rijswijk, and the governor-general’s hotel, or town-residence, is situated in
                    the same quarter. In the district of Weltevreden are the new palace, the
                    barracks, and the artillery school, as well as the military and civil hospital,
                    which can accommodate 600 patients, and not far off is the Frederik-Hendrik
                    citadel, which was built in 1837. Further inland, at Meester Cornelis (known for
                    its lake), Î3 a school for under-officers. The Koningsplein is a large open
                    square for military manoeuvres, about 390 feet long and 250 feet broad,
                    surrounded by mansions of the wealthier classes. Noordwijk is principally
                    inhabited by lesser merchants and subordinate officials. There is an
                    orphan-asylum in the district of Parapatta, and a poor-house <hi rend="italic"
                    >{Diaconie armenhaus)</hi> in Molenvliet. Besides those already mentioned,
                    Batavia has various educational and scientific institutions of note. In 1851 the
                    Government founded a medical school for <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0903-0447-0432"/> Javanese, and in 18G0 the “Gymnasium William
                    III.” in which a comprehensive education is bestowed. A society of arts and
                    sciences was established in 1778, a royal physical society in 1850, and a
                    society for the promotion of industry and agriculture in 1853. In addition to
                    the <hi rend="italic">Transactions</hi> of these societies—many of which contain
                    valuable contributions to their respective departments in their relation to the
                    East Indies—a considerable number of publications are issued in Batavia. Among
                    miscellaneous buildings of importance may be mentioned the public-hall known as
                    the <hi rend="italic">Harmonie,</hi> the freemasons’ lodge, the theatre, the
                    club-house, and several fine hotels.</p>
                <p>The population of Batavia is very varied,—the Dutch residents being a
                    comparatively small class, and greatly intermixed with Portuguese and Malays.
                    Here are found members of the different Indian nations, originally slaves; Moors
                    and Arabs, who are principally engaged in navigation, but also inhabit the Rua
                    Malacoa district, and trade in gold and precious stones; Javanese, who are
                    cultivators; and Malays, chiefly boatmen and sailors, and adherents of
                    Mahometanism. But, perhaps, the most important Asiatic element is the Chinese,
                    who are both numerous and industrious. They were long greatly oppressed by the
                    Dutch Government in various paltry ways, and in 1740 they were massacred to the
                    number of 12,000. But in spite of all this they have maintained their position,
                    and now enjoy a happier lot. In 1832 the population was found to consist of 2800
                    Europeans, 80,000 natives, 25,000 Chinese, 1000 Arabs, and 9500 slaves, a total
                    of 118,300 persons. The number of inhabitants is at present much less.</p>
                <p>Batavia is still a great commercial depot, though it has had to contend against
                    the rivalry of Singapore. The bay is rendered secure by a number of islands at
                    its mouth, and is capacious enough for a much larger trafiic than it has ever
                    seen; but it unfortunately grows very shallow towards the shore. Ships of 300 or
                    400 tons anchor about a mile and a half out; the river is navigable a couple of
                    miles inland for vessels of 30 or 40 tons, but the entrance is narrow, and
                    requires continual attention to keep it open.</p>
                <p>The exports from Batavia to the other islands of the archipelago, and to the
                    ports in the Malayan peninsula, are rice, sago, coffee, sugar, salt, oil,
                    tobacco, teak timber and planks, Java cloths, brass wares, &amp;c., and
                    European, Indian, and Chinese goods. The produce of the Eastern Islands is also
                    collected at its ports for re-exportation to India, China, and Europe,—namely,
                    gold-dust, diamonds, camphor, benzoin, and other drugs; edible bird-nests,
                    trepang, rattans, bees’ wax, tortoise-shell, and dyeing woods from Borneo and
                    Sumatra; tin from Banca; spices from the Moluccas; fine cloths from Celebes and
                    Bali; and pepper from Sumatra. From Bengal are imported opium, drugs, and
                    cloths; from China, teas, raw silk, silk piece-goods, varnished umbrellas,
                    coarse China wares, nankeen, paper, and innumerable smaller articles for the
                    Chinese settlers. British manufactures also are largely introduced. The number
                    of British ships that entered in 1870 was 103, with a tonnage of nearly 31,000
                    tons, the total number of vessels of all nationalities being 783, with a tonnage
                    of nearly 194,000.</p>
                <p>Almost the only manufactures of any importance are the distillation of arrack,
                    which is principally carried on by Chinese, the burning of lime and bricks, and
                    the baking of pottery; and even the brick-making is in a decaying condition. The
                    principal establishment for monetary transactions is the Java Bank, established
                    in 1828 with a capital of £500,000; but there are also agencies belonging to the
                    Bank of Rotterdam, and the Chartered Bank of India, Australia, aud China, as
                    well as a public savings bank.</p>
                <p>The Government has a naval establishment at the island of Onrust, about six miles
                    from the city; and among its other accommodations is a large iron floating dock
                    capable of holding vessels 400 feet long. Since 18G9, however, entrance has been
                    refused to merchant ships, which, consequently, feel the lack of proper docks in
                    the harbour. Proposals to build these and to extend the harbour, though
                    frequently under discussion, have had no result. Tramways were introduced into
                    the city in 1867, and are greatly patronized by the native population. A railway
                    to Buitenzorg, where the Government botanical gardens are situated, was opened
                    in 1871, the distance being about 40 miles inland.</p>
                <p>Batavia owes its origin to the Dutch general John Petersen Coen, who, in 1619,
                    took the town of Jacatra (which had been built on the ruins of the old Javanese
                    town of Sunda Calappa), destroyed it, and founded in its stead the present city,
                    which soon acquired a flourishing trade and increased in importance. The ruins
                    of Jacatra are to be found between Batavia and Anjol. In 1699 Batavia was
                    visited by a terrible earthquake, and the streams were choked by the mud from
                    the volcano of Gunong Salak (7244 feet high), by which the climate was so
                    affected that the city became notorious for its unhealthiness, and was in great
                    danger of being altogether abandoned. In the twenty-two years from 1730 to 1752,
                    1,100,000 deaths are said to have been recorded. General Daendals, who was
                    governor from 1808 to 1811, caused the ramparts of the town to be demolished,
                    and began to form the nucleus of a new city at Weltevreden. By 1816 nearly all
                    the Europeans had left the old town. In 1811 a British armament was sent against
                    the Dutch settlements in Java, which had been incorporated by France, and to
                    this force Batavia surrendered on the 8th of August. It was restored, however,
                    to the Dutch by the treaty of 1814.</p>

                <p>B ATES, WILLIAM, D. D., an eminent Nonconformist divi ne, born in November 1625.
                    He was admitted to Emmanuel College, Cambridge, and removed thence to King’s
                    College in 1644. He was one of the commissioners at the conference in the Savoy,
                    for reviewing the public liturgy, and was concerned in drawing up the exceptions
                    to the Book of Common Prayer. Notwithstanding this he was appointed chaplain to
                    Charles II. soon after the Restoration, and became minister of St Dunstan’s in
                    the West; but he was afterwards deprived of his benefice for nonconformity.
                    Bates was of an amiable character, and enjoyed the friendship of the Lord-Keeper
                    Bridgeman, the Lord-Chancellor Finch, the earl of Nottingham, and Archbishop
                    Tillotson. He published <hi rend="italic">Select Lives of Illustrious ancl Pious
                    Persons,</hi> in Latin; and after his death all his works, except his <hi
                    rend="italic">Select Lives,</hi> were printed in one vol. fol.; again in 1723;
                    and in 4 vols. 8vo, in 1815. He died in July 1699, in the 74th year of his
                    age.</p>
