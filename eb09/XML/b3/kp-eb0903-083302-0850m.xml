                    pulley or pulleys, by means of which weighty objects are hoisted or lowered with
                    facility. There is nothing in the appearance of a block which, to an unpractised
                    eye, would seem to require any stretch of mental ingenuity or of manual
                    dexterity to manufacture. It is a machine apparently so rude in its structure,
                    and so simple in its contrivance, that the name was probably given to it from
                    its general resemblance to a log ot wood, as is obviously the case with a
                    butcher’s block, a barber’s block, the block of the executioner, &amp;c. Of the
                    two constituent parts of a ship’s block, the external <hi rend="italic"
                    >shell</hi> and the internal <hi rend="italic">sheave,</hi> every carpenter
                    might make the one, and every turner the other; but still block-making is a
                    separate branch of trade, and it is necessary that it should be, for the whole
                    effici ency of the block depends upon the proper proportions being observed
                    between the various parts and the accuracy with which they are adjusted.</p>
                <p>Mr Walter Taylor of Southampton took out a patent in the year 1781, to secure the
                    benefit of some improvement he had made in the construction of the sheaves. He
                    also shaped the shells, cut the timber, &amp;c., by machinery driven by water,
                    and carried on so extensive a manufacture of blocks as to be able to contract
                    for nearly the whole supply of blocks and blockmakers’ wares required for the
                    use of the Royal Navy. Mr Dunsterville of Plymouth had a similar set of machines
                    wrought by horse-power. Both his blocks and Taylor’s were said to be superior to
                    those constructed by the hand, though still deficient in many respects.</p>
                <p>It would appear that it was the enormous quantity of blocks consumed in the
                    course of a long protracted war that first called the attention of the Admiralty
                    or Navy Board to the possibility of some reduction being made in the expense of
                    so important an article, and to the imprudence of depending entirely on a single
                    contractor. On these considerations, it seems to have been the intention of
                    Government to introduce, among other improvements in Portsmouth Dockyard about
                    1801, a set of machines for making blocks there. About this time, too, Mr Brunel
                    had completed a working model of certain machines for constructing, by an
                    improved method, the shells and sheaves of blocks. This model was submitted to
                    the inspection of the lords commissioners of the Admiralty, and it was decided
                    to adopt Mr Brunel’s more ingenious machinery.</p>
                <p>The advantages to be gained were those common to all cases in which machine work
                    supersedes hand labour, and consisted in the fact that, after the proper sizes
                    of each part had been determined by careful calculation and experience, the
                    machine could be made to observe these sizes with unerring accuracy, and so
                    avoid all variations due to the carelessness or ignorance of the workman; these
                    considerations are in blocks, perhaps more than in most things, of the utmost
                    importance. Another advantage was, that the blocks could be made by Brunei’s
                    machinery about 30 per cent, cheaper than hand-made blocks had been previously
                    obtained by contract, and the importance of this to the Admiralty in those days,
                    when all ships were so heavily rigged, having no steam to supplement their sail
                    power, will be sufficiently seen when it is stated that the remuneration which
                    Brunel was to receive for his invention was agreed to be the savings of one
                    year, and that these savings were estimated at £16,621; in addition to this he
                    received an allowance of a guinea a day for about six years while engaged on the
                    work, and was paid £1000 for his working model—the total amount paid to Brunel
                    for the invention amounting to about £20,000.</p>
                <p>The process may be described as follows :—Pieces of wood are cut roughly to the
                    size of the block, and the first operation is then performed by the <hi
                    rend="italic">boring-machine,</hi> which bores a hole for the pin, and one, two,
                    or three holes, as the case may be, for single, double, or treble blocks, to
                    receive the first stroke of the mortising chisel; the block is next taken to the
                    <hi rend="italic">mortising-machine,</hi> where the mortise or mortises for the
                    sheaves are cut; after this, to a <hi rend="italic">circular saw,</hi>
                    conveniently arranged for cutting off the corners and so preparing the block for
                    the <hi rend="italic">shaping-machine,</hi> which consists principally of two
                    equal and parallel circular wheels <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit03newyrich/page/n851/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0903-0851-0834"/> moving on the same axis, to which one of them is
                    firmly fixed, but on which the other is made to slide; so that these two wheels
                    may be placed at any given distance from each other, and blocks of any size
                    admitted between their two rims or peripheries. For this purpose, both rims are
                    divided into ten equal parts, for the reception of ten blocks, which are firmly
                    fixed between the two wheels. When the double wheel with its ten attached blocks
                    is put in motion, the outer surface of the blocks, or those which are farthest
                    from the centre, strike against the edge of a chisel or gouge fixed in a movable
                    frame, which, being made to slide in a curved direction in the line of the axis,
                    cuts those outward faces of the blocks to their proper curvature. A contrivance
                    is attached to the cutting tool which allows of the curvature being altered in
                    any required way. One side being shaped, the ten blocks are then, by a single
                    operation, each turned one fourth part round, and another side is exposed to the
                    cutting instrument moving in the same direction as before. A third side is then
                    turned outwards, and after that the fourth side, when the whole ten blocks are
                    completely shaped.</p>
                <p>The velocity with which the wheels revolve, and the great weight with which their
                    peripheries are loaded, would make it dangerous to the workmen or bystanders,
                    if, by the violence of the centrifugal force, auy of the blocks should happen to
                    be thrown off from the rim of the wheels; to prevent the possibility of such an
                    accident, an iron cage or guard is placed between the workman and the
                    machine.</p>
                <p>The last operation is performed by the <hi rend="italic">scoring-machine,</hi>
                    which cuts a groove to receive the binding or strapping of the block. The
                    binding may be of iron or rope, and is very frequently of wire rope.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">The Sheaves.—</hi> The machinery employed for making this part
                    of the block consists of a <hi rend="italic">circular saw,</hi> by which the log
                    is cut into plates of the thickness required for the sheaves, according to their
                    several diameters. These plates are next carried to a <hi rend="italic">crown
                    saw,</hi> which bores the central hole, and at the same time reduces them to a
                    perfect circle of the assigned diameter. The sheave, thus shaped, is next
                    brought to the <hi rend="italic">coahing-machine,</hi> a piece of mechanism not
                    inferior in ingenuity to the shaping machine for the shells. A small cutter, in
                    traversing round the central hole of the sheave, forms a groove for the
                    insertion of the <hi rend="italic">coak</hi> or <hi rend="italic">bush,</hi> the
                    shape of which is that of three semicircles, not concentric with each other, nor
                    with the sheave, but each having a centre equally distant from that of the
                    sheave. The manner in which the cutter traverses from the first to the second,
                    and from this to the third semicircle, after finishing each of them, is
                    exceedingly ingenious. So very exact and accurate is this groove cut for the
                    reception of the metal coak, and so uniform in their shape and size are the
                    latter cast, the casting being made not in sand but in iron moulds, that they
                    are invariably found to fit each other so nicely that the tap of a hammer is
                    sufficient to fix the coak in its place. The coaks are cast with small grooves
                    or channels in the inside of their tubes, which serve to retain the oil or
                    grease for the pins.</p>
                <p>The sheave, with its coak thus fitted in, is now taken to the <hi rend="italic"
                    >drilling-machine,</hi> which is kept in constant motion. In casting the coaks a
                    mark is left in the centre of each of the three semicircles. This mark is
                    applied by a boy to the point of the moving drill, which speedily goes through
                    the two coaks and the intermediate wood of the sheave. Rivets are put in these
                    holes and clenched by hand. The next operation is performed by the <hi
                    rend="italic">faxing-machine,</hi> which has two cutters, so arranged as to
                    finish the side and groove the edge simultaneously; then the hole for the pin is
                    enlarged to its exact size by the <hi rend="italic">broaching-machine.</hi> The
                    pins, which form a very important part of the block, are now made at Portsmouth,
                    not of <hi rend="italic">iron</hi> but of <hi rend="italic">steel,</hi>
                    carefully tempered by special appliances. They are turned by a <hi rend="italic"
                    >self-acting lathe,</hi> and are then reduced to the exact required diameter,
                    and polished in the <hi rend="italic">pin-polishing machine.</hi> They are also,
                    in this machine, subjected to a proof strain proportional to their sectional
                    area, and thus the strength of the pin is guaranteed.</p>
                <p>The blocks are invariably made of English elm, the grain of the wood running
                    lengthways of the block; but in Germany recently, blocks have been made with the
                    grain of the wood running across the block, the reason being that they are less
                    likely to be split by the pressure on the pin of the sheave. The sheaves are
                    made of lignum vitae.</p>
                <p>Three machines of each description for each operation, up to and including the
                    facing-machine, are required. The smallest sized machines will make blocks of
                    from 4 inches to 7 inches in length, the second size from 8 inches to 11 inches,
                    and the largest from 12 inches to 17 inches. Two sizes of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >broaching-machine,</hi> and one <hi rend="italic">pin-polishing machine,</hi>
                    are sufficient. Blocks larger than 17 inches are made by hand, 26 inches being
                    the largest used in the Royal Navy.</p>
                <p>As will be seen from the foregoing account, all machine-made blocks are cut out
                    of a solid piece of wood; whereas hand-made blocks, larger than about 8 inches,
                    are usually made in pieces, filled in at the ends and riveted together. It is
                    questionable whether a block so made is not stronger than one cut out of the
                    solid, as in the latter case the short-grained wood at the ends of the mortises
                    is very liable to give way. In hand-made blocks the brass coak or tail of the
                    sheave is not made of the peculiar shape described for machine-made blocks, but
                    is usually of a circular shape.</p>
                <p>The machinery for Portsmouth Dockyard, on Brunel’s plans, was made by Maudslay,
                    whose firm—now the very eminent firm of Maudslay Sons and Field—has since
                    supplied block-making machinery to the Spanish, Turkish, and Russian
                    Governments, and also to Chatham Dockyard; the last mentioned, however, has
                    never been used, as the machinery at Portsmouth is capable of supplying all the
                    dockyards, the demand for blocks being much less for the steamships and
                    ironclads than it was formerly for the old sailing ships. The first cost of this
                    machinery is so great that no private firm has yet ventured to set it up, and
                    the whole of the blocks used in merchant ships are made by hand-labour, assisted
                    by a lathe and two or three other simple mechanical contrivances. (τ. <hi
