                <p><label type="entry">BABYLONIA <hi rend="smallcaps">and</hi> ASSYRIA</label>.
                    Geographically, as well as ethnologically and historically, the whole district
                    enclosed between the two great rivers of Western Asia, the Tigris and Euphrates,
                    forms but one country. The writers of antiquity clearly recognised this fact,
                    speaking of the whole under the general name of Assyria, though Babylonia, as
                    will be seen, would have been a more accurate designation. It naturally falls
                    into two divisions, the northern being more or less mountainous, while the
                    southern is flat and marshy; and the near approach of the two rivers to one
                    another, at a spot where the undulating plateau of the north sinks suddenly into
                    the Babylonian alluvium, tends still more completely to separate them. In the
                    earliest times of which we have any record, the northern portion was
                    comprehended under the vague title of Gutium (the <hi rend="italic">Goyim</hi>
                    of Gen. xiv. 1), which stretched from the Euphrates on the west to the mountains
                    of Media on the east; but it was definitely marked off as Assyria after the rise
                    of that monarchy in the 16th century <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi>
                    Aram-Naharaim, or Mesopotamia, however, though claimed by the Assyrian kings,
                    and from time to time overrun by them, did not form an integral part of the
                    kingdom until the 9th century B,c., while the region on the left bank of the
                    Tigris, between that river and the Greater Zab, was not only included in
                    Assyria, but contained the chief capitals of the empire. In this respect the
                    monarchy of the Tigris resembled Chaldea, where some of the most important
                    cities were situated on the Arabian side of the Euphrates. The reason of this
                    preference for the eastern bank of the Tigris was due to its abundant supply of
                    water, whereas the great Mesopotamian plain on the western side had to depend
                    upon the streams which flowed into the Euphrates. This vast flat, the modern
                    El-Jezireh, is about 250 miles in length, interrupted only by a single limestone
                    range, rising abruptly out of the plain, and branching off from the Zagros
                    mountains under the names of <hi rend="italic">Sarazûr,</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Hamrin,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Sinjar.</hi> The numerous remains of old
                    habitations show how thickly this level tract must once have been peopled,
                    though now for the most part a wilderness. North of the plateau rises a
                    well-watered and undulating belt of country, into which run low ranges of
                    limestone hills, sometimes arid, sometimes covered with dwarf-oak, and often
                    shutting in, between their northern and north-eastern flank and the main
                    mountain-line from which they detach themselves, rich plains and fertile
                    valleys. Behind them tower the massive ridges of the Niphates and Zagros ranges,
                    where the Tigris and Euphrates take their rise, and which cut off Assyria from
                    Armenia and Kurdistan. The name Assyria itself originally denoted the small
                    territory immediately surrounding the primitive capital “the city of Asur” <hi
                    rend="italic">(al Asur,</hi> the Ellasar of Genesis), which was built, like the
                    other chief cities of the country, by Turanian tribes, in whose language the
                    word signified “water-meadow.” It stood on the right bank of the Tigris, midway
                    between the Greater and the Lesser Zab, and is represented by the modern <hi
                    rend="italic">Kalah Sherghat.</hi> It remained the capital long after the
                    Assyrians had become the dominant power in Western Asia, but was finally
                    supplanted by Calah <hi rend="italic">(Nimrud),</hi> Nineveh <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Nebi Yunus</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Kouyunjik),</hi> and Dur-Sargina <hi
                    rend="italic">(Khorsabad),</hi> some 60 miles further north. See <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Nineveh.</hi></p>
                <p>In contrast with the arid plateau of Mesopotamia, stretched the rich alluvial
                    plain of Chaldea, formed by the deposits of the two great rivers by which it was
                    enclosed. The soil was extremely fertile, and teemed with an industrious
                    population. Eastward rose the mountains of Elam, southward were the sea-marshes
                    and the ancient kingdom of Nituk or Dilvun (the modern Bender-Dilvun), while on
                    the west the civilisation of Babylonia encroached beyond the banks of the
                    Euphrates, upon the territory of the Semitic nomades (or Suti). Here stood Ur
                    (now <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit03newyrich/page/n199/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0903-0199-0184"/><hi rend="italic">Mugheir),</hi> the earliest
                    capital of the country; and Babylon, with its suburb, Borsippa <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Birs Nimrud),</hi> as well as the two Sipparas (the Sepharvaim of Scripture,
                    now <hi rend="italic">Mosaib),</hi> occupied both the Arabian and Chaldean side
                    of the river. (See <hi rend="smallcaps">Babylon.)</hi> The Araxes, or “River of
                    Babylon,” was conducted through a deep valley into the heart of Arabia,
                    irrigating the land through which it passed; and to the south of it lay the
                    great inland fresh-water sea of <hi rend="italic">Nedjef,</hi> surrounded by red
                    sandstone cliffs of considerable height, 40 miles in length and 35 in breadth in
                    the widest part. Above and below this sea, from Borsippa to Kufa, extend the
                    famous Chaldean marshes, where Alexander was nearly lost (Arrian, <hi
                    rend="italic">Exp. Al.,</hi> vii. 22.; Strab., xvi. 1, § 12,); but these depend
                    upon the state of the Hindiyah canal, disappearing altogether when it is closed.
                    Between the sea of <hi rend="italic">Nedjef</hi> and Ur, but on the left side of
                    the Euphrates, was Erech (now <hi rend="italic">Warka),</hi> which with Nipur or
                    Calneh (now <hi rend="italic">Niffer),</hi> Surippac <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Senkereh</hi><hi rend="italic">?),</hi> and Babylon (now <hi rend="italic"
                    >Hillah),</hi> formed the tetrapolis of Sumir or Shinar. This northwestern part
                    of Chaldea was also called Gan-duniyas or Gun-duni after the accession of the
                    Cassite dynasty. Southeastern Chaldea, on the other hand, was termed Accad,
                    though the name came also to be applied to the whole of Babylonia. The Caldai,
                    or Chaldeans, are first met with in the 9th century p.c. as a small tribe on the
                    Persian Gulf, whence they slowly moved northwards, until under Merodach-Baladan
                    they made themselves masters of Babylon, and henceforth formed so important an
                    element in the population of the country, as in later days to give their name to
                    the whole of it. In the inscriptions, however, Chaldea represents the marshes of
                    the sea-coast, and Teredon was one of their ports. The whole territory was
                    thickly studded with towns; but among ⅜11 this “vast number of great cities,” to
                    use the words of Herodotus, Cuthah, or Tiggaba (now <hi rend="italic"
                    >Ibrahim),</hi> Chilmad <hi rend="italic">(Kalwadah),</hi> Is <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Hit),</hi> and Dur-aba <hi rend="italic">(Akkerkuf)</hi> alone need be
                    mentioned, The cultivation of the country was regulated by canals, the three
                    chief of which carried off the waters of the Euphrates towards the Tigris above
                    Babylon,—the “Royal River,” or Ar-Malcha, entering the Tigris a little below
                    Baghdad, the Nahr-Malcha running across to the site of Seleucia, and the
                    Nahr-Kutha passing through Ibrahim. The Pallacopas, on the other side of the
                    Euphrates, supplied an immense lake in the neighbourhood of Borsippa. So great
                    was the fertility of the soil that, according to Herodotus (i. 193), grain
                    commonly returned two hundredfold to the sower, and occasionally three
                    hundredfold. Pliny, too <hi rend="italic">(H. N.,</hi> xviii. 17), says that
                    wheat was cut twice, and afterwards was good keep for sheep; and Berosus
                    remarked that wheat, barley, sesame, ochrys, palms, apples, and many kinds of
                    shelled fruit grew wild, as wheat still does in the neighbourhood of Anah. A
                    Persian poem celebrated the 360 uses of the palm (Strab., xvi. 1, 14), and
                    Ammianus Marcellinus (xxiv. 3) states that from the point reached by Julian’s
                    army to the shores of the Persian Gulf was one continuous forest of verdure.</p>
                <p>Such a country was well fitted to be one of the primeval seats of civilisation.
                    Where brick lay ready to hand, and climate and soil needed only settled life and
                    moderate labour to produce all that man required, it was natural that the great
                    civilising power of Western Asia should take its rise. The history of the origin
                    and development of this civilisation, interesting and important as it is, has
                    but recently been made known to us by the decipherment of the native monuments.
                    The scanty notices and conflicting statements of classical writers have been
                    replaced by the evidence of contemporaneous documents; and though the materials
                    are still but a tithe of w hat we may hope hereafter to obtain, we can sketch
                    the outlines of the history, the art, and the science of the powerful nations of
                    the Tigris and Euphrates. Before doing so, however, it would be well to say a
                    few words in regard to our classical sources of information, the only ones
                    hitherto available. The principal of these is Berosus, the Manetho of Babylonia,
                    who flourished at the time of Alexander’s conquests (though see Havet, <hi
                    rend="italic">Mémoire sur la</hi><hi rend="italic">Date</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >des Ecrits qui portent les noms de Bérose et de Manethon).</hi> He was priest
                    of Bel, and translated the records and astronomy of his nation into Greek. His
                    works have unfortunately perished, but the second and third hand quotations from
                    them, which we have in Eusebius and other writers, have been strikingly verified
                    by inscriptions so fax as regards their main facts. The story of the flood taken
                    from Berosus, for instance, is almost identical with the one preserved on the
                    cuneiform tablets. Numerical figures, however, as might be expected, are
                    untrustworthy. According to Berosus, ten kings reigned before the Deluge for 120
                    <hi rend="italic">saroi,</hi> or 432,000 years, beginning with Alorus of Babylon
                    and ending with Otiartes (Opartes) of Larankha, and his son Sisuthrus, the hero
                    of the flood. Then came eight dynasties, which are given as follows: —</p>

                <p>Next to Berosus, the authority of Herodotus ranke highest. His information,
                    however, is scanty, and he had to trust to the doubtful statements of <hi
                    rend="italic">ciceroni.</hi> Herodotus was controverted by Ctesias of Cnidus,
                    the physician of Artaxerxes Mnemon. But Ctesias mistook mythology for history,
                    and the Ninus and Semiramis, the Ninyas and Sardanapalus, of Greek romance were
                    in great measure his creations. We may yet construct an Assyrian epopee, like
                    the Shahnameh of Firdusi, out of his pages, but we must not look to them for
                    history. Other historical notices of Assyria and Babylonia, of more or less
                    questionable value, are to be gathered from Diodorus and one or two more
                    writers, but beyond Berosus and, to a limited extent, Herodotus, our only
                    ancient authority of much value upon this subject is the Old Testament.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Ethnology and History.—</hi> The primitive population of
                    Babylonia, the builders of its cities, the originators of its culture, and the
                    inventors of the cuneiform system of writing, or rather of the hieroglyphics out
                    of which it gradually developed, belonged to the Turanian or Ural-Altaic family.
                    Their language was highly agglutinative, approaching the modern Mongolian idioms
                    in the simplicity of its grammatical machinery, but otherwise more nearly
                    related to the Ugro-Bulgaric division of the Finnic group; and its speakers were
                    mentally in no w ay inferior to the Hungarians and Turks of the present day. The

                    or Shinar) in the north-west, and the Accad in the south-east, corresponding
                    most remarkably to the Suomi and Akkara-k, into which the Finnic race believed
                    itself to have been separated in its first mountain home. Like Suomi, Sumir
                    signified “ (the people) of the rivers,” and just as Finnic tradition makes Kemi
                    a district of the Suomi, so Came was another name of the Babylonian Sumir. The
                    Accadai, or Accad, were “the highlanders” who had descended from the mountainous
                    region of Elam on the east, and it was to them that the Assyrians ascribed the
                    origin of Chaldean civilisation and writing. They were, at all events, the
                    dominant people in Babylonia at the time to which our earliest contemporaneous
                    records reach back, although the Sumir, or “people of the home language,” as
                    they are sometimes termed, were named first in the royal titles out of respect
                    to their prior settlement in the country. A survey of the syllabary has led to
                    the conclusion that the first attempts at writing were made before the Accad had
                    descended into the plains and exchanged papyrus as a w riting material for clay;
                    other considerations, however, go to show that although the system of writing
                    may have been invented before they had entered Babylonia, it was not completed
                    until after they had done so. In harmony with this, we find Berosus ascribing
                    the culture of “the mixed population of Chaldea” to Oannes and other similar
                    creatures from the Persia^ Gulf. So far as we can judge, the civilisation of
                    Elam is at least coeval with that of Babylonia, and the capture of Babylon by
                    the Medes, with whom the historical dynasties of Berosus are commonly supposed
                    to begin, must be explained by an Elamite conquest. Media was the Accadian <hi
                    rend="italic">ΛIada,</hi> “the land" <hi rend="italic">par excellence;</hi> and
                    Accadian tradition looked back upon the mountainous district to the south-west
                    of the Caspian as the cradle of their race. Among these “mountains of the east,”
                    and in the land of Nisir (the furthermost division of Gutium beyond the Lesser
                    Zab), rose “the mountain of the world,” the Turanian Olympus, on which the ark
                    of the Chaldean Noah was believed to have rested. From this centre Turanian
                    tribes spread in all directions, meeting Alarodians on the north, and Semites on
                    the south-west. The Aryans had not yet penetrated across the great Sagartian
                    desert. The numerous tribes of Susiana, both civilised and uncivilised, spoke
                    languages more closely Ugrian than even that of the Accadians; the oldest towns
                    of Northern Syria, where the Semite afterwards reigned supreme, bore Accadian
                    names, and, as in the case of Haran, were mythologically connected with Babylon;
                    while the chief cities of Assyria were founded by Accadians, were denoted by
                    Accadian symbols, and were ruled by Accadian princes, in strict accordance with
                    the statement of Genesis that out of Babylonia “went forth Asshur.” An Elamite
                    conqueror of Chaldea, like Chedorlaomer (Gen. xiv. 1), imposed his authority not
                    only over Shinar, but over Assyria and Gutium as well. The earliest geographical
                    lists know only of Nuvva, or Elam, on the east, the Khani on the west, Martu,
                    the land of “the path of the setting sun,” Subarti, or Syria, with its four
                    races, and Gutium, which stretched across Mesopotamia from the Euphrates on the
                    one side to the mountains of Media on the other. To these must be added Anzan,
                    or southern Elam, with its capital Susa, Dilvun, or Nituk, on the Persian Gulf,
                    and, at a considerably later date, the Hittites, with their chief city
                    Carchemish.</p>
                <p>The first monarchs whose monumental records we possess had their seat at Ur, on
                    the right bank of the Euphrates. Ur, in Accadian, signified “the city” <hi
                    rend="italic">par excellence,</hi> and so bore testimony to the supremacy
                    claimed by its rulers over the rest of Babylonia. The great temple of the
                    Moon-god there was one of the oldest buildings in the country, and its erection
                    was due to a prince who claimed sovereignty over the whole of Babylonia, and
                    adorned Erech, Nipur, Larsa, and other cities with temples of vast size,
                    dedicated to the sun, to Istar, and to Bel. He seems to have been the first
                    great Babylonian builder; and this would imply that it was under him that Ur
                    rose to its prominent position, and united the numerous principalities of
                    Chaldea under one head. The enormous brick structures were cemented with bitumen
                    in the place of lime mortar; but the use of the buttress, of drains, and of
                    external ornamentation, shows that architectural knowledge was already advanced.
                    The cuneiform system of writing had attained its full development, signet stones
                    were carved with artistic skill, and the amount of human force at the disposal
                    of the monarch may be estimated from the fact that the Bowariyeh mound at Warka,
                    on the site of the temple of the Sun-god, is 200 feet square and 100 feet high,
                    so that above 30,000,000 bricks must have been employed upon its construction.
                    The vicinity of Ur to the Semitic tribes of Arabia implies that the Accadian
                    sovereigns had been turning their attention in that direction, and we find
                    nothing surprising therefore in the Scriptural account of Abraham’s migration
                    from this place, or the Phoenician tradition of the original home of the
                    Canaanitish race on the shores of the Persian Gulf (Strab., i. 2, 35, xvi. 3, 4,
                    27; Justin, xviii. 3, 2; Pliny, A <hi rend="superscript"> r</hi>. <hi
                    rend="italic">II.,</hi> iv. 36). Indeed, we have clear evidence that Semitic was
                    spoken in Ur itself at this remote epoch. Although the ruling caste were
                    Accadian, and generally wrote their inscriptions in that language, Dungi, one of
                    their earliest monarchs, in spite of his Turanian name, has left us a short
                    legend in Semitic; and it is more than probable that the imperial title of
                    “Sumir and Accad” was soon to be assumed to mark a linguistic as well as a
                    geographical distinction. The brick legends of the various viceroys who governed
                    the cities of Chaldea under this dynasty are all, however, in Accadian.</p>
                <p>The supremacy of Ur had been disputed by its more ancient rival Erech, but had
                    finally to give way before the rise of Nisin or Karrak, a city whose site is
                    uncertain, and Karrak in its turn was succeeded by Larsa. Elamite conquest seems
                    to have had something to do with these transferences of the seat of power. In
                    2280 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> —the date is fixed by an inscription of
                    Assur-bani-pal’s—Cudur-nankhundi, the Elamite, conquered Chaldea at a time when
                    princes with Semitic names appear to have been already reigning there, and
                    Cudur-mabug not only overran “the west,” or Palestine, but established a line of
                    monarchs in Babylonia. His son and successor took an Accadian name, and extended
                    his sway over the whole country. Twice did the Elamite tribe of Cassi or
                    Kossaeans furnish Chaldea with a succession of kings. At a very early period we
                    find one of these Kossaean dynasties claiming homage from Syria, Gutium, and
                    Northern Arabia, and rededicating the images of native Babylonian gods, which
                    had been carried away in war, with great splendour and expense. The other
                    Cassite dynasty was founded by Khammuragas, who established his capital at
                    Babylon, which henceforward continued to be the seat of empire in the south. The
                    dynasty is probably to be identified with that called Arabian by Berosus,<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>If so, the number of reigns
                    to be assigned to it, as well as its duration, will have to be corrected, as we

                    and it was during its domination that Semitic came gradually to supersede
                    Accadian as the language of the country. Khammuragas himself assumed a Semitic
                    name, and a Semitic inscription of his is now in the Louvre. A large number of
                    canals were constructed during his reign, more especially the famous
                    Nahr-Malcha, and an embankment built along the banks of the Tigris. The king’s
                    attention seems to have been turned to the subject of irrigation by a flood
                    which overwhelmed the important city of Mulhas. His <pb break="no"

                    and from this base of operations he succeeded in overthrowing Naram-Sin (or
                    Rim-Acuî) in the south, and making himself master of the whole of Chaldea.
                    Naram-Sin and a queen had been the last representatives of a dynasty which had
                    attained a high degree of glory both in arms and in literature. Naram-Sin and
                    his father Sargon had not only subdued the rival princes of Babylonia, but had
                    successfully invaded Syria, Palestine, and even, as it would seem, Egypt. At
                    Agane, a suburb of Sippara, Sargon had founded a library, especially famous for
                    its works on astrology and astronomy, copies of which were made in later times
                    for the libraries of Assyria. Indeed, so prominent a place did Sargon take iu
                    the early history of Babylonia, that his person became surrounded with an
                    atmosphere of myth. Not only was he regarded as a sort of eponymous hero of
                    literature, a Babylonian Solomon, whose title was “the deviser of law and
                    prosperity,” popular legends told of his mysterious birth, how, like Romulus and
                    Arthur, he knew no father, but was born in secrecy, and placed by his mother in
                    an ark of reeds and bitumen, and left to the care of the river; how, moreover,
                    this second Moses was carried by the stream to the dwelling of a ferryman, who
                    reared him as his own son, until at last the time came that his rank should bo
                    discovered, and Sargon, “the constituted king,” for such is the meaning of his
                    name, took his seat upon the throne of his ancestors. It was while the Cassite
                    sovereigns were reigning in the south, and probably in consequence of reverses
                    that they suffered at the hands of the Egyptians, who, under the monarchs of the
                    18th dynasty, were pushing eastward, that the kingdom of Assyτia took its rise.
                    Its princes soon began to treat with their southern neighbours on equal terms;
                    the boundaries of the two kingdoms were settled, and intermarriages between the
                    royal families took place, which led more than once to an interference on the
                    part of the Assyrians in the affairs of Babylonia. Finally, in the 14th century
                    <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.,</hi> Tiglath-A dar of Assyria captured Babylon, and
                    established a Semitic line of sovereigns there, which continued until the days
                    of the later Assyrian empire. From this time down to the destruction of Nineveh,
                    Assyria remained the leading power of Western Asia. Occasionally, it is true, a
                    king of Babylon succeeded in defeating his aggressive rival and invading
                    Assyria; but the contrary was more usually the case, and the Assyrians grew more
                    and more powerful at the expense of the weaker state, until at last Babylonia
                    was reduced to a mere apanage of Assyria.</p>
                <p>We possess an almost continuous list of Assyrian kings; and, as from the
                    beginning of the 9th century downwards there exists a native canon, in which
                    each year is dated by the <hi rend="italic">limmu</hi> or <hi rend="italic"
                    >archon eponymos</hi><hi rend="italic subscript"> i</hi> whose name it bears, as
                    well as a portion of a larger canon which records the chief events of each
                    eponymy, it is evident that our chronology of the later period of Assyrian
                    history is at once full and trustworthy. Similar chronological lists once
                    existed for the earlier period also, since an inscription of a king of the 14th
                    century <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> is dated by one of these eponymies; and
                    the precise dates given in the inscriptions for occurrences which took place in
                    the reigns of older monarchs cannot otherwise be accounted for. How far back an
                    accurate chronological record extended it is impossible to say; but astronomical
                    observations were made in Babylonia from a remote period, and the era of
                    Cudur-nankhundi was known, as we have seen, more than 1600 years afterward;
                    while in Assyria not only can Sennacherib state at Bavian that Tiglath-Pileser
                    I. was defeated by the Babylonians 418 years before his own invasion of that
                    country, but the same Tiglath-Pileser can fix 701 years as the exact interval
                    between his restoration of the temple of Anu and Rimmon at Kalah Sherghat and
                    its foundation by the dependent viceroys of the city of Assur.</p>
                <p>This Tiglath-Pileser, in spite of his subsequent defeat by the Babylonians, was
                    one of the most eminent of the sovereigns of the first Assyrian empire. He
                    carried his arms far and wide, subjugating the Moschians, Comagenians, Urumians,
                    and other tribes of the north, the Syrians and Hittites in the west, and the
                    Babylonians (including their capital) in the south. His empire, accordingly,
                    stretched from the Mediterranean on the one side to the Caspian and the Persian
                    Gulf on the other; but, founded as it was on conquest, and centralised in the
                    person of a single individual, it fell to pieces at the least touch. With the
                    death of Tiglath-Pileser, Assyria seems to have been reduced to comparative
                    powerlessness, and when next its claims to empire are realised, it is under
                    Assur-natsir-pal, whose reign lasted from 883 to 858 <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >b.c.</hi> The boundaries of his empire exceeded those of his predecessor, and
                    the splendid palaces, temples, and other buildings raised by him, with their
                    elaborate sculptures and rich painting, bear witness to a high development of
                    wealth and art and luxury. Calah, which had been founded by Shalmaneser I. some
                    four or five centuries previously, but had fallen into decay, became his
                    favourite residence, and was raised to the rank of a capital. His son
                    Shalmaneser had a long reign of 35 years, during which he largely extended,the
                    empire he had received from his father. Armenia and the Parthians paid him
                    tribute; and under the pretext of restoring the legitimate monarch he entered
                    Babylon, and reduced the country to a state of vassalage. It is at this time
                    that we first hear of the Caldai or Chaldeans,—carefully to be distinguished
                    from the <hi rend="italic">Casdim</hi> or Semitic “conquerors” of Scripture,—who
                    formed a small but independent principality on the sea-coast. In the west
                    Shalmaneser succeeded in defeating in 854 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> a
                    dangerous confederacy, headed by Rimmon-idri or Ben-hadad of Damascus and
                    including Ahab of Israel and several Phoenician kings. Later on in his reign he
                    again annihilated the forces of Hazael, Benhadad’s successor, and extorted
                    tribute from the princes of Palestine, among others from Jehu of Samaria, whose
                    servants are depicted on the black obelisk. The last few years of his life,
                    however, were troubled by the rebellion of his eldest son, which well-nigh
                    proved fatal to the old king. Assur, Arbela, and other places joined the
                    pretender, and the revolt was with difficulty put down by Shalmaneser’s second
                    son, Samas-Rimmon, who shortly after succeeded him. Samas-Rimmon (824-811) and
                    Rimmon-nirari (811-782) preserved the empire of Assyria undiminished; but their
                    principal exploits were in Babylonia, which they wasted with fire and sword, and
                    converted into an Assyrian province.</p>
                <p>The first Assyrian empire came to an end in 744, when the old dynasty was
                    overthrown by a usurper, Tiglath-Pileser, after a struggle of three or four
                    years. Once settled on the throne, however, Tiglath-Pileser proceeded to restore
                    and reorganise the empire. Babylonia was first attacked; the Assyrian monarch
                    offered sacrifices and set up his court in its chief cities; and the
                    multitudinous Arab tribes who encamped along the banks of the Euphrates were
                    reduced to subjection. The Caldai in the south alone held out, and to them
                    belonged the first four kings given in Ptolemy’s canon. Indeed, it may be said
                    that from the invasion of Tiglath-Pileser to the revolt of Nabopolassar,
                    Babylonia ceased to have any separate existence. It was governed by Assyrian
                    kings or the viceroys they appointed, and the only attempts to recover
                    independence were made under the leadership of the “Caldean” chiefs. It becomes
                    nothing more than an important province of Assyria.</p>
                <p>The second Assyrian empire differed from the first in its <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit03newyrich/page/n202/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0903-0202-0187"/> greater consolidation. The conquered provinces
                    were no longer loosely attached to the central power by the payment of tribute,
                    and ready to refuse it as soon as the Assyrian armies were out of sight; they
                    were changed into satrapies, each with its fixed taxes and military contingent.
                    Assyrian viceroys were nominated wherever possible, and a turbulent population
                    was deported to some distant locality. This wiÛ explain the condition in which
                    Babylonia found itself, as well as the special attention which was paid to the
                    countries on the Mediterranean coast. The possession of the barbarous and
                    half-deserted districts on the east was of little profit; the inhabitants were
                    hardy mountaineers, difficult to subdue, and without wealth; and although
                    Tiglath-Pileser penetrated into Sagartia, Ariana, and Aracosia, and even to the
                    confines of India, the expedition was little more than a display of power. The
                    rich and civilised regions of the west, on the contrary, offered attractions
                    which the politicians of Nineveh were keen to discover. Tiglath-Pileser
                    overthrew the ancient kingdoms of Damascus and Hamath, with its nineteen
                    districts, and after receiving tribute from Menahem (which a false reading in
                    the Old Testament ascribes to a non-existent Pul) in 740, placed his vassal
                    Hoshea on the throne of Samaria in 730 in the room of Pekah. Hamath had been
                    aided by Uzziah of Judah; and, on the overthrow of the Syrian city, Judah had to
                    become the tributary of Assyria. Tiglath-Pileser seems to have met with a
                    usurper’s fate, and to have fallen in a struggle with another claimant of the
                    throne, Shalmaneser. The chief event of Shalmaneser’s reign (727-722) was the
                    campaign against Samaria. The capture of that city, however, was reserved for
                    his successor, Sargon, in 720, who succeeded in founding a new dynasty. Sargon’s
                    reign of seventeen years forms an era in later Assyrian history. At the very
                    commencement of it he met and defeated the forces of Elam, and so prepared the
                    way for the future conquest of that once predominant monarchy. He came into
                    conflict, also, with the kingdoms of Ararat and Van in the north; and the policy
                    of the countries beyond the Zagros was henceforth influenced by the wishes of
                    the Assyrian court. But it was in the west that the power of Nineveh was chiefly
                    felt. Syria and Palestine were reduced to a condition of vassalage, Hamath was
                    depopulated, and Egypt, then governed by Ethiopian princes, first came into
                    collision with Assyria. The battle of Raphia in 719, in which the Egyptians and
                    their Philistine allies were defeated, was an omen of the future; and from this
                    time onward the destinies of civilised Asia were fought out between the two
                    great powers of the ancient world. As the one rose the other fell; and just as
                    the climax of Assyrian glory is marked by the complete subjugation of Egypt, so
                    the revolt of Egypt was the first signal of the decline of Assyria. The struggle
                    between the representative states of the East led, as was natural, to the
                    appearance of the Greek upon the stage of history. Sargon claims the conquest of
                    Cyprus as well as Phoenicia, and his effigy, found at Idalium, remains to this
                    day a witness of the fact. Babylonia, however, was the point of weakness in the
                    empire. It was too like, and yet too unlike, Assyria to be otherwise than a
                    dangerous dependency; and its inhabitants could never forget that they had once
                    been the •dominant nation. New blood had been infused into them by the arrival
                    of the Caldai, whose leader, Merodach-Baladan, the son of Yacin, called
                    Mardokempados in Ptolemy’s canon, had taken advantage of the troubles which
                    closed the life of Tiglath-Pileser to possess himself of Babylonia; and for
                    twelve years he continued master of the country, until in 710 Sargon drove him
                    from the province, and crowned himself king of Babylon. Merodach-Baladan had
                    foreseen the attack, and endeavoured to meet it by forming alliances with Egypt
                    and the principalities of Palestine. The confederacy, however, was broken up in
                    a single campaign by the Assyrian monarch; Judea was overrun, and Ashdod razed
                    to the ground. Sargon, who now styled himself king of Assyria and Babylon, of
                    Sumir and Accad, like Tiglath-Pileser before him, spent the latter part of his
                    reign in internal reforms and extensive building. A new town, called after his
                    name, was founded to the north of Nineveh (at the modern Kouyunjik), and a
                    magnificent palace was erected there. The library of Calah was restored and
                    enlarged, in imitation of his semi-mythical namesake of Agane, whose
                    astrological works were re-edited, while special attention was given to
                    legislation. In the midst of these labours Sargon was murdered, and his son,
                    Sennacherib, ascended the throne on the 12th of Ab 705 <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >b.c.</hi> Sennacherib is a typical representative of the great warriors and
                    builders of the second Assyrian empire, and is familiar to the readers of the
                    Old Testament from his invasion of Judah, which the native monuments assign to
                    the year 701. The check he received at Eltakeh, where he was met by the forces
                    of Egypt and Ethiopia, saved the Jewish king, not, however, before his towns had
                    been ravaged, a heavy tribute laid upon the capital, and his a∏ies in Ascalon
                    and Ekron severely punished. At the commencement of this campaign Sennacherib
                    had reduced Tyre and Sidon, and the overthrow of these centres of commerce
                    caused a transfer of trade to Carchemish. Babylonia had shaken off the yoke of
                    Assyria at the death of Sargon under Merodach-Baladan, who had escaped from his
                    captivity at Nineveh, but was soon reduced to obedience again, and placed under
                    the government of the Assyrian viceroy Belibus. In 700, however, the year after
                    the Judaean war, Babylon rebelled once more under the indomitable
                    Merodach-Baladan, and Suzub, another Chaldean. Sennacherib was occupied with a
                    naval war—the first ever engaged in by the Assyrians—against a body of Chaldeans
                    who had taken refuge in Susiana, and the revolt in his rear was stirred up by
                    the Susianian king. But the insurgents were totally defeated; Assur-nadin-sum,
                    Sennacherib’s eldest son, was appointed viceroy of the southern kingdom; and the
                    Assyrian monarch felt himself strong enough to carry the war into the heart of
                    Elam, wasting the country with fire and sword. A last attempt, made by the
                    Susianians and the Chaldeans of Babylonia, to oppose the power of Assyria was
                    shattered in the hardly-contested battle of Khaluli. The interregnum, however,
                    which marks the last eight years of Sennacherib’s rule in Ptolemy’s canon, shows
                    that Chaldea still continued to give trouble and resist the Assyrian yoke.</p>
                <p>Meanwhile Sennacherib had been constructing canals and aqueducts, embanking the
                    Tigris, and building himself a palace at Nineveh on a grander scale than had
                    ever been attempted before. His works were interrupted by his murder, in 681, by
                    his two sons, who, however, soon found themselves confronted by the veteran army
                    of Essar-haddon, their father’s younger and favourite son. Essar-haddon had been
                    engaged in Armenia; but in January 680 he defeated them at Khanirabbat, and was
                    proclaimed king. Soon afterwards he established his court at Babylon, where he
                    governed in person during the whole of his reign. After settling the affairs of
                    Chaldea his first campaign was directed against Syria, where Sidon was destroyed
                    and its inhabitants removed to Assyria, an event which exercised a profound
                    influence upon Asiatic trade. The most remarkable expedition of his reign was
                    into the heart of Arabia, to the kingdoms of Huz and Buz, 980 miles distant from
                    Nineveh, 280 miles of the march being through arid desert. The Assyrian army
                    accomplished a feat never since exceeded. In the north, also, it penetrated
                    equally far, subjugating the tribes of the Caucasus, receiving the submission of
                    Teispes the Cimmerian, and taking possession<pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit03newyrich/page/n203/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0903-0203-0188"/> of the copper-mines on the most remote frontiers
                    of Media. All this part of the country was now in the hands of Aryan settlers,
                    and each small town had its independent chief, like the states of Greece. In
                    fact, on two sides, on both north and west, the Assyrian empire was in contact
                    with an Aryan population, and among the twenty-two kings who sent materials for
                    Essar-haddon’s palace at Nineveh were Cyprian princes with Greek names. But the
                    most important work of Essar-haddon’s reign was the conquest of Egypt, which
                    left the ancient world under the rule of a single power for some twenty years,
                    and by fusing the nations of Western Asia together, broke down their
                    differences, spread an equalised civilisation, and first struck out the idea of
                    universal empire. In 672 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> the land of the Pharaohs
                    was invaded, Tirhakah, the Ethiopian, driven beyond its borders, and the country
                    divided into twenty governments. Vain efforts to shake off the Assyrian
                    supremacy were made from time to time; but just as Babylon had to look to the
                    foreign Caldai for the championship of its independence, so Egypt found its
                    leaders in Ethiopian princes. In 6G9 Essar-haddon fell ill, and on the 12th day
                    of Iyyar in the following year he associated his son, Assur-bani-pal, with him
                    in the kingdom. On his death at Babylon in 667, Assur-bani-pal was left sole
                    king. One of his first acts was to appoint his brother Savul-sum-yucin
                    (Sammughes) governor of Babylonia.</p>
                <p>Assur-bani-pal, the Sardanapalus of the Greeks, was the “grand monarque” of
                    ancient Assyria. The empire on his accession was at the height of its glory and
                    magnitude; the treasures and products of the world flowed into Nineveh, and its
                    name was feared from the frontiers of India to the shores of the Aegean.
                    Constant wars asserted the superiority of the Assyrian troops, though they
                    drained the empire of money and men; and the luxury, which had come in like a
                    flood, was sapping the foundations of the national strength. Assur-bani-pal, in
                    spite of his victories, his buildings, and his patronage of literature, left a
                    diminished inheritance to his son; and the military expeditions, formerly
                    conducted by the king in person, were now entrusted to his generals. His first
                    work was to check the southward advance of the Cimmerians, who were thus driven
                    upon Asia Minor, and to quell a revolt that had broken out in Egypt. Two
                    campaigns were requisite to effect this, and meanwhile Gyges of Lydia had sent
                    tribute to the formidable Assyrian monarch. War had also broken out with Elam,
                    which ended, after a long and hard struggle, with the complete conquest of the
                    country. It was divided into two states, each ruled by Assyrian vassals. But
                    soon after this (in 652) the first blow was struck which eventually led to the
                    downfall of the empire. A general insurrection suddenly took place, headed by
                    Assur-bani-pal·s own brother, the viceroy of Babylonia. Elam, Arabia, Egypt, and
                    Palestine made common cause against the oppressor. Egypt alone, however, under
                    the guidance of Psammitichus, and with the help of Gyges, succeeded in
                    recovering her independence; the wandering tribes of Northern Arabia, Kedar,
                    Zobah, Nabathaea, Ac., were chastised, and summary vengeance taken on Babylonia
                    and Elam. Babylon and Cuthah were reduced by famine (649), Sammughes was
                    captured and burnt to death, and fire and sword were carried through Elam. After
                    a protracted war, in which Assur-bani-pal was aided by internal dissensions,
                    Shushan was plundered and razed, and the whole of Susiana reduced to a
                    wilderness. This happened in 643.</p>
                <p>Assur-bani-pal’s buildings were unrivalled for size and grandeur. Assyrian
                    culture reached its culminating point in his reign, and his palaces glittered
                    with the precious metals, and were adorned with the richest sculpture. The
                    library which he formed at Nineveh far surpassed any that had ever existed
                    before; literary works were collected from all sides; the study of the dead
                    language of Accad was encouraged, grammars and dictionaries were compiled, and
                    learned men of all nations were attracted to the court. Patron of the arts as he
                    was, however, Assur-bani-pal’s character was stained by cruelty and sensuality.
                    Under his second name of Sin-inadina-pal, he appears as king of Babylon in
                    Ptolemy’s list; and the complete amalgamation of Assyria and Babylonia in the
                    later years of his rule is shown by the appearance of a prefect of Babylon among
                    the Assyrian eponyms. He was succeeded in 625 by his son Assur-ebil-ili. His
                    death was the signal for a general revolt. Nabopolassar, the viceroy of
                    Babylonia, made himself independent; and Assyria, shorn of its empire, was left
                    to struggle for bare existence, until, under Sara-cus its last monarch, Nineveh
                    was taken and burnt by the Babylonians and Medes.</p>
                <p>The seat of empire was now transferred to the southern kingdom. Nabopolassar was
                    followed in 604 by his son Nebuchadnezzar, whose long reign of forty-three years
                    made Babylon the mistress of the world. The whole East was overrun by the armies
                    of Chaldea, Egypt was invaded, and the city of the Euphrates left without a
                    rival. Until systematic explorations are carried on in Babylonia, however, our
                    knowledge of the history of Nebuchadnezzar’s empire must be confined to the
                    notices of ancient writers, although we possess numerous inscriptions which
                    record the restoration or construction of temples, palaces, and other public
                    buildings during its continuance. One of these bears out the boast of
                    Nebuchadnezzar, mentioned by Berosus, that he had built the wall of Babylon in
                    fifteen days. Evil-Merodach succeeded his father in 561, but he was murdered two
                    years after, and the crown seized by his brother-in-law, Nergal-sharezer, who
                    calls himself son of Bel-suma-iscun, “king of Babylon.” Nergal-sharezer reigned
                    four years, and was succeeded by his son, a mere boy, who was put to death after
                    nine months of sovereignty (555 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi>) The power now
                    passed from the house of Nabopolassar, Nabu-nahid, who was raised to the throne,
                    being of another family. Nebuchadnezzar’s empire already began to show signs of
                    decay, and a new enemy threatened it in the person of Cyrus the Persian. The
                    Lydian monarchy, which had extended its sway over Asia Minor and the Greek
                    islands, had some time before come into hostile collision with the Babylonians,
                    but the famous eclipse foretold by Thales had parted the combatants and brought
                    about peace. Croesus of Lydia and Nabu-nahid of Babylonia now formed an alliance
                    against the common foe, who had subjected Media to his rule, and preparations
                    were made for checking the Persian advance. The rashness of Croesus, however, in
                    meeting Cyrus before his allies had joined him, brought about his overthrow;
                    Sardis was taken, and the Persian leader occupied the next fourteen years in
                    consolidating his power in the north. This respite was employed by Nabu-nahid in
                    fortifying Babylon, and in constructing those wonderful walls and hydraulic
                    works which Herodotus ascribes to Queen Nitocris. At last, however, the attack
                    was made; and after spending a winter in draining the Gyndes, Cyrus appeared in
                    the neighbourhood of Babylon. Belshazzar, Nabu-nahid’s eldest son, as we learn
                    from an inscription, was left in charge of the city, while his father took the
                    field against the invader. But the Jews, who saw in the Persians monotheists and
                    deliverers, formed a considerable element of the population and army; and
                    Nabu-nahid found himself defeated and compelled to take refuge in Borsippa. By
                    diverting the channel of the Euphrates the Persians contrived to march along the
                    dry river-bed, and enter the city through an unguarded gate. Babylon was taken,
                    and Nabu-nahid shortly afterwards submitted to the conqueror, receiving in
                    return pardon and a residence in <pb break="no"

                    Cyrus’s reign; at all events, when Babylon tried to recover its independence
                    during the troubles that followed the death of Cambyses, it was under impostors
                    who claimed to be “Nebuchadnezzar, the son of Nabu-nahid.”</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Art, Science, and Literature.—</hi> Although in art, as in
                    other things, Assyria was but the pupil and imitator of Babylonia, there was yet
                    a marked différence between its development in the two countries, due partly to
                    natural causes. While the Assyrians had stone in abundance, the Babylonians were
                    obliged to import it from a distance. Brick-clay, on the contrary, lay ready at
                    hand, and architecture among them, consequently, took the forms imposed upon it
                    by the use of bricks instead of stone. Where the Assyrians employed sculptured
                    alabaster to ornament their buildings, the Babylonians contented themselves with
                    enamelled bricks and painted plaster. It is a curious proof of the servile
                    dependence of the northern upon the southern kingdom in artistic matters, that
                    the Assyrians continued to make large use of brick up to the downfall of the
                    empire, in spite of the accessibility of stone and the rapid decay of their
                    palaces caused by the employment of the more fragile material. Still, although
                    Assyrian art clung thus unaccountably to the building materials of another
                    country, it did not dispense with its native stone altogether; and speaking
                    broadly, we may say that the architecture of Nineveh is characterised by the use
                    of stone in contradistinction to the brickwork of Babylonia. Sculpture was
                    naturally developed by the one, just as painting was by the other; and the
                    ornamentation which could be lavished on the exterior in Assyria had to be
                    confined to the interior in Chaldea.</p>
                <p>Another distinction between the art of the two monarchies arose from the
                    character of their respective populations. Babylonia was essentially a religious
                    country, and its art, therefore, was primarily religious. Nearly all the great
                    edifices, whose ruins still attract the traveller, were temples, and the
                    inscriptions we possess of the Babylonian princes relate almost wholly to the
                    worship of the gods. In Assyria, on the other hand, the temple was but an
                    appendage of the palace, the king among “these Romans of Asia,” as Prof.
                    Rawlinson calls them, being the central object of reverence. While the Chaldean
                    temple, with its huge masses of brickwork, rose stage upon stage, each tier
                    smaller than the lower, differently coloured, and surmounted at the top by a
                    chamber which served at once as a shrine and an observatory, the Assyrian palace
                    was erected upon a mound of rubble, with open courts and imposing entrances,
                    though never more than one or two stories high.</p>
                <p>Closely connected with this difference in the religious feelings of the two
                    nations was the greater care and attention paid to burial in Babylonia. As yet
                    not a single tomb has been found in Assyria, while sepulchral remains abound in
                    Chaldea. The vast necropolis of Erech astonishes us by the number of its graves,
                    and the potters of Babylonia were largely employed in making clay coffins. The
                    character of Assyrian art being thus secular, and that of Babylonia sacred and
                    sepulchral, necessarily led to a different application and development of it in
                    the two countries.</p>
                <p>We must regard Assyrian art as parallel with later Babylonian, both having
                    branched off from Accadian. In Assyrian we may trace two or even three periods
                    of development; but our want of materials makes it impossible to do this in the
                    case of later Babylonian. Among neither people, however, did art altogether
                    escape from the swathing-bands of its nursery, although it was never
                    crystallised as in ancient Egypt. The oldest monuments of Accad already display
                    it in all its forms, rude and rudimentary though they may be. The terraced
                    temples of Ur, Erech, and other places, mount back to the earliest times of
                    Chaldean history, and we find them already adorned with enamelled bricks, which
                    were first coloured, then glazed, and finally baked in the fire. Terra-cotta
                    cones of various hues, imbedded in plaster, were used for external
                    ornamentation, and at Warka (Erech) coloured half-columns are employed for the
                    same purpose,—an ornamentation which recurs in Sargon’s palace at Khorsabad, and
                    was the germ of the many kinds of pillars met with in Assyria. The internal
                    walls of the shrine were bright with paint and bronze and gilding; but the
                    brilliant colouring of the Chaldeans was not reproduced in the northern monarchy
                    where more sombre tints were preferred. The huge structures themselves, of burnt
                    and unburnt brick, were supported by buttresses, and the rain was carried off by
                    elaborately-constructed drains, some of which afford us the earliest examples of
                    the arch. A leaden pipe for the same object was found by Mr Loftus at Mugheir
                    (Ur).</p>
                <p>Stone, on account of its scarcity, was highly prized, and used only for sculpture
                    and carving. Fragments of the statue of an Accadian king have been brought from
                    Hammâm, and a portrait of Merodach-iddin-akhi, the successful opponent of
                    Tiglath-Pileser I. (1120 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi>), is cut in low relief
                    on a stone now in the British Museum. Like all other Babylonian stone relics,
                    they are of small size, and of hard black granite, and the royal portrait is
                    interesting not only as being one of the few specimens we possess of Babylonian
                    sculpture, but as showing the marked contrast of the Babylonian face to the
                    typically Jewish features of the Assyrians. If larger stones were rare, however,
                    the same cannot be said of smaller ones, which were used as signets and
                    talismans. These were always incised, and though the figures are frequently
                    rude, and still more often grotesque, they are always clearly cut and vigorous.
                    Indeed, it is clear that emery must have been used for the purpose, while many
                    of the carvings are so minute as to suggest the employment of a
                    magnifying-glass. This, however, seems to be out of the question at so early a
                    date as that to which many of the gems belong, although a crystal lens was
                    discovered by Mr Layard at Nimnid, The design on the signet-cylinder of the
                    earliest king of Ur of whom we have any knowledge is of a high order of
                    merit.</p>
                <p>Next to gem-cutting, pottery was carried to considerable perfection by the
                    Accadians. Some of their vases and lamps exhibit great beauty of form, and bear
                    evidence of the potter’s wheel; though the large majority are made by the hand,
                    and extremely rude. Spirited bas-reliefs in terra-cotta, however, have been
                    exhumed at Senkereh, and some small terra-cotta figures may also be assigned to
                    this early period. Metallurgy was more backward. Stone implements were still in
                    use, although weapons and ornaments of bronze and copper are met with in
                    abundance; and even iron was not unknown. Bronze bowls occur in almost every
                    tomb, sometimes wrought with considerable skill· Metallurgic art, however,
                    attained its highest point in the manufacture of gold objects like ear-rings and
                    fillets. The latter may be compared with the gold head-dresses found by Dr
                    Schliemann in the Troad. This backward state of metallurgy is somewhat
                    remarkable when we consider the skill displayed in the making of textile
                    fabrics. The oldest gems portray the most richly embroidered robes, and it is
                    probable that the muslins and carpets for which Babylonia was afterwards so
                    famous were already a branch of industry.</p>
                <p>Art in Assyria developed chiefly, as has been said, on the side of architecture
                    and sculpture. Its first period is best represented by the reign of
                    Assur-nats·ir-pal, in whose palaces we obtain excellent illustrations of its
                    excellencies and defects. The period is characterised by a simplicity and vigour
                    which shows itself in the bas-reliefs, where the <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit03newyrich/page/n205/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0903-0205-0190"/> figures, more especially the animal forms, are
                    spirited and natural beyond anything that we meet with at a later time. Nothing,
                    for instance, can be bolder and more lifelike than the lion-hunt depicted on the
                    slabs of Assur-natsir-pal. There is a freedom in the attitude of the animals
                    which evidences a remarkable grandeur of conception. On the other hand, the
                    execution is somewhat heavy, the perspective is worse even than in later works,
                    and the outlines are reproduced with too servile an exactitude. A background,
                    again, is entirely wanting, the attention of the artist being concentrated upon
                    the principal group. In the second period, which extends from the beginning of
                    the second empire to the reign of Essar-haddon, the freshness and boldness of
                    the preceding stage have passed away. The care once exclusively bestowed upon
                    the chief figures is now shared with an elaborate background, and a
                    pre-Raffaellite minuteness prevails throughout the whole. This, added to a total
                    want of perspective, causes too obtrusive a realism. Still, what is lost in
                    vigour is gained in delicacy and finish, and the general effect of such rich and
                    intricate grouping could not but have been effective. The reign of
                    Assur-bani-pal marks the third and last period of Assyrian art. Drawing has made
                    a rapid advance, and the sculptures furnish several instances of successful
                    foreshortening. The art of this period is distinguished by great softness and
                    chasteness; vegetable forms are represented with admirable skill, and the
                    overcrowding of the preceding stage is avoided by recurring to the plain
                    backgrounds of the first period, or introducing merely the main outlines of a
                    landscape. At the same time, it is clear that Assyrian art is beginning to
                    decline; the freedom and boldness that once marked it tend to disappear, and it
                    is pervaded by a spirit of effeminacy which is well exemplified by the subjects
                    portrayed. For the first time scenes are taken from the harem; the king lies,
                    with his wife seated beside him, banqueting under the shade of the vine; and the
                    lions that Assur-natsir-pal hunted in the open field at the risk of life are now
                    tame creatures, kept in cages, and let out for a royal <hi rend="italic"

                <p>The effect of this Assyrian bas-relief sculpture was heightened by judicious
                    colouring. Red, blue, black, and white—none of them, however, of very great
                    brilliancy —were laid upon certain parts of the picture, such as the eyes, hair,
                    and fringes of the garments. This partial colouring was also adopted by the
                    Greeks, and it is extremely probable that they borrowed it from Assyria. The
                    beginning of Greek art coincides with the decadence of Assyrian; and the objects
                    found by Μ. Cesnola and others in Cyprus show us the transition of the one into
                    the other. While the remains found by Dr Schliemann in the Troad do not exhibit
                    any Assyτian influence, the oldest works of art in Greece itself are thoroughly
                    Assyrian in character. Indeed, we can trace the lion-sculpture at Mycenae
                    through the similar rock-carving at Kumbet, in Phrygia, back to the artists of
                    Nineveh. The lions themselves are Assyrian in all their details, and the pillar
                    against which they rest reappears in the monuments of Assur-bani-pal. Columnar
                    architecture, in fact, obtained a more extensive development in the empire of
                    the Tigris than has ever been the case elsewhere. The half columns of ancient
                    Chaldea germinated into a wonderful variety of elaborate forms. The most
                    peculiar are those which rest with circular pedestals upon the backs of lions,
                    dogs, and winged bulls. The chasteness of Hellenic taste preserved it from this
                    Eastern fantasticness, but the Doric and Ionic pillars had their first home on
                    the banks of the Tigris. There was something in the round firm column which was
                    congenial to the mind of the Assyrian.</p>
                <p>Indeed, it may be said that solidity and realism underlie all Assyrian art.
                    Muscular strength and power of an intensely earthly and human nature is
                    expressed in their bas-reliefs and the colossal bulls that guarded the palace
                    from the entrance of evil spirits. Nowhere else in the world can we find such an
                    embodiment of brute force and unimaginative energy. Not only is Assyrian art
                    valuable as disclosing the genesis of Hellenic, but yet more so aβ filling up a
                    vacant chapter in the history of aesthetics. The divine calm and mysterious
                    immensity of Egyptian sculpture was not more foreign to the Greek than the stiff
                    unspirituality and coarse vigour of the Assyrians, which found in the lion an
                    appropriate symbol. But the Assyrian artists did not confine themselves to
                    architecture and basreliefs. Gem-cutting was carried to high perfection, and
                    even sitting statues of “the great king” were attempted. These, however, were
                    not so successful as the terra-cotta models, some of which are of great beauty.
                    Indeed, the potters’ work of Nineveh can quite vie with that of ancient Greece,
                    and their lamps seem to be prototypes of those which we find in the tombs of
                    Athens or Syracuse. Besides porcelain, glass was also manufactured, and though
                    transparent glase does not appear to have been known before the reign of Sargon,
                    coloured glass, with all the tints that we admire in Venetian ware, had long
                    been an article of trade. Metallurgy, again, was a branch of industry in which
                    the Assyrians particularly excelled. Their gold ear-rings and bracelets are
                    admirable both in design and workmanship; their bronze casts are free from the
                    narrowness of their sculptures in stone; and so well were they acquainted with
                    the art of inlaying one metal with another, that our modern artists have been
                    content to learn from them the method of covering iron with bronze. Household
                    furniture, too, gives us a high idea of Assyrian skill. Like gem-cutting, it
                    brought out the Chinese minuteness and accuracy of the people, and the profuse,
                    though tasteful ornamentation of the seats is especially to be noticed.</p>
                <p>It is unfortunate that our knowledge of the development of art in the sister
                    kingdom is still so imperfect. As has been said, however, it is characterised by
                    painting rather than sculpture, and the use of brick instead of stone. The few
                    bas-reliefs that exist are small and inferior in execution; but brilliant
                    colouring and a.lavish use of the metals made up for this want. The walls were
                    covered with the most costly materials, and “images portrayed with vermilion”
                    excited the admiration of the stranger. The love of bright colours, in contrast
                    with the sober hues of the Assyrian palaces, led also to the cultivation of
                    gardens, and the hanging gardens of Babylon, raised upon tiers of arches, were
                    one of the wonders of the world. The Babylonian had, too, a strong sense of
                    humour. In the engraved gems and metal-work of the southern empire, we miss the
                    finish and minute care of the sister-kingdom, but they are replaced by a spirit
                    of grotesqueness and serio-comedy. In pottery and the manufacture of textile
                    fabrics the Babylonians particularly excelled; their carpets and variegated
                    dresses were highly prized, while their fondness for music was much celebrated.
                    The history of the latter art, however, both in Babylonia and in Assyria, has
                    yet to be traced.</p>
                <p>The science of Assyria, like most things else, was derived from Accad. A large
                    number of its technical terms were borrowed from the Turanian, and continued to
                    the last an enduring monument of the debt owed by the Semite to his predecessor.
                    At the same time, he did not remain a mere imitator; science received a
                    development in his hands which might have been looked for in vain from a
                    Turanian race. First and foremost comes the astronomy, for which Babylonia was
                    so famous in the ancient world. Its beginning goes back to the time when the
                    Accadai had not yet descended from their mountain fastnesses. The zenith was <pb
                    break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit03newyrich/page/n206/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0903-0206-0191"/> fixed above Elam, and not above Babylonia, and
                    “the mountain of the East,” the primitive home of the race, was εupposed to
                    support the firmament. The shrines on the topmost terraces of the temples were
                    used also as observatories. Ur had its royal observatory, and so probably had
                    the other cities of Chaldea; in Assyria they existed at Assur, Nineveh, and
                    Arbela, and the astronomers-royal had to send in their reports to the king twice
                    a month. At an early date the stars were numbered and named; but the most
                    important astronomical work of the Accadians was the formation of a calendar.
                    This came after the division of the heavens into degrees, since the twelve
                    months (of 30 days each) were named after the zodiacal signs, and would seem to
                    belong to about 2200 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> Somewhat strangely, the
                    Accadian calendar appears to have passed to the Assyrians (and through them to
                    the Jews) through the medium of the Aramaeans. The year being roughly made to
                    consist of 360 days, intercalary months had to be added, one of them being
                    regularly inserted every six years, and two others being counted in by the
                    priests when necessary. The <hi rend="italic">soss</hi> of 60 years, the <hi
                    rend="italic">ner</hi> of 600, and the <hi rend="italic">saτ</hi> of 3600, were
                    merely cycles dependent upon the general mathematical system of the Babylonians,
                    which made 60 the unit, and then multiplied it by the factors of itself. The
                    week of 7 days was in use from an early period; indeed, the names which we still
                    give to the days can be traced to ancient Babylonia; and the seventh day was one
                    of <hi rend="italic">sul·um</hi> or “rest.” The night was divided into three
                    watches; but this was afterwards superseded by the more accurate division of the
                    day into 12 <hi rend="italic">casbu</hi> (of 2 hours each), corresponding to the
                    divisions of the equator, each <hi rend="italic">casbu</hi> being further
                    subdivided into 60 minutes, and these again into 60 seconds. The sections of the
                    equator contained 30 degrees each—a degree being 60 sosses or minutes; but since
                    an astrolabe, now in the Museum, divides each of the 12 sections in the outer
                    circle into 20 degrees, and those in the inner circle into 10 degrees, it is
                    plain that a different system was adopted for astrological purposes. Eclipses
                    were carefully recorded from a very remote epoch, and since some of these are
                    said to have happened “according to calculation,” and others “contrary to
                    calculation,” their recurrence after a cycle of eighteen years must have been
                    roughly determined. One of the Assyrian reports states that a watch was kept for
                    an eclipse of the sun on the three last days of the month, but that, contrary to
                    expectation, the eclipse did not take place, and we possess notices of eclipses
                    which have been verified by modern astronomers, though antecedent to the era of
                    Nabonassar, with whom, so far as Ptolemy knew, the first record of them began.
                    The chief work on astronomy was one compiled for the library of Sargon of Agane
                    in seventy tablets or books, which went through many editions, one of the latest
                    being now in the British Museum. It was called “the illumination of Bel,” and
                    was translated into Greek by Berosus. The catalogue of its contents includes
                    observations on comets, on the pole-star, the conjunction of the sun and moon,
                    and the motions of Venus and Mars. The main purpose, however, of all these
                    Babylonian astronomical observations was an astrological one; to cast a
                    horoscope, or predict the weather, was the chief business of the Chaldean
                    astronomer. Indeed, the patient minuteness of the meteorological observations is
                    most curious, and it was believed that the same weather recurred after a
                    definite number of years. In the later Assyrian period the study became more
                    scientific, and the observatory reports have something of the precision of
                    modern times. But from a much earlier era we obtain interesting tables of lunar
                    longitudes and numerical equivalents of the daily increase and decrease of the
                    moon. As is implied by the attention given to astronomy, mathematics was fairly
                    advanced. The unit was 60, a very convenient number, especially when used as the
                    denominator of a fraction. A tablet found at Senkereh gives a table of squares
                    and cubes, correctly calculated, from 1 to 60; and a people who were acquainted
                    with the sun-dial, the clepsydra, the lever, and the pulley, must have had no
                    mean knowledge of mechanics. The lens, too, discovered at Nineveh, explains the
                    minuteness of the cuneiform writing on so many of the tablets, and suggests the
                    possibility of artificial aids to the observation of the heavens.</p>
                <p>Assyria possessed but little native literature. It was essentially a land of
                    soldiers, and the more peaceful pursuits had their home in Babylonia, where the
                    universities of Erech and Borsippa were renowned down to classical times. It was
                    not until the reign of Assur-bani-pal that any attempt was made to rival Babylon
                    in learning; then for the first time original compositions came from the pens of
                    Assyrian scholars, and works were even written in the dead language of Accad.
                    Syllabaries, together with grammars, dictionaries, and reading-books of Assyrian
                    and Accadian, were drawn up, besides lists of Semitic synonyms. In these
                    grammars and vocabularies lay the germ of ' comparative philology, and they are
                    otherwise valuable as affording us the earliest native analysis of Semitic
                    speech. But before this closing period of the empire, the Assyrians had been
                    chiefly content to translate the ancient Accadian literature, or re-edit the
                    contents of Babylonian libraries; and the cramping influence of a dead language,
                    in which all the precedents of law and the first principles of science were
                    locked up, could not but make itself felt. Every great city of Chaldea had at
                    least one libraιy, and it was in imitation of this that the royal libraries at
                    Calah, Nineveh, Assur, and elsewhere, were founded. The larger part of the
                    literature was in clay, stamped in minute characters upon baked bricks, <hi
                    rend="italic">laterculoe</hi><hi rend="italic">coctiles</hi> as Pliny calls
                    them; but papyrus was also used, though none of this fragile material has been
                    preserved to our day. In fact, the use of papyrus seems to have preceded that of
                    clay, which was not employed until after the settlement of the Accadians in the
                    plains. The clay tablets or books were arranged in order; and we learn from the
                    catalogue of Sargon’s library at Agane (about 2000 <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >b.c.</hi>) that each was numbered, so that the student had only to write down
                    the number of the tablet he wanted and the librarian thereupon handed it to him.
                    The subjects of Accadian literary composition were multifarious. Among the most
                    interesting are the hymns to the gods, some of which strikingly resemble the
                    Hebrew psalms in substance as well as in form. Indeed, the parallelism of Hebrew
                    and Assyrian poetry seems to have been borrowed from the Accadians. But the
                    similarity of expression and feeling is no less remarkable. Thus we read in
                    one—(1.) “May god, my creator: take mine hands. (2.) Guide thou the breath of my
                    mouth: guide thou mine hands; (3.) Olord of light!” and in another—(1.) “In
                    heaven who is high? Thou alone, thou art high. (2.) In earth who is high? Thou
                    alone, thou art high. (3.) As for thee, thy word in heaven is declared: the gods
                    bow their faces to the ground. (4.) As for thee, thy word in earth is declared:
                    the spirits of earth kiss the ground;” or in a third—(1.) “O Lord, my
                    transgressions are many: great are my sins. (2.) The Lord in the anger of His
                    heart: has confounded me. (3.) God in the strength of His heart: set himself
                    against me.” A collection was afterwards made of these hymns, which was used for
                    ritualistic purposes, and regarded as an inspired volume, and has been aptly
                    compared by Μ. Lenormant with the Big-Veda of the Hindus. Of an older date is
                    the collection of magic formulae and charms, chiefly intended to counteract the
                    effects of sorcery and demoniac possession, which go back to the Shamanistic
                    period of Accadian religion. Later than the hymns, but still prior to the second
                    millennium <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> and <pb break="no"

                    mythological poems which grew out of the development of a solar worship and the
                    personification of the attributes of the gods. Two of these poems we possess
                    intact,—on the Deluge and the descent of Istar into Hades,—and part of a third
                    which describes the war of the seven evil spirits against the moon. The first
                    two form the sixth and eleventh books of a very remarkable epic which centred
                    round the adventures of a solar hero, older and originally independent lays
                    being woven into it as episodes. The epic was divided into twelve books, each
                    book dealing with a legend appropriate to the name of the corresponding zodiacal
                    sign. This astronomical basis of the national epic shows how thoroughly the
                    study had penetrated the mind of the people; and the clearness with which we can
                    trace the growth and formation of the whole work throws great light on the
                    history of epic literature generally, and adds one more confirmation to the
                    theory of ^VVolf. The Assyrians also had their epic, in imitation of the
                    Accadians, and Μ. Lenormant has pointed out that the Semiramis andNannarus of
                    the Greeks and the other personages of Ctesias were really figures of this
                    mythical epopee. The historical and chronological works that have been preserved
                    are of purely Assyrian origin, though there is every reason to suppose that when
                    the libraries of Accad come to be excavated similar compositions will be found
                    in them. The legal literature of the Accadians was certainly very extensive, and
                    a collection of fables, one a dialogue between the ox and the horse, and another
                    between the eagle and the sun, has been met with.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Language, Law, and Trade.</hi> —As above stated, the language
                    of the primitive Sumirian and Accadian population of Assyria and Babylonia
                    belonged to the Turanian or Ural-Altaic family of speech. The Semitic tribes,
                    who first possessed themselves of the tetrapolis of Sumir or Shinar, and then
                    gradually spread over the whole of Assyria and Babylonia, borrowed many words
                    from their more civilised predecessors, and lent them a few others in return.
                    The so-called Assyrian language is sub-divided into the two dialects of Assyria
                    and Babylonia, the latter dialect being characterised by a preference for the
                    softer sounds, and a fuller use of the vowels. Literature and the influence of a
                    dead language stereotyped it to such an extent that it underwent comparatively
                    little change during the 1500 years during which we can watch its career; at
                    least this is the case with the literary dialect. The closest affinities are
                    with Hebrew and Phoenician; it shares their peculiarities in phonology, grammar,
                    and vocabulary; and some obscure points in Hebrew etymology have already been
                    cleared up by its help. Next to Hebrew, it shows perhaps the greatest
                    resemblance to Arabic; differing most widely, on the other hand, from Aramaic.
                    Aramaic, however, from becoming the <hi rend="italic">lingua franca</hi> of
                    trade and diplomacy after the fall of Tyre and Sidon, ended (like Arabic in
                    later times) in superseding its sister idioms; but in Babylonia this did not
                    happen until after the Persian conquest.</p>
                <p>A large number of the legal precedents of an Assyrian judge, like the titles upon
                    which he had to decide, went back to the Accadian epoch. A table of early
                    Accadian laws shows us that the mother occupied the same prominent place as
                    among modern Turanian tribes. The son is punished with a fine for denying his
                    father, but with banishment for denying his mother. On the other hand, the
                    husband can divorce the wife upon payment of a pecuniary compensation, while the
                    wife who repudiates her husband is condemned to be drowned. The life and person
                    of the slave are already under the protection of the state, the master who
                    misuses him being subject to a fine, while the slave could purchase his freedom.
                    The rights of property, however, were strictly guarded by the law; the maximum
                    of interest seems also to have been defined; and houses, land, or slaves could
                    be taken as security for a debt. The carefulness with which deeds were signed
                    and attested, and adjudicated cases reported, the deeds and cases being
                    afterwards enclosed in an envelope of clay on which the names and main points
                    were inscribed, testifies to a wide-spread study of law. Witnesses and
                    contracting parties generally affixed their seals; but where they were too poor
                    to possess any, a nail-mark was considered sufficient. In the Accadian period a
                    father could assign property to his son during his lifetime, though he could not
                    put him in possession; and in later times a limited power of willing was in
                    existence. The private will of Sennacherib, in which he bequeaths certain
                    treasures to his favourite son Essar-haddon, is one of the most curious
                    documents of antiquity; unlike other persons, the monarch does not require any
                    witnesses. Great activity of trade is evidenced by this development of law. But
                    here again we must note a distinction due to situation between the northern and
                    southern kingdoms. Of the Chaldeans, it is emphatically said that “their cry was
                    in their ships,” and we have many indications of early commerce with the
                    southern coast of Arabia. The trade of Assyria, on the other hand, was wholly
                    overland; and its first fleet was the one built by Phoenician captives for
                    Sennacherib, when pursuing the fugitive Chaldeans through the Persian Gulf. Like
                    the Jews, however, the Assyrians showed an aptitude for trade from the very
                    first. The earliest Semitic settlements in Babylonia seem to have been mainly
                    for commercial purposes, and their career there may be compared with that of the
                    English in India. In the 12th century <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> the trading
                    spirit had so thoroughly pervaded them that not only were objects of utility and
                    art a marketable commodity, but we find Tiglath-Pileser I. bringing trees from
                    the countries he had overran, and acclimatising them in Assyria. The fullest
                    development of business and commerce, however, does not show itself until the
                    8th and 7th centuries <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.,</hi> when Nineveh was a busy
                    centre of trade. Sidon and Tyre had been ruined by the Assyrian kings—indeed, it
                    is very possible that the obstinate wars with the Phoenician cities had their
                    origin in commercial jealousy, and trade had accordingly transferred itself to
                    Carchemish, which was conveniently situated on the Euphrates. The maneh of
                    Carchemish became the standard of weight, and Aramaic the common language of
                    trade. The interest upon money was usually at 4 per cent.; but sometimes, more
                    especially when objects like iron were borrowed, at 3 per cent. Payment might
                    still be made in kind; but more ordinarily in bars of the three chief metals,
                    which were weighed, though mention of coined money also occurs. Houses could be
                    let on lease, and the deeds which conveyed them give a careful inventory of the
                    property and its appurtenances. Commercial relations extended from India on the
                    one side, whence came ivory and the teak found at Mugheir, which Sennacherib
                    probably means by “wood of Sinda,” to the tin islands of Cornwall on the
                    other.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Religion and Mythology.—</hi> The earliest religion of Accad
                    was a Shamanism resembling that of the Siberian or Samoyed tribes of to-day.
                    Every object had its spirit, good or bad; and the power of controlling these
                    spirits was in the hands of priests and sorcerers. The world swarmed with them,
                    especially with the demons, and there was scarcely an action which did not risk
                    demoniac possession. Diseases were regarded as caused in this way, and the
                    cherubs, bulls, and other composite creatures which guarded the entrance to a
                    house, were believed to protect it from mischief. In course of time certain
                    spirits (or rather deified powers of nature) were elevated above the rest into
                    the position of gods; and at the head of all stood the <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit03newyrich/page/n208/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0903-0208-0193"/> Triad of Na or Anna, “the sky,” Ea, “the earth,”
                    and Mulge, “the lord of the underworld.” The old Shamanism gradually became
                    transformed into a religion with a host of subordinate semi-divine beings; but
                    so strong a hold had it upon the mind, that the new gods were still addressed by
                    their spirits. The religion now entered upon a new phase; the various epithets
                    applied to the same deity were crystallised into fresh divinities, and the
                    sun-god under a multitude of forms became the central object of worship. This
                    inevitably led to a mythology, the numerous personified attributes passing into
                    demi-gods and heroes. A large part of the Accadian mythology was solar, and the
                    transparency of its proper names which, as in other agglutinative languages,
                    never disguise their primitive meaning, makes it valuable in verifying the
                    so-called “solar theory” of comparative mythology. At this stage of development,
                    however, an important change passed over the old faith. The Semitic settlers in
                    Sumir had adopted the Accadian pantheon and belief, and after a conflict between
                    the discordant religious conceptions of the two races, a great sacerdotal
                    “reform” took place analogous to that of Brahmanism, and the official religion
                    fused them into one whole. The magicians were taken into the priestly body, and
                    the hierarchy of divine beings was determined. The old triad of Na, Ea, and
                    Mulge became the trinity of Anu, Ea, and Bel the Demiurge, all children of Zicu
                    or Zicara, “the sky” (the Sige of Nicolaus Damascenus); Ea, “the god of life and
                    knowledge,” “the lord of the abyss,” “the king of rivers and the garden,” the
                    husband of Bahu (the Bohu of Gen i. 2), whose spirit pervades the universe,
                    being made the father of Bel-Merodach, the tutelary divinity of Babylon. In
                    accordance with the genius of the sex-denoting Semitic idioms, each deity was
                    furnished with a female principle, and “The god” in Babylonia, and the
                    personified city of Assur, with his wife Seruâ, in Assyria, were placed at the
                    head of the Pantheon. Below these four supreme divinities came a second trinity
                    of the Moongod, Sun-god, and Air-god, and the seven together formed “the seven
                    magnificent deities.” After these were arranged “the fifty great gods,” and then
                    the 300 spirits of heaven, and the 600 spirits of earth, among whom was found a
                    place for the primeval divinities of Accad as well as for the many local deities
                    of Chaldea. The most dreaded of “the spirits of earth” were “the seven spirits”
                    who were born “without father and mother” in the encircling abyss of ocean, and
                    carried plague and evil over the earth. An old myth told of their war against
                    the moon, which was deputed to watch over the interests of mankind.</p>
                <p>Along with the establishment of the Babylonian official religion, an
                    astro-theology was created by the introduction of astronomy into the religious
                    sphere. The “spirits” of the various stars were identified with the gods of the
                    new creed, Merodach, for instance, properly one of the forms of the sun-god,
                    being identified with the planet Jupiter, and the five planetary deities were
                    added to the seven magnificent gods, making up altogether “the twelve chiefs of
                    the gods.” The elaboration of this astro-theology was also accompanied by the
                    formation of a cosmogony. The details of the latter are to be found in the
                    fragments of Berosus and Nicolaus Damascenus, whose statements are confirmed by
                    the inscriptions, and they show a remarkable resemblance to the cosmogonies of
                    Genesis and Phoenicia. It must be remembered that both Phoenicians and Hebrews
                    profess to have migrated from Chaldea.</p>
                <p>The resemblance is still more βtriking when we examine the Babylonian mythology.
                    The sacred tree of Babylonia, with its guardian “cherubs ”—a word, by the way,
                    which seems of Accadian origin—as well as the flaming sword or thunderbolt of
                    fifty points and seven heads, recall Biblical analogies, while the Noachian
                    deluge differs but slightly from the Chaldean one. Indeed, the Jehovistic
                    version of the flood story in Genesis agrees not only in details, but even in
                    phraseology with that which forms the eleventh lay of the great Babylonian epic.
                    The hero of the latter is Tam-zi or Tammuz, “the sun of life,” the son of
                    Ubara-tutu, “the glow of sunset,” and denotes the revivifying luminary of day,
                    who sails upon his “ark” behind the clouds of winter to reappear when the rainy
                    season is past. He is called Sisuthrus by Berosus, that is, Susru “the founder,”
                    a synonym of Na “the sky.” The mountain on which his ark rested was placed, as
                    already noticed, in Nisir, south-west of Lake Urumiyeh. Its peak, whereon the
                    first altar was built after the deluge, was the legendary model after which the
                    <hi rend="italic">zigurats</hi> or towers of the Babylonian temples were
                    erected. Besides the account of the flood, fragments have been met with of
                    stories resembling those of the tower of Babel or Babylon, of the creation, of
                    the fall, and of the sacrifice of Isaac,—the latter, by the way, forming
                    probably the first lay of the great epic. The sixth lay we possess in full. It
                    describes the descent of Istar into Hades in pursuit of her dead husband Dü-zi,
                    “the offspring,” the Babylonian Adonis. Dü-zi is but another form of Tam-zi, and
                    denotes the sun when obscured by night and winter. At each of the seven gates of
                    Hades the goddess left some portion of her apparel, until she at last reached
                    the abode of the dead, dark and joyless, where dust alone is the food of the
                    unhappy shades. In the midst rose the golden throne of the spirits of earth,
                    beneath which welled “the waters of life,” and here, too <hi rend="subscript">
                    r</hi> was the seat of Bahu. Bahu, as queen of the underworld, smote Istar with
                    many diseases, and confined her in Hades until her brother the Sun-god
                    complained to the Moon-god-and Ea, who sent a sphinx to pour the waters of life
                    upon the imprisoned goddess and restore her to the light of day. This myth gives
                    a good idea of the Chaldean conception of the next world. Certain favoured
                    individuals, however, might look forward to a happier state of existence. A
                    psalm which invokes blessings upon the king wishes him everlasting life in “the
                    land of the silver sky,” where the gods feast and know no evil. It will be
                    observed that the-Babylonian Hades (like the Hebrew Sheol) is not very
                    dissimilar to the Homeric one; and the possibility of borrowing on the part of
                    the Greeks is suggested by the fact, that the seven-headed serpent of Hindu
                    legend is of foreign origin, being taken from the seven-headed serpent of the
                    Accadians, “which lashes the waves of the sea,” while the story of Andromeda
                    came through Phoenician hands from a Chaldean myth which forms the subject of
                    one of the lays of the great epic. So, too, the Oceanus of Homer finds its
                    prototype in the encircling abysmal waters of Accadian geography, and the <hi
                    rend="italic">fravashis</hi> and <hi rend="italic">mithras</hi> of Mazdaism were
                    introduced by the Magian (or Turanian) population found in Media by the Aryan
                    invaders.</p>
                <p>But the old Shamanistic ideas survived also in Assyria and Babylonia, and so were
                    handed on to the Jews. An elaborate system of augury flourished down to the last
                    days of the empire, and omens were drawn from every event that could possibly
                    happen. Magic formulae for warding, off the attacks of demons were extensively
                    used, and the bronze bowls found by Mr Layard, as well as the part played by
                    charms and demons in the Talmud, show how strongly the belief had seized upon
                    the Jewish mind. Through the Jews and the various Gnostic systems of early
                    Christianity, the primitive doctrines of Accad found their way into the
                    mediaeval church, and the features of the mediaeval devil may be traced in an
                    Assyrian bas-relief, where a demon with horns, claws, tail, and wings, is being
                    pursued by the god Adar. Even the phylacteries of the Jews go back to the same
                    origin. Accadian magic ordered the sorcerer to bind the charm, twice knotted
                    with seven <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit03newyrich/page/n209/mode/1up"

                    with the further application of holy water, would, it was believed, infallibly
                    produce a cure, while the same result might be brought about by fixing “a
                    sentence out of a good book on the sufferer’s head as he lay in bed.” Similar
                    superstitions may yet be detected in the corners of our own land, and still more
                    on the Continent, where the break with the traditions of the past has been less
                    strongly felt. They form an important element in the history of the human
                    intelligence, and the light thrown upon their origin and early fortunes by the
                    revelations of cuneiform discovery has opened a new chapter in the science of
                    religion.</p>
