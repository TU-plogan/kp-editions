                <p><label type="entry">BARD</label>, from the Welsh <hi rend="italic">bardd,</hi> is
                    the name applied to the ancient Celtic poets, though the word is sometimes
                    loosely used as synonymous with poet in general. So far as can be ascertained,
                    the title <hi rend="italic">bards,</hi> and some of the privileges peculiar to
                    that class of poets, are to be found only among Celtic peoples. The name itself
                    is not used by Caesar in his account of the manners and customs of Gaul and
                    Britain, but he appears to ascribe the functions of the bards to a section of
                    the Druids, with which class they seem to have been closely connected. Later
                    Latin authors, such as Lucan <hi rend="italic">{Phar.,</hi> p. 447), Festus (De
                    <hi rend="italic">Verb. Sign. s. v.),</hi> and Ammianus Marcellinus (bk. xv.),
                    used the term <hi rend="italic">Bardi</hi> as the recognized title of the
                    national poets oι singers among the peoples of Gaul and Britain. In Gaul,
                    however, the institution soon disappeared; the purely Celtic peoples were swept
                    back by the waves of Latin and Teutonic conquest, and finally settled in Wales,
                    Ireland. Brittany, and the north of Scotland. There is cleaι evidence of the
                    existence of bards in all these places, though the known relics belong almost
                    entirely to Wales and Ireland, where the institution was more distinctively
                    national. In Wales they formed an organized society, with hereditary rights and
                    privileges. They were treated with the utmost respect, and were exempt from
                    taxes O) military service. Their special duties were to celebrate the victories
                    of their people, and to sing hymns of praise tc God. They thus gave poetic
                    expression to the religious and national sentiments of the people, and therefore
                    ex ercised a very powerful influence. The whole society oi bards was regulated
                    by laws, said to have been first dis tinctly formulated by Hywell Dha, and to
                    have been after wards revised by Gruffydd ap Conan. At stated intervals great
                    festivals were held, at which the most famous bards from the various districts
                    met and contended in song, the umpires being generally the princes and nobles.
                    Ever after the conquest of Wales, these festivals, or <hi rend="italic"
                    >Eisisddfodau</hi> as they were called, continued to be summoned by the English
                    sovereigns, but from the reign of Elizabeth the custom has been allowed to fall
                    into abeyance. They have not since been summoned by royal authority, but have
                    beer revived, and are held regularly at the present time. Ir Ireland also the
                    bards were a distinct class with peculiaι and hereditary privileges. They appear
                    to have beer divided into three great sections: the first celebrated victories
                    and sang hymns of praise; the second chantec the laws of the nation; the third
                    gave poetic genealogies and family histories. The Irish bards were held in higl
                    repute, and frequently were brought over to Wales to give instruction to the
                    singers of that country.</p>
