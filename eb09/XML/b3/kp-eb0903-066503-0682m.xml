                    and then proceeded to Magdalen Hall, Oxford. He graduated as bachelor of arts in
                    1638 and as master in 1641, and was then appointed to the mastership of the free
                    school in the city of Gloucester. While conducting this school in an admirable
                    manner he diligently prosecuted his theological studies; and the results he
                    arrived at were of such a nature as to draw down upon him the reprobation of the
                    civic authorities. He circulated privately a tract called <hi rend="italic"
                    >Twelve Arguments drawn out of Scripture, wherein the commonly-received opinion
                    touching the deity of the Holy Spirit is clearly and fully refuted;</hi> and
                    towards the close of 1645 he was summoned before the Parliamentary committee
                    then sitting at Gloucester. By them he was committed to prison, though he was at
                    the time labouring under a dangerous fever. He was released on bail after an
                    imprisonment of some duration, and was then called before the Parliament, which
                    desired to inquire into his views. After tedious proceedings Biddle was
                    committed to custody, in which he remained for five years. During that time the
                    Assembly of Divines at Westminster had discussed his opinions, and in defence he
                    published his <hi rend="italic">Twelve Arguments.</hi> The book was at once
                    ordered by Parliament to be seized and burned by the hangman. Notwithstanding
                    this, Biddle issued two tracts, one a <hi rend="italic">Confession of Faith with
                    regard to the Holy Trinity,</hi> the other <hi rend="italic">Testimonies of
                    Irenaeus, &lt;kc., concerning the one God and the Persons of the Holy
                    Trinity.</hi> These were suppressed by Government, and the Assembly of Divines
                    eagerly pressed for the passing of an /let by which heretics like Biddle could
                    be put to death. This, however, was resisted by the army, and by many of the
                    Independent Parliamentarians: and after the death of the king, Biddle <pb
                    break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit03newyrich/page/n683/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0903-0683-0666"/> was allowed to reside in Staffordshire under
                    surveillance. In 1651 the general Act of Oblivion gave him complete freedom, and
                    his adherents soon began the practice of meeting regularly for worship on
                    Sundays. They were called Biddellians, or Socinians, or Unitarians, the name
                    which has now become associated with their opinions. Biddle was not left long in
                    peace. He translated some Socinian books, among others the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Life of Socinus,</hi> and published two catechisms, which excited a fury of
                    indignation against him. He was summoned before the Parliament and imprisoned.
                    The dissolution of that body again set him at liberty for a short time, but he
                    was presently brought up for some expressions used by him in a discussion with a
                    Baptist clergyman. He was put upon trial, and was only rescued by Cromwell, who
                    sent him out of the way to one of the Scilly Islands, and after three years
                    released him. But in 1662 he was again arrested, and fined £100. As he was
                    unable to pay this sum, he was at once committed to prison, where fever, caused
                    by the pestilential atmosphere, carried him off on the 22d September 1662.</p>
