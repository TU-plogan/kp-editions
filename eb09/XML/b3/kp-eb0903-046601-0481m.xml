                    somewhat poetical mind. In 1758 he obtained a situation as undermaster in the
                    grammar school, Aberdeen, and two years later he was made professor of moral
                    philosophy at Marischal College. Here he became closely acquainted with Reid,
                    Campbell, Gerard, and others, who formed a kind of literary or philosophical
                    society, in which speculative questions, above all the views of Hume, were
                    canvassed and criticized. In 1770 Beattie published his <hi rend="italic">Essay
                    on the Nature and Immutability of Truth,</hi> in which he attacked Helvetius and
                    Hume, and advocated the doctrine afterwards familiarly known as that of Common
                    Sense. The work had an astonishing success, and its author, when on a visit to
                    London in 1773, was received with the greatest honour by the king himself. About
                    the same time he received a pension of £200 a year. In 1773 and 1774 he
                    published the first and second parts of <hi rend="italic">The Minstrel,</hi>
                    which were received with great favour, and gained for the author a fresh
                    accession of popularity. His later writings are partly literary, such as the <hi
                    rend="italic">Essays,</hi> 1766; <hi rend="italic">Dissertations,</hi> 1783,
                    partly philosophical; <hi rend="italic">Evidences of Christianity,</hi> 1781;
                    <hi rend="italic">Elements of Moral Science,</hi> 1790-93. Beattie was
                    unfortunate in his domestic life. His wife, whom he married in 1767, was
                    afflicted with insanity, a disease which she appears to have inherited from her
                    mother. Two sons, all his family, died just as they were attaining manhood. The
                    elder, James Hay Beattie, a young man of great promise, who at the age of
                    nineteen had been associated with his father in the professorship, died in 1790.
                    The younger brother died in 1796. Beattie never recovered his second blow. His
                    mind was nearly overthrown by it; his spirit was completely broken, and although
                    he still lectured, he neither wrote nor studied. In 1799 he was attacked with
                    palsy, and continued to suffer from that disease for three years. He died on the
                    18th August 1803. Beattie’s fame rests now solely on his poems. The much
                    celebrated <hi rend="italic">Essay on Truth</hi> is a work of no philosophic
                    ability, and is disfigured by the violent and intemperate language of the
                    author. His other writings on philosophical subjects, such as the <hi
                    rend="italic">Elements of Moral Science,</hi> are excessively weak, and have
                    fallen into well-deserved oblivion. <hi rend="italic">The Minstrel,</hi>
                    however, is a work which will always retain a considerable share of popular
                    favour. The ground-plan is simple and well conceived,—to trace the development
                    of poetic genius in a youth from his earliest years up to the time when he
                    becomes able to take his place as a minstrel. There runs through the poem a fine
                    vein of quiet reflection, interspersed with animated descriptions of natural
                    scenery. The versification is smooth <pb break="no"
