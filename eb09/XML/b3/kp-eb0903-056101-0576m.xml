                <p><label type="entry">BENEVENTO</label>, a city of Italy, the capital of a
                    province, situated on a hill near the confluence of the Calore and the Sabato,
                    32 miles N.E. of Naples. The town is surrounded by walls, and was formerly
                    defended by a castle of the 12th century, which now contains Government offices
                    and a prison. It occupies the site of the ancient <hi rend="italic"
                    >Beneventum,</hi> and is largely built of its ruins. Except Rome, few cities can
                    boast of so many remains of antiquity. Of these the most beautiful and perfect
                    is the arch of Trajan, erected in 114 A.D., 53 feet in height, and consisting of
                    a single arch of Parian marble of the Corinthian order, highly ornamented with
                    basso and alto rilievos, which represent various events in the reign of that
                    emperor. It now forms one of the gates of the city <hi rend="italic"
                    >{Porta</hi><hi rend="italic">Aurea).</hi> Of the amphitheatre the remains, now
                    known as <hi rend="italic">Grottoni di</hi><hi rend="italic">Mappa,</hi> are in
                    a very ruinous condition, and the arena is occupied by houses of a mean
                    description. Benevento is the see of a bishop, and has a cathedral of the 12th
                    century in the Lombardo-Saracenic style, in front of which is an Egyptian
                    obelisk of granite covered with hieroglyphics. Among its other buildings may be
                    mentioned the town-hall, the diocesan seminary, the lyceum, which was formerly a
                    Jesuit college, and several hospitals. The principal manufactures are leather,
                    parchment, and plated goods. A considerable trade is carried on in grain.</p>
                <p>Beneventum, or, as it was originally called, Maloeis or Maleventum, seems to have
                    been of Samnite foundation. In 268 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> it was
                    colonized by the Romans, who had probably been in possession of it for some
                    time. During the second Punic war two of the most important battles were fought
                    in the neighbourhood. It continued to be a very flourishing city till the close
                    of the empire, and from its position on the <hi rend="italic">Via</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Appia,</hi> it often comes into notice. About 545 A.D. it was
                    sacked by Totila, but before long had recovered its prosperity. Being raised to
                    the rank of a duchy by Alboin, king of the Lombards, it continued in possession
                    of its own dukes till 1053, when the emperor, Henry III., who had rendered
                    himself master of the city, exchanged it with Leo IX. for the bishopric of
                    Bamberg. From that time it continued in Papal possession till 1806, when the
                    Emperor Napoleon I. bestowed it, with the title of prince, on Talleyrand.</p>
