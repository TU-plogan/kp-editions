                    cent., were Hindus; 111,795, or 16Ί per cent., Mahometans; 249 Christians; and
                    3440, consisting principally of aboriginal tribes, of unspecified religions. The
                    eastern portion of the district is the ordinary alluvial plain of the Gangetic
                    Delta; the western part consists of undulating beds of laterite resting on a
                    rock basis, and covered with small scrub jungle. The Ajai, Bakheswar, and Mor or
                    Maurakshi, are the principal rivers of the district, but they are merely hill
                    streams and only navigable in the rains. Rice, wheat, sugar-cane, pulses,
                    oil-seeds, and mulberry form the agricultural products of the district. The
                    chief manufactures are silk, silk cloth, and lacquered ware. The principal seats
                    of trade are Dubrâjpur, Ilâmbâzâr, Bolpur, Sinthiâ, Purandarpur, Krinnâhâr,
                    Muhammad Bâzâr, and Ahmadpur. The total net revenue of the district in 1870-71
                    amounted to £97,979; the civil expenditure to £27,278. The land tax forms the
                    most important item of revenue. In 1870-71 it amounted to £73,261, paid by 556
                    estates, held by 2036 proprietors, under the Permanent Settlement as in other
                    parts of Bengal. The district and municipal police force amounted to 320
                    officers and men, at a total cost of £5895 in 1871. Besides these there were
                    8554 men of the village watch, maintained at a total cost of £23,074, paid by
                    service lands and by the villagers. In 1872 Birbhùm contained 604 schools,
                    attended by 9338 pupils, costing £989 to the state for the education of its
                    people.: There are seven principal roads in the district, the total mileage
                    being 191, and the average cost of their maintenance £1784. Thirty-three miles
                    of the East Indian Railway lie within the district. Until lately Birbhum was
                    considered to be the healthiest district in Bengal; but during the past few
                    years epidemic fever has made havoc among the rural population of the eastern
                    portion of the district.</p>
