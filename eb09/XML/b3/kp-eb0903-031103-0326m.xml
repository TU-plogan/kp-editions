                    N., and bounded on the N. by the Moray Firth, E. and S. by Aberdeenshire, and W.
                    by Morayshire and part of Inverness-shire. It has an area of 686 square miles,
                    or 439,219 statute acres, its extent from N. to S. being 50 miles, and from E.
                    to W. 32 miles,—its average breadth not exceeding 14 miles. It contains 21
                    parishes, and parts of 10 others. Its royal and parliamentary burghs are Banff,
                    Macduff, and Cullen; and its principal harbours are at Banff, Macduff, Cullen,
                    Portsoy, Buckie, and Portgordon. The parliamentary burghs are contributory to
                    Elgin, and the county returns a member to parliament. The parliamentary
                    constituency in 1874-5 was 1737. Many of the schoolmastere, with those of the
                    counties of Aberdeen and Moray, share in Dick’s bequest.</p>
                <p>The surface of Banffshire presents a very diversified aspect. The lower district
                    is mostly a fine open country of a rich, deep, and highly-cultivated soil,
                    agreeably diversified with gentle risings and young plantations. The upper
                    district is mountainous and, at a distance, wears a bleak, forbidding
                    appearance. But the scene changes on a nearer approach. Extensive farms are
                    found embosomed in its fertile and well-cultivated glens. Some of the mountains
                    are covered with trees in full luxuriance of growth; some presenting a beautiful
                    intermixture of rock and copse, while others are covered with brown heath. The
                    Spey flows along its western, and the Deveron along its eastern boundary; and
                    both yield a considerable revenue from their salmon-fish <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit03newyrich/page/n327/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0903-0327-0312"/> ings. The principal mountains of Banffshire
                    proper are Benrinnes and the Knockhill; but Cairngorm,Ben Macdhui, and Ben Aven,
                    the highest summits in Britain, lie on or close to the boundary. The principal
                    noblemen’s and gentlemen’s seats are Duff House, Cullen House, Park House, Troup
                    House, Forglen House, Drummuir, Kininvie, Bal-venie, Aberlour, and Rothiemay.
                    Several of these are elegant mansions, and most of them are surrounded by
                    extensive and tastefully laid-out plantations. The natural woods are
                    inconsiderable both in extent and value.</p>
                <p>The geology of Banffshire is very closely connected with that of the neighbouring
                    counties of Aberdeen and Moray, from which it is divided by no natural
                    boundaries. Gneiss, and to a greater extent mica slate, form the lowest
                    stratified rocks running nearly south-weβt from the coast between Cullen and
                    Portsoy to the upper valleys of the Fiddach, Deveron, and Aven rivers. Generally
                    they are fine grained slaty rocks, and form low rounded mountains, of no great
                    beauty, but decomposing into soils of considerable fertility. In many places the
                    mica slate alternates or passes into quartzite, which differs from it chiefly in
                    the almost entire absence of mica. Quartzite in a more independent form is seen
                    on the coast between Cullen and Buckie, and forms also the Durn Hill near
                    Portsoy, the Binn of Cullen, the Knockhill, and much of the high ground to the
                    south. Where it prevails the soil is far from fertile, and the white,
                    weather-beaten mountains have a very sterile aspect. Connected with this series
                    also beds of limestone are very common, and have been quarried in many places,
                    as near Boyne Castle, Sandend, and Fordyce in the north, and in the interior
                    near Keith, Mortlach, and Tomintoul.</p>
                <p>Clayslate occurs in considerable abundance in Banffshire, in some places perhaps
                    merely a finer variety of mica slate, in others coarser in texture, or so-called
                    greywacke. Large masses are seen near Boharm, and from Dufftown south to
                    Kirkmichael. It also forms the north coast from Knock Head by Banff, Macduff,
                    and Gamrie, to the Troup Head, often rising into bold, lofty cliffs, and extends
                    south to Gartly. In several places it is wrought for roofing slates both in this
                    county and in Aberdeenshire. Though no fossils have yet been found in these
                    strata, there is little doubt that they are more or less metamorphosed
                    representatives of the lower portions of the Palaeozoic (Silurian and Cambrian)
                    formations.</p>
                <p>Resting on these rocks Devonian or Old Red Sandstone and conglomerate beds are
                    seen in a few places. Thus the Morayshire beds cross the Spey near Fochabers,
                    running along the coast to Euckie, and in the Tynet Burn have yielded many
                    characteristic fossil fishes. Gamrie, at the north-east extremity of the county,
                    is also well known for similar remains occurring in calcareous nodules embedded
                    in a bluish grey marly rock, from which they are washed out by a small stream on
                    its way to the sea. The more important species are <hi rend="italic">Cheir
                    acanthus Murchisoni, Cheirolepis Uragus, C occosteus</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >cuspidatus,</hi><hi rend="italic">Dipl opt er us</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >affinis,</hi><hi rend="italic">Glyptolepis</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >elegans,</hi><hi rend="italic">Osteolepis</hi><hi rend="italic">arenatus,</hi>
                    and <hi rend="italic">Pterichthys Milleri.</hi> In the interior, near Tomintoul,
                    another large deposit of red sandstone occurs, probably of the same age, but as
                    yet no organic remains have been found in this locality. Indications of still
                    more recent formations are seen in the chalk flints common in the vicinity of
                    Portsoy, and in the Oolite fossils found in the brick clays at Blackpots. The
                    raised beach with recent shells, more than 200 feet above the sealevel, near the
                    old church of Gamrie, is also interesting. As in other parts of Scotland, the
                    surface of the country is covered with masses of boulder clay and stratified
                    drift beds, the materials often derived from a considerable distance and some of
                    the granite boulders several tons in weight.</p>
                <p>The most important igneous rock is granite. This rock, a portion of the great
                    central mass of the Grampians, forms the mountains in the extreme south of the
                    country round the sources of the Aven. Benrinnes also consists of it, and
                    smaller masses are seen in Glenlivet and other localities. The well-known
                    “graphic granite” forms a vein on the coast near Portsoy, and gets its name from
                    the quartz and felspar crystals appearing on the polished surface like rude
                    letters. Syenite, a compound of hornblende and felspar, covers a large district
                    running south from near Portsoy to Rothiemay and Huntly in Aberdeenshire. The
                    serpentine of Portsoy, though long known, and said to have been at one time
                    extensively wrought and even sent to France as an ornamental stone, is now
                    almost neglected. Rocks of a similar character may be traced pretty much in a
                    south-west direction to near the sources of the Deveron, and from that into the
                    upper parts of the Don in Aberdeenshire.</p>
                <p>Some interesting minerals have been found in Banffshire. Among them may be
                    mentioned magnetite, chromite, and asbestos at Portsoy; fluorite near Boharm, at
                    Keith, and on the Avon; also cyanite and chiastolite in clayslate at Boharm.
                    Attempts were made many years ago to work a vein of sulphuret of antimony near
                    Keith; and more recently mines of haematite were opened near Arndilly on the
                    Spey.</p>
                <p>The agriculture of Banffshire is conducted upon the newest and most approved
                    principles. The soil, though varying even in adjacent fields, is in general rich
                    and productive, yielding fair crops of wheat, and excellent crops of barley,
                    oats, &amp;c.; and the grass and green crops are equally abundant. About 163,000
                    acres are under cultivation, the extent of the farms is in general from 150 to
                    200 arable acres, independently of moorland and pasture-grounds. The duration of
                    leases is nineteen years; although there are still some individuals who possess
                    on liferent, and a few leases are held for a longer term. The whole of the
                    farms, even the smallest pendicles, are under regular rotations of cropping,
                    generally a five or seven course shift. The fields are well laid out and
                    subdivided, and properly cleaned and manured; for which last purpose large
                    quantities of lime, bone-dust, and guano, are annually imported. The ridges are
                    all straight; and the fields, at least many of them, are enclosed with stone
                    dykes or other fences. The swamps and wet grounds have also been drained and
                    cultivated, so as to effect a total revolution in the ancient modes of
                    agriculture within the county. The cattle and stock hold a high character; and
                    there are several herds of pure short-horns and pure polled Aberdeenshire cattle
                    maintained in the county. This district was much indebted to one of the earls of
                    Findlater, who, as early as the year 1754, not only introduced and exemplified,
                    on some of his own farms, the most approved practices then known in England, but
                    held out liberal encouragement to his tenants to follow his example. His
                    descendants, the earls of Seafield, have also done much to improve the family
                    estates, adding to them many thousands of acres of arable land; and it may be
                    said with truth that one of the earls was the greatest planter of trees in Great
                    Britain within the present century. In 1846 this nobleman received the honorary
                    gold medal of the Highland and Agricultural Society of Scotland, for his vast
                    and thriving plantations of useful timber trees, in the counties of Banff,
                    Moray, and Nairn. From the year 1811 to 1845, he had planted 18,938,224 Scotch
                    firs, 11,904,798 larches, 843,450 hardwoods; making the enormous aggregate of
                    31,686,472 forest trees, planted in 8223 acres of enclosed ground.</p>
                <p>This county also owes much to the earls of Fife, by whose generous efforts and
                    taste for improvement a vast amount has been done in planting and reclaiming
                    land, by favourable leases to the tenantry, and allowances for draining,
                    &lt;fcc, <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit03newyrich/page/n328/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0903-0328-0313"/> Latterly, improvement has been promoted by
                    agricultural associations, annual premiums being given for the best specimens of
                    live stock and the best productions of the soil The Banffshire Agricultural
                    Association has two shows yearly for all sorts of stock and produce and
                    agricultural implements, with premiums for superiority in various breeds of
                    cattle, poultry, &amp;c. The valued rental of the county is now upwards of
                    £224,250 sterling.</p>
                <p>The manufactures of Banffshire are very unimportant, the inhabitants being
                    principally engaged in agriculture and the rearing of cattle. The salmon-fishery
                    is actively prosecuted on the rivers, and herring and other fisheries on the
                    coast. Distilling is largely carried on in Glenlivet and other places; and there
                    is a woollen factory at Keith.</p>
                <p>Banffshire was the scene of many bloody conflicts between the Scots and their
                    Danish invaders. From 1624 to 1645 it was the theatre of almost incessant
                    struggles, and the Covenanting troubles of that period, combined with the
                    frequent conflicts of the clans, were productive of serious evils. Several
                    remains of antiquity are pointed out in different parts of the country, such as
                    the sculptured stone at Mortlach, and the churches of Cullen and Fordyce Ruins
                    of castles and traces of encampments are often to be met with, and a great
                    number of cairns and tumuli are also found. Among the distinguished men whom
                    Banffshire has produced, the following may be mentioned :—Archbishop Sharp of St
                    Andrews; George Baird, distinguished for his services as sheriff of the county
                    during the time of the Covenanters; Thomas Ruddiman, the grammarian; Walter
                    Goodall, the defender of Mary Queen of Scots; Dr Alexander Geddes; and James
                    Ferguson, the astronomer. The population of the county in 1861 and in 1871 was
                    as follows :—</p>
