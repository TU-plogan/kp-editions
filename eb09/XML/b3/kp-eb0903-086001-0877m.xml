                    between 48° 33' and 51° 4' N. lat., and 12° 5' and 16° 25' W. long., and bounded
                    on the N. by Saxony and Prussian Silesia, E. by Moravia, S. by Upper and Lower
                    Austria, and W. by Bavaria. Its area is estimated at 19,983 square miles. It
                    belongs almost entirely to the basin of the Elbe, which rises within the
                    territory, and is joined by the Adler, the Iser, the Moldau, and the Eger before
                    it passes the frontier. The boundaries are pretty clearly marked by mountain
                    ranges on all sides,—the Böhmerwald dividing the country from Bavaria, the
                    Erzgebirge and Riesengebirge from Saxony and Silesia,’and the Moravian Hills
                    from the basin of the Danube. The climate is healthy, but varies considerably in
                    different districts; the soil in many parts is highly fertile, and grain of
                    various kinds, potatoes, hops, flax, hemp, vines, and fruits are extensively
                    cultivated. In 1870 there were 6,205,161 acres of ploughed land, 2656 in
                    vineyards, 1,560,321 in gardens and meadows, 995,340 in pasture, and 3,749,411
                    in woodland. At the same date the number of horses in the country was 189,337,
                    cattle 1,602,015, sheep 1,106,290, goats 194,273, swine 228,180, and bee-hives
                    140,892. The mineral productions comprise gold, silver, lead, tin, copper, iron,
                    cobalt, bismuth, arsenic, sulphur, coal, alum, vitriol, and different sorts of
                    stone. In 1870 there were obtained 156 cwt. of gold-ore, 1245 of silver-ore,
                    225,536 tons of iron, 999 tons of lead, 2274 of tin, 61 tons of antimony, and
                    111 of arsenic-ore. The quantity of coal and lignite amounted to 4,099,909 tons.
                    The mineral springs of Bohemia—Carlsbad, Teplitz, Marienbad, and Franzensbrunn,
                    &amp;c.—are justly famous. The industry of the kingdom is highly developed in
                    various directions. Most important of all is the manufacture of woollen goods,
                    principally carried on at Reichenberg and in the neighbourhood. The cotton
                    manufacture is also extensively prosecuted in the same district; and at Rumburg
                    and other places linen stuffs are largely produced. Bohemian glass has been
                    celebrated for centuries, and is still exported to all parts of Europe Porcelain
                    and earthenware of different sorts, iron and steel wares, copper, tin, and
                    pewter articles, wooden wares, chemical stuffs, and paper are all the objects of
                    a considerable industry. Beetroot sugar is pretty largely manufactured, the
                    refineries numbering 126 in 1870. At the same date there were 968 breweries in
                    the country, and 324 brandy distilleries. The chief commercial city is the
                    capital, Prague; but Reichenberg, Pilsen, Haida, Rumburg, Leitmeritz, and
                    Budweis are all important centres. Bohemia is divided into twelve
                    circles—Prague, Budweis, Pisek, Pilsen, Eger, Saaz, Leitmeritz, Bunzlau, Jiczin,
                    Königgrätz, Chrudim, Czaslau, and Tabor, and these are subdivided into 91
                    departments. In 1869 there were 372 towns, 226 smaller market-towns, and 12,551
                    villages. The number of inhabited houses in the whole country amounted to
                    632,404; and the total population was 5,106,069, of whom 2,433,629 were males,
                    and 2,672,440 females. The census of 1869 took no count of nationality, but
                    according to Ficker in his <hi rend="italic">Die Volkerstamme</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">der</hi><hi rend="italic">Oesterreichisch-Uηg</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">arischen Monarchie,</hi> there are 20 of German race for 32 of
                    Slavonic. By far the greater part of the population (4,940,898) belongs to the
                    Roman Catholic Church; while only 3438 are members of the Greek Church, 106,115
                    Protestants, and 89,933 Jews. The country constitutes an archbishopric, and is
                    divided into three bishoprics. In 1870 there were 140 ecclesiastical
                    foundations, with endowments amounting to £65,726. At the head of the
                    educational establishments is the University of Prague, with four faculties, and
                    attended in 1871 by 1516 students. There are upwards of 4000 ordinary schools in
                    rather more than the half of which Czech is spoken, 26 gymnasiums, 4 theological
                    seminaries, and several institutions for special departments of the arts and
                    sciences.</p>
                <p>Bohemia derives its name from the Boii, a Celtic race expelled from the country
                    by the Marcomanni, who, after establishing a considerable kingdom under Marbod
                    and being converted to Christianity, were in their turn supplanted by the
                    Slavonic race, which is still predominant. The new comers were in danger of
                    expulsion or conquest by the Avars, but were defended and established, according
                    to their own possibly mythical account, by the heroic Sarno; and somewhat later,
                    as the story goes, his place was filled by the good knight Krok, whose daughter
                    Libussa, marrying Premysl, became the founder of a regular dynasty. Bohemia was
                    for a time absorbed in the great Carlovingian monarchy, but soon reasserted its
                    independence. In the course of the 9th century Christianity was introduced.
                    Under Boleslas I. the bounds of Bohemia were extended and its unity secured; but
                    after a vigorous defence he had to recognize the overlordship of Otto I. of
                    Germany. Under his grandchildren his kingdom fell to pieces; a Polish conquest
                    followed, and the restoration of the native dynasty was only effected by the
                    help of Henry II. of Germany. In 1086 Wratislas II. received the title of king
                    from the emperor for himself; and Premysl Ottocar I. (1197-1230) became the
                    founder of a hereditary series of kings. He was a bold defender of his
                    independence, and at the same time gave great encouragement to German
                    immigration. By the introduction of the right of primogeniture in the succession
                    to the throne, he put an end to the disputes and contests which so often
                    followed the death of a king. In 1241 his son and successor was the successful
                    defender of Europe against a Mongolian invasion; but he was eclipsed by Ottocar
                    II. (1253-1278), who added greatly by conquest to the extent of his dominions,
                    and made himself a formidable rival to the emperor himself. The Premysl dynasty
                    was at last extinguished in 1306; and· after a few years of uncertainty and
                    dissatisfaction the Bohemian crown was bestowed on John of Luxembourg (sonof the
                    Emperor Henry VII.), who thus became the founder of a dynasty which lasted till
                    1437. This warlike and prosperous monarch was succeeded by his son Charles I.,
                    who obtained the imperial dignity as Charles IV., and left Bohemia in a
                    flourishing and influential position at his death in 1378. Under his successors,
                    who fell far below the character of their ancestor, the country was thrown into
                    confusion by the Hussite reformation, which resulted in a protracted war
                    (1419-1434). The success of the reforming party led to an elective monarchy, and
                    after various vicissitudes, George of Podiebrad mounted the throne in 1458; and
                    in spite of Papal bull and Hungarian arms maintained his position till his death
                    in 1471. His successor, the Polish prince Ladislas, ultimately obtained also the
                    crown of Hungary; but under him and his son Louis (1517-1526) the nobility made
                    themselves more and <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit03newyrich/page/n878/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0903-0878-0861"/> more independent of the king, and the common
                    people were crushed deeper into serfdom. On the death of Louis, in a battle
                    against the Turks at Mohacz, Bohemia passed into the hands of Ferdinand of
                    Austria, who treated the kingdom in the most despotic manner, and in 1547
                    declared it a hereditary possession. He was followed in succession by his son
                    Maximilian II. and his grandson Rudolph IL, who left the country as distracted
                    as they found it. The son of Matthias, the next king, was rejected by the
                    Protestant party, which chose in his stead Frederick V. of the Palatinate; but
                    the victory at the White Mountain in 1620 left Bohemia at the mercy of the
                    emperor, who inflicted a terrible vengeance on his enemies, and in 1627 declared
                    the country a purely Catholic and hereditary kingdom of the empire. Owing to
                    this no fewer than 30,000 families are said to have gone into exile and the
                    population of the country was reduced to 800,000. On the death of Charles VI.
                    Charles Albert of Bavaria laid claim to the crown, which continued to be an
                    object of dispute though the Silesian campaigns and the Seven Years’ War, but
                    was successfully defended by Maria Theresa and her son Joseph II. The country
                    was greatly benefited in many way3 by the government of that monarch; but he
                    destroyed the independence of the royal towns, and treated the whole land as a
                    mere province of the empire. Its religious condition was considerably improved,
                    however, by an edict of toleration published in 1781. Under the succeeding
                    reigns the circumstances of Bohemia underwent but little alteration, and it was
                    hardly affected by the first French Revolution. In 1848, however, a determined
                    “national” movement agitated the country. The demands of the Liberal party
                    gradually increased, and nothing short of a full share in the constitutional
                    government of their country would suffice. The movement was not confined to
                    Bohemia, but spread through the whole Austrian empire, to the article on which
                    (p. 137 of the present volume) the reader is referred. (See Freher, <hi

                <p>The Bohemians or Czechs speak a Slavonic language, which has been subjected to
                    literary culture from about (if not before) the 9th century. A few fragments of
                    a pre-Christian literature have been preserved in a manuscript discovered by
                    Hanka in 1817 in the church-steeple of Königinhof; but the first productions of
                    any extent are due to the activity of the early German Christians, and are
                    composed for the most part in the Latin language. Against this powerful exotic
                    speech the vernacular had a long and dubious struggle, especially in the
                    ecclesiastical domain, and it was still striving against its encroachments when
                    the political circumstances of the nation exposed it to the more dangerous,
                    because more popular and less artificial, rivalry of German. From the court and
                    the capital outward over the nobility and the country there spread a Germanizing
                    energy that at first seemed likely to destroy everything that was distinctively
                    Bohemian; but here and there the national language and customs were fostered and
                    preserved by a few patriotic spirits, among whom the monks of the Slavonic
                    monastery of Sazawa were especially conspicuous. At length the native language
                    obtained the imperial patronage (under Charles IV. ) Dalimil wrote his <hi
                    rend="italic">Rhyming Chronicle of Bohemia</hi> (1314); and translations began
                    to be made from Latin and other languages. Among these were Mandeville’s <hi
                    rend="italic">Travels;</hi> and about the end of the 14th century a complete
                    version of the Scriptures, the manuscript of which is preserved at Nikolsburg in
                    Moravia. Thomas Stitny the domestic moralist, Duba the jurist, and Flaska the
                    didactic poet, deserve to be mentioned as original writers. The next generation
                    saw the attempts at once at religious and at linguistic reform that came to so
                    sad an end in the burning of John Huss and the persecutions that followed. The
                    Bohemian language was, indeed, brought into general use and served the
                    disputants of both sides; but little was consigned to its keeping except the
                    ephemeral productions of ecclesiastical and political strife. A large collection
                    of these works, saved from destruction by the invading Swedes, is still
                    preserved in the library of Stockholm. Of more permanent interest may be
                    mentioned Paul Zidek’s <hi rend="italic">History of the World,</hi> written for
                    George of Podiebrad; the interesting travels of Leo of Rosmital and his
                    companions through various countries of Europe; and those of Kabatnik in Egypt
                    and Asia Minor, and of John of Lobkowitz in Palestine. The 16th century saw a
                    remarkable development of Bohemian prose in various departments of literature.
                    Weleslawin, Paprocky, and Hayek of Liboczun wrote popular histories; Wratislas
                    of Mitrovic and Prefat of Wlkanow gave accounts of their travels; and Nicolas
                    Konec, Dobrensky, and Lomnicky produced didactic works of different kinds. A
                    valuable translation of the Bible was published at Kralitz in Moravia by eight
                    learned Bohemian Brethren at the instigation of John of Zerotin; and various
                    versions of the classics appeared from time to time. A long period of literary
                    decadence followed the battle of the White Mountain in 1620. The best blood of
                    the nation went into exile, and what Bohemian literature was produced appeared
                    for the most part in foreign cities. In 1774 a severe blow was struck at the
                    native language by Maria Theresa’s imperial decree which enforced the use of
                    German in the higher and middle schools of the country. Before long, however,
                    the defence of the mother tongue was taken up by Count Kinsky, Hanka of
                    Hankenstein, the historian Pelzel, and the Jesuit Balbin,—by the last mentioned
                    in a <hi rend="italic">Dissertatio apologetica</hi><hi rend="italic">pro lingua
                    Bohemica.</hi> The language became the object of the scientific investigations
                    of Dobrowsky, and the remains of the early periods were edited by Dobner,
                    Prochazka, and other philologists. A chair of the Bohemian language was founded
                    in the University of Prague, and in 1818 a Bohemian museum was established in
                    connection with a society that devoted itself to the study of national
                    antiquities, and published a valuable journal. Puchmayer (1795-1820) gave an
                    impulse to national poetry, and has been succeeded by Langer, Roko, Wocel,
                    Schneider, Czelakowsky, and Kollar, and a great number of other writers. In the
                    department of science Presl, Sadek. Amerling, Smetana, Petcina, Sloboda, and
                    Opiz have attained distinction. Grammars of the Czech language have been
                    produced by Burian, Hanka, Maly, Sembera, and Tomicek; Sumawsky published a
                    great German-Bohemian dictionary; Spatny, a Bohemian-German and German-Bohemian
                    technological dictionary; and Jungmann a large Bohemian-German lexicon. The
                    names of even the prominent writers in philosophy, theology, and politics are
                    too numerous to be mentioned. (See Schafarik’s <hi rend="italic">Slavisch
