                <p><label type="entry">BEATTIE, <hi rend="smallcaps">James</hi></label>, a Scottish
                    poet and writer on philosophy, was born at Laurencekirk on the 25th October
                    1735. His father, a small farmer and shopkeeper, died when he was very young;
                    but an elder brother took charge of the boy, and observing his aptitude for
                    learning sent him to Marischal College, Aberdeen, where he gained a bursary. In
                    1753 he was appointed schoolmaster of Fordoun, at the foot of the Grampian
                    hills, amongst splendid scenery, which impressed itself deeply on Beattie’s
                    somewhat poetical mind. In 1758 he obtained a situation as undermaster in the
                    grammar school, Aberdeen, and two years later he was made professor of moral
                    philosophy at Marischal College. Here he became closely acquainted with Reid,
                    Campbell, Gerard, and others, who formed a kind of literary or philosophical
                    society, in which speculative questions, above all the views of Hume, were
                    canvassed and criticized. In 1770 Beattie published his <hi rend="italic">Essay
                        on the Nature and Immutability of Truth,</hi> in which he attacked Helvetius
                    and Hume, and advocated the doctrine afterwards familiarly known as that of
                    Common Sense. The work had an astonishing success, and its author, when on a
                    visit to London in 1773, was received with the greatest honour by the king
                    himself. About the same time he received a pension of £200 a year. In 1773 and
                    1774 he published the first and second parts of <hi rend="italic">The
                        Minstrel,</hi> which were received with great favour, and gained for the
                    author a fresh accession of popularity. His later writings are partly literary,
                    such as the <hi rend="italic">Essays,</hi> 1766; <hi rend="italic"
                        >Dissertations,</hi> 1783, partly philosophical; <hi rend="italic">Evidences
                        of Christianity,</hi> 1781; <hi rend="italic">Elements of Moral
                        Science,</hi> 1790-93. Beattie was unfortunate in his domestic life. His
                    wife, whom he married in 1767, was afflicted with insanity, a disease which she
                    appears to have inherited from her mother. Two sons, all his family, died just
                    as they were attaining manhood. The elder, James Hay Beattie, a young man of
                    great promise, who at the age of nineteen had been associated with his father in
                    the professorship, died in 1790. The younger brother died in 1796. Beattie never
                    recovered his second blow. His mind was nearly overthrown by it; his spirit was
                    completely broken, and although he still lectured, he neither wrote nor studied.
                    In 1799 he was attacked with palsy, and continued to suffer from that disease
                    for three years. He died on the 18th August 1803. Beattie’s fame rests now
                    solely on his poems. The much celebrated <hi rend="italic">Essay on Truth</hi>
                    is a work of no philosophic ability, and is disfigured by the violent and
                    intemperate language of the author. His other writings on philosophical
                    subjects, such as the <hi rend="italic">Elements of Moral Science,</hi> are
                    excessively weak, and have fallen into well-deserved oblivion. <hi rend="italic"
                        >The Minstrel,</hi> however, is a work which will always retain a
                    considerable share of popular favour. The ground-plan is simple and well
                    conceived,—to trace the development of poetic genius in a youth from his
                    earliest years up to the time when he becomes able to take his place as a
                    minstrel. There runs through the poem a fine vein of quiet reflection,
                    interspersed with animated descriptions of natural scenery. The versification is
                    smooth <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit03newyrich/page/n482/mode/1up"

                        Beattie,</hi> by his friend Sir W. .Forbes, 1806.)</p>
