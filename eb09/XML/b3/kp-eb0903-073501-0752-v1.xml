                <p>From Birds which have recently become altogether extinct we naturally turn to
                    those that have of late been extirpated, in certain countries though still
                    surviving elsewhere. Several such instances are furnished by the British
                    Islands. First there is the Crane <hi rend="italic">(Grus communis}</hi> which
                    in Turner’s time (1555) was described as breeding in our fens. Then the
                    Spoonbill <hi rend="italic">(Platalea</hi><hi rend="italic">leucorodia},</hi>

                    had done in Norfolk. The Capercally <hi rend="italic">(Tetrao</hi><hi
                        rend="italic">urogallus)</hi> we know to have frequented the indigenous
                    pine-forests of Ireland and Scotland. In the former it had most likely become
                    extinct soon after 1760, and in the latter not much later. Not a single specimen
                    of the British stock of this bird is known to exist in any museum, but the
                    species has been successfully introduced from Sweden into Scotland during the
                    last forty years, and is now certainly increasing in numbers. The Bustard <hi
                        rend="italic">(Otis tarda),</hi> which once tenanted the downs and open
                    country of England from Dorset to the East Riding of Yorkshire, vanished from
                    Norfolk, its last stronghold as a British Bird, in 1838. From other counties it
                    had before disappeared. It is well worthy of note that all the four species just
                    mentioned were protected to a certain degree by Acts of Parliament, but these
                    laws only gave immunity to their eggs and none to the parent-birds during the
                    breeding season, thus shewing how futile is the former when compared with the
                    latter, since there are very many species whose nests from time out of mind have
                    been and are yearly pillaged without any disastrous consequences arising from
                    the practice.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>The

                    landscape and the grateful opportunities of studying many a curious and
                    interesting species. Thanks, perhaps, to the stronger constitution of most
                    Palaearctic Birds, the votaries of what is called “acclimatization” have
                    obtained little success in these islands, for the exotic specieswhich it has
                    been attempting to introduce have, almost without exception, failed to establish
                    themselves. The efforts made in some British colonies—particularly in
                    Australasia—are unfortunately too likely not to be successful; and, when their
                    own peculiar fauna has been half extirpated, our fellow-subjects at the
                    antipodes will probably have good reason to lament the extraordinary sentiment
                    that has led them to introduce from other countries birds which, in the absence
                    of their natural checks, will be nothing else than a positive nuisance; for so
                    reckless is the manner in which they have been imported, that species possessing
                    few or exceedingly doubtful recommendations to begin with have been carried over
                    in abundance, and some of these cannot fail to become permanent settlers equally
                    with those for the transportation of which the would-be “acclimatizers” might
                    find themselves excused. All, however, in the battle of life will contribute
                    first to the subdual and by degrees to the disappearance of the original
                    inhabitants, which had hitherto constituted a fauna, from a scientific point of
                    view, perhaps the most interesting on the face of the globe.</p>
                <p>GEOGRAPHICAL DISTRIBUTION OF BIRDS.</p>
                <p>It is admitted by nearly all naturalists that the study of the extinct organisms
                    of any country leads the investigator of them to a proper appreciation of its
                    existing flora or fauna; while, on the other hand, a due consideration of the
                    plants or animals which may predominate within its bounds cannot fail to throw
                    more or less light on the changes it has in the course of ages undergone. That
                    is to say that the Distribution of forms in Time is a subject so much connected
                    with the Distribution of forms in Space, that the one can hardly be separated
                    from the other. Granting this as a general truth, it must yet be acknowledged as
                    a special fact, which some of the preceding paragraphs will perhaps have
                    foreshadowed, that in fossil Ornithology we have as yet but scanty means of
                    arriving at any precise results which will justify bold generalization in the
                    matter of aviarian distribution. Remains of extinct forms of Birds are, compared
                    with those of other classes of Vertebrates, exceedingly scarce, and in
                    accordance, therefore, with the prevalent practice of naturalists they have been
                    but little investigated. If we except France and New Zealand—and in the latter
                    no fossil ornithic relics can be assigned to any very ancient epochs—little has
                    been done. The discovery in the former of somewhat early remains of Birds,
                    allied to those which we at present only know as denizens of a tropical region,
                    and the recognition of far later remains of species identical with those that
                    now flourish in arctic lands, merely corroborates what is from numerous sources
                    within the knowledge of every geologist—the vicissitudes, namely, of which that
                    part of Europe has had experience. Though in this quarter of the globe we now
                    have no indigenous Struthious Birds, the former existence of Struthious Birds
                    even in England provee very little, because we know that some of such birds (the
                    species of South-American <hi rend="italic">Rhea,</hi> for instance) can
                    maintain themselves in lands which are subject to a climate as fitful, if not as
                    severe, as our own. All that can be justly inferred thence is that Struthious
                    Birds were not formerly confined to their present limits, and possibly that such
                    birds once pervaded the greater part of the earth’s surface. The <hi
                        rend="italic">Archaeopteryx</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Odontopteryx</hi>
                    from their singularity prove nothing in respect of Geographical Distribution.
                    Perhaps in the whole range of zoology there is no class from the fossil remains
                    of which we learn less as regards the physical history of our planet than we do
                    from the Birds. We, therefore, have to turn to the other side of the question of
                    Distribution, and try to find out whether the <pb break="no"

                    evidently deficient, may not be supplied by inquiry into existing <hi
                        rend="italic">avifauna</hi>. and this, in other words, signifies that a
                    knowledge of the Geographical Distribution of living Birds becomes a matter of
                    prime necessity to every one who would intelligently exercise the calling of an
                    ornithologist.</p>
                <p>Thus driven to a kind of extremity, the student of Birds, however, cannot but
                    regard with the most lively satisfaction the circumstance that to one of his
                    brethren is due the merit of having first truly pointed out the great
                    Zoogeographical Regions of the globe—a fact not a little surprising w hen w e
                    reflect that the outlines of Distribution laid down in 1857 by Mr Sclater<note

                            130-145. It is much to be regretted that the author of this most
                            valuable essay has never sanctioned its republication in another and
                            improved form. Many of its details, and some of its principles even, are
                            now known to be incorrect, but for the time at which it appeared it was
                            a marvellous production.</p></note> had reference only to the most
                    vagrant Class of animals in creation; yet these outlines have, not merely in the
                    main, but to a very great extent in detail, met with the approval of nearly all
                    those zoologists who have since studied the subject in its bearing upon the
                    particular Classes in the knowledge of which they themselves stand
                    pre-eminent.</p>
                <p>Without infringing upon what must be deemed the generalities of biological
                    Distribution, it is proper to observe that Mr Sclater’s success is to be
                    attributed to the method in which his investigations were carried on—a method in
                    which he had but few predecessors. Instead of looking at the earth’s surface
                    from the point of view which the geographer would take of it (a point of view
                    which had hitherto been adopted by most writers), mapping out the world
                    according to degrees of latitude and longitude, determining its respective
                    portions of land and water entirely regardless of the products of either
                    element, or adhering to its political divisions—time-honoured as they were,—he
                    endeavoured to solve the question simply as a zoologist should, by taking up the
                    branch of the subject with which he was best acquainted, and by pointing out and
                    defining the several Regions of the globe in conformity with the various aspects
                    of ornithic life which they present. But herein there was at once a grave
                    difficulty to be encountered. Birds being of all animals most particularly
                    adapted for extended and rapid locomotion, it became necessary for him to
                    eliminate from his consideration those groups, be they large or small, which are
                    of more or less universal occurrence,<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                        on.</p></note> and to ground his results on what was at that time commonly
                    known as the order <hi rend="italic">Insessores</hi> or <hi rend="italic"
                        >Passeres,</hi> comprehending the orders now generally differentiated as <hi

                        rend="italic">Psittaci.</hi></p>
                <p>On this basis then Mr Sclater was enabled to set forth that the surface of the
                    globe exhibited <hi rend="italic">six</hi> great Regions, each in a marked
                    manner differing from all the rest, though the difference was not always equally
                    important. These Regions he termed respectively the Palaearctic, Ethiopian,
                    Indian, Australian, Nearctic, and Neotropical; and though it is on all accounts
                    better to preserve the names he bestowed on them, it does not seem convenient to
                    follow the order in which he placed them. Thus the Australian Region appears not
                    only to differ more from the others than they do among themselves, but its
                    differences are of a kind which, when its fauna is considered as a whole,
                    suggest a striking peculiarity, namely, that many of the forms of animal life
                    therein found are the direct and not very much modified descendants of types
                    which may very likely at an early period of our planet’s history have
                    predominated over every land, but of types which have since been elsewhere in
                    great part replaced by more highly developed structures. The lower rank in the
                    scale of its most characteristic animals seems to be indisputable, and,
                    therefore, with the Australian Region it appears most proper to begin.<note

                    from the Indian, which, from a geographical and possibly from a geological point
                    of view, seems to be conterminous with it, by the narrow but deep channel which
                    separates the small islands of Bali and Lombok, and will be found to determine
                    the boundary between two entirely distinct portions of the earth’s surface.
                    Midway along this channel we may draw a line in our imagination, and continue it
                    in a north-north-easterly direction up the Strait of Macassar, dividing the much
                    larger islands of Celebes and Borneo. A considerable interchange of animal forms
                    in the two islands last named is indeed to be observed, and even a slight
                    intermingling of the productions of the two former seems now to be going on; but
                    the inosculation is so much less in degree than that which obtains between any
                    other two Regions, while the characteristic, not to say peculiar, zoological
                    types which occupy either side of this line are so divergent, that it may be
                    fairly considered a harder and faster line than any that can elsewhere be found.
                    Between Bali and Lombok, as above stated, it has been shewn by Mr Wallace to be
                    all but perfect, and in his honour this boundary, as real in the abstract as
                    though it existed in the concrete, has been most justly named after the
                    naturalist and traveller who first saw and recognized its importance—“Wallace’s
                        Line.”<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>This name was
                            first given by Professor Huxley <hi rend="italic">{Proc. Zool. Soc.</hi>
                            1868, p. 313), but as it is hardly a geographical term, it will
                            accordingly make no appearance on any save a so-called “physical” map.
                            The value of the discovery above mentioned, of which no one had ever
                            dreamt till it was made by Mr Wallace, seems to justify proper notice
                            from chartographers, and it might be well, therefore, to dignify the
                            channel between Bali and Lombok—named on some maps Lombok Strait—by the
                            appellation of “Wallace’s Strait.”</p></note> As above indicated, this
                    line becomes less definitive as it proceeds further northward'; and though we
                    know it to pass between the Philippine Islands and Sanguir, and again between
                    the former and the Palau group, its further progress in that direction cannot as
                    yet be set down with precision, though it probably runs to the westward of the
                    Ladrones. But hereabouts we lose sight of it, until we arrive at the Sandwich
                    Islands, to the northward of which it must pass, since for reasons presently to
                    be given at greater length that archipelago must be confined within the
                    Australian Region. Southward from Lombok the boundary of the Region rounds the
                    western coast of Australia, and then strikes off in a south-easterly direction
                    to encompass New Zealand and its dependencies. Arrived here it must be drawn so
                    as to include all of what is commonly known as Polynesia, though the characters
                    of the intermittent chain of islets lying parallel to and just to the southward
                    of the Tropic of Capricorn, and a few scattered reefs to the northward of the
                    equator (between long. 108° and 115° W.), are at present insufficiently
                    determined. After encircling, however, the Low Archipelago and the Marquesas,
                    the boundary trends to the north-west, and includes, as before stated, the
                    Sandwich Islands; but thence its precise direction cannot now be traced, owing
                    to the obscurity which veils the numerous islets of the North Pacific Ocean,
                    which <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit03newyrich/page/n755/mode/1up"
                        xml:id="kp-eb0903-0755-0738"/> lie between that group and the coast of Asia.
                    All that can be said for certain is, that it does not comprise the Aleutian
                    Islands, the empire of Japan, or the Loochoos.</p>
                <p>Though the characteristic Mammals of the Australian Region are in every way
                    highly remarkable, entirely comprehending as they do one of the three Subclasses
                        <hi rend="italic">(Omitho-delphia)</hi> and nearly all of a second <hi
                        rend="italic">(Didelphia'),</hi> by far the largest portion of the area it
                    covers is weak if not absolutely wanting in Mammalian life, and the zoological
                    features which mark the Region as a whole are perhaps better exhibited by its
                    Birds than by any other Class of its fauna. This being the case, it may be
                    excusable in this place to dwell longer upon this Region than upon the rest.
                    True it is that we have no Subclass of birds, like the <hi rend="italic"
                        >Ornithodelphia</hi> among Mammals, which is restricted to the Region; but,
                    on the other hand, the instance of the <hi rend="italic">Didelphia,</hi> to
                    which allusion has just now been made, is here almost exactly paralleled by that
                    of the Struthious Birds—the <hi rend="italic">Ratitoe,</hi> to call them by the
                    name now very generally applied to them by the zoologists who recognize them as
                    forming one of the two primary divisions or Subclasses, we may term them, of the
                    Class <hi rend="italic">Aves.</hi> All the existing <hi rend="italic"
                        >Ratitoe</hi> (with the exception of the species of two forms, the Ostriches
                    of Africa and South America, belonging to the genera <hi rend="italic"
                        >Struthio</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Rhea,</hi> and comprising at most but
                    five species) are found within the Australian Region and nowhere else. But
                    further, the <hi rend="italic">Ratitoe</hi> of the Region are more •widely
                    distributed throughout its area than are the <hi rend="italic">Didelphia,</hi>
                    since the former extend from Ceram, in lat. 4° S. and long. 130° E., to New
                    Zealand in lat. 45° S. and long. 175° E., if not a little further, while the <hi
                        rend="italic">Didelphia</hi> stop short at lat. 44° S. and long. 155°
                        E.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Of course, as
                            regards polymorphism, no comparison can be made between the <hi
                                rend="italic">Ratitas</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">Didelphia,</hi>
                            the latter presenting a very great variety and the former a very great
                            sameness of structure and habit, though if it be true, as seems to be
                            most likely the case, that <hi rend="italic">Dinornis</hi> and its
                            allies were absolutely devoid of wings, we should in them have a
                            divergence from the normal ornithic type which is altogether unique in
                            the whole Class, and for its singularity might well be set off against
                            the multifariousness exhibited by the <hi rend="italic"
                            >Didelphia.</hi></p></note> But if we take the birds alone, and compare
                    the two Subclasses into which the existing or recent members of the Class are
                    divided, we find the Australian Region remarkable for its ornithic singularity.
                    The smaller of these two Subclasses, the <hi rend="italic">Ratitoe,</hi>
                    contains six very natural groups—which might well be called Orders—including,
                    according to the most exaggerated computation of their number, less than 40
                    species, while the larger Subclass, the <hi rend="italic">Carinatoe,</hi> though
                    perhaps not including more truly natural groups, comprehends some 10,000
                    species. Now, out of the six groups of this smaller Subclass, four are
                    absolutely restricted to the Australian Region, and these four groups contain
                    all but, at the highest estimate, as above stated, five of the species known to
                    belong to the Subclass; thus we should be able to regard the 35 species of
                    recent <hi rend="italic">Ratitoe</hi> of the Region (a number which is clearly
                    far too large) as the proportional equivalent of an avifauna of more than 8000
                    species (8750).</p>
                <p>Leaving, however, such a calculation as this, which indeed cannot as yet be more
                    than an approximation to the truth, we must consider first the remaining
                    ornithic features of the Region as a whole, and then those of its parts. With
                    respect to each of those subjects, it will be evident to every one that a
                    further division is at once incumbent upon us. The prevalent zoological features
                    of any Region are of two kinds—negative and positive. It is therefore just as
                    much the business of the zoogeographer, who wishes to arrive at the truth, to
                    ascertain what groups of animals are wanting in any particular locality
                    (altogether independently of its extent) as to determine those which are
                    forthcoming there.</p>
                <p>Of course, in the former case it would be absurd to regard as a physical feature
                    of any great value the absence from a district of groups which do not occur
                    except in its immediate neighbourhood; but when we find that certain groups,
                    though abounding in some part of the vicinity, either suddenly cease from
                    appearing or appear only in very reduced numbers, and occasionally in abnormal
                    forms, the fact obviously has an important bearing. Now, as has been above
                    stated, mere geographical considerations, taken from the situation and
                    configuration of the islands of the so-called Indian or Malay Archipelago, would
                    indicate that they extended in an unbroken series from the shores of the Strait
                    of Malacca to the southern coast of New Guinea, which confronts that of North
                    Australia in Torres Strait, or even further to the eastward. Indeed, the very
                    name Australasia, often applied to this part of the world, would induce the
                    belief that all the countless islands, be they large or small—and some of them
                    are among the largest on the globe—were but a southern prolongation of the
                    mainland of Asia. But. it has been already stated that so far from this being
                    the case a very definite barrier is interposed. A strait, some 15 miles or so in
                    width, and separating the two fertile but otherwise insignificant islands of
                    Bali and Lombok, makes such a frontier as can hardly be shewn to exist
                    elsewhere. The former of these two islands belongs to the Indian Region, the
                    latter to the Australian, and between them there is absolutely no true
                    transition— that is, no species are common to both which cannot be easily
                    accounted for by the various accidents and migrations that in the course of time
                    must have tended to mingle the productions of islands so close to one another.
                    The faunas of the two are as absolutely distinct as those of South America and
                    Africa, and it is only because they are separated by a narrow strait instead of
                    the broad Atlantic that they have become so slightly connected by the
                    interchange of a few species and genera.</p>
                <p>Now, first, of the forms of Birds which are prevalent throughout the Indian
                    Region, but are entirely wanting in the Australian, we have at once the Bulbuls
                        <hi rend="italic">(Ixidoe),</hi> very characteristic of most parts of Africa
                    and Asia, with the allied group of <hi rend="italic">Phyllomithidoe,</hi> which
                    is peculiar to the Indian Region; the widely-spread families of Barbets <hi

                <p>Turning to the families which by their presence characterize the Australian
                    Region, we find those which are peculiar to it to be perhaps, if not more
                    numerous, yet more remarkable than the peculiar families of any other Region.
                    Nearly 20 such might here be enumerated. One, the Honeysuckers <hi rend="italic"

                    extends to almost every part of the region, yet only a single species oversteps

                    more confined, and, since by their means (as will presently appear) the various
                    subdivisions of the Region may be more clearly marked out, further notice of
                    them may be for the present deferred. But the positive characteristics of the
                    Region as a whole are not its peculiar forms alone; there are at least 4
                    families which, being feebly represented elsewhere, here attain the maximum of

                    groups, though widely distributed throughout the world, arrive in the Australian
                    Region at their culmination, presenting an abundance of most varied forms. These
                    are theWeaver-birds (2‰α√cε),and theM0rep0rks(P0dαr7i√ce). if they can be

                <p>Without going into greater detail, the Australian Region may be roughly said to
                    be composed of <hi rend="italic">four</hi> Subregions, to which the names of
                    Papua (or New Guinea), Australia proper, New Zealand, and Polynesia may perhaps
                    be attached. The boundaries of some of these Subregions are, as may be expected,
                    not well defined; and, indeed, it is obvious that much must be done in the way
                    of geographical exploration before the investigation of zoologists will mark out
                    their limits with positive accuracy. Especially is this true in respect of the
                    first of these Subregions, which in certain parts shows a complication of
                    characters that for want of space could hardly here be explained, if, indeed,
                    according to our present information, they can be explained at all.</p>
                <p>(1.) <hi rend="italic">The Papuan Subregion,</hi> the chief province of which is
                    formed by New Guinea and its dependencies, comprises, besides the large and
                    imperfectly-known island whence its name is derived, three other provinces,
                    which may be named the Timorese, the Celebesian, and the Moluccan. The fauna of
                    the Timor group seems to be made up of contributions from Java, belonging to the
                    Indian region, the Moluccas, and Australia. Of nearly 100 genera and 160 species
                    of Land-birds only, which are here found, an equal proportion appears to be
                    related to the Birds of the Indian Region and to those of Australia proper—some
                    30 genera being distinctly traceable to each. The Indian influence is made
                    evident by the presence of about 27 genera which have crossed the strait from
                    Bali into Lombok. Of these, 12 are known to stop short at Flores, but the inter
                    vening island of Sumbawa has not yet been ornithologically explored, and 13 of
                    them reach Timor. In all there may be, disregarding birds of wide distribution,
                    some 30 species of Indian origin, with nearly· 20 thereto allied, but, on the
                    other hand, more than 60 which are derived from Australia, thus indicating a
                    greater affinity to the latter country. There is one genus of Kingfishers <hi
                        rend="italic">(Caridonax)</hi> known only from Lombok and Flores, but no
                    doubt represented in Sumbawa, and a genus of Pigeons <hi rend="italic"
                        >(Leucotreron)</hi> is almost limited to this group.</p>
                <p>The Celebesian province is known to be inhabited by more than 200 species,
                    belonging to about 150 genera. Of the Land-birds, 9 genera and nearly 70 species
                    are absolutely confined to the principal island, but 20 more are found also in
                    the Sula and Sanguir islands, making nearly 90 species peculiar to this
                    Subregion. Of those which are not peculiar, Lord Walden<note anchored="true"
                        place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi rend="italic">Transactions of the
                                Zoological Society,</hi> viii. pp. 23-118.</p></note> estimates that
                    about 55 are of Indian and 22 of Australian origin, the remainder being common
                    to both Regions, and thus the Indian influence is very strong in this quarter,
                    pointing to an immigration from the north and west. Of the less wide genera of
                    Celebes, more than 20 are common to Borneo and Java, and nearly as many to Timor
                    or the Moluccas—again showing a preponderance of Indian over Australian types;
                    but, since the Bornean and Javan species consist of only about one-quarter of
                    those which are characteristic of those islands, while the Moluccan and Timorese
                    genera form nearly one-half, the proportion which has been drawn from the rest
                    of the Australian Region is clearly greater than that which has flowed in from
                    the Indian. The most important family of <hi rend="italic">Meliphagidoe,</hi>
                    however, which, as before remarked, is so highly characteristic of the
                    Australian Region, is here represented by a single species only <hi
                        rend="italic">(Mgzomela chlor</hi><hi rend="italic">opterai),</hi> and the
                    fact requires due acknowledgment. On the other hand, some 8 Indian families
                    which are very important in Borneo and Java are altogether absent, and the
                    non-appearance of a still greater number of Moluccan forms is also worthy of
                    note. The conclusion at which Mr Wallace arrives from these and some other
                    circumstances is that Celebes, during the existing epoch, has never been united
                    by extensive land with either side, but has received an influx of immigrants
                    from each. Of the genera found in Celebes itself 9 are peculiar, 3 more occur in
                    one other island only, and 1 (which is likely to be eventually discovered in
                    Celebes) is as yet known but in the Sula group-Of these 13 genera peculiar to
                    the Subregion, about one-third are modifications of Australian forms. The Sula
                    Islands show a considerable blending of faunas; out of nearly 40 species of
                    Land-birds, more than one-half are identical with or allied to those of Celebes;
                    but 3 Moluccan genera, unknown to Celebes, occur here.</p>
                <p>We have now to consider the Papuan province. The island of New Guinea, which is
                    the centre of the whole Papuan Subregion, has been until lately almost entirely
                    unexplored, and even at the present day its interior has been but scarcely and
                    cursorily visited by civilized foreigners. Yet out of nearly 350 species of
                    Land-birds, belonging to 125 genera, which are known to us from this country,
                    300 species are exclusively peculiar to it, and 36 genera are either peculiar or
                    only just extending to North Australia. Of the remaining genera, 38 are peculiar
                    to the province, 45 are characteristically Australian, 9 more especially belong
                    to the Malay Archipelago generally, being as much Australian as Indian.’ Only 7
                    are typically Indian, ¾ut with a discontinuous distribution, while 25 have a
                    wide range. The chief features of the province to be noted are the extraordinary
                    development therein of the Cassowaries <pb break="no"

                    Malayan, and nearly as many more have apparently the same origin, but, curiously
                    enough, are not found in the intervening Moluccan province. Thus it will be seen
                    that the avifauna of New Guinea is pre-eminently that of the Austral·ian Region,
                    and that it has many peculiar devel·opments of Australian types; but that there
                    has also been an infusion of Malayan forms, of which one group is spread pretty
                    uniformly over the whole Archipe1ago, if not beyond it; while another group
                    presents a rare instance of discontinuous distribution—not appearing in an
                    intervening space of 1000 miles across, though that space is full of islands to
                    all appearance habitable by such forms. The birds of Papua are, as a whole,
                    remarkable for their brilliancy of plumage, one-half of the species occurring
                    there being so distinguished, and no 1ess than 12 genera are decorated by the
                    metallic colouring of their feathers. The Birds-of-Paradise, the Racquet-tailed
                    Kingfishers, the 1argest and small·est of the Parrot tribe, namely, <hi

                    among its productions.</p>
                <p>The chief dependencies of New Guinea require some little notice. These are the
                    Aru Islands in the west, and New Britain and New Ireland in the east, with the
                    Solomon Islands as still more distant outliers in the same direction, and the
                    Louisiade group in the south. The first, separated by 150 miles of sea from
                    Papua, has over 100 species of Land-birds, of which, however, about four-fifths
                    have been found also on the mainland; but among those which are peculiar are two
                    of the finest <hi rend="italic">Paradiseidae</hi> —one of them belonging to a
                    distinct genus <hi rend="italic">(Cicinnurus)—</hi> and there is the very

                    occurring in the group. Of the ornithological features of New Britain and New
                    Ireland not much is known, save that the former is inhabited by a species of
                    Cassowary, and that both are intimately connected with New Guinea. The avifauna
                    of the Solomon Islands is in some degree better understood, and 30<note

                        rend="italic">(Habroptila)</hi> to which the same epithet will apply. One
                    genus is common to Ceram and Celebes, and another is found in Australia, whence
                    possibly it is a migrant, while 30 genera are characteristic of the Papuan
                    Subregion, and nearly 40 more, of more or less wide range, are found in and
                    probably derived from New Guinea. Finally, there are some 12 genera which do not
                    occur in New Guinea, and belong wholly or mainly to the Indian Region, but there
                    are only 3 characteristically Indian types met with in the Moluccas, and all of
                    them are there represented by distinct and well-marked species. The avifauna of
                    the Moluccan province is therefore thoroughly that of the Papuan Subregion, and
                    is no less clearly derivative from that of New Guinea, but not fewer than 11
                    forms of Birds-of-Paradise <hi rend="italic">(Paradiseidae),</hi> with more than
                    12 other characteristically Papuan genera, are wanting, and therefore, in Mr
                    Wallace’s opinion, it would seem as though the province is not a fragment of any
                    old Papuan territory, a supposition supported by the fact that most Moluccan
                    birds are very distinct from their representatives in New Guinea. Amongst the
                    most characteristic forms are the scarlet Brush-tongued Parrots <hi
                        rend="italic">(Lorius</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Eos),</hi> found, it is
                    believed, in every island of the group, but not in the Celebesian or Timorese
                    provinces. One species of <hi rend="italic">Eos</hi> from Siau and Sanguir
                    intimates that those islands belong to the province. <hi rend="italic"
                        >Eclectus,</hi> another scarlet Parrot, but belonging to a different family,
                    also is equall·y characteristic with the Parrots j ust mentioned. As a rule, the
                    birds of the Moluccan province are larger and more conspicuous than the allied
                    species from neighbouring parts.</p>
                <p>On the whole, the avifauna of the Papuan Subregion presents some very remarkable
                    features, but most of them must be here briefly treated by way of summary.
                    Unquestionably its most distinctive characteristic is to be found in the
                    presence of the Birds-of-Paradise <hi rend="italic">(Paradiseidae),</hi> which
                    are almost peculiar to it; for, granting that the Bower-birds <hi rend="italic"
                        >(Chlamydera</hi> and others) of Australia should be classed in this family,
                    it must be admitted that they are very abnormal, or perhaps, to take firmer
                    ground, that they are far less highly specialized than the beautiful and
                    extraordinary forms which are found, and found only within very restricted
                    limits, in the various islands of the Subregion. It would be easy, if space
                    allowed, to dwell at length on the many points of interest with respect to those
                    wonderful birds, though in truth we know but little of them.</p>

                    indeed, that at present it would be almost impossible to subdivide it into

                    its peculiar species bear a greater proportion to the rest than is the case in
                    the Papuan Subregion. Though the western, and especially the north-western,
                    parts of the country, which have been as yet but imperfectly investigated, will
                    no doubt yield more results on further examination, it is already evident that
                    the greatest animal wealth of Australia lies towards the east. The western
                    portion seems to have but 2 peculiar genera (one of questionable value)—a
                    nocturnal Parrakeet <hi rend="italic">(Geopsittacus),</hi> and a Weaver-bird <hi
                        rend="italic">(Emblema),</hi> which is apparently not very far removed from
                    others of the same group. In the north, as already stated, there is a
                    considerable admixture of genera from the Papuan Subregion, which do not proceed
                    beyond the tropic, and of these <hi rend="italic">Casuarius</hi> is a striking

                    confined to South Australia; and the extreme limits of the Subregion, that is
                    Tasmania, possess in addition only 1 genus, <hi rend="italic">Eudyptes,</hi>

                    the Land-birds, which are few in number, are specifically identical with those

                    the third, or Central-Polynesian province, comprising the Fijian, Tongan, and

                    including the Society Islands and the whole of the Low Archipelago, which may
                    perhaps form a fourth province; and lastly, the Sandwich or Hawaiian Islands.
                    The first of these provinces (so to call them) possesses in the Palau Islands a

                    about 34 genera, 16 of the latter being peculiar, and there may be some 5 genera

                    rest (9 in number) are characteristically those of the Region. Most of the
                    genera occurring elsewhere are here represented by peculiar species, but then 5
                    are common to Australia. Some 7 or 8 are also allied to Australian species, and
                    there are 4 Australian and l Polynesian species. Therefore every degree of
                    similarity to Australia is to be found. Of peculiar genera it will suffice to
                    say that 2 <hi rend="italic">(Myiomoira</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Miro)</hi>
                    belong to the Warblers <hi rend="italic">(SyI</hi><hi rend="italic"

                        <hi rend="italic">Nestor</hi> as constituting a second. There is also an
                    Owl, which has been usually considered the type of a genus <hi rend="italic"

                        >(Notornis),</hi> the last almost, if not quite, extinct. The widely-spread
                    family of Plovers <hi rend="italic">(Charadñülae)</hi> have two not less
                    singular generic developments— <hi rend="italic">'Thinomis</hi> and the

                        rend="italic">(Anatidae), Hymenolaemus</hi> is a very curious form; and,
                    finally, among the <hi rend="italic">Ratitae</hi> we have the whole family of
                    weird-looking Kiwis <hi rend="italic">(Aptery-gidce),</hi> represented by three
                    or four species, which are totally unlike any other existing birds. In all,
                    there is a wonderful amount of specialization, though perhaps in a very straight
                    line from generalized forms; but the affinity to Australian or Polynesian types
                    is in many cases clearly traceable, and it cannot be supposed but that these
                    last are of cognate origin with those of New Zealand. A very long period of
                    isolation must have been required to produce the differences so manifestly to be
                    observed, but a few forms seem at rare intervals to have immigrated, and tlιis
                    immigration would appear to be kept up to our own day, as shewn by the instance
                    of <hi rend="italic">Zosterops lateralis,</hi> which is said to have lately made
                    its first appearance, and to have established itself in the country, as well as
                    by the fact of two Cuckows, the widely-ranging <hi rend="italic">Endynami·s
                        taitensis</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Chrysococcyx</hi><hi rend="italic"
                        >lucidus,</hi> which are annual visitors.</p>
                <p>The most extraordinary ornithic feature of New Zealand, however, is
                    unquestionably the former existence of the gigantic birds of the families <hi
                        rend="italic">Dinomithidae</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Palaptery-gidae,</hi>
                    with a few other contemporary forms. These,however, having been already
                    mentioned there is no need to dwelí further upon them. As a whole, the avifauna
                    of New Zealand must be regarded as one of the most interesting and instructive
                    in the world, and the inevitable doom which is awaiting its surviving members
                    cannot but excite a lively regret in the minds of all ornithologists. This
                    regret is quite apart from any question of sentiment; if it were otherwise, it
                    could not be defended against that sentiment which prompts our colonial
                    fellow-subjects indiscriminately to stock their fields and forests, not only
                    with the species of their mother-country, but with all the fowls of heaven,
                    whencesoever they can be procured. The regret we express arises from the thought
                    that just as we lament our ignorance of the species which in various lands have
                    been extirpated by our forefathers, so our posterity will want to know much more
                    of the present ornis of New Zealand than we can possibly record; for no one
                    nowadays can pretend to predict the scope of investigation which will be
                    required, and required in vain, by naturalists in that future when New Zealand
                    may be one of the great nations of the earth.</p>
                <p>II. The Neotropical Region, though presenting certain affinities to the
                    Australian, and the only one which can be said to be zoologically allied to it,
                    is yet almost as distinct in its character therefrom as it is geographically
                    distant Excepting towards its northern limits, where it meets and inosculates
                    with the Nearctic Region, the boundary of the Neotropical Region is simple
                    enough to trace, comprehending as it does the whole of South America from Cape
                    Hom to the Isthmus of Panama and all Central America, and reaching in North
                    America to somewhere about the twenty-second parallel of north latitude; besides
                    including the Falkland Islands to the south-east,<note anchored="true"

                            be referred to the Neotropical rather than to the Ethiopian Region. On
                            this lone spot but four species of Land-birds are known to occur, all of
                            which are peculiar —two of them even generically. One is <hi

                                >(Νesospiza acunhae)</hi> is the type and sole member of a genus
                            which, whether it be considered a Finch or a Bunting, is said by Dr
                            Cabanis, its describer, to have unquestionable similarity to some South
                            American forms <hi rend="italic">{Joum.</hi><hi rend="italic"

                    Galapagos under the equator to the west, as well as the whole of the Antilles or
                    West-India Islands up to the Florida Channel, which separates them from the
                    peninsula of that name. Though over none but the remotest corners of this
                    sufficiently large area is the supreme Class of animals formed (as we have found
                    it to be the case throughout by far the greater portion of the Australian
                    Region) by the Birds, yet they here play a part of very great importance, owing
                    to the comparatively scanty number of Mammalian types. Among these last,
                    however, there are two remarkable groups—the <hi rend="italic">Pedimana,</hi>
                    containing the only members of the Subclass <hi rend="italic">Didelphia</hi>

                    India, attains in South America the summit of its development in variety and
                    number of forms; and we cannot adduce any examples of Orders or Suborders from
                    the Class <hi rend="italic">Aves,</hi> the circumstances of which will exactly
                    match those of these three groups of <hi rend="italic">Mammalia.</hi> The
                    nearest approach, perhaps, is made in one way by the South-American Ratite
                    birds, of which one entire group, consisting of at most three species <hi
                        rend="italic">(Rheidoe),</hi> is peculiar to the region, and thus to some
                    extent parallels the case of the <hi rend="italic">Pedimana;</hi> but while
                    these last also invade the Nearctic Region, the formerare not even spread over
                    the whole of continental South America, being limited to its colder portion.
                    Moreover, so far as Orders have been generally understood and accepted by
                    ornithologists among Carinate Birds, there is no one of wide range which can
                    compare with the overwhelming development of the Edentates in the Neotropical
                    Region. On the other hand, it must be observed that the Region claims all the

                    also a single very remarkable form <hi rend="italic">(Oρisthocomus),</hi> which
                    he has satisfactorily shown to be so unlike every other that it can only be

                            the differential standard, and renders a comparison between “Orders” of

                    similarity between the avifaunas of the two Regions seems to be further borne
                    out by the same fact being observable of other South-American families, forming
                    what may be called the lower Suborders<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    originating in the Neotropical Region, are without doubt therein most abundantly
                    produced. The significance of this fact is enhanced when we remember that, as
                    has been said before, to consider rightly the problem of the distribution of

                    and therefore to be just now disregarded) need not especially excite our wonder.
                    But the characteristic nature of the avifauna of the Region is more clearly
                    brought out when we learn that of the 1997 species just mentioned, 1070 only
                    belong to the higher Suborder <hi rend="italic">(Polymyodae),</hi> leaving 927

                    This is a state of things which exists nowhere else on the globe; for, except in
                    Australia, where a few but uncertain number of purely indigenous and peculiar
                    non-polymyodous <hi rend="italic">Passeres</hi> are found, and in the Nearctic
                    Region whither one family of <hi rend="italic">Oligomyodoe</hi> has evidently
                    been led by the geographical continuity of its soil with that of the Neotropical
                    Region, such forms do not occur elsewhere. Accordingly their disproportionate
                    prevalence in South America and its neighbouring lands points unerringly to the
                    lower rank of the ornis of the region as a whole, and therefore to the propriety
                    of taking it next in order to that of the Australian Region, the general fauna
                    of which is admittedly the lowest in the world. It is believed that much the
                    same result would follow from a similar examination of other Orders, especially

                <p>Leaving, however, this matter as in some degree hypothetical, though its
                    probability can hardly be denied, we have as genera, families, or perhaps even
                    larger groups a great many very remarkable forms which are characteristic of or
                    peculiar to the Neotropical Region in part, if not as a whole. Of families we
                    find 23, or maybe more, absolutely restricted thereto, besides at least 8 which,
                    being peculiar to the New World, extend their range into the Nearctic Region,
                    but are there so feebly developed that their origin may be safely ascribed to
                    the southern portion of America. First in point of importance comes the
                    extraordinarily beautiful family of Humming-birds <hi rend="italic"
                        >(Trochilidoe)</hi><hi rend="italic">,</hi> with nearly 120 genera (of which
                    only 5 occur in the Nearctic Region), and more than 400 species. Then the
                    Tyrants <hi rend="italic">(Tyrannidae),</hi> with more than 70 genera (8 of
                    which range into the northern Region), and over 300 species. To these follow the
                    Tanagers <hi rend="italic">(Tanagridoe),</hi> with upwards of 40 genera (only 1
                    of which crosses the border), and about 300 species; the Piculules <hi
                        rend="italic">(Dendrocolaptidoe),</hi> with as many genera, and over 200
                    species; the Ant-Thrushes <hi rend="italic">(Formicariidoe),</hi> with more than
                    30 genera, and nearly 200 species; together with other groups which, if not so
                    large as those just named, are yet just as well defined, and possibly more
                    significant, namely, the Tapaculos <hi rend="italic">(Ptero-</hi><hi
                        rend="italic">ptochidoe),</hi> the Toucans <hi rend="italic"

                        >(Eurypyga).</hi></p>
                <p>Having thus briefly indicated some of the chief characteristic and for the most
                    part generally distributed forms of the Neotropical avifauna, we have next to
                    consider the separation of the Region into Subregions and provinces. Herein we
                    find far greater difficulty than we had to encounter in treating of the
                    preceding (the Australian) Region, the geographical peculiarities of which
                    marvellously lend themselves to its comparatively easy partition, while the
                    isolation of its several portions contributes in an extraordinary<pb break="no"
                        facs="ia:encyclopediabrit03newyrich/page/n761/mode/1up"
                        xml:id="kp-eb0903-0761-0744"/> degree to the process. But compared with the
                    remaining Regions of the globe, the Neotropical, as it will be essayed to show
                    in the sequel, presents, perhaps, no greater difficulty in this respect than
                    others do. The Subregions (one excepted), however, cannot be said to be well
                    defined, for no natural boundaries are to be found for them, and we must trust
                    solely to the presence or absence of certain forms of Bird-life in marking out
                    their limits. This is, of course, the most proper zoological method of
                    proceeding, but in some cases it tends to make the divisions rather more than
                    less arbitrary, and in all cases dependent upon the amount of investigation
                    which has been bestowed on the several districts. The physical features of the
                    continent of South America are very varied, and cannot be said to assist us much
                    or at all in our task. The proximity of its southern extremity to an ocean
                    wherein at one season of the year floating ice abounds, gives that portion a
                    rigorous climate, and the presence of the grand chain of the Andes, the highest
                    save one in the world, prolongs beyond the equator those characteristics of a
                    mountainous or even an alpine tract, which override any that are commonly
                    associated with degrees of latitude. This range, the great Cordillera, has also
                    a remarkable effect first on the climatological properties of the whole country,
                    and then on its vegetation, which, of course, acts directly on its animal
                    inhabitants. Running as the Andes do pretty nearly longitudinally, and lying
                    near the western coast of the continent, the warm, moist winds from the Atlantic
                    sweep across its eastern and wider portion, unimpeded in their course by any
                    considerable high land, till they are attracted by the summits of the giant
                    range, and, precipitating their fertilizing showers on its lofty slopes, supply
                    the brimming floods of some of the largest rivers of the world. Westward of the
                    chain is in great part a desert, at least down to lat. 10° S., though much of
                    this was, prior to the conquest of Peru by the Spaniards, carefully irrigated
                    and highly luxuriant. A few other arid tracts are found, but compared with most
                    other continents the proportion of desert-land is small, and the valleys of the
                    majestic rivers which roll their course to the Atlantic are clothed with the
                    most extensive virgin forests in the world. To these varied physical conditions
                    seem due the chief differences which are observable in the avifauna of the
                    component parts of the South-American continent, which, rich as it is beyond
                    that of all other countries in genera and species, displays yet a considerable
                    uniformity in its larger groups of Birds.</p>
                <p>The Subregions into which that portion of the earth at present under
                    consideration can be most conveniently separated seem to be <hi rend="italic"
                        >six</hi> in number—four of them included within the continent of South
                    America, and two lying beyond its limits.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                        type="authorial"><p>In arriving at this conclusion the author wishes to
                            acknowledge the kind assistance he has received from his old friend Mr
                            Salvin, F.R.S., whose long-continued study of American, and especially
                            Neotropical, forms of birds has placed him in the front rank of
                            authorities on the ornithology of the New World.</p></note> But the
                    confines of these continental Subregions, as has been above hinted, are of the
                    vaguest. It is doubtful whether any amount of local knowledge will ever justify
                    the zoogeographer in drawing an absolute line of demarcation between any two of
                    them. At present our information certainly does not permit us to do more than
                    indicate the general direction of such boundaries; not that we believe that
                    their existence may not be legitimately assumed. Beginning with the apex of the
                    continent, we have a Subregion, extending from Cape Horn to somewhere north of
                    Bahia Blanca on its eastern coast, whence its boundary runs in a north-westerly
                    direction, passing to the eastward of Mendoza, and then northward along the
                    eastern and higher slopes of the Andes until it crosses the equator, and, after
                    trifurcating on either side of the valleys of the Magdalena and its confluent
                    the Cauca, returns along the western slopes of the lofty Cordillera, until it
                    trends seaward and reaches the Pacific coast of South America somewhere about
                    Truxillo, in lat. 7° S. This Subregion, for a reason presently to be given, may
                    be called the Patagonian, though its northern extremity lies so far removed from
                    its eponymic territory. Next we have what may be called the Brazilian Subregion,
                    marching with the foregoing until somewhere near Potosi in Bolivia, whence it
                    turns to the north-east, and, avoiding the watershed of the Amazons, strikes,
                    perhaps, the Paranahyba, through or along which it makes its way to the
                    Atlantic. Then comes the enormous basin of the Amazons—the Mediterranean of
                    South America, as the dwellers on its banks fondly call it—which, though forming
                    an important part of the Brazilian Empire, seems undoubtedly to be a distinct
                    Subregion from that to which this last name has been applied, and may justly be
                    denominated the Amazonian. Yet, be it remembered, that, its peculiarities not
                    being observable on the higher tributaries of the mighty river, its upper waters
                    must be regarded as draining land which belongs to the fourth Subregion—of which
                    more immediately. Continuous to the south-ward with the Brazilian boundary the
                    western frontier of the Amazonian Subregion seems to turn off before the eastern
                    confines of the Patagonian Subregion are reached, and, leaving a space
                    intervening, it pursues a generally northward course, at a lower level, on the
                    western bank of the Huallaga, and crossing the great stream whence it derives
                    its name, in somewhere about long. 77° W. and lat. 5° S., it pursues its way
                    towards the mouth of the Orinoco. The fourth and last Subregion of South America
                    includes all that is left of the continent, and perhaps may be most fitly named
                    the Subandean.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>In some
                            respects it corresponds with what has been commonly called the
                            “Columbian” Subregion; but that name, having been used in a special and
                            more restricted sense, might give rise to some misunderstanding. As will
                            be seen, it comprehends far more than the former United States of
                            Columbia.</p></note> This begins in the south with the narrow slip of
                    land before mentioned as intervening between the comparatively low-lying
                    Amazonian Subregion and that portion of the Patagonian which runs along the
                    lofty Peruvian ' Andes, and is believed to extend from the frontiers of Bolivia
                    to the table-land of Ecuador, rounding, on the one hand, the forked extremity of
                    the Patagonian Subregion to the westward until it meets the Pacific at Truxillo,
                    stretching over 500 miles of sea to the Galapagos Islands, under the equator,
                    and, on the other hand, following the Amazonian boundary to the Atlantic, while
                    it comprehends the islands of Trinidad and Tobago, as well as those which lie on
                    the northern coast of South America. Besides portions of the states already
                    named, it includes Nueva Granada and Venezuela till it reaches the
                    Central-American Subregion in the Isthmus of Panama. This fifth Subregion
                    stretches on the west northward about as far as Guaymas on the east coast of the
                    Gulf of California, and on the east to the Rio Grande, which forms the boundary
                    of Mexico and Texas, but the Nearctic Region dips down along the central
                    table-land till near Queretaro, a little to the northward of the city of Mexico,
                    and thence southward along the higher ridges to an almost indefinite extent. The
                    sixth Subregion is composed of the Antilles, with the important exception of
                    Trinidad and Tobago, and its limits being capable of easy geographical
                    circumscription, further consideration of them may be for the present
                    deferred.</p>
                <p>The difficulty of distinguishing these several Subregions is indeed very great;
                    and it is not only possible, but highly probable that even in a few years
                    further exploration will enjoin a large amount of rectification of their
                    frontiers. It <pb break="no"

                        xml:id="kp-eb0903-0762-0745"/> must be remembered too that where, in the
                    preceding paragraphs, “lines” of demarcation have been spoken of, such lines are
                    in truth tracts of country often from one to two hundred miles in breadth, and
                    in most cases there is no hope that the boundaries will ever attain any great
                    degree of precision. Some advance of knowledge in this direction will no doubt
                    accrue as the elevation and contour of hills and table-lands become more
                    accurately laid down; but at first the effect of this increase to our
                    information will certainly be to complicate matters, by shewing the existence
                    within one Subregion of spurs, isolated spots, or enclosed areas belonging to
                    another, and as yet unsuspected. Still the amount of light thrown on the
                    Neotropical Region by the persevering labours of the eminent ornithologists
                    before named, seems to deserve being brought to a focus; and accordingly the
                    following summary is now offered in the hope that some of the characteristics of
                    the avifauna of the Region may thereby be more readily comprehended.</p>

                <p>This table will serve to shew the close alliance of the four middle Subregions to
                    one another in their most remarkable forms, and, at the same time, the
                    singularity displayed by the Patagonian and Antillean Subregions; while it will
                    also make evident that no family peculiar to the Region is found in all its
                    Subregions.</p>
                <p>(1.) <hi rend="italic">The Patagonian Subregion,</hi> lying chiefly at the
                    southern extremity of the continent·, seems to present the greatest affinity to
                    that in which the Australian avifauna reaches its climax This is shewn not only
                    by the prevalence in it, alone of all the Neotropical Subregions, of the <hi
                        rend="italic">Ratitoe,</hi> which wander over its solitudes, and the
                    Penguins <hi rend="italic">(Spheniscidoe),</hi> which haunt its shores; but by
                    the low, generalized, and peculiar forms like <hi rend="italic">Thinocorus</hi>
                    and <hi rend="italic">Attagis</hi> among the widely-varying <hi rend="italic"
                        >Limicoloe,</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">Pteroptochidoe</hi> (though some
                    few species of this family occur elsewhere in South America) among the <hi
                        rend="italic">Passeres.</hi> The family of Plantcutters <hi rend="italic"
                        >{Phytotomidoe)</hi> is almost peculiar, only just intruding upon Southern
                    Brazil. Of the more characteristic families of Birds of the New World, some 3
                    only <hi rend="italic">(Dendroco-</hi><hi rend="italic">laptidoe,
                        Formicariidoe,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Trochilidoe)</hi> shew themselves
                    in any great abundance, while but 2 other3, which are feebly represented, occur
                    within the ill-defined limits of its southern province, Patagonia,—the rest of
                    its terrestrial, and still more of its littoral or maritime, avifauna consisting
                    of families, or groups of families, which are nearly cosmopolitan. On the pampas
                    of La Plata we find the number of characteristic Neotropical forms much
                    increased, but still the poverty of the Argentine ornis is of the most marked
                    kind when compared with the wealth of the more fertile tracts which lie on its
                    northern and eastern frontiers. In La Plata we have but 2 other familes <hi
                        rend="italic">(fTyrannidoe</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Palamedeidoe)</hi>
                    coming under this category that are at all well developed. <hi rend="italic"
                        >Mniotiltidoe, Vireonidoe,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Coerebidoe</hi> do not
                    appear at all, and <hi rend="italic">Tanagridoe</hi> but in small numbers. As
                    has been said already, the Subregion extends northward along the chain of the
                    Andes, and with this extension it seems proper to take in their arid and barren
                    western slopes as well as a portion of the tract lying between that range and
                    the sea, so as to include Chile and a considerable slice of Peru. But even by so
                    doing we gain but little. No more of the characteristically Neotropical forms
                    mount these lofty ascents in any multitude, nor are we able to add any forms of
                    very wide distribution. However, throughout the whole Subregion many genera, and
                    species without number, which are absolutely peculiar, occur, and thus aid in
                    stamping the quality of the tract. Indeed, the very presence of the Struthious
                    family <hi rend="italic">Rheidoe,</hi> with its two or three species, would
                    serve alone to do this; and as its headquarters are in Patagonia, that country
                    becomes of sufficient importance to give its name to the Subregion of which it
                    forms at most but a moiety.</p>
                <p>Entering more into details, we find the Patagonian Subregion possessing about 46
                    genera of birds not found elsewhere in South America. Of these 30 are strictly
                    Landbirds—3 belonging to the family <hi rend="italic">Emberizidoe,</hi> 1 to <hi

                    and 1 to <hi rend="italic">Rheidoe.</hi> Of the rest there are 3 genera of <hi
                        rend="italic">Charadriidoe</hi> (as restricted), 1 of which <hi
                        rend="italic">(Eudrornias)</hi> is doubtfully identical with a genus of the
                    Old World; 2 genera of the peculiar family <hi rend="italic">Thinoco~</hi><hi
                        rend="italic">ridoe;</hi><hi rend="italic">Chionis,</hi> an antarctic form;
                    2 genera of <hi rend="italic">Scolopacidoe,</hi> one peculiar, the other <hi
                        rend="italic">(Rhynchoea)</hi> rather widely spread over Australia, India,
                    and Africa; 2 genera of <hi rend="italic">Anatidoe,</hi> both peculiar; 2 genera
                    of <hi rend="italic">Laridoe,</hi> one peculiar, the other belonging to subpolar

                    family limited to the Antarctic or Subantarctic Ocean. But further into
                    particulars want of space forbids our going, save to remark on a very peculiar
                    and instructive case offered by <hi rend="italic">Eustephanus,</hi> a genus of
                        <hi rend="italic">Trochilidoe.</hi> Of this section of Humming-birds there
                    are three known species— one, <hi rend="italic">E. galeritus,</hi> found in
                    Chile, evidently its mothercountry, but also occurring from 400 to 600 miles
                    from the mainland on both of the chief islets of the little Juan Fernandez
                    group—Masatierra and Masafuera; but each of these limited spots has besides its
                    own peculiar species of the genus—the former <hi rend="italic">E.
                        femandensis</hi> and the latter <hi rend="italic">E. leyboldi.</hi> This
                    alone would present nothing at all unparalleled elsewhere; but it is curious
                    that while both sexes of the more widely-ranging <hi rend="italic">E.
                        galeritus</hi> have a green plumage, the males of the other two have a
                    brilliant red colour, and generally resemble each other, though the females of
                    each differ more decidedly. Supposing, as we may justly do, that all these
                    species have descended from a common ancestor, Mr Sclater has shewn<note

                                >Ibis,</hi> 1871, pp. 180-183.</p></note> the probability that <hi
                        rend="italic">E. galeritus</hi> represents the appearance of the parental
                    stock that in bygone times colonized the Juan-Fernandez cluster, of which <hi
                        rend="italic">E. femandensis,</hi> now peculiar to Masatierra, and the most
                    aberrant from the original form, is the progeny of the earliest settlers, and
                        <hi rend="italic">E. leyboldi,</hi> confined to Masafuera, is the descendant
                    of a later immigration, while, still more recently, <hi rend="italic">E.
                        galeritus</hi> has found its way to both islets, and in each yet possesses
                    its normal characters.</p>
                <p>Passing over, as not affording anything especially remarkable, the chain of
                    islands, from Chiloe to Cape Horn, in which the range of the Andes plunges into
                    the Southern Ocean, though alongside of it lie Tierra del Fuego and its
                    satellites, which form an important adjunct to the South-American continent, our
                    attention is turned to the Falklands, an interesting and considerable group of
                    islands situated over 200 miles to the north-east of the historic Strait of
                    Lemaire. Here we find 18 species of Land-birds— 7 belonging to the order <hi

                    Subregion is not characterized by the presence, of any family of Birds peculiar
                    to it alone, but among those families which are found in only two Subregions of
                    the Neotropical Region it possesses 3 in common with the Patagonian,— <hi

                <p>families peculiar— <hi rend="italic">Opisthocomidoe</hi> —already mentioned as
                    forming almost a distinct Order, but composed of a single species, the Hoactzin,
                    and <hi rend="italic">ÙidPsophiidoe</hi> or Trumpeters, now a-days regarded as
                    distant allies of the Cranes <hi rend="italic">(Gruidoe),</hi> but presenting
                    many remarkable and unique features. This family also contains but one single
                    genus, including some half-dozen species, the respective range of each
                    appearing, singularly enough, to be separated by rivers. Amazonia possesses no
                    family in common with but one other Neotropical Subregion, but it shares 3 with
                    the Central-American and Subandean. These are <hi rend="italic">Capitonidoe,
                        Eurypygidoe,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Oedicnemidoe,</hi> of which the
                    second only is peculiar to the Region, the first and last being widely
                    distributed. The families which it shares with three other Subregions have been
                    already enumerated, as well as those which by their presence or absence
                    distinguish it from the Brazilian Subregion. The peculiar genera remain to be
                    pointed out. These are but 27 in number: 2 belong to <hi rend="italic"

                        >Psophia</hi> before mentioned. There is another genus also which is worthy
                    of remark, <hi rend="italic">Chenalopex,</hi> belonging to the <hi rend="italic"
                        >Anatidoe,</hi> not found elsewhere in the New World, but common to the
                    Ethiopian Region. Space will not admit of our entering further upon the
                    consideration of the ornithic peculiarities of Amazonia, but perhaps it may be
                    said to form the most self-contained Subregion of the whole continental area of
                    which we are now treating, and we may expect that with the progress of
                    zoological exploration its boundaries may be laid down with tolerable precision.
                    There are no islands which can bo attached to Amazonia.</p>
                <p>(4.) <hi rend="italic">The Subandean Subregion,</hi> from what has been
                    previously indicated of its extent, will be readily seen to offer the most
                    varied conditions of existence of any part of the Neotropical Region, and we
                    shall not therefore be surprised to find its ornis at once rich and remarkable.
                    It might perhaps now, and some day probably will, be broken up into two or more
                    provinces, not to say separated into distinct Subregions, but the means for such
                    partition are at present wanting. Yet there is only one family of Birds peculiar
                    to it, the <hi rend="italic">Steatomithidoe,</hi> composed of a single species,
                    the Guacharo or Oil-bird <hi rend="italic">(Steatomis caripensis),</hi> confined
                    to a very few localities in its eastern portion. In common with Central America,
                    but not elsewhere met with in the Region, it has of Neotropical families <hi
                        rend="italic">Cinclidoe</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Alaudidoe,</hi> though
                    the latter of these two widely-ranging families is but poorly represented by a
                    single species <hi rend="italic">(Otocorys</hi><hi rend="italic"
                        >chrysoloema),</hi> apparently the survivor of an old population (all, or
                    nearly all, of which has perished), stranded, as it were, on the high lands of
                    Columbia. Those families which it possesses that are common to but two other
                    Neotropical Subregions have already been named, and it will be enough to repeat
                    that 1 of them extends to the Patagonian and Brazilian, and the remaining 3 to
                    the Amazonian and Central-American. In like manner have been enumerated the
                    families which are also found in but three other Subregions—1 it has in common
                    with the Amazonian, Brazilian, and Patagonian; 8 with the Central-American,
                    Amazonian, and Brazilian; while 1 of these <hi rend="italic">(Parridoe)</hi> is
                    also found in very distant parts of the world, and 1, also a family of extremely
                    wide range, with the Brazilian, Central American, and Antillean Subregions.</p>
                <p>The genera peculiar to the Subandean Subregion are exceedingly numerous,
                    amounting to no fewer than 72. These may be apportioned as follows: 1 to <hi

                    (as will presently be seen) by that which has occurred in Central America. The
                    habitat of some of these forms of Humming-birds, whether genera or species— and
                    the latter are wonderfully numerous—is extremely restricted. That of <hi
                        rend="italic">Loddigesia</hi><hi rend="italic">mirabilis,</hi> long since
                    described from a still unique specimen in the Loddiges collection, is
                    Chachapoyas in northern Peru, and though possibly more pains has been taken to
                    discover it and compass the capture of other examples than has been the case
                    with any other Bird, it has not been again met with. Its haunts may, therefore,
                    be safely presumed to be especially confined. Two species of <hi rend="italic"
                        >Oreotrochilus (0. chimborazo</hi> and <hi rend="italic">0.
                        pichin-chce)</hi> have their abode almost limited to the slopes of the lofty
                    mountains whence they take their name, and nearly as much may be said of others.
                    The Tanagers <hi rend="italic">(Tana-gridβe)</hi> —birds of varied form, and
                    generally of exquisite plumage—also frequent this Subregion in great force, and
                    among them there is here found, perhaps, the greatest amount of differentiation,
                    both generic and specific.</p>
                <p>Of the hundreds of other curious ornithological characteristics of the Subregion
                    which might easily be cited, no more can here be given, but a brief notice of
                    the avifauna of its extreme points seems to be required. It has now been for
                    some time fully admitted by all competent authorities that the islands of
                    Trinidad and Tobago, which the geographer might be inclined to class with the
                    Antillean chain, must be regarded as being truly portions of the South-American
                    continent, detached in comparatively recent times, and even now only separated
                    from Venezuela by a comparatively shallow sea. Neither of these islands has a
                    single peculiar species,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"
                            ><p>Trinidad has about 350 species—one of them <hi rend="italic"

                            Salvin informs the writer that it has lately been procured in Guiana.
                            The nearest approach, perhaps, to peculiarity is in a Thrush, which was
                            originally described as being specifically distinct, under the name of
                                <hi rend="italic">Turdus</hi><hi rend="italic">xanthoscelus,</hi>
                            but its claims to that consideration are now disallowed.</p></note> and
                    except, perhaps, some stragglers from the north, not one which is not also found
                    on the nearest mainland, though, of course, many inhabitants of the neighbouring
                    continent do not pass either the Dragon’s or the Serpent’s Mouth, as the two
                    narrow channels which cut off Trinidad from South America are called. We may
                    presume that the various islands, Margarita, Curaçao, and Oruba, which He off
                    the northern coast of Venezuela, also belong to this Subregion, though scarcely
                    anything is known of their animal products.</p>
                <p>Very different from this state of things is that which obtains at the opposite
                    extremity of the Subregion. The interesting group of volcanic islands known as
                    the Galapagos present not merely a large number of peculiar species, but 4
                    peculiar genera of Land-birds; 1 of these, <hi rend="italic">Certhidea,</hi>
                    belongs to the <hi rend="italic">Ceerebidoe,</hi> and the other 3, <hi

                        >Cactomis,</hi> seem to come into the family <hi rend="italic"

                            very considerable amount of uncertainty, which at present cannot be

                            position of many of the New-World forms of so-called Buntings <hi
                                rend="italic">(Emberizidoe)</hi> and Finches <hi rend="italic"
                                >(Fringillidoe).</hi> The writer is fully inclined to believe that
                            the distinctness of these two families, which among forms of the Old
                            World has long been recognized, and that almost without difficulty, can
                            be fairly established, since it seems to rest on good osteological
                            characters; but the American genera have not yet been sufficiently
                            examined to allow of many of them being allotted without much doubt.
                            This uncertainty will most likely in time be removed, unless—and such a
                            probability cannot be denied—some of the New-World forms turn out to be
                            so much generalized as to fill up the gap which now presents itself
                            between the two groups as observed in the Old World. Meanwhile, the
                            consequent inconvenience is unavoidable.</p></note> It was Mr Darwin who
                    first drew attention to the remarkable ornis of this archipelago, and here it
                    was, as he has told us, that there dawned upon him from its consideration that
                    theory of “Natural Selection” which has transformed the whole aspect of biology,
                    and, whether wholly or partially accepted, has placed the science upon a new and
                    higher pedestal. Later researches, indeed, have shown the nonexistence of some
                    of the peculiarities which this eminent observer believed, on what was then good
                    evidence, he had determined; but these refer to the restricted distribution of
                    several of the species among the different islands, and are not of any such
                    importance as to affect his general results, while doubtless, had his visit to
                    this “little world within itself,” as he appropriately calls it, been of longer
                    duration, he would have become aware of these minor facts. The strictly-speaking
                    Land-birds of the Galapagos seem to be some 30 in number, of which about 26 are
                        <hi rend="italic">Passeres.</hi> Among these, 1 only, <hi rend="italic"
                        >Oolichonyx oryzivorus</hi> (belonging to the family <hi rend="italic"
                        >Icteridoe),</hi> and obviously a straggler, is identical with a species of
                    the mainland, while 2, a <hi rend="italic">Dendroeca</hi><hi rend="italic"
                        >(Λfniotiltidce),</hi> and a <hi rend="italic">Progne</hi><hi rend="italic"
                        >(Hirundinidoe),</hi> have been by some considered to be distinct species,
                    by others but local races,—which means, of course, that from one cause or
                    another isolation has not yet modified them so as to depart greatly from their
                    congeneric continental forms,—but the remaining 23 (?) are peculiar, and, what
                    is especially worthy of notice, no fewer than 18 (Î), or nearly three-fourths of
                    the whole number, belong to the four peculiar genera. There is also a peculiar
                    species of Buzzard, agreeing closely in every habit and even in tone of voice
                    with the carrion-eating <hi rend="italic">Polybori,</hi> and originally
                    described as the type of a distinct genus under the name of <hi rend="italic"
                        >Cracirex galapagoensis.</hi> Apparently, too, there is a distinct and
                    peculiar Barn-Owl <hi rend="italic">{Aluco punctatissimus),</hi> but alongside
                    of it we have the widely-spread Short-eared Owl <hi rend="italic">{Asio
                        accipitrinus),</hi> though examples of this last are said to present in
                    these islands sufficient difference to justify the bestowal upon them of a
                    distinct specific name. Among Water-birds, the <hi rend="italic">Rallidoe</hi>
                    and <hi rend="italic">Ardeidoe</hi> furnish, the former one and the latter two,
                    species not known elsewhere. A remarkable fact, also, is the asserted existence
                    of a peculiar species of Flamingo <hi rend="italic">(Phoenicopterus</hi><hi
                        rend="italic">glyphorhynchus),</hi> seeing that most of the birds of this
                    genus have a very extended distribution. A Penguin also <hi rend="italic"
                        >(Spheniscus</hi><hi rend="italic">mendiculus)</hi> is at present only known
                    from the Galapagos; but considering the range of other forms of this family <hi
                        rend="italic">(Spheniscidoe),</hi> we should, perhaps, be premature in as
                    yet pronouncing it a peculiar species, though the existence of a Penguin at all
                    under the equator raises a presumption that such may be the case. There is,
                    however, one feature in the avifauna of these islands which should not be
                    overlooked. Notwithstanding that the Galapagos are here placed as forming an
                    outlying portion of the Subandean Subregion, the fact must not be concealed that
                    their omis seems to have no very special or intn⅛ate relation thereto. All that
                    can be averred of it is that it is American. In the subregion just named, as has
                    been above shown, the <hi rend="italic">Trochilidoe</hi> attain their maximum of
                    development, yet no Humming-birds are found in this archipelago. So also with
                    the <hi rend="italic">Tanagridoe,</hi> of which there are abundant Subandean
                    representatives, the <hi rend="italic">Dendrocolaptidoe, Formicariidoe,</hi> and
                    other characteristic Neotropical families. In the Galapagos none of them are
                    found. It is true that the presence of a species of the South-American genus <hi
                        rend="italic">Pyrocephalus,</hi> and of a genus of the Neotropical family
                        <hi rend="italic">Coerebidoe,</hi><hi rend="italic">m&amp;y</hi> be a set
                    off on the other side; but on the whole, it seems quite likely that the
                    relations of this isolated, equatorial province (for so it is entitled to be
                    deemed) are as near to the north as to the south, if not nearer, and it is quite
                    possible that, having its ornithological characters only in view, future
                    zoogeographers may think fit to ally it to the former rather <pb break="no"

                    Reptilian fauna point to a connection, however remote in point of time, with
                    South America, and accordingly the Galapagos are here left in that Region to
                    which they have been commonly assigned.</p>
                <p>(5.) <hi rend="italic">The Central-American Subregion</hi> is the next to be
                    considered, and in treating of it we become aware of a disturbing force which
                    renders impossible the laying down for it of anything like a definite frontier.
                    This disturbing force is the entrance, as before intimated, of a Nearctic fauna
                    which runs along the backbone, so to speak, of the Subregion to an unknown but
                    variable extent; for part of this Nearctic fauna ebbs and flows according to the
                    season of the year, in winter possibly creeping down the mountainsides, and
                    being strongly reinforced by immigrants from the north, but in summer retiring
                    northward and perhaps upward, so as to occupy only the most lofty ridges. Yet
                    that two Subregions here unite and inosculate is certain; but in considering the
                    Central-American avifauna, we have to guard ourselves against this periodic
                    stream of northern immigrants, and cannot deal with it precisely in the same way
                    as we have done those Subregions further removed from the influence which is
                    here so strongly manifested. In Centι⅛J America, though its ornis is of the
                    richest, we find not a single peculiar family of Birds, and those which it, to a
                    more or less limited extent, shows with the other Subregions of the Neotropical

                    small but widely-ranging family of the northern hemisphere, which it has in
                    common with the Antillean Subregion. 5 other families, however, <hi

                    elsewhere in the Region, it seems to have 93, but 47, of just more than half, of
                    them are also found in the Nearctic Region; and therefore to obtain anything
                    like a true notion of the Central-American ornis, it will be necessary to keep
                    the two categories apart. Taking first those which are absolutely peculiar, we

                <p>Nicely balanced as these numbers are, they shew a result which might well have
                    been expected from the physical and geographical configuration of the country,
                    while the numbers of other families peculiar to the Neotropical Region, though
                    shared by some of its Subregions, as already given, prove incontestably the
                    propriety of including Central America with that Region; and this would come out
                    even more plainly did our limits permit of the investigation being extended to
                    species, though so many northern forms here find their winter-quarters. It
                    remains to remark that almost the only island of any importance belonging to the
                    Subregion is Socorro, the largest of a small group lying to the westward of
                    Mexico in lat. 18° 30' N., and long. 1 ll <hi rend="superscript"> 0</hi> W. Here
                    out of 9 species of Land-birds, 4 have been described as peculiar, 2 others are
                    elsewhere known as occurring only on the Très Marias, a little group some 250
                    miles nearer the mainland, and 1 is regarded as a local race of a continental
                    species, leaving but 2 (both Birds-of-prey) which cannot be deemed
                    autochthonous. The still more remote Cocos Island, lying in lat. 5° 33' N., and
                    long. 87° W., from which one peculiar species of <hi rend="italic"
                        >Coccyzus</hi><hi rend="italic">(Cuculidae)</hi> is known, may belong just
                    as likely to the Subandean as to the Central-American Subregion.</p>
                <p>(6.) <hi rend="italic">The Antillean</hi> is the only one of the Neotropical
                    Subregions the precise boundaries of which can be definitely laid down; and it
                    is in many respects one of the most suggestive and interesting, comparatively
                    small though it be. Extending from Cape San Antonio de Cuba in the west to
                    Barbadoes in the east, its greatest length is only about 1700 miles, and from
                    Abaco, one of the Bahamas, in the north to Grenada in the south, it does not
                    cover 15 degrees of latitude, while within these limits the proportion of land
                    to water, being less than 98,000 square miles, is very inconsiderable. The
                    unbroken chain of islands which are commonly known as the “West Indies ”—though
                    that term rightly includes not only all of the “Spanish Main,” but an indefinite
                    extent of coast lying both north and south of the ancient dominions of the
                    Catholic King in the New World—forms, geographically, a second line of
                    connection between the two halves of the American continent, separated from the
                    great western isthmus by the deep waters of the Caribbean Sea and the Gulf of
                    Mexico, and at once suggests a former communication by land with Yucatan at the
                    one extremity and with Venezuela at the other, to say nothing of a possible
                    junction with Florida. Yet, as will presently be shewn from a consideration of
                    the peculiar forms of Bird-life which have grown up along the chain, any such
                    communication, if it ever existed, must have been exceedingly remote in point of
                    time; for narrow as are the channels between Cuba and the opposite coast of
                    Central America, between the Bahamas and the south-western peninsula of North
                    America, and between Grenada and Tobago (the last belonging zoologically, as has
                    been already demonstrated, to South America), the fauna of the Antillean chain,
                    instead of being a mixture of that of the almost contiguous countries, differs
                    much from all, and exhibits in some groups a degree of speciality which may be
                    not unfitly compared with that of oceanic islands. Except such as are of coral
                    formation, the Antilles are hilly, not to say mountainous, their summits rising
                    in places to an elevation of 8000 feet, and nearly all, prior to their
                    occupation by Europeans, were covered with luxuriant forest, which, assisting in
                    the collection and condensation of the clouds brought by the trade winds,
                    ensured its own vitality by precipitating frequent and long-continued rains upon
                    the fertile soil Under such conditions we might expect to find an extremely
                    plentiful animal population, one as rich as that which inhabits the same
                    latitudes in Central America, not many degrees further to the west; but no
                    instance perhaps can be cited which shows more strikingly the difference between
                    a continental and an insular fauna, since, making every allowance for the
                    ravages of cultivation by civilized man, the contrary is the case, and possibly
                    no area of land so highly favoured by nature is so poorly furnished with the
                    higher forms of animal life. Here, as over so large a portion of the Australian
                    Region, we find Birds constituting the supreme class—the scarcity of Mammals
                    being accounted for in some measure as a normal effect of insularity.</p>
                <p>Glancing at the entire chain, we may first set aside the Bahamas, a succession of
                    emerged coral-reefs founded on, and to the south and east surrounded by, shoals
                    or banks, broken only here and there by deeper channels; and then by drawing a
                    line to the south of the islands of St Croix <pb break="no"
                        facs="ia:encyclopediabrit03newyrich/page/n766/mode/1up"
                        xml:id="kp-eb0903-0766-0749"/> and St Bartholomew, we find that this line
                    divides the chain into two groups of distinct character—that lying to the
                    southward and eastward, almost identical with the “Windward Islands” of some
                        geographers,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>In the
                            language of others, the “Windward Islands” begin'with Martinique and so
                            continue to Trinidad, while the remainder of the Lesser Antilles, lying
                            eastward of Porto Rico, are called the “Leeward Islands.” Other
                            authorities name all the smaller islands so far as St Thomas “Windward
                            Islands,” and those further westward the “Leeward.” Creoles appear to
                            apply these terms relatively to then-own habitation, just as the dweller
                            on the bank of a river speaks of “up stream” and “down stream” with sole
                            reference to the position he occupies on the margin; and it might be
                            wished, though that were vain, that the use of terms so little definite
                            should be abandoned.</p></note> which, excepting Antigua and Barbadoes,
                    are almost entirely volcanic, while no direct trace of recent volcanic action is
                    known in the group lying to the northward and westward. These three divisions,
                    however natural in appearance, can hardly be affirmed to form as many zoological
                    provinces, owing to the absolute dearth of information respecting many of them,
                    and the insufficient amount which has been received of the remainder. Taking the
                    whole of the Antillean Subregion, the Bahamas, Cuba, Jamaica, St Croix, St
                    Thomas, Sombrero, St Bartholomew, Guadeloupe, Dominica, Martinique, and St Lucia
                    are the only islands of the ornithology of which we have anything more than what
                    may be called a casual account; and hence, though valuable observations
                    respecting some of the rest have been placed on record by travelling
                    naturalists, any attempt to separate the Subregion into proper provinces would
                    necessarily be of the crudest kind, and here cannot be made, though doubtless
                    such provinces will eventually be defined with precision.</p>
                <p>Still enough is known of the Birds of this Subregion to enable us to draw some
                    conclusions, though certain of them seem especially likely to be overset by
                    further investigation. It is inhabited by some 41 families, 1 of which <hi

                    and, as the above numbers show, there is no family common to that Region and the
                    Antillean Subregion without also occurring in other parts of the Neotropical
                    Region. On the whole, therefore, the affinity of the Subregion to the
                    Neotropical rather than to the Nearctic Region is fully made out. About 140
                    genera are found in the Antilles, of which 30 are peculiar to it, being a
                    considerably larger proportion than is elsewhere found in the Neotropical

                    the remaining Antillean genera inhabiting both North and South America. The
                    distribution of some of the peculiar genera merits a little attention, for 19
                    out of the 30 are confined to a single island, or nearly-connected group of
                    islands. Thus, Cuba has 6 believed to be restricted to its soil; Jamaica, 7;
                    Hispaniola, 2; and the so-called “Windward Islands,” probably 4; while none are
                    known to be absolutely limited to the Bahamas, to Porto Rico, or the Virgin
                    Islands. It is possible, indeed, that Hispaniola and Porto Rico, if as well
                    explored a3 Cuba and Jamaica have been, might tell a very different story.</p>
                <p>Pursuing the subject further, and entering, so far as space will allow, upon a
                    consideration of details, we find that there are of Land-birds about 200
                    resident species, and nearly 90 which are not resident, but migratory. These
                    last belong to about <hi rend="italic">55</hi> genera, of which some 40 have no
                    resident insular representatives, while those migrants pertaining to genera
                    which possess permanent residents are nearly all as much Neotropical as Nearctic
                    in character. Most of these, so far as is known, visit Cuba only, where over 80
                    are recorded as occurring, while but 30 reach Jamaica. The number, however, in
                    the island last named, and in others, would most likely be not inconsiderably
                    increased did competent observers but exist, though the fact that a well-known
                    species like the Humming-bird of eastern North America <hi rend="italic"
                        >(Trochilus colubris)</hi> does not seek its winter-abode in any of the
                    islands except the Bahamas and Cuba, tends to lessen the force of such a
                    supposition, and points to our actual knowledge being not very far wrong. Among
                    the more interesting of peculiar forms is one genus of <hi rend="italic"
                        >Turdidoe</hi><hi rend="italic">(Mimocichla),</hi> which is represented by 4
                    distinct species, found in the Bahamas, Cuba, Jamaica, and Hispaniola
                    respectively. Another genus of the same family <hi rend="italic"
                        >(Margarops)</hi> has a species ranging from Hispaniola to the Virgin
                    Islands, and a second species inhabiting Martinique and St Lucia only, these two
                    islands possessing at the same time a third and peculiar genus <hi rend="italic"
                        >(Rham-phodnclus),</hi> containing but a single species, common to both,
                    while they also have another genus <hi rend="italic">(Cinclocerihia),</hi> a
                    distinct species of which inhabits either island, though a third species of the
                    same is found in Guadaloupe and Nevis. The genus <hi rend="italic"
                        >Certhiola,</hi> belonging to the <hi rend="italic">Coerébidoe,</hi> is
                    remarkable in that it occurs in nearly every island except Cuba; but what seems
                    to be still more extraordinary is that the species found in the Bahamas <hi
                        rend="italic">(C. bahamensis),</hi> and there alone in the whole Subregion,
                    also occurs in Cozumel, an island off the coast of Yucatan, though Cuba
                    intervenes. The distribution of <hi rend="italic">Spindalis,</hi> one of the <hi
                        rend="italic">Tanagridae,</hi> resembles that of <hi rend="italic"
                        >Mimocichla,</hi> above noticed, only that here Porto Rico also has its
                    distinct representative species. Of the peculiar genera of Humming-birds, <hi
                        rend="italic">Eulampis</hi> has 2 species—one ranging from St Lucia t»
                    Nevis, but the second extending northward to St Thomas. <hi rend="italic"
                        >Aithurus,</hi> a very remarkable form, is restricted to Jamaica, while <hi
                        rend="italic">Mellisuga</hi> is common to that island and Hispaniola— each
                    of these genera consisting of but one species only, and the last is the smallest
                    known bird. <hi rend="italic">Orthorhynchus</hi> seems to have 3 species, one
                    extending from St Thomas to Dominica, a second (perhaps barely separable) common
                    to Martinique and St Lucia, and a third to St Vincent and Barbadoes; and,
                    finally, <hi rend="italic">Sporadinus</hi> has one species in Cuba and at least
                    one of the Bahamas, a second species in Hispaniola, and a third in Porto Rico.
                    Of genera of Humming-birds, which are not confined to the Antilles, <hi
                        rend="italic">Lampomis,</hi> a widely-ranging genus, has two species
                    peculiar to Jamaica and Porto Rico respectively; while a third extends from
                    Hispaniola to St Thomas. <hi rend="italic">Calypte,</hi> which has two species
                    in Mexico, has a third peculiar to Cuba, while <hi rend="italic">Doricha</hi> is
                    represented in two of the Bahamas (New Providence and Inagua) by as many
                    distinct species; the other three described species of the form inhabiting
                    Central America, and none, so far as known, occurring in <pb break="no"

                    case of interrupted generic distribution somewhat like though not quite so
                    extraordinary as that of <hi rend="italic">Certhiola</hi> already noticed. In
                    all, about 17 species of <hi rend="italic">Trochilidoe</hi> are found in the
                    Antilles, of which only one, and that of exceptionally developed migratory
                    habits, occurs elsewhere. The peculiar family <hi rend="italic">Todidoe</hi> has
                    been already mentioned; and it is only necessary here to remark that the single
                    genus <hi rend="italic">Todus</hi> which it contains seems to have 5 species,
                    one limited to each of the large islands, Cuba, Jamaica, Hispaniola, and Porto
                    Rico, the fifth being from an unknown locality.<note anchored="true"

                        >Saurothera,</hi> a genus of <hi rend="italic">Cuculidoe,</hi> which is
                    represented by a distinct species in each of these four islands, while another
                    genus of the same family, <hi rend="italic">Hyetomis,</hi> with one species, is
                    peculiar to Jamaica. The <hi rend="italic">Trogonidoe</hi> have two genera, <hi

                    with a single species, the former peculiar to Cuba, and the latter, which
                    exhibits a remarkable affinity to the African genus <hi rend="italic"
                        >HapaLoderma,</hi> to Hispaniola. <hi rend="italic">Pseudoscops,</hi> a
                    genus of <hi rend="italic">Strigidoe,</hi> is peculiar to Jamaica, but <hi
                        rend="italic">Gymnoglaux,</hi> belonging to the same family, has one species
                    limited to Cuba, while a second extends from Porto Rico to some of the Virgin
                    Islands. Cuba also, besides a widely-ranging species of Kestrel <hi
                        rend="italic">(Tinnunculus),</hi> has a second species which is peculiar to
                    the island. Jamaica, on the other hand, seems to have no Kestrel at all.</p>
                <p>Any speculations as to the former history of the Antilles derived from our
                    imperfect knowledge of their existing ornis would be vain. It is enough to
                    perceive, as the preceding facts will show, that there must here have been no
                    ordinary amount of upheaval and subsidence, of turning land into water and water
                    into land, to account for the present distribution of their avifauna. More
                    wonderful than any evidence given by the Birds, is that which is afforded by
                    other Classes. It is asserted that <hi rend="italic">Solenodon,</hi> an
                    Antillean genus of Insectivorous Mammals, has its nearest ally in a Malagasy
                    form; and a splendid Butterfly, found only in Jamaica <hi rend="italic">(Urania
                        sloanii),</hi> belongs to a genus of which while two other species are known
                    from Central and South America respectively, the only other genus resembling it
                    is one that inhabits Madagascar.</p>
                <p>III. <hi rend="smallcaps">The</hi><hi rend="smallcaps">Ne</hi><hi
                        rend="smallcaps">arctic Region</hi> comprises all that is left of the
                    American continent, after the Neotropical Region has been taken off, and certain
                    outlying groups of islands, such as the Aleutian chain, with its immediate
                    dependencies, and the Bermudas—none of them, however, being of any great
                    importance,—as well as the circumpolar lands lying westward of long. 60 <hi
                        rend="superscript"> c</hi> W., and Greenland. The confines of these two
                    Regions, as before stated (page 748), are as yet but vaguely traced. All that is
                    known for certain is that the more northern runs considerably southward along
                    the highlands of Central America, and that its influence, as determined by the
                    presence of resident genera of northern extraction, is perceptibly felt on the
                    summits or slopes of the mountains, at least so far southward as lat. 20° N. In
                    the lowlands the boundary lies much further towards the north, and, perhaps, in
                    general terms, may be placed somewhere about lat. 25° N., while both in lowlands
                    and highlands, as above explained, the northern influence varies with the
                    seasons of the year, being greatest in winter, when the migratory birds, which
                    breed in the Nearctic Region, have turned their flight southward, and least in
                    summer, when they have retired to their northern homes. If the avifauna of the
                    Neotropical Region could, in a wide sense, be truly termed homogeneous, much
                    more is this the state of the case with the Nearctic. Of the 63 families<note

                        >Chamoeidoe,</hi> is peculiar, and the validity of the grounds on which this
                    has been established as such may be open to question; 44 of them are also
                    Pahsarctic; and the remaining 18 are common to the Neotropical Region, of which
                    last number at least 4 <hi rend="italic">(Trogonidoe, Plotidoe, Fregatidoe,</hi>
                    and <hi rend="italic">Phaetontidoe)</hi> have a much more extended range. Thus
                    there are 14 peculiarly American families left. These are <hi rend="italic"
                        >Mniotiltidoe, Coerebidoe, Tanagridoe, Vireonidae, Icteridae, Tyrannidoe,
                        Trochilidoe, Momotidoe, Aridoe, Cathartidoe, Graddoe, Meleagridae,
                        Tantalidae,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Aramidae.</hi> But the propriety of
                    here admitting <hi rend="italic">Trogonidoe</hi> (mentioned above) aud <hi
                        rend="italic">Momotidoe</hi> is very doubtful; for, though included by Dr
                    Coues, they are omitted by Professor Baird from his <hi rend="italic">North
                        American Birds,</hi> the most recent work on the subject. The claim of <hi
                        rend="italic">Coerebidoe</hi> to be considered Nearctic is also slender,
                    resting on the fact that a small colony of the Sugar-bird which inhabits the
                    Bahamas <hi rend="italic">(Certhiola bahamensis)</hi> has established itself on
                    one of the Florida Cays. The <hi rend="italic">Aridoe</hi> are represented in
                    the Region by a single species only—the long-known Carolina Parrakeet <hi
                        rend="italic">(Conurus carolinensis);</hi> and the <hi rend="italic"
                        >Tanagridoe,</hi> a family containing upwards of forty genera, have but one
                    genus <hi rend="italic">(Pyranga),</hi> exemplified by four or five species, out
                    of about a dozen, which occur within its limits.</p>
                <p>On the other hand, the peculiarly American families best represented in the
                    Nearctic Region seem to be four in number,— <hi rend="italic">Mniotiltidoe,</hi>
                    by 13 genera and about 50 species, <hi rend="italic">Vireonidoe</hi> by 1 genus
                    and 14 species, <hi rend="italic">Icteridae</hi> by 8 genera and 21 species, and
                        <hi rend="italic">Tyrannidoe</hi> by 8 genera and 26 species. The first of
                    these, however, can alone be regarded as eminently characteristic of the Region,
                    since that affords a home to all but 3 of the genera, but at the same time, only
                    about one-half of the described species occur there. None of the rest can
                    compare with it in this respect, <hi rend="italic">Vireonidoe</hi> having 5
                    genera and 50 species, <hi rend="italic">Icteridae</hi> 24 genera and 105
                    species, and <hi rend="italic">Tyrannidoe</hi> 71 genera and 324 species in the
                    Neotropical Region.</p>
                <p>Coming now to the genera of Nearctic birds, we may put the number perhaps at 330,
                    of which 24 seem to be peculiar to the Region; 2 of them belong to <hi
                        rend="italic">Turdidoe,</hi> 1 to <hi rend="italic">Chamoeidoe, Paridoe,
                        Troglodytidoe,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Motacillidoe</hi> respectively, 5
                    to <hi rend="italic">Ember</hi><hi rend="italic">izidoe,</hi> 2 to <hi
                        rend="italic">Corvidoe,</hi> 1 to each of <hi rend="italic">Picidoe,
                        Falconidoe,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Columbidoe,</hi> 5 to <hi
                        rend="italic">Tetraonidoe,</hi> and 1 to <hi rend="italic">Scolopacidoe,
                        Anatidoe,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Larxdoe</hi> respectively. But it is
                    perhaps worth remarking that the families <hi rend="italic">Emberizidoe</hi> and
                        <hi rend="italic">Tetraonidoe,</hi> here most abundantly represented by
                    genera, are still more abundantly represented in like manner elsewhere. In the
                    Neotropical Region we have some 30 and in the Old World some 15 genera of the
                    former, which are not found in the Nearctic Region; and the Old World has some
                    30 genera of the latter which are not found in the New. On the other hand it
                    must be admitted that if we subdivide the American <hi rend="italic"
                        >Tetraonidoe</hi> into sections or sub families, we find that while one of
                    those sections, the <hi rend="italic">Odon</hi><hi rend="italic"
                        >tophorinoe,</hi> is peculiar to America, the balance as regards the other,
                        <hi rend="italic">Tetraoninae,</hi> is clearly in favour of its greater
                    development in North America, where we have 3 genera absolutely peculiar, as
                    well as 3 others which are also found in the Palaearctic Region. With this
                    Region, indeed, the Nearctic has about 128 generain common, having 178 which are
                    also Neotropical. Returning to these last presently, it may be advisable here to
                    give some particulars of those which are common to both sides of the North
                    Atlantic. 1 belongs to each of the families <hi rend="italic">Turdidoe</hi> and

                    arrive at a just estimate of the relations of the avifaunas of the first two.
                    These categories consist of those genera which, being only winter visitants to
                    the southern Region, do not breed there, and those which may fairly be called
                    common to both. The latter need perhaps no further attention, after what has
                    been previously said of the Central-American Subregion (p. 748), but the former
                    require some notice. Of those in this category 1 genus belongs to each of the

                    must, of course, be considered characteristic of the Nearctic Region, and might,
                    indeed, be not inappropriately added to the 24 genera which are, as already
                    said, peculiar thereto; but even if this be done, we find the number of peculiar
                    and characteristic genera (taken together) of the Nearctic Region to be only
                    51—a smaller number than that of the genera of Land-birds alone (57) which are
                    common to the Palaearctic, and considerably less than half the number of all
                    genera which are found on both sides of the Atlantic (128), while the remaining
                    genera which are strictly common to the Neotropical (151) is much larger again.
                    Thus, regarded simply from an ornithologist’s point of view, what we call the
                    Nearctic “Region” seems to have no right to be considered one of the primary
                    Regions of the earth’s surface, and to be of less importance than some of the
                    Subregions of the Neotropical Region, as may be shewn more plainly by the

                <p>It is not, however, intended here to question the validity of the Nearctic Region
                    in a zoogeographical sense. If that position could be successfully disputed, it
                    must be done on more than ornithological grounds, and a consideration of them
                    would be out of place in this article. It is enough to mention that though the
                    Mammals would possibly lead to much the same conclusion as the Birds do, yet the
                    lower Classes of Vertebrates—Reptiles, Amphibians, and Fishes —would most likely
                    have a contrary tendency, while the present writer is quite unable to guess at
                    the result which would be afforded by the Invertebrates. Now, as in map ping out
                    the W(θrld into zoological Regions all animais have to be regarded, he has no
                    wish to disturb the scheme which has been so generally approved, but contents
                    himself with pointing out that the case for its adoption is not in this
                    particular instance strengthened by the evidence given by the Class <hi
                        rend="italic">Aves.</hi></p>
                <p>A great majority of the Nearctic families and genera of Birds appear to be
                    generally distributed throughout all the “Subregions,” or perhaps it would be
                    better to call them “provinces,” into which ingenuity can separate the Region.
                    And on this account, as well as from what has been urged in the preceding
                    paragraph, it seems unnecessary to treat of each “Subregion” or “province” so
                    fully as has hitherto been done in the present article. Indeed such districts
                    are not easily defined, and their definition rests rather on differences of
                    species than of higher groups, as we have found to be the case in discussing the
                    several component parts of the other Regions we have considered. Professor
                    Baird, in a masterly treatise on this and another subject,<note anchored="true"
                        place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>“The Distribution and Migrations of North

                    North America which constitutes the Nearctic Region into <hi rend="italic"
                        >two</hi> principal sections, the Eastern extending from the Atlantic
                    sea-board westward across the Alleghany Mountains and over the valley of the
                    Mississippi and its fertile prairies to about long. 100° W., where the sterile
                    plains begin. The western boundary of this division, however, is not sharply
                    defined, nor does it coincide with any meridian line, but lies somewhat
                    obliquely and interdigitates with the eastern confines of the next division by
                    extending westward along the riverbottoms. Marching with this irregular frontier
                    we have the second, or Western, great division reaching thence to the shores of
                    the Pacific, and though the character of its avifauna is much the same through
                    and beyond the Rocky Mountains to the eastern slope of the Sierra Nevada and
                    Cascade Mountains of California and Oregon, it changes somewhat on their western
                    slope and thence to the sea, exhibiting modifications which may warrant further
                    separation into a truly Western and a Central subdivision—thus making in all <hi
                        rend="italic">three</hi> provinces for the whole of the more southern part
                    of the Nearctic Region, while each of them shews, as might be expected,
                    indicatione of additional change, subject in great measure to the degree of
                    latitude under which any particular locality in them may lie.</p>
                <p>Having thus pointed out the three provinces into which this portion of the Region
                    can be separated, it may be well to cull from Professor Baird’s investigations
                    of the subject some further details. The boundary of the Eastern province,
                    which, taking up an old name, we may perhaps term the “Alleghanian”—from the
                    principal mountain range within its limits,—starts from the Gulf of Mexico, near
                    the eastern border of Texas, perhaps between the rivers Brazos and Sabinè, and
                    following the course of the former to the great American Desert, in about long.
                    100° W., runs northward, forced sometimes more or less westward, especially
                    along the Platte, and sometimes eastward. It crosses the Platte between Forts
                    Kearney and Laramie, and apparently intersects the Missouri about Fort Lookout.
                    Reaching the southern frontier of the Dominion of Canada, it rapidly inclines to
                    the westward, and including the valleys of the Saskatchewan and the Athabasca,
                    it crosses the Rocky Mountains, and, cutting the river Yukon below the junction
                    of the Pelly and the Porcupine, loses itself in the wilds which border the
                    Arctic Ocean. Since the Middle province—on which as yet no more precise name has
                    been bestowed—lies for the most part between the Alleghanian and the Western or
                    “Californian,” as it has been entitled, the boundaries of this last had best, so
                    far <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit03newyrich/page/n769/mode/1up"
                        xml:id="kp-eb0903-0769-0752"/> as is possible, be j,iven. Its extent both
                    southward and northward is somewhat indefinite. The avifauna of Cape San Lucas,
                    at the extremity of the peninsula of Old or Lower California, is said to be
                    thoroughly that of the “Middle” province, but whether the whole of that
                    promontory is to be reckoned as belonging thereto, or only its eastern border,
                    is not known. It appears, however, that some of the most characteristic forms of
                    the Middle province find their way to the Pacific coast through a break in the
                    mountains opposite to San Diego, and it is to be remarked that the difference
                    between the species of birds found at Cape San Lucas (of which about a score are
                    absolutely peculiar) and of Mazatlan, though separated only by the breadth of
                    the Gulf of California, is very great. Northward the boundary of the Californian
                    province probably runs along the Sierra Nevada and the Cascade Mountains before
                    named, so that its extent is contracted to a mere strip along the coast, while
                    still further to the north, in British Columbia, no precise details of its
                    limits have as yet reached this country. But it would seem that in Alaska, as
                    will presently be stated at greater length, an avifauna presenting many very
                    different characters from any found elsewhere in America is reached, for here we
                    encounter a number of genuine Palaearctic forms.</p>
                <p>But these are not all the zoological provinces into which this part of North
                    America can be separated. A <hi rend="italic">fourth,</hi> of especially Arctic
                    type, occupies the northern portion of the continent, and gradually melts away
                    into the rest, extending far to the southward along the highest ranges, even to
                    Fort Burgwyn, in lat. 37° N., if not beyond. This province may be called the
                    “Canadian,” from the ancient colony of that name constituting so large a portion
                    of it, but its limits must be confessed to be indefinite in a high degree. The
                    eastern half, at least, of the British possessions in North America are herein
                    included, and the province may be deemed to extend across Davis’s Strait to
                    Greenland.</p>
                <p>In noticing these provinces, the results of Professor Baird’s researches have
                    been, with little deviation, mainly adopted, but his enquiries have been largely
                    supplemented by the more recent investigations of Mr J. A. Allen, who has
                    admirably carried out the further subdivision of the Eastern, or, as it has been
                    termed, the Alleghanian province, together with part of what has just been
                    denominated the Canadian. Regarding the whole eastern half of the continent as
                    one province, he recognises in it the existence of seven distinct ornithological
                    faunas, namely, the Floridan, the Louisianian, the Carolinan, the Alleghanian,
                    the Canadian, the Hudsonian, and the American-Arctic, comparing them also with
                    the distribution therein of Mammals and Reptiles.<note anchored="true"

                    very general bearing.</p>
                <p>The provinces above named (and naturally the districts which they comprise)
                    appear to be characterized rather by the presence or absence of certain species
                    of widely-spread genera than by the presence or absence of the genera
                    themselves, and much less of families, but it seems expedient to notice some of
                    the chief exceptions to general distribution in the latter of these groups.
                    First we have the peculiar family of <hi rend="italic">Chamoeidoe,</hi>
                    restricted so far as is known to the coast-district of California, where it is
                    represented by a single genus and a single species; and then among families of
                    greater range, the <hi rend="italic">Coerébidoe,</hi> already introduced to us
                    as a Neotropical group, but in the Nearctic Region existing only in the case of
                    the colony of a species of <hi rend="italic">Certhiola</hi> before noticed; the
                        <hi rend="italic">Aridoe,</hi> nowadays almost limited to Western
                    Louisiania, Arkansas, and Florida, but formerly known along the whole valley of
                    the Mississippi to the verge of the Great Lakes, and even occasionally
                    penetrating to Pennsylvania and the State of New York; the <hi rend="italic"
                        >Cathartidoe,</hi> of which one genus <hi rend="italic"
                        >{Pseudogryphus),</hi> having for its sole species one of the largest birds
                    of flight, the Californian Vulture <hi rend="italic">(P. califomianus),</hi> is
                    confined to the Pacific coast from a little north of the Columbia River to the
                    Colorado, extending eastward to the Sierra Nevada, while of another genus <hi
                        rend="italic">(Cathartes)</hi> one species ranges from the Strait of
                    Magellan to the Saskatchewan, but a second hardly strays further northward than
                    North Carolina, and does not occur on the Pacific coast of the United States;
                    the Turkeys <hi rend="italic">(Meleagridae),</hi> found only to the eastward of
                    the Rocky Mountains, and now extinct in most of the settled districts of
                    Pennsylvania, New England, and Canada; the Wood-Ibises <hi rend="italic"
                        >(Tantalidae),</hi> belonging to the southern country from the Colorado
                    eastward, and so far to the north as the State of Ohio and the Carolinas; the
                    Spoonbills <hi rend="italic">(Plataleιdce),</hi> with apparently much the same
                    range as the last, but more limited towards the north, being of only accidental
                    occurrence on the Lower Mississippi and in the Carolinas; the Courlans <hi
                        rend="italic">(Aramidoe),</hi> frequenting in this region only the shores of
                    the Gulf of Mexico and the coast of Florida; the Flamingoes <hi rend="italic"
                        >(Phoenicopteridoe),</hi> with haunts nearly as much confined, though
                    occasionally reaching South Carolina; the Pelicans <hi rend="italic"
                        >(Pelecanidoe),</hi> having one species abundant in the Western and only by
                    chance occurring in the Middle and Eastern states, while a second is of strictly
                    marine habit, and is found on the coast of California, and in the Gulf of Mexico
                    and the shoals of Florida. The single representative of the Darters <hi
                        rend="italic">(Plotidoe)</hi> in summer reaches North Carolina and Illinois,
                    but that of the Frigate-birds <hi rend="italic">(Fregatidoe)</hi> is confined to
                    the shores of the great Gulf, while that of the Tropic-birds <hi rend="italic"
                        >(Phaetontidoe)</hi> not only haunts the same waters but also finds a
                    nursery in the Bermudas; the species of Divers <hi rend="italic"
                        >(Colymbidoe)</hi> breed only in the north—Halifax, in lat. 45° N., being
                    perhaps their most southern limit of reproduction; while, finally; the Auks <hi
                        rend="italic">(Alcidoe),</hi> Sea-birds of northern range, exhibit a most
                    remarkable development of genera, species, and individuals on the rocky cliffs
                    and islets which riβe from the North Pacific.</p>
                <p>Reference has already been made to the peculiarity of the avifauna of
                    Alaska—Russian America, as it was formerly called,—and its character needs brief
                    notice. The list of Birds observed in this territory, as given by Messrs Dall
                    and Bannister,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi

                    species. Of these 96 are Land-birds, belonging to 63 genera, whereof 20 at the
                    outside are peculiarly American, while of the remaining 43, which are common to
                    the Nearctic and Palaearctic Regions, 3 are found nowhere else in the New World
                    but in Alaska, and their occurrence there does not preclude us from setting them
                    down as being emphatically Palaearctic forms. Two of them are actually
                    represented by species common throughout the greater part of Asia and Europe, as
                    is the case with <hi rend="italic">Budytes</hi><hi rend="italic">flavus,</hi> a
                    Yellow Wagtail, and <hi rend="italic">Phylloscopus borealis,</hi> a Willow-Wren,

                    Water-birds, amounting to 115 species, are referable to 63 genera, of which only

                    are truly American against 52 common to both Regions, one of these last,
                    however, not having been found elsewhere in the New World, while the home of 5
                    seems doubtful. These numbers will show the great influence of Palaearctic forms
                    on Alaska, and it only remains to be said that some of the ordinary
                    summer-migrants thither would seem to arrive there from Asia, as the Wagtail and
                    Willow-Wren just mentioned, to which should possibly be added the Wheatear <hi
                        rend="italic">(Saxicola</hi><hi rend="italic">aenanthe),</hi> for though
                    that species is known as a regular annual visitant to Greenland and Labrador
                    (where it breeds), and almost annually appears as a straggler on the eastern
                    coast of the United States, the flocks which throng the stony hill-tops of
                    Alaska in spring are not likely to have performed a north-west passage from
                    Europe, and indeed it is stated that specimens from Norton Sound differ
                    considerably in dimensions from those obtained in Greenland. All these Birds are
                    unseen in British Columbia, and as all are migratory, the inference that they
                    make some part of Asia their winter-quarters is almost irresistible.</p>
                <p>After all, perhaps there is nothing very surprising in this, when we consider the
                    narrowness of the ohannel<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"
                            ><p>Behring’s Strait is said also to be very shallow, which fact is
                            suggestive as to a still greater interchange of animal life in past

                    from the Old, and it would seem that it is almost within the confines of the
                    Arctic circle that, apart from circumpolar species, the connection of the faunas
                    of the two continents is closest. At any rate, the Aleutian Islands, though they
                    look like stepping-stones from the one to the other, do not appear to be used as
                    a route of communication; for Mr Dall calls especial attention to the fact that
                    no intrusion of Asiatic forms occurs towards the western end of the chain, while
                    observing that its avifauna beyond Oonalaska is reinforced by several Arctic
                    species not possessed by more eastern islands.<note anchored="true"

                <p>Northward of the Aleutians lies a little volcanic group known as the Prybilov
                    Islands, whose coasts are frequently encumbered by ice, and there only 40
                    species of Birds have as yet been found, while those which breed are about 12 in
                    number, and among them a Sandpiper <hi rend="italic">(Tringa ptilocnemis),</hi>
                    apparently peculiar to St Paul’s Island, the largest of the group. Only one of
                    the characteristically Palaearctic forms, and this also a Water-bird <hi
                        rend="italic">(Limosa</hi><hi rend="italic">uropygialis),</hi> which appear
                    but in Alaska, seems there to occur—a fact which points yet again to the more
                    northern connection of the two continents by way of Cape Prince-of-Wales and the
                    East Cape (Vostochni) of Asia.</p>
                <p>We have next to turn to another group of islands, situated in a different ocean,
                    and in formation very unlike that last considered. These are the Bermudas, a
                    cluster of low coral-reefs rising from the Atlantic, about 600 miles from Cape
                    Hatteras, the nearest point on the eastern coast of North America. They possess
                    but few Land-birds, and not a single peculiar species, yet they play by no means
                    an unimportant part as a resting-station to the flocks of migrants as they
                    retreat southward from their northern homes in Labrador and Greenland, and,
                    though less often, on their northward journey in spring. Only about 6 Landbirds
                    are resident, and about as many Water-birds are known to breed there; but the
                    number of stragglers is large, and includes two or three of undoubtedly European
                    extraction.</p>
                <p>Greenland is the last portion of the Nearctic Region to which we shall especially
                    invite attention, and there though the character of the avifauna is certainly
                    that of the New World, yet that of the Old is very influential. Out of the 45
                    genera to which the feathered inhabitants of Greenland belong, none are peculiar
                    to the Palaearctic Region, while 2— <hi rend="italic">Zonotrichia,</hi> one of
                    the <hi rend="italic">Emberùidoe,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Rhodostethia,</hi>
                    one of the <hi rend="italic">Laridae</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi> are peculiar
                    to the Nearctic. If we take the species, we find that of the 63 inhabitants,
                    those peculiar to the New World amount to 11, while those not elsewhere dwelling
                    out of the Old are only 5. &lt; But, on the other hand, the Sea-Eagle <hi
                        rend="italic">(Haliaetus),</hi> the Ringed Plover <hi rend="italic"
                        >(Aegia-</hi><hi rend="italic">litis),</hi> and the Snipe <hi rend="italic"
                        >(Scolopax)</hi> which breed in Greenland are those of Europe instead of
                    their American congeners; and the Wheatear <hi rend="italic">(Saxicola),</hi>
                    the Sanderling <hi rend="italic">(Calidris),</hi> the Knot <hi rend="italic"
                        >(Tringa canutus),</hi> and the Bernacle-Goose <hi rend="italic">(Bernicla
                        leucopsis)</hi> would appear to cross the Atlantic from the east, while 43
                    out of the 63 inhabitant species are every bit as much Palaearctic as Nearctic;
                    and 2 more, the Ptarmigan <hi rend="italic">(Lagopus rupestris)</hi> and
                    Barrow’s Duck <hi rend="italic">(Clangula islandica)</hi> breed abundantly in
                    Iceland. Following the western coast-line (for of the eastern we know little) to
                    the Arctic circle,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"
                            ><p>People are apt to forget that Cape Farewell, the most southerly

                            though undoubtedly exposed in the highest degree to the rigours of an
                            Arctic climate, is situated outside the Arctic circle.</p></note> we
                    find the proportion of forms which are common to the Palaearctic Region
                    increase, until in lat.jΓ5° N. or thereabouts, there are (so far as our means of
                    information will allow us to judge) no species of Birds which have not been
                    known to occur, and only about 5 which have not been known to breed, in the Old
                    World.</p>
                <p>It has been already stated that 128 out of the 330 Nearctic genera, or more than
                    one-third, are common also to the Palaearctic Region. This will serve to shew
                    the great similarity of the two; and if we investigate the species, the
                    similarity is still to a great extent borne out. Taking the number of Nearctic
                    species at 700 (which is perhaps an exaggeration), and that of the Palaearctic
                    at 850 (which is certainly under the mark), we find that, exclusive of
                    stragglers, there are about 100 common to the two Regions. Nearly 20 more are
                    Palaearctic but occasionally occur in America, and about 50 are Nearctic which
                    from time to time stray to Europe or Asia.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                        type="authorial"><p>Professor Baird, in the essaybefore cited, has
                            reasonably accounted for this disproportionate reciprocity between
                            Europe and America; but perhaps something more than he has allowed must
                            be set down to the comparative want of records in the new country, where
                            observers and amateur collectors have until lately been scarce. This
                            want is, however, being speedily supplied by the numerous students of
                            out-of-doors ornithology, who are everywhere springing up throughout the

                    resemblance. Of many genera the species found in the New World are represented
                    in the Old by species which often no one but an expert can distinguish. Of such
                    representative or parallel species, somewhere about 80 might be enumerated; and
                    thus the relation of the two regions may be concisely stated :—</p>

                    Iceland and Spitsbergen to those of the Mediterranean—Asia Minor, Palestine,
                    Persia, Afghanistan, and all the rest of the Asiatic continent lying to the

                    besides Japan and the Kurile Islands. The propriety of comprehending this
                    enormous tract in one Zoological Region was first shown by Mr Sclater, in the
                    paper to which reference has before been made,<note anchored="true"

                    animals there have been few to doubt that it is an extremely natural one. Not
                    indeed altogether so homogeneous as the Nearctic Region, it presents however
                    even at its extreme points no very striking difference between the bulk of its
                    Birds. Though Japan is far removed from Western Europe, and though a few generic
                    forms and still fewer families inhabit the one without also frequenting the
                    other, yet there is a most astonishing similarity in a large portion of their
                    respective Birds, ς∖In some cases the closest examination has failed to detect
                    any distinction that may be called specific between the members of their
                    avifauna; but in most it is possible to discover just sufficient difference to
                    warrant a separation of the subjects. Nevertheless it is clear that in Japan we
                    have as it were a repetition of some of our most familiar species—the Redbreast
                    and the Hedge-Sparrow for example—slightly modified in plumage or otherwise so
                    as to furnish instances of the most accurate representation.</p>
                <p>The limits of the western portion of the Region are definite enough, for except
                    in its African province it is girt by the sea, but even there we find a boundary
                    hardly inferior to a coast-line in the precision with which it may be recognized
                    and in the influence it exerts. This is the Great Desert, commonly known as the
                    Sahara, which, though yearly crossed by innumerable multitudes of many of the
                    more migratory species, just as the sea itself is traversed by them, acts as a
                    complete barrier to the less migratory and to the residents, cutting off the
                    denizens of Morocco, Algeria, and Tunis from the rest of the continent to which
                    they are geographically attached. Further to the eastward, however, the limits
                    of the Region are if in any way marked at least but little known, though
                    indications are not wanting to show that the avifauna of Tripoli is rather
                    Ethiopian than Palaearctic in its character. When we reach Egypt we have a state
                    of things which may be compared to that debatable land in Central America
                    wherein the Neotropical and Nearctic avifaunas meet but hardly mingle. During
                    winter the bird-population of the Nile-valley is formed almost exclusively of
                    the hordes of European migrants of nearly all Orders and families which there
                    seek refuge. When spring returns these begin to troop across the Mediterranean,
                    and their place is taken by the indigenous Birds of Egypt which had been either
                    reduced to comparative insignificance by, or actually thrust out before, the
                    northern invaders. The seaboard of Palestine, and even its interior, until the
                    western limits of the Jordan-basin are touched, are on the contrary almost
                    purely Palaearctic, but the depressed valley of the Ghor, part of which is sunk
                    about 1300 feet below the level of the Mediterranean, seems to be an outlier of
                    the Ethiopian Region, and though the scanty avifauna of the Mountains of Moab
                    may possess a northern phase, the desert, with its characteristic, and in the
                    main Ethiopian, forms of animallife almost immediately succeeds, and it is not
                    until the fertile plains of Mesopotamia are approached or attained that we can
                    feel assured we have again entered the Palaearctic area, which may be considered
                    to reach the head of the Persian Gulf. Coasting this inlet on its eastern side
                    we have a fauna the character of which it is as yet impossible to declare, and
                    this difficulty becomes greater still when we emerge into the Indian Ocean. It
                    seems most probable that Beloochistan belongs to the Palaeartic Region, but if
                    not then the line of demarcation must run inland and so continue between that
                    land and Afghanistan till, ascending the right bank of the valley of the Indus,
                    it turns the shoulder of the Great Snowy Range and thence proceeds in the
                    direction already traced parallel to the southern frontier of Thibet, and across
                    the intervening portion of the Chinese Empire, once more to the ocean. Arrived
                    here the remaining limits of the Region are as well marked by the coastdine as
                    they were in Europe. They extend to Kamchatka, and rounding the furthest verge
                    of Asia, within the Arctic Circle, they return by the north coast of Siberia
                    till the confines of Europe are again reached.</p>
                <p>To separate this vast area into subsidiary districts according to the zoological
                    properties of each is perhaps a less easy task than is the same operation with
                    regard to the Nearctic Region, and, as in that case, the mapping-out of the
                    whole into Subregions is almost impossible except it be done arbitrarily.
                    Nevertheless the attempt must be made, and, though in the Asiatic half
                    considerable assistance is to be derived from a careful essay by Mr Elwes,<note

                    entertained.</p>
                <p>The very fulness of the information which we possess as to the ornis of some
                    countries of Europe makes the scarcity of it in respect to others all the more
                    conspicuous, and renders any really comprehensive view of the whole all the more
                    difficult. Grounds are not wanting at first sight in favour of a longitudinal or
                    approximately longitudinal division of this quarter of the globe, in which case
                    the line of demarcation might be taken to run up the Adriatic Sea, and starting
                    from the neighbourhood of Trieste, to cross the Camic Alps, descend the valley
                    of the Inn till it falls into the Danube, and thence follow the angular mountain
                    frontier of Bohemia as far as the head-waters of the Niesse, along which it
                    would proceed to their junction with the Oder, and so to the Baltic a little to
                    the westward of Stettin. Thence it might be continued northward between (Eland
                    and Gottland up the Gulf of Bothnia to the confines of Sweden and Finland, where
                    cutting the Scandinavian peninsula to the westward of the Lower Torneâ and its
                    affluent the Muonio it would strike the shores of the Arctic Ocean perhaps on
                    the Lyngen Fjord. Though undoubtedly most species of Birds are common to both
                    sides of this imaginary line, yet it would be found to divide the breeding-range
                    of a few which are very characteristic of the east and west of Europe
                    respectively. But on further consideration it would seem that though such a
                    division as has just been suggested may be convenient if not natural for the
                    countries lying north of the Mediterranean basin, those, such as the three
                    principal peninsulas which project into the great inland sea, together with the
                    portion of North Africa which was at one time known as Mauritania, form a group
                    which have much in common, and collectively differ more from the countries lying
                    further to the north than the two (Eastern and Western) divisions of Central and
                    Northern Europe, just suggested, do from one another. Accordingly it seems best
                    to adopt primarily a latitudinal division of the Western part of the Palaearctic
                    Region. This done we should have as our first Subregion all Europe north of the
                    Pyrenees, the Alps, the Balkan, the Black Sea, and the Caucasus, and since it
                    would thus comprehend by far the greater portion of this quarter of the globe,
                    we may not inappropriately call it the “European” Subregion, further subdividing
                    it if we think fit into a Western and an Eastern Province, according to the
                    boundary above traced—the eastern boundary of the last being indeed very
                    uncertain, though perhaps to <pb break="no"
                        facs="ia:encyclopediabrit03newyrich/page/n772/mode/1up"
                        xml:id="kp-eb0903-0772-0755"/> be limited by the Ural Mountains and the
                    River of the same name. Next we should have the Subregion to which we may most
                    properly affix the name of “Mediterranean,” comprehending the portion of North
                    Africa already indicated, the Iberian and Italian peninsulas, as well as Turkey
                    in Europe and the Peloponnesus, but we must extend it far to the eastward
                    through Asia Minor and Persia until it touches the Indian Region. The lofty
                    range of the Caucasus would divide it from the European Subregion between the
                    Black Sea and the Caspian; beyond the latter, however, we cannot do more than
                    guess that the desert of the Tekko Turcomans and the mountains of Cabool would
                    form its northern boundary. Then stretching from the eastern shores of the
                    Caspian in a wide belt, but how wide is a matter of the greatest uncertainty,
                    comes the third Subregion, which we may call the “Mongolian ”—marching with the
                    Mediterranean Subregion till the Hindoo Koosh is reached, and thence coincident
                    with the southern borders of the Region towards the Yellow Sea—possibly
                    following the course of the Yangstzekiang. To this Subregion also would belong
                    the greater part if not the whole of Japan. Northward again we have the great
                    “Siberian” Subregion, but materials for any attempt to shew whether its southern
                    boundary is capable of being laid down are absolutely wanting. Even on the
                    seaboard it is at present impossible to say whether it is in Manchuria that one
                    Subregion passes into the other, or whether first the Stannovoi and further
                    inland the Altai Mountains mark their respective limits.</p>
                <p>Having thus indicated the component parts of the whole area, it is time to say
                    somewhat of its avifaunal characters. Like the Nearctic the Palaearctic Region
                    seems to produce but a single peculiar family of Birds—the <hi rend="italic"
                        >Panuridae,</hi> the type of which is the beautiful species known to
                    Englishmen as the Bearded Titmouse <hi rend="italic">(Panurus biarmicus)</hi><hi
                        rend="italic">—</hi> and this is a family which has not been long or very
                    generally recognized. Its members, however, are found stationed at intervals
                    from the western to the eastern extremity, and every attempt to refer them to
                    other groups of Birds has proved unsatisfactory—for the different genera (about
                    the number of which there is much doubt) have often been widely scattered by
                    systematists, one being placed at times with the Titmouse-family <hi
                        rend="italic">(Parùke),</hi> at times with the Buntings <hi rend="italic"
                        >(Ernberizidae),</hi> another relegated to the Finches <hi rend="italic"
                        >(Fringillidae),</hi> and a third or even more to the so-called “Babblers”
                        <hi rend="italic">(Timeliidae).</hi> The entire number of Palaearctic
                    families, computing them as we have already done those of other Regions, is
                    about 67, not counting 1 other <hi rend="italic">(Nectar iniidae)</hi> of which
                    a single species is peculiar to the valley of the Ghor, and that of the genera
                    323, about which there can be little doubt, or if any exist it may be that the
                    number is understated. Of these as we have above mentioned 128 are common to the
                    Nearctic Region. Species of 5l more seem to occur as true natives both in the
                    Ethiopian and Indian Regions, of which 4 genera belong to <hi rend="italic"

                    of the Australian and Neotropical Regions would be simply a waste of time, for
                    the points of resemblance are extremely few, and such as they are they lead to
                    nothing. It will therefore be seen from the above that next to the Nearctic
                    Region, the Palaearctic has a much greater affinity to the Indian than to any
                    other, a fact which need not surprise us when we consider the great extent of
                    their contact.</p>
                <p>Having shewn this much we have next to deal with the peculiarities of the Region
                    under our view. At the lowest computation 37 genera seem to be peculiar to it,
                    though it is certain that species of several are regularly wont to wander beyond
                    its limits in winter seeking a southern climate there to avoid the distress they
                    would suffer in that of their birth. Of these genera 3 are to be apportioned to

                    peculiarities too remarkable to be here left unnoticed. First we have the
                    Azores, the subject of an excellent monograph by Mr Frederick Godman,<note
                        anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi rend="italic">Natural
                                History of the Azores or Western Islands,</hi> 8vo. London:
                            1870.</p></note> in which is contained the result of his own
                    investigations in that group, as well as those of his predecessors. There is a
                    general tendency among Azorean Birds to vary more or less from their continental
                    representatives, and this is especially shown by the former having always darker
                    plumage and stronger bills and legs. In one instance the variation is so
                    excessive that it fully justifies the establishment of a specific distinction.
                    This is the case of the Bullfincjι of the more eastern of these islands <hi
                        rend="italic">(Pyrrhula</hi><hi rend="italic">murina),</hi> the male of
                    which, instead of the ruddy breast of its well-known congener (P. <hi
                        rend="italic">vulgaris),</hi> has that part of a sober mouse-colour. A
                    similar sombre hue distinguishes the peculiar Chaffinch of the Canary Islands
                        <hi rend="italic">(Fringilla</hi><hi rend="italic">teydea),</hi> but to
                    these islands as well as the Azores and Madeiras there belongs in common another
                    Chaffinch <hi rend="italic">(F. tintiUon),</hi> which, though very nearly allied
                    to that of Mauritania (<hi rend="italic">F. spodiogenia),</hi> is perfectly
                    recognizable, and not found elsewhere. Madeira has also its peculiar
                    Golden-crested Wren <hi rend="italic">(Regulus maderensis),</hi> and its
                    peculiar Pigeon <hi rend="italic">(Columba trocaz),</hi> while two allied forms
                    of the latter <hi rend="italic">(C. laurivora</hi> and <hi rend="italic">C.
                        bollii)</hi> are found only in the Canaries. Further on this subject we must
                    not go; we can only state that Mr Godman has shown good reason for declaring
                    that the avifauna of all these islands is the effect of colonization extending
                    over a long period of years, and going on now.</p>

                <p>It would extend the present article far beyond all reasonable bounds were we to
                    dwell upon more than a few of the curiosities of distribution which have been
                    revealed by the continuous observations of European ornithologists. There is no
                    need to travel out of our own island to meet with some of the most remarkable
                    among them, and we may take that of the Nightingale <hi rend="italic">(Daulias
                        luscinia)</hi> as an example. In England the western limit of the range of
                    this incomparable songster seems to be formed by the valley of the Exe, which is
                    only overstepped on rare occasions—Montagu having once heard it near
                    Kingsbridge, while it is said to have been observed at Teignmouth and
                    Barnstaple. But even in the east of Devonshire it is local and rare, as it also
                    is in the north of Somersetshire, though plentiful in other parts of that
                    county. Crossing the Bristol Channel it is said to be not uncommon at times near
                    Cowbridge in Glamorganshire; but this seems to be an isolated spot, or at any
                    rate there is no evidence of its being found elsewhere in Wales, or between that
                    place and Tintern on the Wye, where it has been reported to be plentiful. Thence
                    there is more or less good testimony of its occurrence in Herefordshire,
                    Shropshire, Staffordshire, Derbyshire, and so on, to about 5 miles north of
                    York, but not further. Along the line thus sketched out and immediately to the
                    east and south of it, the appearance of the nightingale, even if regular, which
                    may be doubted, is rare, and the bird exceedingly local; but in many parts of
                    the midland, eastern, and southern counties it is abundant, and the woods,
                    coppices, and gardens ring with that thrilling song which has been the theme of
                    writers in all ages. There are many assertions of its occurrence in England
                    further to the northward, but some of them rest on anonymous authority only, and
                    all must be regarded with the greatest suspicion. Still more open to doubt are
                    the statements which have been made as to its visits to Scotland, while in
                    Ireland there is no pretence even of its appearance. No reasonable mode of
                    accounting for the partial distribution of the Nightingale has hitherto been
                    propounded: there is no peculiar kind of soil which it especially affects, or
                    none, so far as we know, that it especially avoids; and the same may be said of
                    its relations to the flora of this country. It is not so entirely <hi
                        rend="italic">adscriptus</hi><hi rend="italic">gleboe</hi> that it will not
                    readily betake itself to new localities suited to its wants, when these have
                    been formed within its natural limits, though they may be miles away from its
                    ancient haunts. On the contrary, it is often one of the first birds to establish
                    itself when a heath has been broken up, and plantations of trees thereon made
                    have grown sufficiently to afford it the sheltering covert that it loves. This
                    instance, taken from a bird whose habits have been so closely studied both in
                    captivity and at large, and one which is so familiar, and in many places so
                    numerous, that abundant opportunities are given for observing all that can be
                    observed about it, shews how futile would be the expectation that in most cases
                    we could at present, even if ever, satisfactorily account for the existing
                    causes which limit the distribution of species. A vast majority of them, we
                    know, have each its bounds, which virtually it cannot pass, and the case of the
                    Nightingale in England, beyond the fact that its distribution is extremely well
                    marked, and therefore has long attracted especial attention, has really nothing
                    out of the common way in it.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                            undergone as has already been done by the same means in regard to many
                            of the general facts of distribution. The results of the labour of the
                            geologist are doubtless just as necessary to, and closely connected
                            with, the work of the biologist, as those of the investigation of the
                            historian are to and with the efficiency of the statesman; while, in
                            return, the researches of the biologist are, or ought to be, of the
                            greatest service to the geologist. The history of the earth is for a
                            long period of time that of its inhabitants.</p></note> In Europe, the

                    asserted to reach; but on the continent its range is less extended, and though
                    abundant in Mecklenburg, it is not found in that part of Pomerania <pb

                    nor does it stretch so far to the eastward as Danzig. It occurs, however,
                    sparingly on the Polish frontier, near Thom, and is observed in Austria, Upper
                    Hungary, and Gallizia. In Russia its distribution cannot be laid down with any
                    degree of accuracy, but it does not reach the Governments near the Ural, though
                    it is said to be plentiful in that of Kharkov, and it is known to visit the
                    Crimea. Still further to the eastward it can be traced through Circassia, and as
                    far as Kasbin in Persia. Southward of this imperfectly-drawn line it may be
                    found as a winter-visitant even in Arabia, Nubia, and Abyssinia, as well as in
                    Algeria, where it is reported as breeding, and it would seem to migrate thence
                    so far as the Gold Coast. It is abundant in Spain and Portugal; but it is a
                    stranger to Britanny, the western peninsula of France, just as it is to the
                    western peninsula of England.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                <p>One other example we may take, and this, though much less familiar, is equally
                    instructive, as exhibiting some of the as yet unexplained peculiarities of
                    distribution. It shall be from a Bird belonging to a very different Order from
                    the last, having habits entirely dissimilar, and presenting in most ways a great
                    contrast. The Kentish Plover <hi rend="italic">{Aegialitis</hi><hi rend="italic"
                        >cantiana),</hi> first determined from specimens obtained on the coast of

                    Britain limited to the pebbly beach between Sandwich and Hastings, and in other
                    parts of the British Islands only occurs as a chance straggler. Yet this bird
                    has as wide a range elsewhere as almost any that could be named—breeding not
                    only abundantly along the greater part of the coasts of the temperate and warmer
                    portions of the Old World north of the Equator, but also occasionally in the
                    interior, as at the base of the Caucasus and in the <hi rend="italic"

                    wanders to the Malay Archipelago and South Africa, or even seems most likely to
                    be specifically identical with a Plover which is found on the west coast of
                    America, from California southward—though this last has been described as

                <p>Islands must always be a matter of the greatest interest to the student of
                    Geographical Distribution, and we have already mentioned some peculiarities of
                    those groups which belong to the Mediterranean Subregion of Europe. There are
                    not many more here to be cited. Spitsbergen is supposed to have its peculiar
                    species of Ptarmigan <hi rend="italic">{Lagopus hemileucurus),</hi> though it is
                    confessedly very nearly allied to the Rock-Ptarmigan (Z. <hi rend="italic"
                        >rupestris)</hi> which inhabits the Arctic portion of the American continent
                    and islands, Greenland, and Iceland, but, except in the last-named country, does
                    not occur in the Palaearctic Region. Iceland is also remarkable for being the
                    headquarters of the noble Falcon <hi rend="italic">{Falco islandus)</hi> which
                    takes its name therefrom, though this bird also inhabits the southern districts
                    of Greenland, to say nothing of other countries; and in Iceland alone of the
                    western portion of the Region does the beautiful Harlequin-Duck <hi
                        rend="italic">{Histrionicus torquatus)</hi> breed. It is, however, known to
                    inhabit North America and the eastern half of Siberia.</p>
                <p>Coming nearer home, we have a remarkable case of restricted distribution in the
                    Red Grouse <hi rend="italic">{Lagσρus scoticus),</hi> found (and in certain
                    districts, as every one knows, numerously), in each of the three kingdoms
                    composing the British Islands as well as in the principality of Wales. The
                    details of its local distribution, as of that of all other birds which breed in
                    Great Britain, have been ∙carefully and concisely given by Mr More,<note

                    not propose to con sider them here, but what is worthy of remark is that this
                    particular species differs in no essential character save coloration from the
                    Willow-Grouse <hi rend="italic">{L.</hi><hi rend="italic">albus),</hi> which is
                    an abundant bird throughout the whole of the northern parts of the Palaearctic
                    Region from Norway to Kamchatka, and again throughout the same or even lower
                    latitudes of the Nearctic Region from Alaska to Newfoundland. Its remains, as
                    has before been said (page 731), have also been found in the south of France,
                    associated with those of the Reindeer and Snowy Owl. It is not for us now to
                    enter into any hypothetical discussion, but it is hard to resist drawing an
                    inference that at a time, geologically speaking, not very recent, both these
                    species of Grouse had a common ancestor, and that the severe winters to which it
                    has for a long period been exposed have caused the Willow-Grouse to don the
                    snowy garb that is characteristic of it and other species of the genus, the more
                    so since we find it in its first plumage possessed of the coloured quills, which
                    are precisely similar to those of the Red Grouse at the same age.</p>
                <p>Other instances there are in which British-born examples of species common to the
                    continent are in a less degree distinguishable from those of neighbouring
                    countries. The Coal-Titmouse of England is to be recognized from that of
                    continental Europe <hi rend="italic">{Parus ater),</hi> and accordingly by some
                    ornithologists it is regarded as a distinct species <hi rend="italic">{P.
                        britannicus),</hi> but the scanty remnants of the ancient pine-forests of
                    Scotland are inhabited by birds between which and European examples no
                    difference can be established. The home-bred Bottle-Titmouse of Britain, too,
                    has, from its darker coloration, been accorded specific rank, but then we
                    occasionally find continental birds of this species <hi rend="italic">{Acredula
                        caudata)</hi> varying in this respect, and the specific validity of the
                    British form <hi rend="italic">(A. rosea)</hi> can hardly be with consistency
                    maintained. Indeed, as a matter of fact, nearly all our smaller birds can be
                    distinguished by an expert from their continental brethren, and this mainly
                    through their duller or darker plumage. The difference is not so great by any
                    means as obtains in the case of the birds of the Atlantic Islands above
                    mentioned, but it most unquestionably exists to a greater or less degree; and it
                    is curious that an analogous state of things is observable in regard to many of
                    the birds of Japan, a country which is subject to many of the same climatic
                    conditions as the British Islands. It will be for future investigators to
                    ascertain the cause of this similarity, we here only record the fact; but
                    another remarkable instance of the forms of the western portion of the region
                    being repeated in the far east, is fouħd in the range of the two kindred species
                    of the beautiful genus <hi rend="italic">Cyanopica—</hi> the Blue Magpie of

                    Mascarene group from Réunion (Bourbon) to the Seychelles, and the large island
                    of Socotra, and crossing the Red Sea to Arabia, is sufficiently well marked out
                    in a geographical point of view. The Ghor, or valley of the Jordan and the
                    depressed basin of the Dead Sea, has been before mentioned as an outlier of this
                    Region, the north-eastern part of which melts into the Palaearctic between
                    Palestine and the Persian Gulf. There, and apparently there only, do its
                    boundaries admit of no precise definition. Some zoogeographers seem inclined to
                    extend its limits further to the eastward, through Beloochistan and even beyond
                    the Indus; but though the desert-form3 of a large portion of that tract of

                    identical with, the denizens of similar districts in Africa, yet it must be
                    remarked that such forms should be regarded in much the same light as those
                    which frequent wide seas, and that the determination of a desert-tract must
                    therefore depend rather on the fauna which inhabits its islands—as we may term
                    the oases which, whether plentifully or rarely, stud its surface—rather than on
                    the fauna of the desolate space which surrounds these fertile and more favoured
                    spots. Still, it is hardly to be denied that the influence of Ethiopian types is
                    to be discovered in Sindh, Gujerat, and even further in the Indian peninsula. In

                <p>The subdivision of the Ethiopian Region is perhaps accomplished with less
                    difficulty than in the case of the more temperate tracts with which we have
                    lately had to do. Bounded on the north by the Mediterranean Subregion of the
                    Palaearctic Region, we have a Subregion extending from the Cape-Verd Islands on
                    the one side of the continent to Socotra on the other; and with this we must
                    comprehend all the Asiatic territory, whatever be its limits, which is, for
                    zoogeographical purposes, to be annexed to the Ethiopian Region. On the West

                    trend in a southeasterly direction. On the East Coast the frontier of the Libyan

                    include; and is then succeeded by the “Mosambican” Subregion, which continues
                    perhaps to Sofala. Beginning on the West Coast, where the Libyan Subregion
                    stops, we have another Subregion, the “Guinean,” comprising the seaboard from

                    widely-scattered Mascarene Islands, constitute a fifth Subregion, the most
                    distinct and remarkable of all, and for this we may most reasonably use the name
                    “Madagascarian.”</p>

                    may perhaps be broken up into four provinces—the Arabian, Egyptian, Abyssinian,
                    and the Gambian; but it must not be expected that all their respective
                    boundaries can be distinctly drawn—those of the first excepted, which, however,
                    seems to be the one that has precisely the fewest positive characteristics, and
                    the propriety of its recognition, except on purely geographical grounds, is most
                    questionable. We may doubt whether it has more than half-adozen peculiar
                    species; but then we know next to nothing of the zoology of any part of Arabia,
                    save the Peninsula of Sinai and the desert of the Tih. As before mentioned the
                    Ostrich occurs here, but its present northern or eastern limits are
                    indeterminate; we know, however, that within recent years it has been killed in
                    the desert of Belka, just on the other side of the Dead Sea. The species which
                    seem to be peculiar to the Jordan basin are— <hi rend="italic"

                <p>The Egyptian province, so far as regards the valley of the Lower Nile, is
                    remarkable for being, as already stated, overrun by migrants from Europe during

                    season that most of our knowledge is derived, it is perhaps not very wonderful
                    that many zoogeographers are inclined to iιrclude this district within the
                    Palaearctic Region. The number of species which occur in Egypt and Nubia, as

                    occurrence. Of these more than 230 are natives of the Palaearctic Region; but
                    only between 50 and 60, or about one quarter of them, remain to breed in Egypt,
                    and of this number a considerable proportion do not breed in Europe, but only in
                    the Barbary States. The extra-Palaearctic character of the Egyptian ornis seems

                    the Caffrarian Subregion, and 253 only to the Mosambican; while 215 are peculiar
                    to the district to which his work especially relates; the last statement being
                    the most important for our present use, since it cannot be doubted that nearly
                    all these 215 species are peculiar to the Abyssinian province, which may be
                    taken as extending from about the southern frontier of Dongola to the Victoria
                    Nyanza, and from the Kosanga River (long. 27° E.) to Cape Guardafui One of the
                    most wonderful forms of birds peculiar to this province is the gigantic

                <p>Of the Gambian province we cannot say much, through want of materials to convey
                    any definite notion of its character; and we are only able to confirm the
                    general belief that it has a good deal in common with the Abyssinian, next to be
                    mentioned, for without lists carefully drawn up by those who have a special
                    knowledge of the avifauna of a country, or the power to compile such for
                    oneself, which in this case the present writer does not possess, any attempt at
                    a critical examination of its details would be rather misleading than otherwise.
                    The province probably lies between lat. 18° and lat. 10° N., but whether it
                    preserves those limits in the interior, whether it passes directly into the
                    Abyssinian, or whether another province intervenes, are questions that cannot be
                    now decided. It would seem to have in common with the East Coast several very
                    characteristic species, of which <hi rend="italic">Buphaga africana, Vidua

                    Libyan Subregion, while, admirably executed as it was at the time of its
                    appearance, so much has since been done by collectors in this part of Africa,
                    and by those who in Europe have examined their collections (especially Professor
                    Barboza du Bocage and Mr Sharpe), that its results must be regarded as out of
                    date. Yet no good, and much harm, would follow from any attempt to generalize on
                    the facts thus recorded, at various times and in various publications, except it
                    were made by one especially acquainted with African ornithology; and we must
                    therefore, perforce, leave the continental portion of this Subregion without
                    trying to exhibit its particular characteristics. Respecting the islands
                    belonging to it, however, somewhat may be advanced with more confidence. The
                    chief of these are four in number—Fernando Po, Prince’s Island, that of St
                    Thomas, and Annobon, The first, lying in the Bight of Biafra, was once believed
                    to possess a very peculiar avifauna; but one by one, all, or nearly all, of the
                    supposed peculiar species have been found on the mainland, until it seems likely
                    to have none whatever. Prince’s Island, situated outside the Bight, but still
                    lying within the Gulf of Guinea, has been said to possess 1 peculiar genus, <hi
                        rend="italic">Cuphopterus</hi> (of perhaps uncertain affinity, though it has
                    been referred to the <hi rend="italic">Timeliidoe),</hi> comprising a single
                    species, (but this has since been sent from the Gaboon) and 6 other species—1
                    each of <hi rend="italic">Dicoeidoe</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                        >Hirundinidoe,</hi> and 2 of <hi rend="italic">Ploceidoe</hi> and <hi
                        rend="italic">Columbid&lt;x</hi> respectively. A curious assertion has been
                    made with regard to this island, namely, that it is not inhabited by any Diurnal
                    Bird-of-prey, all such being, it is said, driven off by the Grey Parrots <hi
                        rend="italic">(Psittacus</hi><hi rend="italic">erithacus)</hi> which there
                    abound. The island of St Thomas, lying nearly or just under the equator, also
                    has 6 peculiar species, belonging respectively to the <hi rend="italic"
                        >Turdidoe, Dicaeidoe, Oriolidoe, Ploceidoe, Columbidoe,</hi> and <hi
                        rend="italic">Strigidoe;</hi> while another species of the family last
                    mentioned is common to this and Prince’s Island, but seems to be found nowhere
                    else. Of Annobon we know nothing.</p>
                <p>(3.) <hi rend="italic">The Caffrarian Subregion</hi> has its inland boundaries as
                    ill-defined as either of the preceding, yet its distinctive features are much
                    more marked—a fact which is doubtless to some extent explained by so great a
                    portion of it lying without the tropic. Though this part of Africa has perhaps
                    received the closest attention from ornithologists, the several labours in
                    various districts of the Subregion of Levaillant and Jules Verreaux, Audersson
                    and Andrew Smith, Mr Layard and Mr· Ayres, assisted at home by Sundevall and Mr
                    Gurney, all require digesting before their bearings upon the subject of
                    geographical distribution can be fully comprehended; and, as in the cases
                    previously mentioned, the careful collation and comparison of different lists
                    can only be usefully accomplished by one who has a special knowledge of the
                    objects treated of by those writers, and any attempt to attain this end by an
                    inexpert would be dangerous. Only one island can be with certainty affiliated to
                    this Subregion, and that is St Helena, where the indigenous Land-birds, if any
                    there were, have probably been extirpated with most of its original and peculiar
                    flora. Yet, curious as it may be, it seems to be a fact that this isolated spot
                    possesses a peculiar Water-bird, albeit it is of a group which greatly affects
                    dry places. This is a small Ringed Plover <hi rend="italic">(Aeguüitis
                        sanctoe-helenoe),</hi> and, though belonging to a genus the members of which
                    are remarkable for very wide distribution, it is not known to have occurred off
                    the island. Tristan da Cunha, commonly assigned to the Ethiopian Region, and
                    therefore to this Subregion, seems, from reasons before stated, to have at least
                    as much affinity to the Neotropical, and Ascension appears to have no indigenous
                    Land-birds whatever, so that its appropriation must remain in doubt.</p>
                <p>(4.) <hi rend="italic">The Mosambican Subregion</hi> next follows, and its
                    relations to the Abyssinian the numbers already quoted from Dr von Heuglin will
                    have shewn, but these must be taken with caution, since the limits of the
                    Subregion are so indefinite. Whether we should comprehend in it the whole of the
                    country drained by the Zambesi and its tributaries seems to be very uncertain;
                    but, judging from the collections he has received, Mr Sharpe is now inclined to
                    think that this part has more affinity to South Africa. The general uniformity
                    of distribution which obtains among the Birds of all the tropical portion of the
                    Region, especially noticed by Dr Kirk in writing on thosς,pf Zambesia <hi

                    details than are at present available to entitle us to form any very decided
                    opinion, though the in most respects ex cellent monograph of Drs Finsch and
                    Hartlaub (see note at page 758) gives ample information as to the literature and
                    descriptions of the 448 species which, according to those learned authors,
                    constitute its avifauna, and no attempt can possibly be made to subdivide the
                    Subregion into provinces. Lying off its coast are three considerable islands,
                    Pemba, Zanzibar, and Monfia, but as yet there is no reason <pb break="no"

                    bearing from a zoogeographical point of view. Zanzibar is the best known, and
                    that seems to have a few species peculiar to it— for instance, <hi rend="italic"

                <p>(5.) <hi rend="italic">The Afadagascarian Subregion</hi> remains for
                    consideration, and this from its insularity is obviously well defined, while a
                    good deal of attention has been paid to its remarkable peculiarities.' Indeed,
                    except New Zealand, it may be safely deemed the most peculiar Subregion on the
                    earth’s surface, while from ' <hi rend="subscript"> ι</hi> the richness and
                    multifariousness of its animal and especially of its ornithic population, New

                    Madagascar itself, once possessed in the extinct gigantic bird <hi rend="italic"

                    the Roc, not a vestige has been recovered which can be declared to belong to any
                    period to which history or even legend can reach, and Arabian tales are not
                    corroborated by the hypothesis of Professor Bianconi, while they are virtually
                    contradicted by the researches at home of Μ. Alphonse Milne-JJdwards, and Herr
                    von Nathttsius, and of Μ. Grandidier abroad. Three also of the satellite
                    islands—Mauritius, Réunion (Bourbon), and Rodriguez—possessed brevipennate Birds

                    now extirpated, flourished peacefully till they felt the power of man and his
                    agencies. But brief particulars of these extinct forms have already been given
                    (pp. 732, 733), and we must now restrict ourselves to the consideration of those
                    which survive.</p>
                <p>This Subregion is easily divided into two provinces— Madagascar and the Mascarene
                    Islands; but then it becomes a question whether the Comoros should not be
                    considered to form a third, and also how the Seychelles should be treated. Not
                    without scruples we propose to refer the latter to the Mascarene province as an
                    outlying group, and to regard the former in the same light in reference to the
                    Malagash province or Madagascar proper.</p>
                <p>Long studied as the Birds of Madagascar have been, hardly a year now passes
                    without some new form being added to its list; and what is especially remarkable
                    is that a very large proportion of the additions are not merely new species of
                    genera previously known, but are the types of undeniably good and new genera,
                    while it would seem also as if many of these had a very limited range in the
                    island, for every fresh district visited by a collector is almost sure to
                    produce something which neither he nor his predecessors have met with in other
                    parts, though the actual distance between the localities may be inconsiderable.
                    The number of genera of Land-birds amounts to nearly 100, and of them almost
                    one-half are peculiar to the Subregion; by far the greatest number of them
                    belonging to the Order <hi rend="italic">Passeres,</hi> though the <hi
                        rend="italic">Picarioe</hi> are also well represented by peculiar genera,
                    and the <hi rend="italic">Psittaci</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Columbae</hi>
                    possess to a certain extent the same characteristics. Many of the genera
                    belonging to the two Orders first named can be but with difficulty referred to
                    any family existing elsewhere, but for fear of exaggerating the singular
                    character of the Subregion we prefer regarding two only of these families as
                    absolutely peculiar. These are <hi rend="italic">Lepto-</hi><hi rend="italic"
                        >somidoe</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Eurycerotidae,</hi> the single genus and
                    species constituting each of which it seems impossible to place with any other
                    family. <hi rend="subscript"> z</hi> Almost the same may be said of the genera
                        <hi rend="italic">Brachypter</hi><hi rend="italic">acias,</hi><hi
                        rend="italic">Geobiastes,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Atelornis,</hi> which
                    may perhaps be linked in one group, though to what family it should be attached
                    seems very doubtful; and there is <hi rend="italic">Philepitta</hi> so isolated
                    that by one author it is referred to the <hi rend="italic">Turdidoe,</hi> by
                    another to the <hi rend="italic">Paradiseidoe,</hi> and by a third to the <hi
                        rend="italic">Pittidoe,</hi> the probability being that each assignation is
                    wide of the mark. But the avifauna of Madagascar is not entirely composed of
                    such singularities as these. We have homely genera, even among the <hi
                        rend="italic">Passeres,</hi> occurring there, such as <hi rend="italic"
                        >Acrocephalus,</hi><hi rend="italic">Motacilla,</hi><hi rend="italic"
                        >Pratincola,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Alauda,</hi> while a <hi
                        rend="italic">Cisticola,</hi> which, though it has received a distinct
                    trivial name, is undistinguishable from the well-known Fantail-Warbler (C <hi

                    Europe, Africa, and India, has long been known as an inhabitant of Madagascar.
                    But there are also species, though not Passerine, which are absolutely identical
                    with those of Britain— <hi rend="italic">Aluco</hi><hi rend="italic">flammeus,
                        Coturnix</hi><hi rend="italic">communis, Porzana</hi><hi rend="italic"
                        >pygmoea,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Podiceps minor</hi> —all of them common
                    in the island. The number of species of Birds hitherto found in Madagascar
                    cannot be safely put at less than 200, of which 120 are Land-birds, and of these
                    latter fully 100 are peculiar. The Comoros, so far as they have been explored,
                    have yielded more than 20 Land-birds, of which 12 at least are peculiar, the
                    remainder being common to Madagascar; but, no doubt, throughout every part of
                    the Malagash province there is room for further discoveries.</p>
                <p>The principal islands of the Mascarene province have had their original fauna so
                    largely destroyed by colonization, as has just been stated, that we are hardly
                    in a condition to judge its peculiarities accurately. Mauritius and Réunion,
                    lying within sight of each other, and possessing about the same number of
                    existing species, seem not to have more than 3 in common. There is 1 genus <hi
                        rend="italic">(Oxynotus)</hi> belonging to the <hi rend="italic"
                        >Campephagidoe</hi> which is peculiar to these two islands, and represented
                    in each by a distinct species. Réunion also had within the memory of men yet
                    living a peculiar genus of <hi rend="italic">Stumidoe</hi><hi rend="italic"
                        >—Fregilupus.</hi> Rodriguez is now known to possess only <hi rend="italic"

                            to cite similar cases of isolated Birds of either the Indian or
                            Ethiopian Region which have their nearest relatives natives of the

                        rend="italic">(Ibis,</hi> 1867, p. ff59), are peculiar; but there is no good
                    genus which can be so termed. Finally, we may mention that the small island of
                    Aldabra has a Dove which has been described as a distinct species, and that of
                    St Denis a Water-hen which probably merits the same remark. Taken as a whole, we
                    cannot but be struck with the force of the evidence as to the land-connection
                    which must once have existed—though not necessarily all at once—between the
                    various units forming the whole Subregion. Even the scanty remnant that is left
                    enables one to see how the denizens of its most distant quarters represent one
                    another, a clear token of their long-continued isolation and the working of a
                    differentiating power. But this is no place to pursue theories.</p>

                    be defined, have been already sketched out when treating of the adjoining areas.
                    Large as is its extent, and greatly varied as are its physical features, it
                    would seem to have but 2 peculiar families of Birds <hi rend="italic"
                        >(Phyllornithidae</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Euryloemidcé)</hi> out of
                    upwards of 70 which occur within its limits. There is peculiar difficulty in
                    determining the zoological Subregions and provinces into which this Region
                    should be separated. While the fauna of some districts, or even larger portions,
                    has been studied so that we possess a knowledge of them almost as full as of any
                    country in the world, Europe and the tracts of other Regions settled by
                    Europeans alone excepted, the greater part is not much better known zoologically
                    than is the centre of Africa. Yet we cannot treat the Indian Region with the
                    same audacity of ignorance that we did the Ethiopian, drawing our boundaries
                    here and there in a manner which the experience of a few more years will very
                    likely prove to be exceedingly wide of the mark, for our acquaintance with the
                    Region now under consideration is such as to convince us that throughout its
                    whole extent there are districts, large or small, which have an unmistakable
                    affinity to one another, and yet appear to be cut off from all communication
                    with their neighbours. True it is that we may readily account for this on the
                    ground that the similarity to be observed is due to corresponding elevation
                    above the sea-level, and that throughout the whole Region the hill-countries
                    are, as a rule, disconnected; but such an explanation does not make our task the
                    easier, and we are filled with the consciousness that we cannot map out the
                    Indian Region according to the method we have hitherto followed. We find the
                    characteristics of the Himalayan avifauna shewing themselves not only on the
                    highlands of Southern India and Ceylon, but far away to the eastward also, as in
                    Formosa, Hainan, and Cochin China, and again repeated in a lesser but still
                    perceptible degree to the southward in the mountain ranges of Malacca and
                    Sumatra. This then being the case, we think it better to follow in the main the
                    scheme adopted by Mr Elwes, to whose essay on the geographical distribution of
                    Asiatic Birds we have before referred (page 754). Right or wrong in his results,
                    he has the merit of having arrived at them, as he tells us, contrary to a
                    certain bias which he had entertained at the beginning of his investigations,
                    and these are marked by uncommon care and a diligent study of all the means of
                    information at that time available to him. Mr Elwes would establish three
                    Subregions— the “Himalayan” “or Himalo-Chinese,” the “Indian” (proper), and the
                    “Malayan.”</p>
                <p>(1.) <hi rend="italic">The Himalo-Chinese Subregion,</hi> according to his view,
                    includes all the middle slopes of the Himalayan range, from an elevation of
                    about 3000 to 12,000 feet, and, beginning with Cashmere, extends through Nepal,
                    Bhotan, the highlands of Assam, and thence, marching with the as yet
                    undetermined frontier of the Palaearctic Region, to the sea-coast of China. To
                    this Subregion belong the islands of Formosa and Hainan, and it not only
                    includes a great part of China proper, but probably the whole of Cochin China
                    and Siam, with the hill-country of Tennasserim and Burmah, merging into the
                    Malayan Subregion somewhere about lat. 12° N. In its western part, he observes,
                    it is merely a narrow border-land, in which the members of two very different
                    faunas meet, and, being inhabited during some part of the year by nearly all the
                    principal Palaearctic genera, and those of the proper Indian Subregion, probably
                    includes some of the richest portions of the world. Besides this, as already
                    remarked, its influence is felt far to the southward, even in the islands of
                    Ceylon and Sumatra.</p>
                <p>From what has been said above as to the way in which some of the Subregions of
                    the Indian Region are broken up, and this Subregion especially, it is useless to
                    attempt any partitioning of them into true zoological provinces. We can only
                    follow Mr Elwes in taking the various countries in succession, and stating what
                    is known of them. Cashmere is the first. Here there seems to be 171 Landbirds,
                    referable to 116 genera; of the latter, 34 have a wide range, 32 are
                    characteristic of the Palaearctic Region, 29 of the Indian, and 21 peβuliar to
                    or characteristic of the Himalo-Chinese Subregion. There is only 1 species
                    peculiar to the country—a very normal Bullfinch <hi rend="italic"
                        >(Pyrrhula)</hi> belonging to <hi rend="italic">Fringillidoe.</hi><hi
                        rend="italic">Cephalopyrus,</hi> an aberrant Titmouse <hi rend="italic"
                        >(ParidcE),</hi> and once thought to be a peculiar genus, extends eastward
                    so far as Simla. Of the species 70 seem to be peculiar to the Himalayan
                    district, and 30 are common to the Palaearctic Region.</p>
                <p>Nepal is the next country of which we know enough to give any satisfactory
                    account; and, indeed, thanks to Mr Hodgson’s labours in years gone by, our
                    knowledge of its zoology is very tolerably complete, though of late years little
                    has been added to it. Its rich avifauna is said to consist of 553 species of
                    Land-birds, belonging to 294 genera; of the latter, 62 are of wide range, 30
                    characteristic of the Palaearctic, and 122 of the Indian Region, while 80 are
                    peculiar to, or characteristic of, the Himalaya. Of the species there are 330
                    peculiar to the Himalayan district, and 60 common to the Palaearctic Region.</p>
                <p>The small state of Sikkim seems to be richer stilL Excluding the <hi
                        rend="italic">Accipitres</hi> there are here found 423 species of
                    Land-birds, of which 270 do not occur out of the Himalaya, except as migrants or
                    stragglers. Of these, 63 belong to genera of wide range, 60 more are of
                    Palaearctic distribution, and 154 are nearly peculiar to the Indian Region,
                    while 146 are peculiar to, or characteristic of, the Himalo-Chinese Subregion.
                    Passing to Assam, the hills to the north and east of which, however, are very
                    little known, its ornithic character seems greatly to resemble that of Sikkim;
                    but we have from its southern boundary a few genera which are not actually found
                    in the Himalaya, such as <hi rend="italic">Anthreptes, Turdinus,</hi> and <hi
                        rend="italic">Ehytoceros,</hi> belonging respectively to <hi rend="italic"
                        >Nectar-</hi><hi rend="italic">iniidoe, Timeliidoe,</hi> and <hi
                        rend="italic">Bucerotidoe,</hi> while we are acquainted with only 16 species
                    which are not found also in Sikkim, and of these one-half are Burmese.</p>
                <p>Burmah must be taken next, though a district intervenes of which we are quite
                    ignorant, and this country, its highlands especially, requires much more
                    exploration, but the valley of the Irrawadi, Aracan, and Pegu are very fairly
                    known. Of 373 species of Land-birds, 97 are common to India, and the rest to the
                    Malay peninsula. 193 more are found in India, and 27 in the peninsula alone,
                    while 46 are peculiar to Burmah or to Burmah and Tennasserim. In Tennasserim,
                    taking it to extend from Martaban to the isthmus of Krau, we have 313 species of
                    Land-birds, 93 being common to India and the rest of the peninsula, 117 more
                    being found in India, and 56 in the peninsula alone, while 47 are peculiar to
                    Tennasserim or to Tennasserim and Burmah. This country is especially rich in
                    species of the peculiarly Indian family <hi rend="italic">Euryloemidae,</hi>
                    possessing a majority of the known forms.</p>
                <p>Lying in the Bay of Bengal are two remarkable groups of islands—the Andamans and
                    the Nicobars—which the authority we are following would, from the similarity of
                    their avifauna to that of Pegu, include in this Subregion. Lord Walden, however,
                    thinks <hi rend="italic">(Ibis,</hi> 1873, p. 297) the former have a greater
                    affinity to the highlands of India south of the Himalaya and west of the
                    Brahmapootra, and Mr Hume <hi rend="italic">(Stray Feathers,</hi> ii. p. 136)
                    considers both groups to form an outlying bit of the proper Indian Subregion on

                    or even families, which are common in Burmah are wanting in the Andamans, such
                    as the <hi rend="italic">Timeliidoe, Pittidoe, Eurylaemidoe,</hi> and <hi
                        rend="italic">Bucerotidoe,</hi> though a peculiar form of the last occurs on
                    Narcondam, an island between the Andamans and Burmah, and there is an extreme
                    paucity of several other families. Still the Andamans possess an avifauna of
                    some 155 species, 17 of which (all Land-birds) are peculiar. The precise number
                    of species found in the Nicobars is not explicitly stated by Mr Hume, but he
                    gives 10 as peculiar to that group, which is inhabited by two very noteworthy
                    forms— <hi rend="italic">Caloenas,</hi> a very remarkable genus of <hi
                        rend="italic">Columbidoe,</hi> widely spread throughout the Malayan
                    archipelago, and a species of <hi rend="italic">Megapodius,</hi> belonging to
                    one of the most characteristic families of the Australian Region. The presence
                    of these two forms would almost incline one to remove the Nicobars from the
                    Subregion to which they have generally been assigned, and refer them rather to
                    the Malayan Subregion.</p>
                <p>It is now necessary to retrace our steps northward and notice China;<note

                    but this is a branch of the subject on which it is as yet impossible to form an
                    opinion. The chief authority on Chinese ornithology is unquestionably Mr
                    Swinhoe, who has for so long a time laboured in various parts of that country
                    equally as a public servant and a naturalist; but the results of his
                    multitudinous contributions to our knowledge of its avifauna have never yet been
                    tabulated, and probably their author is alone competent to perform this task
                    -without running into errors that would be disastrous in their consequences. In
                    his latest catalogue of the Birds of China,<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                        type="authorial"><p><hi rend="italic">Proc. Zool. Soc.</hi> 1871, pp.
                            337-343.</p></note> he enumerates 675 species as found in that country
                    and its islands; but valuable and carefully-drawn up as this list is, it is
                    impossible to eliminate therefrom the species not strictly belonging to that
                    part of the Celestial Empire which lies within our present bounds; or even were
                    this possible, an intimate acquaintance with its ornis would be required to
                    separate the birds-of-passage from the residents, and still more to classify
                    them according to their several Orders and families. Add to this, that
                    assiduously as Mr Swinhoe has himself worked in the field, and diligently as he
                    has availed himself of such information as he could obtain from other
                    trustworthy observers, only the outskirts of this great territory have, with few
                    exceptions, been examined. Much is it to be hoped that he will be able in due
                    time to bring forth the ripe fruit of his labours, but meanwhile the attempt to
                    elucidate the peculiarities of the avifauna of China proper, that is, south at
                    least of the Yangstzekiang and of Cochin China, would be vain if not
                    misleading.</p>
                <p>The two principal islands lying off the Chinese coast, however, are in a
                    different condition. One of them has been extremely and the other tolerably well
                    ransacked by Mr Swinhoe. In Formosa he has found 144 species, referable to 102
                    genera, of which 98 are found in the Himalayan Subregion, and 70 in the Malayan.
                    The species may be thus assorted :—74 belong to wide-ranging genera, 47 to
                    genera common to the Himalayan and Malayan Subregions, 18 are peculiar to, or
                    characteristic of, the former Subregion, and 5 to China itself; 18 are not found
                    in the Malayan Subregion, and no less than 34 are peculiar to the island. For
                    Hainan Mr Swinhoe has enumerated 130 species belonging to 96 genera, of which
                    latter 86 are common to the Malayan Subregion, and 93 to the Himalayan. Of the
                    species 54 belong to wide-ranging genera, 59 to genera characteristic of the
                    Indian and 16 of the Palaearctic Region, while 16 are believed to be peculiar to
                    the island.</p>
                <p>(2.) <hi rend="italic">The Indian Subregion,</hi> still following Mr Elwes, is
                    the next to be considered. This consists of the remainder of the peninsula of
                    India lying to the south and west of the last, as well as of the island of
                    Ceylon. Its partition into provinces has been several times attempted, and
                    doubtless the method proposed by Mr Blanford, when treating of the geographical

                    here it seems preferable to abstain from doing more than consider, so far as
                    materials are available, the avifauna of the various districts of which it is
                    composed— the more so since the extraordinary impulse given to the study of
                    ornithology in India by the publication of the late Dr Jerdon’s work<note

                    a few years place the whole subject in a very different light, for the number of
                    Indian ornithologists is grown so considerable that that country has now a
                    journal especially devoted to the record of their observations.</p>
                <p>Beginning in the north-west with the Punjab, we have as yet no complete list of
                    the Birds of this most important district, and we can only infer that we shall
                    here find the Malayan influence at its least, and the Palaearctic at its
                    greatest; but descending the Indus to Sindh we have a discursive account of its
                    ornithology by Mr Hume,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"

                    150 species observed, 41 are peculiarly desert-forms, and as such either very
                    nearly allied to or identical with the like forms of the Palaearctic and
                    Ethiopian Regions; 40 are peculiar to the Indian Subregion, 8 are common to the
                    Malayan, 4 to the non-desert portions of the Ethiopian, and 12 to the similar
                    parts of the Palaearctic Region, while 45 do not come under any of these heads.
                    Omitting the desert-forms as not leading to any just conclusion, it would appear
                    that Sindh has less affinity to the Ethiopian Region than to the Palaearctic,
                    that is to say, to its Mediterranean Subregion. The very remarkable district of
                    Cutch yielded 115 Land-birds to Stoliczka,<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    23 were found only on the hills of Kumaon. There seems to be a remarkable
                    absence of many of the most widely-spread genera of the Region, and many forms
                    generally common to Africa are also wanting; but no doubt Mr Brooks, who has of
                    late industriously investigated this portion of the country, will be able to
                    supply some of these unaccountable deficiencies.</p>

                <p>The avifauna of Southern India seems to be small relatively to the extent and
                    variety of the country, and most of its peculiar species are said to have a
                    considerable range of latitude, though some, which are restricted to the highest
                    hills, are only found to the southward of lat. 12° N., where several
                    mountain-ranges reach the height of 8000 feet. No single comprehensive listof
                    the Birds of this part of India seems lately to have been put together, and Mr
                    Elwes gives us no statistics as the result of his investigations whereby we may
                    compare its ornithic products with those of other districts.</p>

                    belong to genera inhabiting the Himalaya but not the Malayan Subregion, and only
                    6 to Malayan but not Himalayan genera, while 14 are members of genera only found

                    numerous species have been constantly described by various authors as coming
                    from Malacca or Singapore, which in most cases probably means that the specimens
                    have been purchased at one of those places. To enter into any details with
                    respect to the Malay Peninsula, therefore, would here be impossible, but the
                    case is different as regards the islands which form the greater part of the

                    ourselves of the results which he has so ably set forth. He enumerates 219
                    species, of which 150 are Land-birds; but in consequence of the caution he has
                    exercised, it is most probable that this number is really too small. Of these,
                    106 species are peculiar to the archipelago—96 of them being Land-birds. There
                    is no species, he remarks, which is common to the Philippines and the

                    the Philippines is very great, but it must be observed that hardly anything is

                    Sumatra, 226 species; in common with Java, 149; with the Philippines, 25; with
                    the Indian Subregion, 53; with China, 72; and with Celebes, 28. A species of <hi

                    Malacca, and the second inhabiting the Philippines, Borneo, and Sumatra.<note

                <p>Sumatra must be considered next, or perhaps it ought to have been taken after
                    Malacca, from which it is divided by so narrow a channel. The greater part of
                    this island, its northern half especially, is unknown, and not more than 240
                    species can be assigned to it, of which about 20 appear to be peculiar. Its
                    avifauna is much allied to that <pb break="no"

                    to have much less peculiarity than the latter’s.</p>
                <p>We then have Java, the best-explored, the most thickly-peopled, and,
                    proportionately to its fauna, the most peculiar, perhaps, of the Indo-Malay
                    Islands. Here we find about 270 species of Land-birds, of which about 45 are
                    peculiar—most of them being from the mountains in the western part of the
                    island. The reappearance in Java of several Burmese species, as <hi

                    others, which do not occur in the Malay Peninsula south of Penang, is very
                    remarkable.</p>
                <p>Of Bali, so interesting as the southern outpost of the Region, we only know from
                    Mr Wallace that he saw there several Birds highly characteristic of Javan
                    ornithology, and whether the island has any peculiar species nowhere appears. We
                    are then brought to the brink of that remarkable strait through which runs
                    “Wallace’s Line,” and crossing it find ourselves at once in the Australian
                    Region, with which we began this protracted dissertation.</p>
                <p>It is, of course, much to be regretted that at present our information does not
                    allow of our treating all the Six Zoological Regions of the globe on a uniform
                    plan, or of dealing equally with their several component portions. That this
                    will be possible in a few years, as materials are accumulated, none can doubt;
                    but as yet we are far from the attainment of so desirable an end, and must be
                    content to make the most of what we have. Want of space, also, has hindered the
                    proper consideration here of many points that fully deserve notice, and
                    especially the negative characteristics of the different Regions—often quite as
                    important as those which are positive. Of the imperfections of the preceding
                    sketch no one can be more painfully aware than its author, but its very
                    imperfections may serve a useful purpose in drawing attention to the districts
                    about which least is known. Yet it would be affectation for him not to believe
                    that it has some actual merit, but that merit is greatly if not chiefly due to
                    the kindness of Mr Wallace, who, in the manner already stated, has allowed his
                    forthcoming work to be laid under contribution, though in several respects its
                    conclusions are not here adopted. That work, when published, will unquestionably
                    form a foundation on which a noble superstructure will ultimately be erected,
                    but it were vain to anticipate the ends which such a building will one day
                    serve, and it would be beyond our scope to enter into any theoretical
                    disquisition on the deductions which follow from the facts here advanced.</p>
                <p>MIGRATION.</p>
                <p>Most strangely and unaccountably confounded by many writers with the subject of
                    Distribution is that of Migration. True it is that owing to the vast powers of
                    locomotion possessed by nearly all Birds, we have individuals belonging in the
                    main to certain groups, but by no means always confined to them, straying from
                    their proper quarters and occurring in places far removed, not only from the
                    land of their birth, but from the country whither they are ordinarily bound in
                    their journeys, to reach which is the object wherefore such journeys are
                    undertaken. It may be that in some measure this erraticism is governed by fixed
                    laws, and indeed indication is not wanting that such laws exist, though as yet
                    we know much too Httle to lay them down with any approach to confidence. But it
                    is obvious on reflection that granting the existence of most rigorous laws of
                    this kind—determining the flight of every winged vagabond—they must be very
                    different from those which are obeyed by Birds commonly called “Migratory,” and
                    migrating year after year according to a more or less fixed rule from one
                    locality to another with the seasons as they roll. The former laws would seem to
                    be created or controlled by purely external circumstances, which if they possess
                    any periodicity at all possess a periodicity of cycles, and are most likely
                    dependent in the main on cycles of the weather, but on this point observation
                    has not yet supplied us with the means of avoiding speculation. We may indeed
                    say almost without much risk of error that so many individuals of a foreign
                    species—whether North-American or Asiatic—will occur in Great Britain so many
                    times in the course of a term of years; but, though we may safely predict that
                    if they appear at all they will do so at a certain season, it is impossible to
                    make a forecast as to the year in which an example will turn up, or whether in
                    one year some half-dozen may or may not occur. The matter thus becomes a matter
                    of averages, and like all such is open to the influence of many perturbants, not
                    that such may not well be subject to some law of which we are ignorant. Besides
                    this, the average is hard to strike, depending as it must on the existence of
                    favourably-placed and watchful observers. Moreover if we consider that the
                    number of competent observers, though possibly greater in England than anywhere
                    else in the world, has been at all times small, it is not surprising that little
                    has been effected towards the compassing of any definite notion on this head. At
                    present we can but attribute the appearance of foreign stragglers on our shores,
                    and no doubt the same may be said of other countries, to the influence of storms
                    which have driven the wanderers from their course, and though other more remote
                    causes may possibly be assigned, there seems to be none but this on which we can
                    safely rely. Consequently until the periodicity of storms is brought within our
                    knowledge we must be content to abide in our ignorance of the laws which govern
                    the appearance of the strangers. Still confining our remarks to the British
                    Islands, the effect of these laws is in some degree constant. Singular as it may
                    appear, the greatest number of North-American Birds—and especially of the <hi
                        rend="italic">Limicoloe.</hi> or Shorebirds, which are recorded as having
                    occurred in this country have been met with in the eastern part of England or
                    Scotland. There are two ways of accounting for this fact, the first of which is
                    the unfortunate scarcity of observing naturalists in Ireland and on its western
                    coast especially, and this is by no means to be overlooked; but it may be
                    remarked that in no part of the United Kingdom is the profession of the gunner
                    more enthusiastically followed than in the sister island, and the men who pursue
                    that vocation are all alive to the mercantile value of any strange bird which
                    may fall in their way. Of course they have no means of knowing what it is, yet
                    as their spoils are sent for sale to the nearest market, it cannot but happen
                    that if many examples of North-American species were procured by them, some
                    proportion of these would find their way to the notice of the amateur naturalist
                    and by him be recorded in the public prints.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                        type="authorial"><p>It seems also not unlikely that the very scarcity of
                            rare birds in Ireland is one reason why there are so few ornithologists
                            in that country, for here it is not uncommon for a man to have his
                            attention first called to zoology by meeting with some strange animal—be
                            it beast, bird, beetle, or butterfly, and for such a man afterwards to
                            become no mean field-naturalist.</p></note> Now, as compared with Great
                    Britain, this so rarely occurs in Ireland that it is by no means unfair to draw
                    the inference that Transatlantic Birds are there far less frequently met with.
                    The second mode of accounting for the fact above stated is that the majority of
                    North-American Birds which occasionally visit Europe are of species which breed
                    in somewhat high northern latitudes. On their way thence to their
                    winterquarters, some are driven out to sea by violent westerly gales—the
                    strongest winds, be it remembered, that prevail <pb break="no"

                    that country observers may be said to be practically absent, and fowlers as a
                    rule unknown. Such storm-beaten wanderers there consort with the allied species
                    to be found at that season in abundance on its shores and in their company
                    pursue the same southerly course. With them they cross to the east of Great
                    Britain, and once arrived here are speedily picked out and secured by the
                    practised gunner. But should they even escape his notice, they with their
                    comrades follow the shore-line, where they obtain the best supply of food, until
                    passing round the south coast they find themselves at the western extremity of
                    England—the district of the Land’s End, in which, next to Norfolk and Suffolk,
                    the greatest number of these Transatlantic stragglers have been obtained. This
                    suggestion may serve to shew what most likely goes on in other parts of the
                    world, though the materials for establishing its general truth are not
                    forthcoming.</p>
                <p>I But returning to the subject of Migration proper, distinguished as it ought to
                    be from that of the more or less accidental occurrence of stray visitors from
                    afar, we have here more than enough to excite our wonder, and indeed are brought
                    face to face with perhaps the greatest mystery which the whole animal kingdom
                    presents—a mystery which attracted the attention of the earliest writers, and
                    can in its chief point be no more explained by the modern man of science than by
                    the simple-minded savage or the poet or prophet of antiquity. Some facts are
                    almost universally known and have been the theme of comment in all ages and in
                    all lands. The Hawk that stretches her wings toward the south is as familiar to
                    the latest Nile-boat traveller or dweller on the Bosphorus as of old to the
                    author of the book of Job. The autumnal thronging of myriads of Waterfowl by the
                    rivers of Asia is witnessed by the modern sportsman as it was of old by Homer.
                    Anacreon welcomed the returning Swallow, in numbers which his imitators of the
                    colder north, to whom the associations connected with it are doubly strong, have
                    tried in vain to excel. The Indian of the Fur-Countries in forming his rude
                    calendar names the recurring moons after the Birds-of-passage whose arrival is
                    coincident with their changes. But there is no need to multiply instances. The
                    flow and ebb of the mighty feathered wave has been sung by poets and reasoned of
                    by philosophers, has given rise to proverbs and entered into popular
                    superstitions, and yet we must say of it still that our “ignorance is
                    immense.’’</p>
                <p>On one point and one only in connection with this subject can we boast ourselves
                    to be clearly wiser than our ancestors. Some of them fully believed that the
                    seasonal disappearance of the Swallow, the Nightingale, the Cuckow, and the
                    Corncrake was due to hibernation, while others indeed doubted whether or not
                    this was the true explanation of the fact. It is not so long since this belief
                    and these doubts were in vogue, but now assuredly they have no hold upon the
                    mind of any one capable of appreciating evidence, and this absurd fancy being
                    exploded need not again trouble us.</p>
                <p>In considering the phaenomena of Migration it will be best first to take the
                    facts, and then try to account for their cause or causes. That a very large
                    number of Birds all over the world change their abode according to the season is
                    well known, and we find that in almost all countries there are some species
                    which arrive in spring, remain to breed, and depart in autumn; others which
                    arrive in autumn, stop for the winter, and depart in spring; and others
                    again—and these are strictly speaking the “Birds of Passage ”—which shew
                    themselves but twice a year, passing through the country without staying long in
                    it, and their transient visits take place about spring and autumn. People who
                    have given but little thought to the subject are apt to suppose that these
                    migrants, which may thus easily be classed in three categories, are acted upon
                    by influences of different kinds, whereas very little reflection will show that
                    all are really affected by the same impulse, whatever that may be, and that the
                    at first sight dissimilar nature of their movements is in truth almost uniform.
                    The species which resort to this and to other temperate countries in winter are
                    simply those which have their breeding-quarters much nearer the poles, and in
                    returning to them on the approach of spring are but doing exactly aβ do those
                    species which, having their winter-abode nearer the equator, come to us with the
                    spring. The Birds-of-passage proper, like our winter-visitants have their
                    breeding-quarters nearer the poles, but, like our summer-visitants, they seek
                    their winter-abode nearer the equator, and thus perform a somewhat longer
                    migration. So far there is no difficulty and no hypothesis—the bringing together
                    of these three apparently different categories is the result of simple
                    observation.</p>
                <p>This however is not the only fact which is evident on the most cursory
                    examination. To take the birds of the British Islands as an example (though
                    exactly similar cases are presented in other countries) we find that while there
                    are some species, such as the Swallow or the Fieldfare, of which every
                    individual disappears at one period of the year or another, there are other
                    species, such as the Pied Wagtail or the Woodcock, of which only the majority of
                    individuals vanish—a few being always present<note anchored="true"
                        place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Whether these few be not migrants from
                            another district is a point that would require further
                            consideration.</p></note> —and these species form the so-called “Partial
                    Migrants.” If we extend our view and look to birds on the continent of Europe,
                    we find that many species are there notoriously migrant which are not generally
                    suspected to be so in this country—such as the Song-Thrush and the Redbreast,
                    both of which species closer observation has proved to be with us subject to the
                    migratory impulse. In respect of the former it is known that towards the end of
                    summer or in autumn our native Song-Thrushes receive a considerable accession in
                    numbers from the birds which arrive from the north, though the immigration is by
                    no means so well marked as it is in Belgium, France, or Germany, where the
                    arrival of the strangers sets all the fowlers to work, and the beginning of the
                        <hi rend="italic">Chasse</hi><hi rend="italic">aux Grives</hi> or <hi
                        rend="italic">Drosselzug</hi> is regarded in many places nearly as the
                    Twelfth of August or the First of September is with us. In most localities in
                    Britain the new comers depart after a short sojourn, and are accompanied by so
                    many of the home-bred birds that in some parts of the island it may be safely
                    declared that not a single Song-Thrush can be found from the end of November to
                    the end of January, w hile in others examples can always be seen. Much the same
                    may be said of the Redbreast. Undeniably resident as a species, attentive
                    scrutiny will reveal the fact that its numbers are subject to very considerable
                    variation according to the season of the year. At no time do our Redbreasts
                    collect in bands, but towards the end of summer they may be seen in the south of
                    England successively passing onward, the travellers being mostly if not wholly
                    young birds of the year; and so the great majority disappear, departing it may
                    be safely presumed for more southern countries, since a few weeks later the
                    markets of most towns first in France and then in Italy are well supplied with
                    this species. But the migratory influence affects, though in a less degree, many
                    if not most of the Redbreasts that remain with us. Content during the autumn to
                    occupy their usual haunts, <pb break="no"
                        facs="ia:encyclopediabrit03newyrich/page/n783/mode/1up"
                        xml:id="kp-eb0903-0783-0766"/> the first sharp frost has a decided effect
                    upon their distribution, and a heavy fall of snow drives them towards the
                    homesteads for the larger supply of food they find there, while should severe
                    and long-continued hard weather follow even these birds vanish, leaving only the
                    few which have become almost domesticated.</p>
                <p>These two species have been here chosen as illustrative cases because they are at
                    once plentiful and familiar, and want of space only forbids us from citing
                    others, but we shall find on inquiry that there is scarcely a Bird of either the
                    Palaearctic or Nearctic Region, whose habits are at all well known, of which
                    much the same may not be said, and hence we are led to the conclusion that every
                    Bird of the northern hemisphere is to a greater or less degree migratory in some
                    part or other of its range. Such a conclusion brings us to a still more general
                    inference—namely that Migration, instead of being the exceptional characteristic
                    it uβed formerly to be thought, may really be almost universal, and though the
                    lack of observations in other, and especially tropical, countries does not allow
                    us to declare that such is the case, it seems very probable to be so. Before
                    proceeding however to any further conclusions it is necessary to examine another
                    class of facts which may possibly throw some light on the matter.</p>
                <p>It must be within the experience of every one who has ever been a birds’-nesting
                    boy that the most sedentary of Birds year after year occupy the same quarters in
                    the breeding season.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Two
                            remarkable instances of this persistency may be noticed. The nest of a
                            Falcon (<hi rend="italic">Falco</hi><hi rend="italic">peregrinus)</hi>
                            on Avasaxa—à hill in Finland somewhat celebrated as one of the most
                            southern points whence the midnight sun may be seen—is mentioned by the
                            French astronomer Maupertuis as having been observed by him in the year
                            1736. In 1799 it was rediscovered by Skjöldebrand and Acerbi. In 1833
                            Wolley found it tenanted, and from enquiries he made of the neighbours
                            it was evident that such had yearly been the case so far as any one
                            could remember, and so it was in 1855 as the writer can testify. In 1779
                            according to one account, in 1785 according to another, a pair of the
                            Blue Titmouse <hi rend="italic">(Parus caeruleus)</hi> built their nest
                            in a large earthenware bottle placed in the branches of a tree in a
                            garden at Oxbridge near Stockton-on-Tees. With two exceptions only, this
                            bottle, or a second which has lately been placed close to it, has been
                            tenanted by a pair of birds of this species from the year in which it
                            was first occupied until 1873, when the writer saw it.—See YarrelΓs <hi
                                rend="italic">British Birds,</hi> 4th ed. i. pp. 58, 486.</p></note>
                    In some instances this may be ascribed, it is true, to the old haunt affording
                    the sole or the most convenient site for the nest in the neighbourhood, but in
                    so many instances such is not the case that we are led to believe in the
                    existence of a real partiality, while there are quite enough exceptions to show
                    that a choice is frequently exercised. The same may equally be said of the most
                    migrant of Birds, and perhaps the strongest instance that has ever come to the
                    knowledge of the writer refers to one of the latter. A pair of Stone-Curlews <hi
                        rend="italic">(Oedicnemus</hi><hi rend="italic">crepitans)—</hi> a very
                    migratory species, affecting almost exclusively the most open country—were in
                    the habit of breeding for many years on the same spot though its character had
                    undergone a complete change. It had been part of an extensive and barren
                    rabbit-warren, and was become the centre of a large and flourishing
                    plantation.</p>
                <p>With these two sets of facts before us we may begin to try and account for the
                    cause or causes of Migration. Iu some cases want of food would seem to be
                    enough, as it is undoubtedly the most obvious cause that presents itself to our
                        mind.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Far more so
                            than variation of the temperature, though in popular belief that
                            probably holds the first place. But Birds generally, as compared with
                            other Vertebrates, are but slightly affected by extremes of heat or
                            cold, and indeed (so far as we can judge) by most climatic influences,
                            provided only their supply of food is not affected thereby. <hi

                    animals have of finding for themselves proper and sufficient sustenance is
                    all-powerful, and the difficulties they have to encounter in obtaining it are so
                    great that none can wonder that those which possess the power of removing
                    themselves from a place of scarcity should avail themselves of it, while it is
                    unquestionable that no Class of animals has this facility in a greater degree
                    than Birds.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>The only
                            animals which approach Birds in the extent and character of their

                            anything.</p></note> Even among many of those species which we commonly
                    speak of as sedentary, it is only the adults which maintain their ground
                    throughout the year. It has long been known that Birds-of-prey customarily drive
                    away their offspring from their own haunts so soon as the young are able to
                    shift for themselves. The reason generally, and no doubt truly, given for this
                    behaviour, which at first sight appears so unnatural, is the impossibility of
                    both parents and progeny getting a livelihood in the same vicinity. The
                    practice, however, is not limited to the Birds-of-prey alone, but is much more
                    universal. We find it to obtain with the Redbreast, and if we watch our
                    feathered neighbours closely we shall perceive that most of them indulge in it.
                    The period of expulsion, it is true, is in some Birds deferred from the end of
                    summer or the autumn, in which it is usually performed, until the following
                    spring, when indeed from the maturity of the young it must be regarded as much
                    in the light of a voluntary secession on their part as in that of an act of
                    parental compulsion, but the effect is ultimately the same. These cases,
                    however, which make certainly the exception rather than the rule, we can account
                    for in another manner. It is to be observed that they are confined to species
                    having a peculiar mode of life, the individuals associating in family-parties to
                    form small bands. The members of the Titmouse-family <hi rend="italic"
                        >(Paridae)</hi> offer a good instance of this peculiarity, but it requires
                    no very abstruse reflection to perceive that the adoption of this habit is one
                    eminently conducive to the easy attainment of their food, which is collected, as
                    it were, into particular spots often far apart, but where it does occur
                    occurring plentifully. Thus a single Titmouse searching alone might hunt for a
                    whole day without meeting with a sufficiency, while if a dozen are united by the
                    same motive it is hardly possible for the place in which the food is lodged to
                    escape their detection, and when discovered a few call-notes from the lucky
                    finder are enough to assemble the whole company to share the feast. It is
                    impossible to watch a band of any species of Titmouse, even for a few minutes,
                    without arriving at this conclusion. One tree after another is visited by the
                    active little rovers, and its branches examined: if nothing be forthcoming away
                    goes the explorer to the next that presents itself, merely giving utterance to
                    the usual twitter that serves to keep the body together. But if the object of
                    search be found, another kind of chirp is emitted, and the next moment the
                    several members of the band are flitting in succession to the tree and eagerly
                    engaged with the spoil.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"

                            the only particular bond of union not entirely selfish which keeps them
                            together is the cry of alarm with λvhich a stranger is

                <p>The mode in which the want of sustenance produces Migration may best be
                    illustrated by confining ourselves to the unquestionably migrant Birds of our
                    own northern hemisphere. As food grows scarce towards the end of summer in the
                    most northern limits of the range of a species, the individuals affected thereby
                    seek it elsewhere. Thus doing, they press upon the haunt of other individuals:
                    these in like manner upon that of yet others, and so on, <pb break="no"
                        facs="ia:encyclopediabrit03newyrich/page/n784/mode/1up"
                        xml:id="kp-eb0903-0784-0767"/> until the movement which began in the far
                    north is communicated to the individuals occupying the extreme southern range of
                    the species at that season; though, but for such an intrusion, these last might
                    be content to stay some time longer in the enjoyment of their existing
                    quarters.</p>
                <p>This seems satisfactorily to explain the southward movement of all migrating
                    Birds in the northern hemisphere; but when we consider the return movement which
                    takes place some six months later, doubt may be entertained whether scarcity of
                    food can be assigned as its sole or sufficient cause, and perhaps it would be
                    safest not to come to any decision on this point. On one side it may be urged
                    that the more equatorial regions which in winter are crowded with emigrants from
                    the north, though well fitted for the resort of so great a population at that
                    season are deficient in certain necessaries for the nursery. Nor does it seem
                    too violent an assumption to suppose that even if such necessaries are not

                    computation, twice as numerous as the former—unless the numbers of both were
                    diminished by the casualties of travel.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                            Southern Hemisphere were at all such as it is in the Northern, we should
                            no doubt find the birds of southern continents beginning to press upon
                            the tropical and equatorial regions of the globe at the season when they
                            were thronged with the emigrants from the north, and in such a case it
                            would be only reasonable that the latter should be acted upon by the

                            movement of northern migrants. But, though we know almost nothing of the

                            world, it is obvious that the feathered population of such as now-a-days

                    passionate fondness for the old home cannot but be taken into account, even if
                    we do not allow that in it lies the whole stimulus to undertake the perilous

                <p>Mr Wallace in some remarks on the subject <hi rend="italic">(Nature, X.</hi> p.
                    459) ingeniously suggests the manner in which the habit of Migration has come to
                    be adopted:<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>In principle
                            Captain Hutton had already foreshadowed the same theory.— <hi

                    —</p>
                <p>“It appears to me probable that here, as in so many other cases, ‘ survival of
                    the fittest’ will be found to have had a powerful influence. Let us suppose that
                    in any species of migratory bird, breeding can as a rule be only safely
                    accomplished in a given area; and further, that during a great part of the rest
                    of the year sufficient food cannot be obtained in that area. It will follow that
                    those birds which do not leave the breeding area at the proper season will
                    suffer, and ultimately become extinct; which will also be the fate of those
                    which do not leave the feeding area at the proper time. Now, if we suppose that
                    the two areas were (for some remote ancestor of the existing species)
                    coincident, but by geological and climatic changes gradually diverged from each
                    other, we can easily understand how the habit of incipient and partial migration
                    at the proper seasons would at last become hereditary, and so fixed as to be
                    what we term an instinct. It will probably be found, that every gradation still
                    exists in various parts of the world, from a complete coincidence to a complete
                    separation of the breeding and the subsistence areas; and when the natural
                    history of a sufficient number of species is thoroughly worked out, we may find
                    every link between species which never leave a restricted area in which they
                    breed and live the whole year round, to those other cases in which the two areas
                    are absolutely separated.”</p>
                <p>A few more particulars respecting Migration are all that can here be given, and
                    it is doubtful whether much can be built upon them. It has now been ascertained
                    by re- <hi rend="superscript"> i</hi> peated observation that in the
                    spring-movement of most species of the northern hemisphere the cock-birds are
                    always in the van of the advancing army, and that they appear some days, or
                    perhaps weeks, before the hens. It is not difficult to imagine that, in the
                    course of a journey prolonged throughout some 50° or 60° of latitude, the
                    stronger individuals should outstrip the weaker by a very perceptible distance,
                    and it can hardly be doubted that in most species the males are stouter, as they
                    are bigger than the females. Some observers assert that the same thing takes
                    place in the return-journey in autumn, but on this point others are not so sure,
                    which is not surprising when we consider that the majority of observations have
                    been made towards what is the northern limit of the range of the <hi
                        rend="italic">Passeres,</hi> to which the remark is especially applicable
                    —in the British Islands, France, North Germany, and the Russian Empire—for it is
                    plain that at the beginning of the journey any inequality in the speed of
                    travelling will not have become so very manifest. There is also another matter
                    to be noticed. It has been suspected that where there is any difference in the
                    size of birds of the same species, particularly in the dimensions of their
                    wings, the individuals that perform the most extensive journeys are naturally
                    those with the longest and broadest <hi rend="italic">remiges,</hi> and in
                    support of this view it certainly appears that in some of the smaller
                    migrants—such as the Wheatear <hi rend="italic">(Saxicola</hi><hi rend="italic"
                        >oenanthe)</hi> and Willow-Wren <hi rend="italic">(Phylloscopus</hi><hi
                        rend="italic">trochilus)</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi> the examples which
                    reach the extreme north of Europe and there pass the summer possess greater
                    mechanical powers of flight than those of the same species which stop short on
                    the shores of the Mediterranean. It may perhaps be also inferred, though precise
                    evidence is wanting, that these same individuals push further to the southward
                    in winter than do those which are less favoured in this respect. It is pretty
                    nearly certain that such is the case with some species, and it may well be so
                    with individuals. Canon Tristram has remarked <hi rend="italic">(Ibis,</hi>
                    1865, p. 77) that, in many genera of Birds, “those species which have the most
                    extended northerly have also the most extended southerly range; and that those
                    which resort to the highest latitudes for nidification also pass further than
                    others to the southward in winter,” fortifying his opinion by examples adduced
                    from the genera <hi rend="italic">Turdus, Fringilla, Cypselus,</hi> and <hi
                        rend="italic">Turtur.</hi> But supposing this to be true for many Birds, it
                    may fairly be doubted whether it is so for all, and whether in some species
                    certain individuals do not always occupy the most northern portion of the range
                    and others always keep to the most southern, no matter what the season of the
                    year may be, or over what countries the range may extend. On this point
                    therefore it will be advisable to await further investigation.</p>
                <p>For many years past a large number of persone in different countries have
                    occupied and amused themselves by carefully registering the dates on which
                    various migratory Birds first make their appearance, and certain publications
                    abound with the records so compiled.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                        type="authorial"><p>These are far too numerous to mention here. Perhaps the

                            and again from 1836 to 1874 by four generations of the Marsham family at

                    of high scientific repute, others of less note but of not inferior capabilities
                    for this especial object. Still it does not seem that they have been able to
                    determine what connection, if any, exists between the arrival of birds and the
                    state of the weather. This is not very wonderful, for the movements of the
                    migrants, if governed at all by meteorological forces, must be influenced by
                    their action in the places whence the travellers have come, and therefore to
                    establish any direct relation of cause and effect corresponding observations
                    ought equally to be made in such places, which has seldom been done.<note

                <p>As a rule it would seem as though Birds were not dependent on the weather to any
                    great degree. Occasionally the return of the Swallow or the Nightingale may be
                    somewhat delayed, but most Sea-fowls may be trusted, it is said, as the almanack
                    itself. Were they satellites revolving around this earth, their arrival could
                    hardly be more surely calculated by an astronomer. Foul weather or fair, heat or
                    cold, the Puffins <hi rend="italic">(Fratercula</hi><hi rend="italic"
                        >arctica)</hi> repair to some of their stations punctually on a given day as
                    if their movements were regulated by clock-work. Whether they have come from far
                    or from near we know not, but other Birds certainly come from a great distance,
                    and yet make their appearance with scarcely less exactness. Nor is the
                    regularity with which certain species disappear much inferior; every observer
                    knows how abundant the Swift <hi rend="italic">(Cypselus</hi><hi rend="italic"
                        >apus)</hi> is up to the time of its leaving its summer-home— in most parts
                    of England, the first days of August—and how rarely it is seen after that time
                    is past.</p>
                <p>It must be allowed, however, that, with few exceptions, the mass of statistics
                    above spoken of has never been worked up and digested so as to allow proper
                    inferences to be made from them, and therefore it would be premature to say that
                    little would come of it, but the result of those few exceptions is not very
                    encouraging. Some twenty years ago Dr von Middendorff carefully collated the
                    records of the arrival of migratory Birds throughout the Russian Empire, but the
                    insight into the question afforded by his published labours<note anchored="true"

                    down on the maps which accompany his treatise. The lines are found by taking the
                    average date of arrival of each species at each place in the Russian dominions
                    where observations have been regularly made, and connecting those places where
                    the dates are the same for each species by lines on the map. The curves thus
                    drawn indicate the nequality of progress made by the species in different
                    longitudes, and assuming that the advance is directly across the isepiptesial
                    lines, or rather the belts defined by each pair of them, the whole course of the
                    migration is thus most accurately made known. In the case of his seven sample
                    species the maps show their progressive advance at intervals of a few days, and
                    the issue of the whole investigation, according to him <hi rend="italic">(op.
                        cit.</hi> p. 8) proves that in the middle of Siberia the general direction
                    of the usual migrants is almost due north, in the east of Siberia from
                    south-east to north-west, and in European Russia from south-west to north-east.
                    Thus nearly all the migrants of the Russian Empire tend to converge upon the
                    most northern part of the continent, the Taimyr Peninsula, but it is almost
                    needless to say that few of them reach anything like so far, since the country
                    in those high latitudes is utterly unfit to support the majority. With the
                    exception of some details, which, though possessing a certain special interest,
                    need not here be mentioned, this treatise fails to shew more; for the fact that
                    there are places that notwithstanding their higher latitude are reached by Birds
                    on their spring-migrations sooner than others in a lower latitude was already
                    known.</p>
                <p>The routes followed by migratory Birds, so far as our information at present

                            very extensive literature needless here, and a pretty full

                    present article to do more than mention his results concisely. He enters very
                    fully into this part of the enquiry and lays down with much apparent probability
                    the chief roads taken by the most migratory Birds of the Palaearctic Region in
                    their return autumnal journey, further asserting that in the spaces between
                    these lines of flight such birds do not usually occur. These main routes are, he
                    states, <hi rend="italic">nine</hi> in number. The first (A—to use his
                    notation), leaving the Siberian shores of the Polar Sea, Nova Zembla, and the
                    North of Russia, passes down the west coast of Norway to the North Sea and the
                    British Islands. The second (B), proceeding from Spitsbergen and the adjoining
                    islands, follows much the same course, but is prolonged past France, Spain, and
                    Portugal to the west coast of Africa. The third (C) starts from Northern Russia,
                    and, threading the White Sea, and the great Lakes of Onega and Ladoga, skirts
                    the Gulf of Finland and the southern part of the Baltic to Holstein and so to
                    Holland, where it divides—one branch uniting with the second main route (B),
                    while the other, running up the valley of the Rhine and crossing to that of the
                    Rhone, splits up on reaching the Mediterranean, where one path passes down the
                    western coast of Italy and Sicily, a second takes the line by Corsica and
                    Sardinia, and a third follows the south coast of France and eastern coast of
                    Spain —all three paths ending in North Africa. The fourth (D), fifth (E), and
                    sixth (F) main routes depart from the extreme north of Siberia. The fourth (D)
                    ascending the river Ob, branches out near Tobolsk—one track, diverging to the
                    Volga, descends that river and so passes to the Sea of Azov, the Black Sea, and
                    thence, by the Bosphorus and Aegean, to Egypt; another track makes for the
                    Caspian by way of the Ural River and so leads to the Persian Gulf, while two
                    more are lost sight of on the steppes. The fifth (E) mouuts the Jennesei to Lake
                    Baikal and so passes into Mongolia. The sixth (F) ascends the Lena and striking
                    the Upper Amoor reaches the Sea of Japan, where it coalesces with the seventh
                    (G) and eighth (0) which run from the eastern portion of Siberia and Kamchatka.
                    Besides these the ninth (X) starting from Greenland and Iceland passes by the
                    Faeroes to the British Islands and so joining the second (B) and third (C) runs
                    down the French coast. These being the main routes it must be added that, in
                    Herr Palmén’s opinion and that of many others, nearly all river-courses form
                    minor routes.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>In giving

                    writer cannot offer an approach to the solution of this mystery. There was a
                    time when he had hopes that what is called the “homing” faculty in Pigeons might
                    furnish a clue, but Mr Tegetmeier and all the best authorities on that subject
                    declare that a knowledge of landmarks obtained by sight, and sight only, is the
                    sense which directs these Birds, while sight alone can hardly be regarded as
                    affording much aid to Birds—and there is reason to think that there are several
                    such—which at one stretch transport themselves across the breadth of Europe, or
                    even traverse more than a thousand miles of open ocean, to say nothing of
                    those—and of them there are certainly many—which perform their migrations by
                    night. That particular form of Bluethroat which yearly repairs to breed upon the

                    collectors of that country, a numerous and well-instructed body, have long taken
                    great interest, we are in a position to declare that it is not known to stop in
                    its transit from its winter haunts, which we know to be Egypt and the valley of
                    the Upper Nile, to its breeding-quarters. Other instances, though none so
                    crucial as th13, could be cited from among European Birds were there room here
                    for them. In New Zealand there are two Cuckows which are annual visitors: one, a
                    species of <hi rend="italic">Chrysococcyx,</hi> is supposed to come from
                    Australia, the other, <hi rend="italic">Eudynamis taitensis</hi> is widely
                    spread throughout Polynesia, yet both these birds yearly make two voyages over
                    the enormous waste of waters that surrounds the country to which they resort to
                    breed. But space would utterly fail us were we to attempt to recount all the
                    examples of these wonderful flights. Yet it seems impossible that the sense of
                    sight should be the faculty whereby they are so guided to their destination, any
                    more than in the case of those which travel in the dark.</p>
                <p>Dr von Middendorff <hi rend="italic">(op. cit.</hi> p. 9), from the conclusions
                    he has drawn, as before mentioned, as to the spring-movement of all birds in the
                    Russian Empire being towards the Taimyr Peninsula, the seat of one of the
                    magnetic poles, has suggested that the migrating Bird is always aware (he does
                    not sufficiently explain by what means) of the situation of this point, and thus
                    knows how to steer its course. Not only is this hypothesis unsupported by any
                    considerations known to the writer, but it is not at all borne out by 'the
                    observed facts of Migration in North America, where Birds as has been shewn by
                    Professor Baird <hi rend="italic">(op. cit.</hi> p. 347) do not migrate in the
                    direction of the magnetic pole.</p>
                <p>Other authors there are who rely on what they call “instinct” as an explanation
                    of this wonderful faculty. This with them is simply a way of evading the
                    difficulty before us, if it does not indeed remove the question altogether from
                    the domain of scientific inquiry. Rejecting such a mode of treatment, Herr
                    Palmén meets it in a much fairer spirit. He asserts <hi rend="italic">(op.
                        cit.</hi> p. 195) that migrants are led by the older and stronger
                    individuals among them, and, observing that most of those which stray from their
                    right course are yearlings that have never before taken the journey, he ascribes
                    the due performance of the flight to “experience.” But, granting the undisputed
                    truth of his observation, his assertion seems to be only partially proved. That
                    the birds which lead the flock are the strongest is on all accounts most likely,
                    but what is there to show that these are also the oldest of the concourse?
                    Besides this, there are many Birds which cannot be said to migrate in flocks.
                    While Swallows, to take a sufficiently evident example, conspicuously congregate
                    in vast flocks and so leave our shores in large companies, the majority of our
                    summer-visitors slip away almost unobserved, each apparently without concert
                    with others. It is also pretty nearly certain that the same species of Bird does
                    not migrate in the same manner at all times. When Skylarks arrive on our
                    north-eastern coast in autumn they come flitting over in a constant, straggling
                    stream, not in compact flocks; yet a little later these same birds collect in
                    enormous assemblages which prosecute their voyage in company. It is indeed
                    possible that each bird of the stream intentionally follows that which goes
                    before it, though in a long seapassage it must be hard to keep the precursor in
                    sight, and it may perhaps be granted that the leader of the whole is a bird of
                    experience. But then we must consider not these cases only, but also those of
                    Birds which do not migrate in company, and we must also have regard to what is
                    implied in the word “experience.” Here it can only signify the result of
                    knowledge acquired on former occasions, and obtained by sight. Now it was stated
                    by Temminck<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi
                                rend="italic">Manual</hi><hi rend="italic">à:</hi><hi rend="italic"

                    years ago, and so far as would appear the statement has not been invalidated,
                    that among migrants the young and the old always journey apart and most
                    generally by different routes. The former can have no “experience,”, and yet the
                    greater number of them safely arrive at the haven where they would be. The sense
                    of sight, essential to a knowledge of landmarks, as we have above attempted to
                    demonstrate, is utterly insufficient to account for th® success that attends
                    Birds which travel by night, or in a single flight span oceans or continents.
                    Yet without it the idea of “experience” cannot be substantiated. We may admit
                    that inherited but unconscious experience, which is really all that can be meant
                    by instinct, is a factor in tho whole matter—certainly, as Mr Wallace seems to
                    have proved, in originating the migratory impulse, but yet every aspect of the
                    question is fraught with difficulty, and we must leave to time the discovery of
                    this mystery of mysteries.</p>
                <p>There yet remain a few words to be said on what may be termed Exceptional
                    Migration, that is when from some cause or other the ordinary practice is broken
                    through. This differs from the chance occurrence of the waifs and strays with
                    which this section of the article began in that the Birds subject to it keep in
                    a great measure their customary habit of migrating, and yet are compelled to
                    indulge it in an irregular, or perhaps an altogether novel, manner, though they
                    are not entirely the sport of circumstances. The erratic movements of the
                    various species of Crossbill <hi rend="italic">(Loxia)</hi> and some allied
                    forms afford perhaps the best-known examples. In England no one can say in what
                    part of the country or at what season of the year he may not fall in with a
                    company of the Common Crossbill (A. <hi rend="italic">curvirostra),</hi> and the
                    like may be said of many other lands. The food of these Birds consists mainly of
                    the seeds of conifers, and as its supply in any one locality is intermittent or
                    precarious, we may not unreasonably guess that <pb break="no"

                    and may thus find an easy way of accounting for their uncertain appearance. The
                    great band of Nutcrackers <hi rend="italic">(Numfraga caryocatactes)</hi> which
                    in the autumn of 1844 pervaded Western and Central Europe<note anchored="true"

                    can hardly explain the roaming of all other Birds so plausibly. The inroads of
                    the Wax wing <hi rend="italic">(Ampelis garrulus)</hi> have been the subject of
                    interest for more than 300 years, and by persons prone to superstitious auguries
                    were regarded as the forerunners of dire calamity. Sometimes years have passed
                    without its being seen at all in Central, Western, or Southern Europe, and then
                    perhaps for two or three seasons in succession vast flocks have suddenly
                    appeared. Later observation has shown that this species is as inconstant in the
                    choice of its summer-as of its winter-quarters, and though the cause of the
                    irregularity may possibly be of much the same kind as that just suggested in the
                    case of the Crossbill, the truth awaits further investigation.<note

                    extraordinary events known to ornithologists is the irruption into Europe in
                    1863 of Pallas’s Sand-Grouse <hi rend="italic">(Syrrhaptes paradoxus).</hi> Of
                    this Bird, hitherto known only as an inhabitant of the Tartar steppes, a single
                    specimen was obtained at Sarepta on the Volga in the winter of 1848. In May 1859
                    a pair is said to have been killed in the Government of Vilna on the western
                    borders of the Russian Empire, and a few weeks later five examples were
                    procured, and a few others seen, in Western Europe—one in Jutland, one in
                    Holland, two in England, and one in Wales. In 1860 another was obtained at
                    Sarepta; but in May and June 1863 a horde computed to consist of at least 700
                    individuals overran Europe—reaching Sweden, Nor way, the Faeroes, and Ireland in
                    the north-west, and in the south extending to Sicily and almost to the frontiers
                    of Spain. On the sandhills of Jutland and Holland some of these birds bred, but
                    war was too successfully waged against the nomades to allow of their
                    establishing themselves, and a few survivors only were left to fall to the gun
                    in the course of the following winter and spring.<note anchored="true"

                    visitation to Great Britain was reported, but if it really took place it must
                    have been that of a very small number of birds, and it was not observed on the
                    Continent. Speculation has amused itself by assigning causes to these movements
                    but the real reason remains in doubt.</p>
                <p>We cannot quit the subject of Migration, however, without referring to the
                    wonderful assemblages of Birds which have in various places been time and again
                    noticed by night. Towards the close of summer, in dark, cloudy, and still
                    weather, it not unfrequently happens that a vast and, to judge from their cries,
                    heterogeneous concourse of Birds may be heard hovering over our large towns. The
                    practical ornithologist will recognize the notes of Plover, Sandpiper, Tern, and
                    Gull, now faint with distance and then apparently close overhead, while
                    occasionally the stroke of a wing may catch his ear, but nothing is visible in
                    the surrounding gloom. Sometimes but a few fitful wails are heard, of which only
                    an expert listener will know the meaning. At others the continuous Babel of
                    sounds will ensure the attention of the most incurious. It is supposed that
                    these noises proceed from migrating birds, which, having lost their way, are
                    attracted by the glare of the street-lamps, but far too little has been observed
                    to remove the obscurity that in a double sense surrounds them and to enable us
                    to come to any definite conclusion. It must be added also that such a concourse

                    great Acherusian Marsh had met in conflict overhead, but he could form no

                <p>SONG.</p>
                <p>Leaving then the subject of Migration, the next important part of the economy of
                    Birds to be considered is perhaps their Song—a word, however, in a treatise of
                    this kind to be used in a general sense, and not limited to the vocal sounds
                    uttered by not more than a moiety of the feathered races which charm us by the
                    strains they pour from their vibrating throat,—strains indeed denied by the
                    scientific musician to come under cognizance as appertaining to his art, but
                    strains which in all countries and in all ages have conveyed a feeling of true
                    pleasure to the human hearer, and strains of which by common consent the
                    Nightingale is the consummate master. It is necessary in a philosophical spirit
                    to regard every sound made by a Bird under the all-powerful influence of love or
                    lust as a “Song.” It seems impossible to draw any but an arbitrary line between
                    the deep booming of the Emeu, the harsh cry of the Guillemot (which, when
                    proceeding from a hundred or a thousand throats, strikes the distant ear in a
                    confused murmur like the roar of a tumultuous crowd), the plaintive wail of the
                    Plover, the melodious whistle of the Widgeon, “the Cock’s shrill clarion,” the
                    scream of the Eagle, the hoot of the Owl, the solemn chime of the Bellbird, the
                    whip-cracking of the Manakin, the Chaffinch’s joyous burst, or the hoarse croak
                    of the Raven, on the one hand, and the bleating of the Snipe<note

                    Grouse, on the other. Innumerable are the forms which such utterances take. In
                    many birds the sounds are due to a combination of vocal and instrumental powers,
                    or, as in the cases last mentioned, to the latter only. But, however
                    produced—and of the machinery whereby they are accomplished there is not room
                    here to speak— all have the same cause and the same effect. The former has been
                    already indicated, and the latter is its consummation. Almost coinstantaneously
                    with the hatching of the Nightingale’s brood, the song of the sire is hushed,
                    and the notes to which we have for weeks hearkened with rapt admiration are
                    changed to a guttural croak, expressive of alarm and anxiety, inspiring a
                    sentiment of the most opposite character. No greater contrast can be imagined,
                    and no instance can be cited which more completely points out the purpose which
                    “Song” fulfils in the economy of the bird, for if the Nightingale’s nest at this
                    early time be destroyed or its contents removed, the cock speedily recovers his
                    voice, and his favourite haunts again resound to his bewitching strains. For
                    them his mate is content again to undergo the wearisome round of nest-building
                    and incubation. But should some days elapse before disaster befalls their callow
                    care, his constitution undergoes a change and no second attempt to rear a family
                    is made. It would seem as though a mild temperature, and the abundance of food
                    by which it is generally accompanied, prompt the physiological alteration which
                    inspires the males of most birds to indulge in the “Song” peculiar to them. Thus
                    after the annual moult is accomplished, and this is believed to be the most
                    critical epoch in the life of any bird, cock Thrushes, Skylarks, and others
                    begin to sing, not indeed with the jubilant voice of spring but in an <pb

                    by the supervention of cold weather. Yet some birds we have which, except during
                    the season of moult, hard frost, and time of snow, sing almost all the year
                    round. Of these the Redbreast and the Wren are familiar examples, and the
                    Chiff-chaff repeats its two-noted cry, almost to weariness, during the whole
                    period of its residence in this country.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                            little attention, is whether the notes of the same species of Bird are

                            to think that it is not, and that there may exist “dialects,” so to

                <p>Akin to the “Song” of Birds, and undoubtedly proceeding from the same cause, are
                    the peculiar gestures which the males of many perform under the influence of the
                    approaching season of pairing, but these again are far too numerous here to
                    describe with particularity. It must suffice to mention a few cases. The Ruff on
                    his hillock in a marsh holds a war-dance. The Snipe and some of his allies mount
                    aloft and wildly execute unlooked-for evolutions almost in the clouds. The
                    Woodcock and many of the Goatsuckers beat evening after evening the same aerial
                    path with its sudden and sharp turnings. The Ring-Dove rises above the
                    neighbouring trees and then with motionless wings slides down to the leafy
                    retreat they afford. The Capercally and Blackcock, perched on a commanding
                    eminence, throw themselves into postures that defy the skill of the
                    caricaturist—other species of the Grouse-tribe assume the strangest attitudes
                    and rur in circles till the turf is worn bare. The Peacock in pride spreads his
                    train so as to shew how nearly akin are the majestic and the ludicrous. The
                    Bower-bird, not content with his own splendour, builds an arcade, decked with
                    bright feathers and shining shells, through and around which he paces with his
                    gay companions. The Larks and Pipits never deliver their song so well as when
                    seeking the upper air. Rooks rise one after the other to a great height and,
                    turning on their back, wantonly precipitate themselves many yards towards the
                    ground, while the solemn Raven does not scorn a similar feat, and, with the
                    tenderest of croaks, glides supinely alongside or in front of his mate.<note

                <p>NIDIFICATION.</p>
                <p>Following or coincident with the actions just named, and countless more besides,
                    comes the real work of the breeding-season, to which they are but the prelude or
                    the accompaniment. Nidification is with most birds the beginning of this
                    business; but with many it is a labour that is scamped if not shirked. Some of
                    the Auk tribe place their single egg on a bare ledge of rock, where its peculiar
                    conical shape is but a precarious safeguard when rocked by the wind or stirred
                    by the thronging crowd of its parents’ fellows. The Stone-Curlew and the
                    Goatsucker deposit their eggs without the slightest preparation of the soil on
                    which they rest; yet this is not done at haphazard, for no birds can be more
                    constant in selecting, almost to an inch, the very same spot which year after
                    year they choose for their procreant cradle. In marked contrast to such artless
                    care stand the wonderful structures which others, such as the Tailor-bird, the
                    Bottle-Titmouse, or the Fantail-Warbler build for the comfort or safety of their
                    young. But every variety of disposition may be found in the Class. The Apteryx
                    seems to entrust its abnormally big egg to an excavation among the roots of a
                    tree-fern; while a band of female Ostriches scrape holes in the desert-sand and
                    therein promiscuously dropping their eggs cover them with earth and leave the
                    task of incubation to the male, who discharges the duty thus imposed upon him by
                    night only, and trusts by day to the sun’s rays for keeping up the needful,
                    fostering warmth. The Megapodes raise a huge hotbed of dead leaves wherein they
                    deposit their eggs and the young are hatched without further care on the part of
                    either parent. Some of the Grebes and Rails seem to avail themselves in a less
                    degree of the heat generated by vegetable decay, and dragging from the bottom or
                    sides of the waters they frequent fragments of aquatic plants form of them a
                    rude half-floating mass which is piled on some growing water-weed—but these
                    birds do not spurn the duties of maternity. Many of the Gulls, Sandpipers, and
                    Plovers lay their eggs in a shallow pit which they hollow out in the soil, and
                    then as incubation proceeds add thereto a low breastwork of haulm. The Ringed
                    Plover commonly places its eggs on shingle, which they so much resemble in
                    colour, but when breeding on grassy uplands it paves the nest-hole with small
                    stones. Pigeons mostly make an artless platform of sticks so loosely laid
                    together that their pearly treasures may be perceived from beneath by the
                    inquisitive observer. The Magpie, as though self-conscious that its own thieving
                    habits may be imitated by its neighbours, surrounds its nest with a hedge of
                    thorns. Very many birds of almost every group bore holes in some sandy cliff,
                    and at the end of their tunnel deposit their eggs with or without bedding. Such
                    bedding, too, is very various in character; thus, while the Sheldduck and the
                    Sand-Martin supply the softest of materials, the one of down from her own body,
                    the other of feathers collected by dint of diligent search,—the Kingfisher forms
                    a couch of the undigested spiny fish-bones which she ejects in pellets from her
                    own stomach. Other birds, as the Woodpeckers, hew holes in living trees, even
                    when the timber is of considerable hardness, and therein establish their
                    nursery. Some of the Swifts secrete from their salivary glands a fluid which
                    rapidly hardens as it dries on exposure to the air into a substance resembling
                    isinglass, and thus furnish the “edible birds’ nests” that are the delight of
                    Chinese epicures. In the architecture of nearly all the Passerine birds, too,
                    some salivary secretion seems to play an important part. By its aid they are
                    enabled to moisten and bend the otherwise refractory twigs and straws and glue
                    them to their place. Spiders’ webs also are employed with great advantage for
                    the purpose last mentioned, but perhaps chiefly to attach fragments of moss and
                    lichen so as to render the whole structure less obvious to the eye of the
                    spoiler. The Tailor-bird deliberately spins a thread of cotton and therewith
                    stitches together the edges of a pair of leaves to make a receptacle for its
                    nest. Beautiful too is the felt fabricated of fur or hairs by the various
                    species of Titmouse, while many birds ingeniously weave into a compact mass both
                    animal and vegetable fibres, forming an admirable non-conducting medium which
                    guards the eggs from the extremes of temperature outside. Such a structure may
                    be open and cup-shaped, supported from below as that of the Chaffinch and
                    Goldfinch, domed like that of the Wren and Bottle-Titmouse, slung hammock-wise
                    as in the case of the Golden-crested Wren and the Orioles, or suspended by a
                    single cord as with certain Grosbeaks and Hummingbirds. Under such circumstances
                    it is even sometimes needful to balance the nest lest the weight of the growing
                    young should destroy the equipoise and, precipitating them on the ground, dash
                    the hopes of the parents, and compensation in such cases is applied by loading
                    the opposite <pb break="no"

                    Certain Warblers <hi rend="italic">(Aedon</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                        >Thamηobia)</hi> for some unascertained reason invariably lay a piece of
                    snake’s slough in their nests—to repel, it has been suggested, marauding lizards
                    who may thereby fear the neighbourhood of a deadly enemy. The clay-built
                    edifices of the Swallow and Martin are known to everybody, and the Nuthatch
                    plasters up the gaping mouth of its nest-hole till only a postern large enough
                    for entrance and exit, but easy of defence, is left. In South America we have a
                    family of birds <hi rend="italic">(Eurnariidoe)</hi> which construct on the
                    branching roots of the mangrove globular ovens, so to speak, of mud, wherein the
                    eggs are laid and the young hatched. The Flamingo erects in the marshes it
                    frequents a mound of earth some two feet in height, with a cavity atop, on which
                    the hen, having oviposited, sits astride with dangling legs, and in that
                    remarkable attitude is said to perform the duty of incubation. The females of
                    the Hornbills, and perhaps of the Hoopoes, submit to incarceration during this
                    interesting period, the males immuring them by a barrier of mud, leaving only a
                    small window to admit air and food, which latter is assiduously brought to the
                    prisoners.</p>
                <p>But though in a general way the dictates of hereditary instinct are rigidly
                    observed by birds, in many species a remarkable degree of elasticity is
                    exhibited or the rule of habit is rudely broken. Thus the noble Falcon, whose
                    ordinary eyry is on the beetling cliff, will for the convenience of procuring
                    prey condescend to lay its eggs on the ground in a marsh, or appropriate the
                    nest of some other bird in a tree. The Golden Eagle, too, remarkably adapts
                    itself to circumstances, now rearing its young on a precipitous ledge, now on
                    the arm of an ancient monarch of the forest and again on a treeless plain,
                    making a humble home amid grass and herbage. Herons also shew the same
                    versatility and will breed according to circumstances in an open fen, on
                    sea-banks or (as is most usual) on lofty trees. Such changes are easy to
                    understand. The instinct of finding food for the family is predominant, and
                    where most food is there will the feeders be gathered together. This explains,
                    in all likelihood, the associated bands of Ospreys or Fish-Hawks, which in North
                    America breed (or used to breed) in large companies where sustenance is
                    plentiful, though in the Old World the same species brooks not the society of
                    aught but its mate. Birds there are of eminently social predilections. In
                    Europe, excepting Sea-fowls—whose congregations are universal and known to
                    all—we have perhaps but the Heron, the Fieldfare, and the Rook, which habitually
                    flock during the breeding-season; but in other parts of the world many birds
                    unite in company at that time, and in none possibly is this habit so strongly
                    developed as in the Anis of the Neotropical Region, the Republican Swallow of
                    North America, and the Sociable Grosbeak of South Africa, which last joins nest
                    to nest until the tree is said to break down under the accumulated weight of the

                <p>In the strongest contrast to these amiable qualities is the parasitic nature of
                    the Cuckows of the Old World and the Cow-birds of the New, but this peculiarity
                    of theirs is so well known that to dwell upon it would be needless. Enough to
                    say that the egg of the parasite is introduced into the nest of the dupe, and
                    after the necessary incubation by the fond fool of a foster-mother the
                    interloper successfully counterfeits the heirs, who perish miserably, victims of
                    his superior strength. The whole process has been often watched, but the
                    reflective naturalist will pause to ask how such a state of things came about,
                    and there is not much to satisfy his enquiry. Certain it is that some birds
                    whether by mistake or stupidity do not unfrequently lay their eggs in the nests
                    of others. It is within the knowledge of many that Pheasants’ eggs and
                    Partridges’ eggs are often laid in the same nest, and it is within the knowledge
                    of the writer that Gulls’ eggs have been found in the nests of Eider-Ducks, and
                        <hi rend="italic">vice versa;</hi> that a Redstart and a Pied Flycatcher
                    will lay their eggs in the same convenient hole —the forest being rather
                    deficient in such accommodation; that an Owl and a Duck will resort to the same
                    nest-box, set up by a scheming woodsman for his own advantage; and that the
                    Starling, which constantly dispossesses the Green Woodpecker, sometimes
                    discovers that the rightful heir of the domicile has to be brought up by the
                    intruding tenant In all such cases it is not possible to say which species is so
                    constituted as to obtain the mastery, but it is not difficult to conceive that
                    in the course of ages that which was driven from its home might thrive through
                    the fostering of its young by the invader, and thus the abandonment of domestic
                    habits and duties might become a direct gain to the evicted householder. This
                    much granted, all the rest will follow easily enough, but it must be confessed
                    that this is only a presumption, though a presumption which seems plausible if
                    not likely.</p>

                <p>The pains bestowed by such Birds (incomparably the most numerous of the Class),
                    as build elaborate nests and the devices employed by those that, not doing so,
                    display no little skill in providing for the preservation of their produce,
                    invite some attention to the eggs which they lay. This attention will perhaps be
                    more cheerfully given when we think how many naturalists, not merely
                    ornithologists, have been first directed to the study of the animal kingdom by
                    the spoils they have won in their early days of birds’ nesting. With some such
                    men the fascination of this boyish pursuit has maintained its full force even in
                    old age—a fact not so much to be wondered at when it is considered that hardly
                    any branch of the practical study of Natural History brings the enquirer so
                    closely in contact with many of its secrets. It is therefore eminently
                    pardonable for the victims of this devotion to dignify their passion by the
                    learned name of <hi rend="smallcaps">“</hi><hi rend="smallcaps">Oologï,”</hi>
                    and to bespeak for it the claims of a science. Yet the present writer—once an
                    ardent follower of the practice of birds’-nesting, and still on occasion warming
                    to its pleasures—must confess to a certain amount of disappointment as to the
                    benefits it was expected to confer on Systematic Ornithology, though he yields
                    to none in his high estimate of its utility in acquainting the learner with the
                    most interesting details of bird-life—without a knowledge of which nearly all
                    systematic study is but work that may as well be done in a library, a museum, or
                    a dissecting-room, and is incapable of conveying information to the learner
                    concerning the why and the wherefore of such or such modifications and
                    adaptations of structure. To some—and especially to those who are only
                    anatomists— this statement may seem preposterous, but it is in truth no such
                    thing. What engineer can be said to understand his business if he knows not the
                    purpose to which the machines he makes are to be applied and is unacquainted

                    the economy of the creature we as naturalists have done but half our task and
                    abandon our labour when the fulness of reward is coming upon us. The
                    field-naturalist, properly instructed, crowns the work of the comparative
                    anatomist and the physiologist, though without the necessary education he is
                    little more than an empiric, even should he possess the trained cunning of the
                    savage on whose knowledge of the habits of wild animals depends his chance of
                    procuring a meal.</p>
                <p>Perhaps the greatest scientific triumph of oologists lies in their having fully
                    appreciated the intimate alliance of the <hi rend="italic">Limicoloe</hi> (the
                    great group of Snipes and Plovers) with the <hi rend="italic">Gavioe</hi> (the
                    Gulls, Terns, and other birds more distantly connected with them) before it was
                    recognized by any professed taxonomist,—L’Herminier, whose researches have been
                    much overlooked, excepted; though to such an one was given the privilege of
                    placing that affinity beyond cavil (Huxley, <hi rend="italic">Proc. Zool.
                        Soc.</hi> 1867, pp. 426, 456-458; <hi rend="italic">cf. Ibis,</hi> 1868, p.
                    92). In like manner it is believed that oologists first saw the need of
                    separating from the true <hi rend="italic">Passeres</hi> several groups of birds
                    that had for many years been unhesitatingly associated with that very uniform
                    assemblage. Diffidence as to their own capacity for meddling with matters of
                    systematic arrangement may possibly have been the cause which deterred the men
                    who were content to brood over birds’ eggs from sooner asserting the validity of
                    the views they held. Following the example furnished by the objects of their
                    study, they seem to have chiefly sought to hide their offspring from the curious
                    eye—and if such was their design it must be allowed to have been admirably
                    successful. In enthusiastic zeal for the prosecution of their favourite
                    researches, however, they have never yielded to, if they have not surpassed, any
                    other class of naturalists. If a storm-swept island, only to be reached at the
                    risk of life, held out the hope of some oological novelty there was the
                    egg-collector (Faber, <hi rend="italic">Isis,</hi> xx. pp. 633-688; Proctor, <hi
                        rend="italic">Naturalist,</hi> 1838, pp. 411, 412). Did another treasure
                    demand his traversing a burning desert (Tristram, <hi rend="italic">Ibis,</hi>
                    1859, p. 79) or sojourning for several winters within the wildest wastes of the
                    Arctic Circle (Wolley, <hi rend="italic">Ibis,</hi> 1859, pp. 69-76; 1861, pp.
                    92-106; Kennicott, <hi rend="italic">Rep. Smithson. Inst.</hi> 1862, pp. 39,
                    40), he endured the necessary hardships to accomplish his end, and the
                    possession to him of an empty shell of carbonate of lime,<note anchored="true"
                        place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>A small proportion of carbonate of

                    secretion of the villous membrane of the parent’s uterus, was to him a
                    sufficient reward. Taxonomers, however, have probably been right in not
                    attaching too great an importance to such systematic characters as can be
                    deduced from the eggs of birds, but it would have been better had they not
                    insisted so strongly as they have done on the infallibility of one or another
                    set of characters, chosen by themselves. Oology taken alone proves to be a guide
                    as misleading as any other arbitrary method of classification, but combined with
                    the evidence afforded by due study of other particularities, whether superficial
                    or deep-seated, it can scarcely fail in time to conduct us to an ornithological
                    arrangement as nearly true to Nature as we may expect to achieve.</p>
                <p>The first man of science who seems to have given any special thought to oology,
                    was the celebrated Sir Thomas Browne, of Norwich, who already in 1681, when
                    visited by John Evelyn (from whose diary we learn the fact), had assigned a
                    place in his cabinet of rarities to a collection of birds’ eggs. The next we
                    hear of is that Count of Marsigli who early in the eighteenth century explored,
                    chiefly for this kind of investigation, the valley of the Danube—a region at
                    that time, it is almost unnecessary to remark, utterly unknown to naturalists.
                    But there is no need to catalogue the worthies of this study. As they approach
                    our own day their number becomes far too great to tell, and if very recently it
                    has seemed to dwindle the reason is probably at hand in the reflection that most
                    of the greatest prizes have been won, while those that remain to reward the
                    aspiring appear to be just now from one cause or another almost out of reach.
                    Perhaps at the present time the Birds-of-Paradise and their allies form the only
                    group of any recognized distinctiveness and extent of whose eggs we know
                    absolutely nothing—though there are important isolated forms, such a3 <hi
                        rend="italic">Atrichia, Heterolocha,</hi> and others, concerning the eggs as
                    well as the breeding habits of which our ignorance is absolute, and the species
                    of many families that have hitherto defied the zeal of oologists are very
                    numerous. These last, however, though including some common and some not very
                    uncommon British birds, possess in a general way comparatively little interest,
                    since, the eggs of their nearest allies being well known, we cannot expect much
                    to follow from the discovery of the recluses, and it is only to the impassioned
                    collector that the obtaining of such desiderata will afford much
                    satisfaction.</p>
                <p>The first thing which strikes the eye of one who beholds a large collection of
                    egg-shells is the varied hues of the specimens. Hardly a shade known to the
                    colourist is not exhibited by one or more, and some of these tints have their
                    beauty enhanced by the glossy surface on which they are displayed, by their
                    harmonious blending, or by the pleasing contrast of the pigments which form
                    markings as often of the most irregular as of regular shape. But it would seem
                    as though such markings, which a very small amount of observation will shew to
                    have been deposited on the shell a short time before its exclusion, are
                    primarily and normally circular, for hardly any egg that bears markings at all
                    does not exhibit some spots of that form, but that in the progress of the eggs
                    through that part of the oviduct in which the colouring matter is laid on many
                    of them become smeared, blotched, or protracted in some particular direction.
                    The circular spots thus betoken the deposition of the pigment while the egg is
                    at rest, the blurred markings show its deposition while the egg is in motion,
                    and this motion would seem often to be at once onward and rotatory, as indicated
                    by the spiral markings not uncommonly observable in the eggs of some
                    Birds-of-prey and others—the larger end of the egg (when the ends differ in
                    form) making way for the smaller.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                        type="authorial"><p>That the larger end is protruded first was found on
                            actual experiment by Mr Bartlett, Superintendent of the Gardens of the
                            Zoological Society, to be the case commonly, but as an accident the
                            position may be sometimes reversed, and this will most likely account
                            for the occasional deposition of markings on the smaller instead of the
                            larger end as not un frequently shown in eggs of the Sparrow-hawk <hi

                            of the chick is always formed at the larger end.</p></note> At the same
                    time the eggs of a great number of birds bear, beside these last and
                    superimposed markings, more deeply-seated stains, generally of a paler and often
                    of an altogether different hue, and these are evidently due to some earlier
                    dyeing process. The peculiar tint of the ground-colour, though commonly
                    superficial, if not actually congenital with the formation of the shell, would
                    appear to be suffused soon after. The depth of colouring whether original or
                    supervening is obviously dependent in a great measure on the constitution or
                    bodily condition of the parent. If a bird, bearing in its oviduct a fully-formed
                    egg, be captured, that egg will speedily be laid under any circumstances of
                    inconvenience to which its producer shall be subjected, but such an egg is
                    usually deficient in coloration—fright and <pb break="no"

                    secretions. In like manner over excitement or debility of the organs, the
                    consequence of ill health, give rise to much and often very curious abnormality.
                    It is commonly believed that the older a bird is the more intensely coloured
                    will be its eggs, and to some extent this belief appears to be true. Certain <hi
                        rend="italic">Ealconidoe,</hi> which ordinarily lay very brilliantly-tinted
                    eggs, and are therefore good tests, seem when young unable to secrete so much
                    colouring-matter as they do when older, and season after season the dyes become
                    deeper, but there is reason to think that when the bird has attained its full
                    vigour improvement stops, and a few years later the intensity of hue begins to
                    decline. It would be well if we had more evidence, however, in support of this
                    opinion, which is chiefly based on a series of eggs of one species—the Golden
                    Eagle <hi rend="italic">(Aquila chrysaetus),</hi> in the writer’s possession,
                    among which are some believed on good grounds to have been the produce in the
                    course of about twelve years of one and the same female. The amount of
                    colouring-matter secreted and deposited seems notwithstanding to be generally a
                    pretty constant quantity—allowance being made for individual constitution; but
                    it often happens—especially in birds that lay only two eggs—that nearly all the
                    dye will be deposited on one of these, leaving the other colourless; it seems,
                    however, to be a matter of inconstancy which of the two is first developed. Thus
                    of two pairs of Golden Eagles’ eggs also in the possession of the writer, one
                    specimen of each pair is nearly white while the other is deeply coloured, and it
                    is known that in one case the white egg was laid first and in the other the
                    coloured one. When birds lay many mottled, and <hi rend="italic">a fortiori</hi>
                    plain, eggs, there is generally less difference in their colouring, and though
                    no two can hardly ever be said to be really alike, yet the family resemblance
                    between them all is obvious to the practised eye. It would seem however to be a
                    peculiarity with some species—and the Tree-Sparrow <hi rend="italic"
                        >(Passer·</hi><hi rend="italic">montanus)</hi> which lays five or six eggs
                    may be taken as a striking example— that one egg should always differ remarkably
                    from the rest of the clutch. In addition to what has been said above as to the
                    deposition of colour in circular spots indicating a pause in the progress of the
                        <hi rend="italic">egg</hi> through one part of the oviduct, it may be
                    observed that the cessation of motion at that time is equally shewn by the
                    clearly defined hair-lines or vermiculations seen in many eggs, and in none more
                    commonly met with than in those of the Buntings <hi rend="italic"
                        >(Ember-</hi><hi rend="italic">izidoe).</hi> Such markings must not only
                    have been deposited while the egg was at rest, but it must have remained
                    motionless until the pigment was completely set, or blurred instead of sharp
                    edges would have been the result.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    the subject by the researches of Mr Sorby <hi rend="italic">(Proc. Zool.
                        Soc.</hi> 1875, p. 351), who, using the method of spectrum-analysis, has now
                    ascertained the existence of <hi rend="italic">seven</hi> well-marked substances
                    in the colouring-matter of eggs, to the admixture of which in certain
                    proportions all their tints are due. These he names</p>
                <p>Oorhodeine, Oocyan, Banded Oocyan, Yellow Ooxanthine, Rufous Ooxanthine, a
                    substance, giving narrow absorptionbands in the red, the true colour of which he
                    has not yet been able to decide, and lastly Lichenoxanthine. It would be out of
                    place here to particularize their chemical properties, and it is enough to say
                    that they are closely connected either with haemoglobin or bile-pigments, and in
                    many respects resemble the latter more than do any other group of
                    colouring-matters, but do not actually agree with them. The first is perhaps the
                    most important of all the seven, because it occurs more or less in the shells of
                    so great a number of eggs that its entire absence is exceptional, and it is of a
                    very permanent character, its general colour being of a peculiar brown-red. The
                    second and third seem when pure to be of a very fine blue, but the spectrum of
                    the former shows no detached bands, while that of the latter has a well-marked
                    detached absorbent-band near the red end, though the two are closely related
                    since they yield the same product when oxidized. The fourth and fifth substances
                    supply a bright yellow or reddish-yellow hue, and the former is particularly
                    characteristic of eggs of the Emeus <hi rend="italic">(Dromoeus),</hi> giving
                    rise when mixed with oocyan to the fine malachite-green which they possess,
                    while the latter has only been met with in those of the Tinamous <hi
                        rend="italic">(Tinamidoe),</hi> in which it should be mentioned that
                    oorhodeine has not been found, or perhaps in those of a Cassowary <hi
                        rend="italic">(Casitamus),</hi> and when mixed with oocyan produces a
                    peculiar lead-colour. The sixth substance, as before stated, has not yet been
                    sufficiently determined, but it would seem in combination with others to give
                    them an abnormally browner tint; and the seventh appears to be identical with
                    one which occurs in greater or less amount in almost all classes of plants, but
                    is more especially abundant in and characteristic of lichens and fungi. There is
                    a possibility however of this last being in part if not wholly due to the growth
                    of minute fungi, though Mr Sorby believes that some such substance really is a
                    normal constituent of the shell of eggs having a peculiar brick-red colour. That
                    gentleman is further inclined to think that oorhodeine is in some way or other
                    closely related to cruentine, being probably derived from the red
                    colouring-matter of the blood by some unknown process of secretion, and likewise
                    that there is some chemical relation between the oocyans and the bile.</p>

                    that a well-defined type of shell-structure belongs to certain families of
                    birds, and is easily recognized under the microscope. In some cases, as in the
                    eggs of certain Swans and Geese <hi rend="italic">(Cygnus olor</hi> and <hi
                        rend="italic">C. musicus, Anser cinereus</hi> and <hi rend="italic">A.

                    researches on classification generally is of considerable importance and must be
                    taken into account by all future taxonomers. Here we cannot enter into details,
                    it must suffice to remark that the grain of the shell is sometimes so fine that
                    the surface is glossy, and this is the case with a large number of <hi

                    surface of those just mentioned, and nothing like a definite line can be drawn
                    between their structure and that in which the substance is dull and uniform, as

                    those which lay the glossy eggs above spoken of—are often apparently spherical,
                    though it is probable that if tested mathematically none would be found truly
                    so—indeed it may be asserted that few eggs are strictly symmetrical, however
                    nearly they may seem so, one side bulging out, though very slightly, more than
                    the other. The really <hi rend="italic">oval</hi> form, with which we are most
                    familiar, needs no remark, but th13 is capable of infinite variety caused by the
                    relative position and proportion of the major and minor axes. In nearly all the
                        <hi rend="italic">Limicoloe</hi> and some of the <hi rend="italic"
                        >Alcidoe</hi> the egg attenuates very rapidly towards the smaller end,
                    sometimes in a slightly convex curve, sometimes without perceptible curvature,
                    and occasionally in a sensibly concave curve. The eggs having this pyriform
                    shape are mostly those of birds which invariably lay four in a nest, and therein
                    they lie with their points almost meeting in the centre and thus occupying as
                    little space as possible and more easily covered by the brooding parent. Other
                    eggs as those of the Sand-Grouse <hi rend="italic">{Ptcrocleidoe)</hi> are
                    elongated and almost cylindrical for a considerable part of their length
                    terminating at each end obtusely, while eggs of the Grebes <hi rend="italic"
                        >{Podicipedidoe)</hi> which also have both ends nearly alike but pointed,
                    are so wide in the middle as to present a biconical appearance.<note

                <p>The size of eggs is generally but not at all constantly in proportion to that of

                    Hewitson, from whom these instances are taken, remarks :—“The reason of this
                    great disparity is, however, obvious; the eggs of all those birds which quit the
                    nest soon after they are hatched, and which are consequently more fully
                    developed at their birth, are very large.”<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    covered at one time seems also to have some relation to their size, and this
                    offers a further explanation of the fact just mentioned with regard to the Snipe
                    and the Partridge —the former being one of those birds which are constant in
                    producing four, and the latter often laying as many as a dozen—for the chicks of
                    each run as soon as they release themselves from the shell.</p>
                <p>Incubation is performed, as is well known, by the female of nearly all Birds, but
                    with most of the <hi rend="italic">Passeres</hi> and many others the male seems
                    to share her tedious duties, and among the <hi rend="italic">Ratitoe,</hi>
                    apparently without exception, the cock takes that office wholly on himself.
                    There are a few groups or perhaps species in which the same practice is
                    suspected to obtain—certain of the <hi rend="italic">Limicoloe</hi> for
                    instance, the Godwits <hi rend="italic">{Limosa),</hi> the Phalaropes <hi
                        rend="italic">{Phalaroprus),</hi> and the Dotterel <hi rend="italic"
                        >{Eudromias morinellus)—</hi> and in these it is to be remarked that the hen
                    is larger and more brightly coloured than her mate. Owing to the unfortunate
                    neglect of those who have the opportunity of making the needful observations the
                    period of Incubation has been ascertained in comparatively few birds, and it is
                    here possible to deal with that subject only in the most vague and general
                    language. It may be asserted that most of the smaller <hi rend="italic"
                        >Passeres</hi> of Europe hatch their young in about thirteen days, but in a
                    few species the term is believed to be shortened to ten or eleven days, while in
                    the largest of that Order, the Raven, it is lengthened to some twenty-one days.
                    This also is the period which the Barndoor-fowl ordinarily takes, but the
                    Pheasant, though so very nearly allied, takes about twentyeight. Most
                    Water-birds, so far as is known, and the smaller Birds-of-prey seem to require
                    as long a time, but in the Swan incubation is protracted to six weeks. The
                    temperature of the air is commonly credited with having something to do either
                    in hastening or retarding exclusion from the egg, but to what extent, or even
                    whether justly so or not, seems in the absence of precise experiments to be
                    doubtful. Certain birds occasionally begin brooding as soon as the first egg is
                        laid,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>This seems to
                            be very often the case with the Owls, but if the writer’s observation is
                            not mistaken the habit is not constant even with the same individual
                            bird.</p></note> and this plan unquestionably has its advantages, since
                    the offspring being of different ages thereby become less of a burthen on the
                    parents which have to minister to their wants, while the fostering warmth of the
                    earlier chicks can hardly fail to aid the development of those which are
                    unhatched, during the absence of father and mother in search of food; but most
                    birds, and it need scarcely be said, all those the young of which run from their
                    birth, await the completion of the clutch before sitting is begun. The care
                    bestowed, by almost every species, on the infant-brood, is proverbial, and there
                    is hardly any extremity of danger which one at least of the anxious parents will
                    not incur to ward off injury from their progeny.</p>
                <p>MOULT.</p>
                <p>The more or less protracted business of reproduction being ended there forthwith
                    follows in the case of nearly all Birds a process of the most vital consequence
                    to them. This is the Moult or shedding of their old and often weather-beaten
                    feathers to be replaced by an entirely new suit. It is probably the severest
                    strain to which bird-life is exposed, and, to judge from its effects on our
                    domesticated pets, produces a greater mortality than an occasional want <pb

                    connected series of observations on Moult within the whole range of their
                    literature. The structure and mode of growth of feathers has been very well
                    studied and described by several investigators, and must be especially treated
                    in introducing the subject of Pterylography—or the disposition of the various
                    plumed patches on the bird’s body—which, having been found to be a most useful
                    auxiliary in Classification, is deferred until that comes to be discussed under
                    the article “<hi rend="smallcaps">Ornithology.”</hi> For the present we have
                    briefly to consider the different phases which the process of Moulting
                    offers.</p>
                <p>As a general rule all Birds are subject to an annual Moult, and this as above
                    stated, commonly begins immediately on the close of the breeding-season, but, as
                    will be explained further on, there arc some which undergo in addition a second
                    or even a third partial change of plumage, and it is possible that there may be
                    others still more exceptional, our information respecting these, however, is too
                    meagre to make it worth while saying anything here about them. It must be
                    acknowledged that with regard to the great majority of form3 we can only judge
                    by analogy, and though it may well be that some interesting deviations from the
                    general rule exist of which we are altogether ignorant, yet when we consider
                    that the <hi rend="italic">Ratitoe,</hi> so far as observed, moult exactly in
                    the same manner as other birds,<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                        type="authorial"><p>For the knowledge of this fact the write? is indebted to
                            the vast experience of Mr Bartlett.</p></note> the uniformity of the
                    annual change may be almost taken for granted.</p>
                <p>It is not intended here to describe the way in which a feather dies and a new one
                    succeeds it, nor need we compare the process of moulting with the analogous
                    shedding of the hair in Mammals or of the skin in Reptiles. Enough for our
                    present purpose to see that such renovation is required in Birds, which nearly
                    all have to depend upon their quills for the means of locomotion and hence of
                    livelihood. It is easy to understand that durable as are the flight-feathers,
                    they do not last for ever and are besides very subject to accidental breakage,
                    the consequence of which would be the crippling of the bird. It is obviously to
                    provide against what in most cases would be such a disaster as this last that we
                    find the <hi rend="italic">remiges,</hi> or quill-feathers of the wings, to be
                    always shed in pairs. They drop out not indeed absolutely at the same moment,
                    though this sometimes seems to happen, but within a few days of each other, and,
                    equilibrium being thus preserved, the power of flight is but slightly
                    deteriorated by their temporary loss. The same mιy be observed in a less degree,
                    since there is less need of regularity, with the rest of the plumage, as a
                    little attention to any tame bird will show, and the new feathers grow at an
                    almost equal rate. In the young of most species the original quills are not shed
                    during the first year, nor in the young of many does there seem to be an entire
                    moult during that time, but in the typical <hi rend="italic">Gallinoe,</hi>
                    which are able to fly at a very early age, often before they are one-third
                    grown, the original quills, being proportioned to the duties required of them,
                    are shed before the bird has attained its full size and are succeeded by others
                    that serve it when it has reached maturity. In the Duck-tribe <hi rend="italic"
                        >(Anatidoe),</hi> however, we have a very singular exception to what has
                    been above stated. Most of these birds shed their quillfeathers all at once, and
                    become absolutely incapable of flight for a season,<note anchored="true"

                    aquatic herbage, and it is further to be particularly remarked that the males of
                    most of two sections of the family <hi rend="italic">(Anatinoe</hi> and <hi
                        rend="italic">Fuligulinoe)</hi> at the same period lose the
                    brilliantly-coloured plumage which commonly distinguishes them and “go into
                    eclipse,” as Waterton happily said, putting on for several weeks a dingy garb
                    much resembling that of the other sex, to resume their gay attire only when,
                    their new quills being grown, it can be safely flaunted in the open air. Here we
                    have the first instances of Additional Moult to be mentioned. Another is not
                    less interesting, though ornithologists must confess with shame that they have
                    not sufficiently investigated it. This 13 that of the Ptarmigan <hi

                    then again as autumn passes away into their snowy winter-clothing, but,
                    divesting themselves of this last in spring, then put on each a third and most
                    distinctive dress—these changes, however, do not extend to the quills either of
                    the wings or tail.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"

                <p>The number of Birds which undergo a more or less entire Double Moult is very
                    considerable, and the peculiarity is not always characteristic of families or
                    even, unless in a restricted sense, of genera. Thus while the Garden-Warbler <hi
                        rend="italic">(Sylvia salicaria)</hi> is said to moult twice in the year the
                    Blackcap <hi rend="italic">(S. atricapilla)</hi> does so but once. The same may
                    be said of the <hi rend="italic">Embemzidoe,</hi> in which family both practices
                    seem to obtain, but on the other hand the distinction in this respect between
                    the Larks <hi rend="italic">(Alaudidoe)</hi> and the Pipits <hi rend="italic"
                        >(Anthinoe),</hi> belonging to the family <hi rend="italic"
                        >Motacillidoe,</hi> appears, so far as our knowledge goes, to be invariable,
                    though the habits and general appearance of both groups are so much alike— the
                        <hi rend="italic">Alaudidoe</hi> moulting but once and the <hi rend="italic"
                        >Anthinoe,</hi> conforming to the practice of the normal <hi rend="italic"
                        >Motacillidoe (Motacillinoe),</hi> twice a year—the quills, be it
                    understood, excepted. But it would be impossible here to give more than these
                    few examples, and indeed we scarcely know anything of the subject outside of
                    groups belonging to the Northern hemisphere.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                <p>In a large number of species the Additional Moult is very partial, being often
                    limited to certain portions of the plumage, and it is yet an unsolved problem
                    how far some of the changes to be observed are due to actual Moult and how far
                    to the alteration of colour in the feathers themselves, as also the way by which
                    this alteration of colour is produced, whether, as certainly happens in many
                    instances, by the dropping off of the “barbicels ’’—the fine filaments that
                    fringe the “barbicels” which are arranged on the upper surface of each “barb”
                    composing the web of the feather —or in some other manner. With either of these
                    last considerations we need not now concern ourselves. It is unquestionable that
                    there are innumerable species of birds, the males at least of which put forth in
                    spring decorative plumes unknown at any other season, and it would appear that
                    in the majority of them the feathers which before clothed the parts whence the
                    newly-donned ornaments grow are doffed to make room for these paraphernalia of
                    marriage.</p>

                    even he has far from exhausted its varied points of interest.</p>
                <p>It remains to be remarked that though the annual Moult commonly takes place so
                    soon as the breeding-season is over, there are plenty of cases where we find the
                    change delayed to a later period of the year. This is so with the Swallow <hi
                        rend="italic">{Hirundo rustica),</hi> which has long been known to moult in
                    midwinter, and it is generally the way with all the Diurnal Birds-of-prey. But
                    unquestionably most birds accomplish the change much earlier, and before they
                    leave their breeding-quarters for their winter-haunts, thereby starting on one
                    of their great annual journeys with all the external machinery of flight renewed
                    and in the best condition for escaping its attendant perils. <hi
