                    most original composer of modern France, was born in 1803 at Côte-Saint-André, a
                    small town near Grenoble, in the department of Isère. His father was a physician
                    of repute, and by his desire our composer for some time devoted himself to the
                    study of the same profession. At the same time he had music lessons, and, in
                    secret, perused numerous theoretical works on counterpoint and harmony, with
                    little profit it seems, till the hearing and subsequent careful analysis of one
                    of Haydn’s quartets opened a new vista to his unguided aspirations. A similar
                    work written by Berlioz in imitation of Haydn’s masterpiece was favourably
                    received by his friends. From Paris, where he had been sent to complete his
                    medical studies, he at last made known to his father the unalterable decision of
                    devoting himself entirely to art, the answer to which confession was the
                    withdrawal of all further pecuniary assistance. In order to .support life
                    Berlioz had to accept the humble engagement of a singer in the chorus of the
                    Gymnase theatre. Soon, however, he became reconciled to his father and entered
                    the Conservatoire, where he studied composition under Reicha and Lesueur. His
                    first important composition was an opera called <hi rend="italic">Les
                    Francs-Juges,</hi> of which, however, only the overture remains extant. In 1825
                    he left the Conservatoire, disgusted, it is said, at the dry pedantry of the
                    professors, and began a course of autodidactic education, founded chiefly on the
                    works of Beethoven, Gluck, Weber, and other German masters. About this period
                    Berlioz saw for the first time on the stage the talented Irish actress Miss
                    Smithson, who was then charming Paris by her impersonations of Ophelia, Juliet,
                    and other Shakespearean characters. The young enthusiastic composer became
                    deeply enamoured of her at first sight, and tried, for a long time in vain, to
                    gain the responsive love or even the attention of his idol. To an incident of
                    this wild and persevering courtship Berlioz’s first symphonic work, <hi
                    rend="italic">Episode de la Vie d'un Artiste,</hi> owes its origin. It describes
                    the dreams of an artist who, under the influence of opium, imagines that he has
                    killed his mistress, and in his vision witnesses his own execution. It is
                    replete with the spirit of contemporary French romanticism and of
                    self-destructive Byronic despair. A written programme is added to each of the
                    five movements to expound the imaginative material on which the music is
                    founded. By the advice of his friends Berlioz once more entered the
                    Conservatoire, where, after several unsuccessful attempts, his cantata <hi
                    rend="italic">Sardanapalus</hi> (1830) gained him the first prize for foreign
                    travel, in spite of the strong personal antagonism of one of the umpires. During
                    a stay in Italy Berlioz composed an overture to <hi rend="italic">King
                    Lear,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Le Retour à la Vie,—</hi> a sort of symphony,
                    with intervening poetical declamation between the single movements, called by
                    the composer a melologue, and written in continuation of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Episode de la Vie d</hi> ’ <hi rend="italic">un Artiste,</hi> along with which
                    work it was performed at the Paris Conservatoire in 1832. Paganini on that
                    occasion spoke to Berlioz the memorable words: “Vous commencez par où. les
                    autres ont fini.” Miss Smithson, who also was present on the occasion, soon
                    afterwards consented to become the wife of her ardent lover. The artistic
                    success achieved on that occasion did not prove to be of a lasting kind.
                    Berlioz’s music was too far remote from the current of popular taste to be much
                    admired beyond a small circle of esoteric worshippers. It is true that his name
                    became known as that of a gifted though eccentric composer; he also received in
                    the course of time his due share of the distinctions generally awarded to
                    artistic merit, such as the ribbon of tbe Legion of Honour and the membership of
                    the Institute. But these distinctions he owed, perhaps, less to a genuine
                    admiration of his compositions than to his influential position as the musical
                    critic of the <hi rend="italic">Journal</hi><hi rend="italic">des Débats</hi> (a
                    position which he never used or abused to push his own works), and to his
                    successes abroad. In 1842 Berlioz went for the first time to Germany, where he
                    was hailed with welcome by the leading musicians of the younger generation,
                    P⅛obert Schumann foremost amongst them. The latter paved the way for the French
                    composer’s success, by a comprehensive analysis of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Episode</hi> in his musical journal, the <hi rend="italic">Neue Zeitschrift für
                    Musik.</hi> Berlioz gave successful concerts at Leipsic and other German cities,
                    and repeated his visit on various later occasions—in 1852, by invitation of
                    Liszt, to conduct his opera, <hi rend="italic">Benvenuto Cellini</hi> (hissed
                    off the stage in Paris), at Weimar; and in 1855 to produce his oratorio-trilogy,
                    <hi rend="italic">L'</hi><hi rend="italic">Enfance</hi><hi rend="italic">du
                    Christ,</hi> in the same city. This latter work had been previously performed at
                    Paris, where Berlioz mystified the critics by pretending to have found one part
                    of it, the “Flight into Egypt,” amongst the manuscript scores of a composer of
                    the 17th century, Pierre Ducré by name. Berlioz also made journeys to Vienna
                    (1866) and St Petersburg (1867), where his works were received with great
                    enthusiasm. He died in Paris, March 9, 1869.</p>
                <p>Berlioz has juetly been described as the French representative of musical <hi
                    rend="italic">Romanticism,</hi> and his works are in this respect closely
                    connected with the contemporary movement in literature known by that name. The
                    affinity between him and Victor Hugo, for instance, is undeniable, and must be
                    looked for deeper than in the fantastic eccentricities and breaches of the
                    established form common <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0903-0616-0599"/> to both. 1IÎ3 ready acknowledgment of congenial
                    aspirations in foreign countries, so adverse to French natural prejudice, may be
                    cited as another essentially “romantic” feature in Berlioz’s character. In his
                    case, however, the predilection for English literature, as shown in the choice
                    of several of his most important subjects from Shakespeare, Byron, and Walter
                    Scott, may be to some extent explained from his connection with Miss Smithson, a
                    striking instance of the relation between life and art in a man of high creative
                    faculty.</p>
                <p>The second powerful element in Berlioz’s compositions is the influence of
                    Beethoven’s gigantic works. The grand forms of the German master’s symphonies
                    impressed him with competitive zeal, and what has been described as the
                    “poetical idea” in Beethoven’s creations soon began to run riot in the
                    enthusiastic mind of the young medical student. But, in accordance with the
                    aversion of his national character to indistinct ideal notions, he tried to
                    condense the poetical essence of his inspiration in the tangible shape of a
                    story, and in this manner became the father of what is generally called
                    “programme-music.’ Whether the author of such works as <hi rend="italic"
                    >Harold</hi><hi rend="italic">en Italie,</hi> or the <hi rend="italic">Episode
                    de la Vie d'un Artiste,</hi> may lay claim to the prophet’s cloak is difficult
                    to decide; he must at any rate be accepted as a man strong in his own
                    convictions, “a swallower of formulas,” and faithful ally in the great cause of
                    nature <hi rend="italic">versus</hi> traditional artificiality, of Shakespeare
                    against pseudo-classicism. Under such circumstances we can hardly be surprised
                    at seeing Berlioz appreciated sooner and more lastingly in Germany than in his
                    own country. Schumann and Liszt were, as we have mentioned, at various periods
                    amongst the foremost promoters of his music. We subjoin a list of the more
                    important works by</p>
                <p>Berlioz not mentioned above, viz., the symphonies <hi rend="italic">Roméo
                    et</hi><hi rend="italic">Juliette</hi> (1834), and <hi rend="italic">Damnation
                    de Faust</hi> (1846); the operas <hi rend="italic">Béatrice et Bénéôtict</hi>
                    (1862), and <hi rend="italic">Les</hi><hi rend="italic">Troyens</hi> (1866); a
                    Requiem, and <hi rend="italic">Tristia,</hi> a work for chorus and orchestra,
                    written on the death of his wife. Of his spirited literary productions we
                    mention his <hi rend="italic">Voyage musical</hi><hi rend="italic">en Allemagne
                    et en Itadie</hi> (1845), <hi rend="italic">Les Soirées d'Orchestre</hi> (1853),
                    <hi rend="italic">A travers Chant</hi> (1862), and his incomparable <hi
                    rend="italic">Traité d’instrumentation</hi> (1844). The characteristics of
                    Berlioz’s literary style are French <hi rend="italic">verve</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">esprit,</hi> occasionally combined with English humour and German
                    depth of idea. The time has hardly yet arrived for judging finally of Berlioz’s
                    position in the history of his art. His original ideas, his poetical intentions,
                    nobody can deny; the question is whether he possesses genuine creative power to
                    carry out these intentions, and, first of all, that broad touch of nature which
                    leads from subjective feeling to objective rendering, and which alone can
                    establish a lasting <hi rend="italic">rapport</hi> between a great artist and
                    posterity. To decide this question the performances of his works have as yet,
                    unfortunately, been too few and far between. In England, particularly, only a
                    very small fraction of his compositions has been heard. (F. H.)</p>
