                    the West Riding of Yorkshire. His grandfather had suffered in person and estate
                    in the royal cause, and the family were in consequence in reduced circumstances.
                    Bentley’s mother, the daughter of a stonemason in Oulton, was a woman of
                    excellent understanding and some education, as she was able to give her son his
                    first lessons in Latin. From the grammar school of Wakefield Richard Bentley
                    passed to St John’s College, Cambridge, being admitted subsizar in 1676. He
                    afterwards obtained a scholarship, but never succeeded to a fellowship, being
                    appointed by his college, before he was twenty-one, headmaster of Spalding
                    grammar school. In this post he did not remain long, being selected by Dr
                    Stillingfleet, Dean of St Paul’s, to be domestic tutor to his son. This
                    appointment introduced Bentley at once to the society of the most eminent men of
                    the day, threw open to him the best private library in England, and brought him
                    into familiar intercourse with Dean Stillingfleet, a man of sound understanding,
                    who had not shrunk from exploring some of the more solid and abstruse parts of
                    ancient learning. The example of such a patron seconding his natural
                    inclinations drew Bentley into a course of thorough reading, which, however,
                    took a philological rather than a philosophical direction. The six years which
                    he passed in Stillingfleet⅛ family were employed, with the restless energy
                    characteristic of the man, in exhausting the remains of the Greek and Latin
                    writers, and laying up those stores of knowledge upon which he afterwards drew
                    for his various occasions.</p>
                <p>In 1689 Stillingfleet became bishop of Worcester, and Bentley’s pupil went to
                    reside at Oxford in Wadham College, accompanied by his tutor. Bentley’s
                    introductions, and his own merits, placed him at once on a footing of intimacy
                    with the most distinguished scholars in the university—Mill, Hody, Edward
                    Bernard. Here he revelled in the MS. treasures of the Bodleian, Corpus, and
                    other college libraries. He projected, and occupied himself with collections
                    for, vast literary schemes. Among these are specially mentioned a <hi
                    rend="italic">corpus of</hi> the fragments of the Greek poets, and an edition of
                    the Greek lexicographers. But his first publication was in connection with a
                    -writer of much inferior note. The Oxford press was about bringing out an
                    edition (the <hi rend="italic">editio princeps)</hi> of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Chronicle of John Malalas,</hi> from the unique MS. in the Bodleian; and the
                    editor, Dr Mill, had requested Bentley to look through the sheets, and make any
                    remarks on the text. This originated Bentley’s <hi rend="italic"
                    >Epistola</hi><hi rend="italic">ad</hi><hi rend="italic">Millium,</hi> which
                    occupies less than one hundred pages at the end of the Oxford <hi rend="italic"
                    >Malμlas</hi><hi rend="italic">(e Theatro</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Sheldoniano,</hi> 1691, 8vo). This short tractate at once placed Bentley at the
                    head of all living English scholars. The ease with which, by a stroke of the
                    pen, he restores passages which had been left in hopeless corruption by the
                    editors of the <hi rend="italic">Chronicle,</hi> the certainty of the
                    emendation, and the command over the relevant material, are in a style totally
                    different from the careful and laborious learning of Hody, Mill, or Chilmead. To
                    the small circle of classical students it was at once apparent that there had
                    arisen in England a critic, whose attainments were not to be measured by the
                    ordinary academical standard, but whom these few pages had sufficed to place by
                    the side of the great Grecians of a former age. Unfortunately this mastery over
                    critical science was accompanied by a tone of self-assertion and presumptuous
                    confidence, which not only checked admiration, but was calculated to rouse
                    enmity. Dr Monk, indeed, Bentley’s biographer, has charged him with an indecorum
                    of which he was not guilty. “In one place,” writes Dr Monk, “he accosts Dr Mill
                    as ω Ιαmδiov, an indecorum which neither the familiarity of friendship, nor the
                    licence of a dead language, can justify towards the dignified head of a house.”
                    But the object of Bentley’s apostrophe is not his correspondent Dr Mill, but his
                    author John Malalas, whom in another place he playfully appeals to as "Syrisce.”
                    From this publication, however, dates the origin of those mixed feelings of
                    admiration and repugnance which Bentley through his whole career continued to
                    excite among his contemporaries.</p>
                <p>In 1690 Bentley had taken deacon’s orders in the Established Church. In 1692 he
                    was nominated first Boyle lecturer, a nomination which was repeated in 1694. He
                    was offered the appointment a third time in 1695, but declined it, being by that
                    time involved in too many other undertakings. In these first series of lectures
                    he endeavours to present the Newtonian physics in a popular form, and to frame
                    them into a proof of the existence of an intelligent Creator. The second series,
                    preached in 1694, has not been published, and is believed to be lost. Scarcely
                    was Bentley in priest’s orders before he was preferred to a prebendal stall in
                    Worcester cathedral. And, in 1693, the keepership of the royal library becoming
                    vacant by the death of Henri de Justel, great efforts were made by his friends
                    to obtain the place for Bentley. But, though there was a High Church candidate
                    (Edmund Gibson) backed by the archbishops, the court interest prevailed, and the
                    place was given to Mr Thynne. Mr Thynne, however, wanted only the salary and not
                    the office, and was prevailed on to cede the place to Bentley for an annuity of
                    £130 for life, the whole emoluments being but £200 and apartments in St James’s
                    Palace. To these preferments were added, in 1695, a royal chaplaincy, and the
                    living of Hartlebury. He was also about the same time elected a fellow of the
                    Royal Society. And the recognition of Continental scholars came in the shape of
                    a dedication, by Graevius (John George), prefixed to a dissertation of Albert
                    Rubens, <hi rend="italic">Be vita Th.</hi><hi rend="italic">Mallii,</hi>
                    published at Utrecht in 1694.</p>
                <p>While these distinctions were being accumulated upon Bentley, his energy was
                    making itself felt in many and various directions. His first care was the royal
                    library, the queen’s library, as it was commonly called. He made great efforts
                    to retrieve this collection from the dilapidated condition into which it had
                    been allowed to fall. He employed the mediation of the earl of Marlborough to
                    beg the grant of some additional rooms in the palace for the books. The rooms
                    were granted, but Marlborough characteristically kept them for himself. Bentley
                    enforced the law against the publishers, and thus added to the library nearly
                    1000 volumes which had been neglected to be delivered. He was commissioned by
                    the University of Cambridge to obtain Greek and Latin founts for their classical
                    books, and he had accordingly cast, in Holland, those beautiful types which
                    appear in the Cambridge books of that date. He assisted Evelyn in his <hi
                    rend="italic">Numismata.</hi> All Bentley’s literary appearances at this time
                    were of this accidental character. We do not find him settling down to the
                    steady execution of any of the great projects with which he had started. He
                    designed, indeed, in 1694, an edition of Philostratus, but easily abandoned it
                    to Olearius, " to the joy,” says F. A. Wolf, "of Olearius and of no one else.”
                    He supplied Graevius with collations of Cicero, and Joshua Barnes with a warning
                    as to the spuriousness of the <hi rend="italic">Epistles of Euripides,</hi>
                    which was thrown away upon that blunderer, who printed the epistles and declared
                    that no one could doubt their genuineness but a man " perfriet»</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit03newyrich/page/n596/mode/1up"

                <p>frontis aut judicii imminuti.” Bentley supplied to Graevius’s <hi rend="italic"
                    >Callimachus</hi> a masterly collection of the fragments.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Dissertation on the Epistles of</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Phalaris,</hi> the work on which Bentley’s fame in great part rests, originated
                    in the same casual way. Wotton being about to bring out a second edition of his
                    book on <hi rend="italic">Ancient and Modern Learning,</hi> claimed of Bentley
                    the fulfilment of an old promise to write a paper exposing the spuriousness of
                    <hi rend="italic">the Epistles of</hi><hi rend="italic">Phalaris.</hi> This
                    paper was resented as an insult by the Christchurch editor of Phalaris, Hon.
                    Charles Boyle, afterwards earl of Orrery. Assisted by his college friends, Boyle
                    wrote a reply, “a tissue,” says Mr Dyce, “of superficial learning, ingenious
                    sophistry, dexterous malice, and happy raillery.” The reply was hailed by the
                    public as crushing, and went immediately into a second edition. It was incumbent
                    on Bentley to rejoin. This he did, in what Porson styles “that immortal
                    dissertation,” to which no answer was, or could be, given.</p>
                <p>In the year 1700, Bentley, then in his 38th year, received that main preferment
                    which, says De Quincey, “was at once his reward and his scourge for the rest of
                    his life.” The six commissioners of ecclesiastical patronage unanimously
                    recommended Bentley to the Crown for the headship of Trinity College.</p>
                <p>Trinity College, the most splendid foundation in the University of Cambridge, and
                    in the scientific and literary reputation of its fellows the most eminent
                    society in either university, had, in 1700, greatly fallen from its high estate.
                    It was not that it was more degraded than the other colleges, but its former
                    lustre made the abuse of endowments in its case more conspicuous. The eclipse
                    had taken place during the reaction which followed 1660, and was owing to causes
                    which were not peculiar to Trinity, but which influenced the nation at large.
                    The names of Pearson and Barrow, and, greater than either, that of Newton, adorn
                    the college annals of this period. But these were quite exceptional men. They
                    had not inspired the rank and file of fellows of Trinity with any of their own
                    love for learning or science. Indolent and easy-going clerics, without duties,
                    without a pursuit, or any consciousness of the obligation of endowments, they
                    haunted the college for the pleasant life and the good things they found there,
                    creating sinecure offices in each other’s favour, jobbing the scholarships, and
                    making the audits mutually pleasant. Any excuse served for a banquet at the cost
                    of “the house,” and the celibate imposed by the statutes was made as tolerable
                    as the decorum of a respectable position permitted. To such a society Bentley
                    came, obnoxious as a Johniau and an intruder, unwelcome as a man of learning,
                    whose interests lay outside the walls of the college. Bentley replied to their
                    concealed dislike with open contempt, and proceeded to ride roughshod over their
                    little arrangements. He inaugurated many beneficial reforms in college usages
                    and discipline, executed extensive improvements in the buildings, and generally
                    used his eminent station for the promotion of the interests of learning, both in
                    the college and in the university. But this noble energy was attended by a
                    domineering temper, an overweening contempt for the feelings, and even for the
                    rights, of others, and an unscrupulous use of means when a good end could be
                    obtained. Bentley, at the summit of classical learning, disdained to associate
                    with men whom he regarded as illiterate priests. He treated them with contumely,
                    while he was diverting their income to public purposes. The continued drain upon
                    their purses—on one occasion the whole dividend of the year was absorbed by the
                    rebuilding of the chapel—was the grievance which at last roused the fellows to
                    make a resolute stand. After ten years of stubborn, but ineffectual resistance
                    within the college, they had recourse, in 1710, to the last remedy—an appeal to
                    the visitor. Their petition is an ill-drawn invective, full of general
                    complaints, and not alleging any special delinquency. Bentley’s reply <hi
                    rend="italic">{The Present State of Trinity College,</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >àc.,</hi> 8vo, Lond. 1710) is in his most crushing style. The fellows amended
                    their position, and put in a fresh charge, in which they articled fifty-four
                    separate breaches of the statutes as having been committed by the master.
                    Bentley, called upon to answer, demurred to the bishop of Ely’s jurisdiction,
                    alleging that the Crown was visitor. He backed his application by a dedication
                    of his Horace to the lord treasurer (Harley). The Crown lawyers decided the
                    point against him; the case was heard, and a sentence of ejection from the
                    mastership ordered to be drawn up, but before it was executed the bishop of Ely
                    died, and the process lapsed.</p>
                <p>This process, though it had lasted nearly five years, was only a prologue to the
                    great feud, the whole duration of which was twenty-nine years. Space will not
                    allow of its vicissitudes being here followed. It must suffice to say that
                    Bentley was sentenced by the bishop of Ely (Greene) to be ejected from the
                    mastership, and by Convocation to be stripped of his degrees, and that he foiled
                    both the visitor and the university.</p>
                <p>Bentley survived the extinction of this thirty years’ war, two years. Surrounded
                    by his grandchildren, he experienced the joint pressure of age and infirmity as
                    lightly as is consistent with the lot of humanity. He continued to amuse himself
                    with reading; and though nearly confined, to his arm-chair, was able to enjoy
                    the society of his friends, and several rising scholars, Maitland, John Taylor,
                    his nephews Bichard and Thomas Bentley, with whom he discussed classical
                    subjects. He was accustomed to say that he should live to be 80, adding that a
                    life of that duration was long enough to read everything worth reading. He
                    fulfilled his own prediction, dying, of a pleurisy, 14th July 1742, when he was
                    a few months over 80. Though accused by his enemies of being grasping, he left
                    not more than £5000 behind him. A few Greek MSB., brought from Mount Athos, he
                    left to the college library; his books and papers to his nephew, Richard
                    Bentley. Richard, who was a fellow of Trinity, at his death in 1786, left the
                    papers to the college library. The books were acquired, by purchase, by the
                    British Museum.</p>
                <p>Of his personal habits some anecdotes are related by his grandson, Richard
                    Cumberland, in vol. i. of his <hi rend="italic">Memoirs</hi> (Lond. 1807). The
                    hat of formidable dimensions, which he always wore during reading to shade his
                    eyes, and his preference of port to claret, are traits embodied in Pope’s
                    caricature <hi rend="italic">{Dunciad,</hi> b. 4), which bears in other respects
                    little resemblance to the original. He did not take up the habit of smoking till
                    he was 70. He held the archdeaconry of Ely with two livings, but never obtained
                    higher preference in the church. He was offered the (then poor) bishopric of
                    Bristol, but refused it, and being asked what preferment he would consider worth
                    his acceptance, replied, “That which would leave him no reason to wish for a
                    removal.”</p>
                <p>Dr Bentley married, in 1701, Joanna, daughter of Sir John Bernard of Brompton.
                    Their union lasted forty years. Mrs Bentley died in 1740, leaving a son,
                    Richard, and two daughters, one of whom married, in 1728, Mr Denison Cumberland,
                    grandson of Richard Cumberland, bishop of Peterborough, and father of Richard
                    Cumberland the dramatic author.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Life of Richard Bentley,</hi> by Bishop Monk (4to, Lond.
                    1830; 2d ed., 2 vols. 8vo, 1833), gives in full detail an interesting account of
                    the Trinity College feud, and the other incidents of his hero’s life. But,
                    though himself a Greek scholar of celebrity and an editor of Euripides, Dr Monk
                    appears to have had but an imperfect compre<pb break="no"

                    acquirements of the subject of his biography. He regrets that Bentley wasted his
                    time upon conjectural criticism, instead of applying himself to the deistical
                    controversy. The <hi rend="italic">Remarks upon a late Discourse of
                    Freethinking,</hi> by Phileleutherus Lipsiensis, 8vo, 1713, to which Dr Monk
                    alludes, is indeed a very characteristic piece of writing; but it gives no more
                    idea of what Bentley was as a master of ancient learning than does his pamphlet,
                    <hi rend="italic">The Present State of Trinity College,</hi> quoted before.
                    Indeed, of all Bentley’s publications there is not one which can be taken as an
                    adequate sample of the critic, as a work at once monumental and characteristic.
                    Bentley is most imperfectly represented by any one of his books. They have all
                    the same occasional stamp. This is the case not only with the most popular of
                    these, the <hi rend="italic">Dissertation on</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Phalaris.</hi> The <hi rend="italic">Horatius</hi> of 1712 was brought out to
                    propitiate public opinion at a critical period of the struggle with the fellows
                    of Trinity; the proposals for a recension of the New Testament text, 1720, had a
                    similar origin; the <hi rend="italic">Terentius</hi> of 1725 was occasioned by
                    his resentment of Hare’s conduct. The <hi rend="italic">Milton</hi> was
                    undertaken at the request of Queen Caroline, but also at an anxious conjuncture
                    of the great quarrel. Nearly all his lesser performances were called forth by
                    friends invoking his aid for their own schemes. What he wrote, he wrote with
                    rapidity, rather with precipitation. If we try to form our idea of the man, not
                    from this or that extempore effusion, but from all that he did or was, we shall
                    find that Bentley was the first, perhaps the only Englishman who can be ranked
                    with the great heroes of classical learning. Before him we have only Selden to
                    name, or, in a more restricted field, Gataker and Pearson. But Selden, with
                    stupendous learning, wanted that which Bentley shared with Scaliger or Wolf, the
                    freshness of original genius and confident mastery over the whole region of his
                    knowledge. “Bentley is not,” says Mähly, “one among the great classical
                    scholars, but he inaugurates a new era of the art of criticism. He opened a new
                    path. With him criticism attained its majority. When scholars had hitherto
                    offered suggestions and conjectures, Bentley, with unlimited control over the
                    whole material of learning, gave decisions.” The modern German school of
                    philology, usually so unjust to foreigners, yet does ungrudging homage to the
                    genius of this one Englishman. Bentley, says Bunsen, “was the founder of
                    historical philology.” And Bernays says of his corrections of the <hi
                    rend="italic">Tristia,</hi> “corruptions which had hitherto defied every attempt
                    even of the mightiest, were removed by a touch of the fingers of this British
                    Samson.” The English school of Hellenists, by which the 18th century was
                    distinguished, and which contains the names of Dawes, Markland, Taylor, Toup,
                    Tyrwhitt, Porson, Dobree, Kidd, and Monk, was the creation of Bentley. And even
                    the Dutch school of the same period, though the outcome of a native tradition,
                    was in no small degree stimulated and directed by Bentley’s example. Ruhnken has
                    recorded the powerful effect produced upon the young Hemsterhuys by Bentley’s
                    letter to him on the occasion of his <hi rend="italic">Pollux;</hi> at first
                    humiliated to despair by the revelation to him of his own ignorance; then
                    stimulated to higher effort by the consideration that commendation from such a
                    man was not words of mere compliment.</p>
                <p>Bentley was a source of inspiration to a following generation of scholars.
                    Himself, he sprang from the earth without forerunners, without antecedents.
                    Self-taught, he created his own science. It was his misfortune that there was no
                    contemporary guild of learning in England by which his power could be measured,
                    and his eccentricities checked. In the <hi rend="italic">Phalaris</hi>
                    controversy his academical adversaries had not sufficient knowledge to know how
                    absolute their defeat was. Garth’s couplet—</p>
                <p>“So diamonds take a lustre from their foil, And to a Bentley <hi
                    rend="superscript"> ,</hi> tis we owe a Boyle ”— expressed the belief of the
                    wits, or literary world, of the time. It was not only that he had to live with
                    inferiors, and to waste his energy in a struggle forced upon him by the
                    necessities of his official position, but the wholesome stimulus of competition
                    and the encouragement of a sympathetic circle were wanting. In a university
                    where the instruction of youth, or the religious controversy of the day, were
                    the only known occupations, Bentley was an isolated phenomenon, and we can
                    hardly wonder that he should have flagged in his literary exertions after his
                    appointment to the mastership of Trinity. All his vast acquisitions and all his
                    original views seem to have been obtained before 1700. After this period he
                    acquired little, and made only spasmodic efforts—the <hi rend="italic"

                    which alone a great work can be born, were wanting to him.</p>
