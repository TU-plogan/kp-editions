                    poet, was born about 1490 at Lamporecchio, in Bibbiena, a district lying along
                    the Upper Arno. His family was of good descent, but excessively poor. At an
                    early age he was sent to Florence, where he remained till his 19th year. He then
                    set out for Rome, trusting to obtain some assistance from his uncle, the
                    Cardinal Bibbiena. The cardinal, however, did nothing for him, and he was
                    obliged to accept a situation as clerk or secretary to Ghiberti, datary to
                    Clement VII. The duties of his office, for which Berni was in every way unfit,
                    were exceedingly irksome to the poet, who, however, made himself celebrated at
                    Rome as the most witty and inventive of a certain club of literary men, who
                    devoted themselves to light and sparkling effusions. So strong was the
                    admiration for Berni’s verses, that mocking or burlesque poems have since been
                    called <hi rend="italic">poesie bemesca.</hi> About the year 1530 he was
                    relieved from his servitude by obtaining a canonry in the cathedral of Florence.
                    In that city he died in 1536, according to tradition poisoned by Duke Alessandro
                    de’ Medici, for having refused to poison the duke’s cousin, Ippolito de’ Medici;
                    but considerable obscurity rests over this story. Berni stands at the head of
                    Italian comic or burlesque poets, For lightness, sparkling wit, variety of form,
                    and fluent diction, Ills verses are unsurpassed. Perhaps, however, he owes his
                    greatest fame to the recasting <hi rend="italic">{Bifacimento')</hi> of
                    Boiardo’s <hi rend="italic">Orlando Innamo∙ rato.</hi> The enormous success of
                    Ariosto’s <hi rend="italic">Orlando</hi><hi rend="italic">Furioso</hi> had
                    directed fresh attention to the older poem, from which it took its characters,
                    and of which it is the continuation. But Boiardo’s work, though good in plan,
                    could never have achieved wide popularity on account of the extreme ruggedness
                    of its style. Berni undertook the revision of the whole poem, avowedly altering
                    no sentiment, removing or adding no incident, but simply giving to each line and
                    stanza due gracefulness and polish. His task he completed with marvellous
                    success; scarcely a line remains as it was, and the general opinion has
                    pronounced decisively in favour of the revision over the original. To each canto
                    he prefixed a few stanzas of reflective verse in the manner of Ariosto, and in
                    one of these introductions he gives us the only certain information we have
                    concerning his own life. It should be noticed that Berni appears to have been
                    favourably disposed towards the Reformation principles at that time introduced
                    into Italy, and this may explain the bitterness of some remarks of his upon the
                    church. The first edition of the <hi rend="italic">Rifacimento</hi> was printed
                    posthumously in 1541, and it has been supposed that a few passages either did
                    not receive the author’s final revision, or have been retouched by another hand.
                    The <hi rend="italic">Opere</hi><hi rend="italic">Burlesche</hi> have been
                    published separately. A partial translation of Berni’s <hi rend="italic"
                    >Orlando</hi> was published by W. S. Rose, 1823. (See for full information
