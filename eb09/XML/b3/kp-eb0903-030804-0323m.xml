                    Archbishop of Canterbury in the reign of James I., distinguished as an
                    inflexible opponent of Puritanism, was born at Farnworth in Lancashire in 1544.
                    He was educated at Cambridge University, studying first at Christ’s College, and
                    afterwards at Jesus College. He took his degree of B.A. in 1567, and that of
                    M.A. in 1570. Ordained about that time, he was named chaplain to Dr Cox, then
                    bishop of Ely, and in 1575 was presented to the rectory of Teversham in
                    Cambridgeshire. The next year he was one of the preachers to the university, and
                    in 1584 was presented to the rectory of St Andrew’s, Holborn. His unquestionable
                    abilities, and his zeal as a champion of the church in those unsettled times,
                    secured him rapid promotion, and at length the highest ecclesiastical position
                    in the land. He graduated B.D. in 1580, and D.D. five years later. In 1585 he
                    was appointed treasurer of St Paul’s Cathedral, London. On February 9, 1589, he
                    preached at Paul’s Cross a sermon on 1 John iv. 1, the substance of which was a
                    passionate attack on the Puritans. He described their speeches and proceedings,
                    caricatured their motives, denounced the exercise of the right of private
                    judgment, and set forth the divine right of bishops in such strong language that
                    one of the queen’s councillors held it to amount to a threat against the
                    supremacy of the Crown. Sixteen days after the publication of this
                    ecclesiastical manifesto, Bancroft was made a prebendary of St Paul’s. Within a
                    few years he was advanced to the same dignity in the collegiate church of
                    Westminster, and in the cathedral church of Canterbury. He was chaplain
                    successively to Lord Chancellor Hatton and Archbishop Whitgift. In May 1597 he
                    was consecrated bishop of London; and from this time, in consequence of the age
                    and incapacity for business of Archbishop Whitgift, he was virtually invested
                    with the power of primate, and had the sole management of <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0903-0324-0309"/> ecclesiastical affairs. Among the more noteworthy
                    cases which fell under his direction were the proceedings against Martin
                    Mar-Prelate, Cartwright and his friends, and the pious Penry, whose “seditious
                    writings” he caused to be intercepted and given upto the Lord Keeper. In 1600 he
                    was sent on an embassy, with others, to Embden, for the purpose of settling
                    certain matters in dispute between the English and the Danes. This mission,
                    however, failed. Bishop Bancroft was present· at the death of Queen Elizabeth.
                    He took a prominent part in the famous conference of the prelates and the
                    Presbyterian divines held at Hampton Court in 1604. By the king’s desire he
                    undertook the vindication of the practices of confirmation, absolution, private
                    baptism, and lay excommunication; he urged, but in vain, the re-inforcement of
                    an ancient canon, “that schismatics are not to be heard against bishops;” and in
                    opposition to the Puritans’ demand of certain alterations in doctrine and
                    discipline, he besought the king that care might be taken for a <hi
                    rend="italic">praying clergy;</hi> and that, till men of learning and
                    sufficiency could be found, godly homilies might be read and their number
                    increased. In the capacity of a commissioner for ecclesiastical causes (1603),
                    he advocated severe measures for the suppression of “heresy and schism,”
                    treating books against Episcopacy as acts of sedition, and persecuting their
                    authors as enemies of the state. In March 1604, Bancroft, in consequence of the
                    death of the primate, was appointed by royal writ president of Convocation then
                    assembled; and he there presented for adoption a book of canons collected by
                    himself. In the following November he was elected successor to Whit gift in the
                    see of Canterbury. He had now but six years of life before him. He continued to
                    show the same zeal and βeverity as before, and with so much success that Lord
                    Clarendon, writing in his praise, expressed the opinion that “if Bancroft had
                    lived, he would quickly have extinguished all that fire in England which had
                    been kindled at Geneva.” In 1605 he was sworn a member of the Privy Council. The
                    same year he engaged in a contest with the judges, and exhibited articles of
                    complaint against them before the lords of the council; but these complaints
                    were overruled. He enforced discipline and exact conformity within the church
                    with an iron hand; and forty-nine ministers of the church were deprived of their
                    livings for disobedience to hi3 injunctions. In 1608 he was chosen chancellor of
                    the University of Oxford. One of his latest public acts was a proposal laid
                    before the parliament for improving the revenues of the church. In the last few
                    months of his life he took part in the discussion about the consecration of
                    certain Scottish bishops, and it was in pursuance of his advice that they were
                    consecrated by several bishops of the English Church. By this act were laid the
                    foundations of the Scottish Episcopal Church. Archbishop Bancroft was “the chief
                    overseer” of the authorised version of the Bible, published within a year of his
                    death. He died at Lambeth Palace, November 2,1610. His literary remains are very
                    few and unimportant.</p>
