                    game in which the players are liable to be sent back. Other derivations are,

                <p>Two <hi rend="italic">dice boxes</hi> are required, one for each player, and a
                    pair of dice, which are used by both players. The dice are marked with numbers
                    on each face from one to six, number one being called <hi rend="italic"
                    >ace;</hi> two, <hi rend="italic">deuce;</hi> three, <hi rend="italic"

                    (size).</p>
                <p>The board being arranged, each player throws one die; the one who throws the
                    higher number has the right of playing first; and he may either adopt the throw
                    originally made by the two players, each throwing one die; or he may throw
                    again, using both dice.</p>
                <p>Each player moves his own men from point to point, the moves being determined by
                    throws of the dice made by the players alternately. A player may move any of his
                    men a number of points corresponding to the numbers thrown by him, provided the
                    board is not <hi rend="italic">blocked</hi> by two or more of his adversary’s
                    men occupying the point to which he wishes to move. Thus, suppose white throws
                    cinque, six, he may move one of his men from the left-hand corner of the black’s
                    inner table to the left-hand corner of black’s outer table for six; he may,
                    again, move the same man five points further on, viz., to the right-hand point
                    of the same table for five, when his move is completed; or he may leave the man
                    first moved six, and move any other man five points, where the board is open.
                    But white cannot move a man for five, from the ace point in black’s inner table,
                    because the six point in that table <hi rend="italic">(i.e.,</hi> the fifth
                    point from where white moves) is blocked by the black men. Any part of the throw
                    which cannot be moved is of no effect; but it is compulsory for a player to move
                    the whole throw if he can. Thus, if the men were differently placed, and white
                    could move a six, and having <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit03newyrich/page/n213/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0903-0213-0198"/> done so could not move a five, his move is
                    completed. If, however, by moving the five first, he can afterwards move a six,
                    he may be required to make the move in that manner. All white’s moves must be in
                    the direction indicated, viz., from black’s inner table to black’s outer, and
                    from this to white’s outer table, and so on to white’s inner table; and all
                    black’s moves must be in the contrary direction. Of course, where men are
                    originally placed part of the way home, they only have to traverse the remainder
                    of the distance.</p>
                <p>A player in moving must not skip a point which is blocked by his adversary’s men.
                    Thus, suppose white’s first throw is fives, he cannot move a man from the ace
                    point of black’s inner table to the cinque point of black’s outer, although that
                    is free; because in moving the first cinque he comes to a point which is
                    occupied by black.</p>
                <p>When two similar numbers are thrown (called <hi rend="italic">doublets),</hi> the
                    player has a double move. Thus, if he throws aces he has to move four aces
                    instead of two, and so on for the other numbers.</p>
                <p>When a player moves his men so as to occupy a point with two men, it is called
                    <hi rend="italic">making a point.</hi> Thus, if ace, trois are thrown and white
                    moves one man from the three in his outer table to the cinque point in his inner
                    table, for trois, and then moves a man from the six point to the cinque point of
                    his inner table, for ace, he makes a point there.</p>
                <p>If a player leaves only a single man on a point, or places a single man on an
                    unoccupied point, it is called <hi rend="italic">leaving a blot.</hi> Thus, if
                    the first throw is six, cinque, and white carries a man from black’s inner table
                    as far as he will go, white leaves a blot on the ace point of his opponent’s
                    home table.</p>
                <p>When a blot is left the man may be taken up, or the blot may be <hi rend="italic"
                    >hit,</hi> if, while it remains, the adversary throws a number which will enable
                    him to place a man on that point. For example, if a blot is left on black’s ace
                    point, as in the case previously supposed, and black throwe a five, or numbers
                    that make up five, he can hit the blot from his six point; or similarly, if he
                    throws seven, or numbers that make up seven, he can hit the blot from the three
                    men posted in his outer table. The man hit is placed on the bar, and has to <hi
                    rend="italic">enter</hi> black’s inner table again at white’s next throw.</p>
                <p>It will be observed that black in taking up white leaves a blot himself, which
                    subjects him to be taken up if white enters with an ace. If this should occur,
                    black’s man is placed on the bar, and hμs at his next throw to enter white’s
                    inner table, whence he has to start his journey home. Suppose white to have a
                    blot as before on black’s ace point, and black to throw sixes, black could then
                    move two men from white’s outer table to his own bar point (so called because it
                    is close to the bar), and thence again to his own ace point, when he would hit
                    white without leaving a blot.</p>
                <p>The point in which a man is entered must not be blocked by two or more men
                    belonging to the adversary. Thus, to carry on the illustration, if white now
                    throws aces, or sixes, or six, ace, he cannot enter at all. He is not allowed to
                    move any man while he has one to enter; consequently his throw is null and void,
                    and black throws again. It sometimes happens that one player has a man up, and
                    that his adversary occupies all the points on his own home table with two or
                    more men (called having his table <hi rend="italic">made up).</hi> In this case,
                    the player with a man up cannot enter; and as it 13 useless for him to throw,
                    his adversary continues throwing until he is obliged to open a point on his
                    innertable.</p>
                <p>Two blots may be taken up at once if the adversary throws numbers that will hit
                    them both. It is possible with doublets to take up four blots at once, but this
                    could scarcely happen in a game between players of any proficiency.</p>
                <p>The game proceeds by moving the men round towards home, or by hitting blots and
                    sending them back, until one of the players gets all his men into his inner
                    table or home. As soon as this stage is reached, the player who has accomplished
                    it begins to take his men off the board or to <hi rend="italic">bear</hi> them.
                    Thus, suppose he has several men on every point of his table, and throws six,
                    quatre; he bears one man from his six point, and one from his quatre point. If
                    his six point is unoccupied, he can bear a six from his cinque point, or from
                    the highest point which is occupied, and so on with smaller numbers, provided
                    the numbers thrown are higher than the points occupied; if lower, the throw must
                    be moved. A player has the option of moving a man when he can, instead of
                    bearing it. Thus, in the case originally given the six must be borne, because a
                    six cannot be moved; but the quatre may be moved if preferred, by moving a man
                    from the six point to the deuce point, or from cinque point to the ace point
                    Doublets entitle to bear or move four men in accordance with the previous rules.
                    The adversary similarly bears his men as soon as he gets them all home. If,
                    after a player has commenced bearing his men, he should be hit on a blot, he
                    must enter on his adversary’s inner table, and must bring the man taken up into
                    his own inner table before he can bear any more.</p>
                <p>Whoever first bears all his men wins the game :—a single game or <hi
                    rend="italic">hit</hi> if his adversary has borne any of his men; a double game
                    or <hi rend="italic">gammon</hi> if the adversary has not borne a man; and a
                    triple game or <hi rend="italic">backgammon,</hi> if, at the time the winner
                    bears his last man, his adversary, not having borne a man, has one in the
                    winner’s inner table.</p>
                <p>When a series of games is played, the winner of a hit has the first throw in the
                    succeeding game; but if a gammon is won, the players each throw a single die to
                    determine the first move of the next game.</p>
                <p>In order to play backgammon well, it is necessary to know all the chances on two
                    dice, and to apply them in various ways. The number of different throws that can
                    be made is thirty-six. (See <hi rend="smallcaps">Hazard.)</hi> By taking all the
                    combinations of these throws which include given numbers, it is easily
                    discovered where blots may be left with the least probability of being hit. For
                    example, to find the chance of being hit where a blot can only be taken up by an
                    ace; the adversary may throw two aces, or ace in combination with any other
                    number up to six, and he may throw each of these in two different ways, so that
                    there are in all eleven ways in which an ace may be thrown. This deducted from
                    thirty-six (the total number of throws), leaves twenty-five; so that it is 25 to
                    11 against being hit on an ace. It is very important to bear in mind the chance
                    of being hit on any number. The following table gives the odds against being hit
                    on any number within the reach of one or two dice :—</p>

                </table>
                <p>The table shows that if a blot must be left within the reach of one die <hi
                    rend="italic">{i.e.,</hi> on any number from 1 to 6), the nearer it is left to
                    the adversary’s man, the less probability there is of its being hit. Also, that
                    it is long odds against being hit on a blot which is only to be reached with
                    double dice, and that, in that case <hi rend="italic">(i.e.,</hi> on any number
                    from T to 12), the further off the blot is, the less chance there is of its
                    being hit.</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit03newyrich/page/n214/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0903-0214-0199"/>
                <p>The table assumes that the board, is open for every possible throw. If part of
                    the throw is blocked by an intervening point being held by adverse men, the
                    chance of being hit may be less. Thus, a blot may be hit on an eight with
                    duecee; fours; cinque, trois (twice); or six, deuce (twice). If the fourth point
                    is blocked, the blot cannot be hit with deuces or fours, and consequently the
                    chance of its being hit is reduced from 30 to 6 to 32 to 4, or from 5 to 1 to 8
                    to 1.</p>
                <p>Two principles, then, have to be considered in moving the men :—( 1. ) To make
                    points where there is the best chance of obstructing the opponent; (2.) When
                    obliged to leave blots, to choose the position in which they are least likely to
                    be hit, t.e., either as near as possible to an adverse man, or as far as
                    possible from any adverse men: or where the intervening points are blocked by
                    the player's own men.</p>
                <p>At the beginning of the game it is advisable, if possible, to secure the cinque
                    point in your own inner table, or the cinque point in your adversary’s inner
                    table, or both. If you succeed in this, you should then play a bold game in
                    hopes of winning a gammon. The next best point to gain is your own bar point;
                    and the next to that the quatre point in your own inner table.</p>
                <p>If you are fortunate enough to secure all these points, and your adversary’s
                    inner table is less favourably made up, it is then to your interest to open your
                    bar point (in expectation of compelling your adversary to run out of your inner
                    table with a six), and also to keep any men you may have in the outer tables
                    spread <hi rend="italic">(i.e.</hi><hi rend="italic subscript"> i</hi> not to
                    crowd a number of men on one point). In this case you have a good chance of
                    hitting the man your adversary brings out, and also of hitting the man he has
                    left on your ace point.</p>
                <p>If you succeed in taking both these men, and your adversary has a blot in his
                    inner table, it will be to your interest not to make up your own table, but to
                    leave a blot there on purpose, in hopes of his entering on it. You will then
                    have a probability of hitting a third man, which, if accomplished, will give you
                    considerable odds (according to Hoyle, 4 to 1) in favour of winning a gammon;
                    whereas if you have only two of his men up, the odds are against your gammoning
                    him.</p>
                <p>The best move for every possible throw at the commencement of a game is a3
                    follows :—If you throw aces (the best of all throws), move two on your bar point
                    and two on your cinque point. This throw is often given to inferior players by
                    way of odds.</p>
                <p>Ace deuce: move the ace from your adversary’s ace point (if playing for a hit
                    only), and the deuce from the five men placed in your adversary’s outer table.
                    If playing for a gammon, move the ace from the six to the cinque point in your
                    inner table.</p>
                <p>Ace trois: make the cinque point in your inner table.</p>
                <p>Ace quatre and ace cinque: move the ace from your adversary’s ace point, and the
                    quatre or cinque from the five men in your adversary’s outer table. If playing
                    for a gammon, play the ace on the cinque point in your inner table.</p>
                <p>Ace six: make your bar point.</p>
                <p>Deuces: move two on the quatre point in your inner table, and two on the trois
                    point in your opponent’s inner table. If playing for a gammon, move two on the
                    quatre point in your inner table, and two from the five men in your adversary’s
                    outer table.</p>
                <p>Deuce trois and deuce cinque: move two men from the five placed in your
                    adversary’s outer table.</p>
                <p>Deuce quatre: make the quatre point in your own table.</p>
                <p>Deuce six: move a man from the five in your adversary’s outer table, and place
                    him on the cinque point in your own table.</p>
                <p>Threes: play two on the cinque point in your inner table, and three on the quatre
                    point of your adversary’s inner table. For a gammon, play two on your cinque
                    point and two on your trois point in your inner table.</p>
                <p>Trois quatre: move two men from the five in your opponent’s outer table.</p>
                <p>Trois cinque: make the trois point in your own table.</p>
                <p>Trois six: bring a man from your adversary’s ace point as far as he will go.</p>
                <p>Fours: move two on the cinque point in your adversary’s inner table, and two from
                    the five in his outer table. For a gammon, move two men from the five in your
                    opponent’s outer table to the cinque point in your own table.</p>
                <p>Quatre cinque and quatre six; carry a man from your adversary s ace point as far
                    as he will go.</p>
                <p>Fives: move two men from the five in your adversary’s outer table to the trois
                    point in your inner table.</p>
                <p>Cinque six: move a man from your adversary’s ace point as far as he will go.</p>
                <p>Sixes (the second best throw): move two on your adversary’s bar point, and two on
                    your own bar point.</p>
                <p>Subsequent moves depend on the intervening throws; consequently the problem
                    becomes too complicated for analysis. Some general rules, however, may be
                    given.</p>
                <p>In carrying the men home carry the most distant man to your adversary’s bar
                    point, next to the six point in your outer table, and then to the six point in
                    your inner table. By following this rule as nearly as the throws admit, you will
                    carry the men to your inner table in the feweβt number of throws. When all are
                    home but two, it is often advisable to lose a point, if by so doing you put it
                    in the power of a high throw to save a gammon.</p>
                <p>If, in endeavouring to gain your own or your adversary’s cinque point, you have
                    to leave a blot and are hit, and your adversary is forwarder in the game than
                    you, you must put another man on your cinque or bar point, or into your
                    adversary’s table. If this man is not hit, you may then make a point, and so get
                    as good a game as your opponent. If it is hit, you must play a <hi rend="italic"
                    >back</hi> game (t.e., allow him to take up as many men as he likes); and then
                    in entering the men taken up, endeavour to secure your adversary’s ace and trois
                    points, or ace and deuce points, and keep three men upon his ace point, so that
                    if you hit him from there you still keep the ace point protected.</p>
                <p>To find which is the forwardest, reckon how many points you have to bring all
                    your men home to the six point in your inner table. Add to this six for every
                    man on the six point in your tables, five for every man on your cinque point,
                    and so on; and then make the same calculation for your adversary’s men.</p>
                <p>Avoid carrying many men upon the trois or deuce point in your own tables, as
                    these men are out of play, and the board is left open for your adversary.</p>
                <p>Whenever you have taken up two of your adversary’s men, and have two or more
                    points made in your inner table, spread your other men to take the best chance
                    of making another point in your tables, and of hitting the man your adversary
                    enters. As soon as he enters, compare his game with yours, and, if equal or
                    better, take up his man, except when playing for a hit only, and your playing
                    the throw gives you a better chance for the hit.</p>
                <p>Always take up a man if the blot you leave in making the move can only be hit
                    with double dice, except when playing for a hit only, and you already have two
                    of your opponent’s men in your tables, and your game is forwardest; because your
                    having three of his men in your tables gives him a better chance of hiting you
                    without leaving a blot than if he has only two.</p>
                <p>In entering a man which it is to your adversary’s advantage to hit, leave the
                    blot upon the lowest point you can, <hi rend="italic">e.g.</hi><hi rend="italic
                    subscript"> t</hi> ace point in preference to deuce point, and so on; because
                    this crowds his game by taking out of it the men played on the low point.</p>
                <p>When your adversary is bearing his men, and you have two men in his table, say on
                    his ace point, and several men in the outer table, it is to your advantage to
                    leave one man on the ace point, because it prevents his bearing his men to the
                    greatest advantage, and gives you the chance of his leaving a blot. But if, on
                    calculation, you find that you can probably save the gammon by bringing both
                    your men out of his table, do not wait for a blot. To make this calculation, you
                    must ascertain in how many throws you can bring all your men home (a throw
                    averaging eight points), and in how many throws he can bear all his men, on the
                    assumption that he will bear on the average two men at each throw.</p>
                <p>The laws of backgammon (as given by Hoyle) are as follows :—</p>
                <p>1. When a man is taken from any point, it must be played; when two men are taken
                    from it, they also must be played. 2. A man is not supposed to be played till it
                    is placed upon a point and quitted. 3. If a player have only fourteen men in
                    play, there is no penalty inflicted, because by his playing with a lesser number
                    than he is entitled to, he plays to a disadvantage for want of the deficient man
                    to make up his tables. 4. If he bear any number of men before he has entered a
                    man taken up, and which of course he wa3 obliged to enter, such men so borne
                    must be entered again in the adversary’s tables as well as the man taken up. 5.
                    If he have mistaken his throw and played it, and his adversary have thrown, it
                    is not in the choice of either of the players to alter it, unless they both
                    agree so to do.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Russian Backgammon</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Tric-Trac</hi> is
                    played with the same implements as backgammon. The men are not placed on the
                    board, but both black and white are entered in the same table by throws of the
                    dice, and both players move <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit03newyrich/page/n215/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0903-0215-0200"/> in the same direction round to the opposite
                    table. A player is not obliged to enter all his men before he moves any; and he
                    can take up blots on entering, although he has some of his men, which have never
                    been entered, off the board. But, while a player has a man up, he must enter it
                    before entering any more, or moving any of those already entered. If he cannot
                    enter the man that is up, he loses the benefit of the throw.</p>
                <p>A player who throws doublets must move not only the number thrown, but also
                    doublets of the number corresponding to the opposite side of the dice; thus, if
                    he throws sixes, he must first enter or move the sixes, as the case may be, and
                    then aces, and he also has another throw. If he throws doublets a second time,
                    he moves according to the rule already given, and throws again, and so on. The
                    privilege is sometimes restricted by not allowing this advantage to the first
                    doublets thrown by each player. It is sometimes extended by allowing the thrower
                    of deuce, ace, to choose any doublets he likes on the opposite sides of the
                    dice, and to throw again. The restriction with regard to the first doublets
                    thrown does not apply to deuce, ace, nor does throwing it remove the restriction
                    with regard to first doublets.</p>
                <p>A player must first be able to complete the doublets thrown. If the cannot move
                    the whole throw, he cannot take the corresponding doublets &gt; and he is not
                    allowed another throw if he cannot move all the points to which he is entitled.
                    In other respects the game is similar to ordinary backgammon. The chief object
                    in the game is for the player who has his men in advance to secure as many
                    successive points as possible, so that his adversary may be unable to pass or
                    hit the forward men. <hi rend="smallcaps">(h. j.)</hi></p>
