                    is true that he was inspired by many of the influences that animated Victor Hugo
                    and his followers. Like them he was much occupied by the study of the fantastic
                    element in mediaeval art, so strongly opposed to the calm and limit of classical
                    literature, like them he reproduced the remoter phases of life and passion, and
                    thought that few subjects were so base or obscure as to be unworthy of artistic
                    treatment. But there is something in the powerful personality of Balzac
                    indicated by the colossal body, by the strong and sensual face, somewhat
                    resembling the profile of the Emperor Nero, which preserved him from the
                    mannerism of any school. He was never successful in reproducing the existence of
                    the past, he was essentially the man of his own day, and <hi rend="italic">La
                    Comédie Humaine</hi> is as much the picture of the 19th, as the <hi
                    rend="italic">Divina</hi><hi rend="italic">Commedia</hi> is of the 13th century.
                    The passions that move his characters are the intense desire of boundless
                    wealth, of luxury, of social distinction; and though here and there his
                    financiers, his journalists, his political intriguers, his sordid peasantry, are
                    relieved by the introduction of some pure figure, like that of Eugénie Grandet,
                    of David, or of Eve, there are only too many elaborate studies of creatures sunk
                    below the surface of humanity, the embodiments of infinite meanness and nameless
                    sin. He was merely “the secretary of society,” he said, and “drew up the
                    inventory of vices and virtues.” His ambition was, “by infinite patience and
                    courage, to compose for the France of the 19 th century that history of morals
                    which the old civilizations of Rome, Athens, Memphis, and India, have left
                    untold.” The consequence of this ambition is, that Balzac’s voluminous romances
                    have too often the air of a minute and tedious chronicle, and that the
                    contemporary reader is wearied with à mass of details about domestic
                    architecture, about the stock exchange, and about law, which will prove
                    invaluable to posterity.</p>
                <p>Balzac’s private history, which may be traced through many passages of his
                    novels, was a strange and not a happy one. He was early sent from his home in
                    Tours to the college of Vendôme, where he neglected the studies and sports of
                    childhood to bury himself in mystic books and mystic reveries. He has told the
                    story of his school life in <hi rend="italic">Louis Lambert,</hi> how he
                    composed a <hi rend="italic">théorie</hi><hi rend="italic">de la</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">volonté,</hi> a theory which was to complete the works of Mesmer,
                    Lavater, Gall, and Bichat. This promising treatise was burned by one of the
                    masters of the school; and Balzac, falling into bad health, returned home. The
                    next stage in his education was a course of study at the Sorbonne, and of
                    lectures on law. In the offices of <hi rend="italic">avoués</hi> and notaries he
                    picked up his knowledge of the by-ways of chicanery,—knowledge which he uses
                    only too freely in his romances. Nature did not mean Balzac for an advocate; he
                    was constant in the belief in his own genius, a belief which for many years he
                    had all to himself, and his family left him to work and starve, on the scantiest
                    pittance, in a garret of the Rue Lesdiguières. There followed ten years of hard
                    toil, poverty, experiments in this and that way of getting a living. These
                    struggles are described in <hi rend="italic">Facino Cane,</hi> in the <hi
                    rend="italic">Peau</hi><hi rend="italic">de Chagrin,</hi> and in a series of
                    letters to the author’s sister, Madame de Sur ville. Balzac found “three sous
                    for bread, two for milk, and three for firing” suffice to keep him alive, while
                    he devoured books in the library of the Arsenal, copied out his notes at night,
                    and then wandered for hours among the scenes of nocturnal Paris. “Your brother,”
                    he writes to Madame de Surville, “is already nourished like a great man,—he is
                    dying of hunger.” He tried to make money by scribbling many volumes of novels
                    without promise, and borrowed funds to speculate in the business of printing.
                    Ideas which have since made other men’s fortunes failed in Balzac’s hands, and
                    he laid the foundations of those famous debts which in later life were his
                    torment and his occupation. At length appreciation came, and with appreciation
                    what ought to have been wealth. Balzac was unfortunately as prodigal of money as
                    of labour; he would shut himself up for months, and see no one but his printer;
                    and then for months he would disappear and dissipate his gains in some
                    mysterious hiding-place of his own, or in hurried travelling to Venice, Vienna,
                    or St Petersburg. As a child he had been a man in thought and learning; as a man
                    he was a child in caprice and extravagance. His imagination, the intense power
                    with which he constructed new combinations of the literal facts which he
                    observed, was like the demon which tormented the magician with incessant demands
                    for more tasks to do. When he was not working at <hi rend="italic">La Comédie
                    Humaine,</hi> his fancy was still busy with its characters; he existed in an
                    ideal world, where some accident was always to put him in possession of riches
                    beyond the dreams of avarice. Meantime he squandered all the money that could be
                    rescued from his creditors on sumptuous apparel, jewels, porcelain, pictures.
                    His excesses of labour, his sleepless nights, his abuse of coffee undermined his
                    seemingly indestructible health. At length a mysterious passion for a Russian
                    lady was crowned by marriage; the famous debts were paid, the visionary house
                    was built and furnished, and then, “when the house was ready, death entered.”
                    Balzac died at the culmination of his fame, and at the beginning, as it seemed,
                    of the period of rest to which he had always looked forward.</p>
                <p>It is impossible to enter on a detailed criticism of Balzac’s novels. In them he
                    scales every height and sounds every depth of human character,—from the purity
                    of the mysterious Seraphitus Seraphita, cold and strange, like the peaks of her
                    northern Alps, to the loathsome sins of the Marnefs, whose deeds should find no
                    calendar but that of Hell. In the great divisions of his <hi rend="italic"
                    >Comédie,</hi> the scenes of private and of public life of the provinces and of
                    the city, <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit03newyrich/page/n320/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0903-0320-0305"/> in the philosophic studies, and in the <hi
                    rend="italic">Contes</hi><hi rend="italic">Drolatiques,</hi> Balzac has built up
                    a work of art which answers to a mediaeval cathedral. There are subterranean
                    places, haunted by the Vautrins and “Filles aux yeux d’or;” there are the seats
                    of the money-changers, where the Nucingens sit at the receipt of custom; there
                    is the broad platform of everyday life, where the journalists intrigue, where
                    love is sold for hire, where splendours and miseries abound, where the peasants
                    cheat their lords, where women betray their husbands; there are the shrines
                    where pious ladies pass saintly days; there are the dizzy heights of thought and
                    rapture, whence falls a ray from the supernatural light of Swedenborg; there are
                    the lustful and hideous grotesques of the <hi rend="italic">Contes</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Drolatiques.</hi> Through all swells, like the organ-tone, the
                    ground-note and mingled murmur of Parisian life. The qualities of Balzac are his
                    extraordinary range of knowledge, observation, sympathy, his steadfast
                    determination to draw every line and shadow of his subject, his keen analysis of
                    character and conduct. His defects are an over-insistance on detail, which
                    hampers and bewilders rather than aids the imagination of his readers; his
                    tortured style, “a special language forged out of all the slangs, all the
                    terminologies of science, of the studio, the laboratory, the <hi rend="italic"
                    >coulisses</hi> his fondness for dwelling on the morbid pathology of human
                    nature. With all these defects, and with the difficulty of judging any one of
                    his tales separately, because each is only a fragment in the development of the
                    immense <hi rend="italic">Comédie Humaine,</hi> Balzac holds a more distinct and
                    supreme place in French fiction than perhaps any English author does in the same
                    field of art. <hi rend="smallcaps">(a. l.)</hi></p>
