                <p><label type="entry">BIRMINGHAM</label>, the fourth town in size and population in
                    England, and the fifth in the United Kingdom, is situated at the extreme
                    north-west of the county of Warwick, in 52° 59' N. lat. and 1° 18' W. long. It
                    is 102 miles in a straight line N.W. of London, from which it is distant 112
                    miles by the North-Western Railway. The Roman Road, known as the Ikenield
                    Street, runs through the town. On the north Birmingham touches Staffordshire,
                    and on the south and west Worcestershire, the suburbs of the town extending
                    largely into both these counties—Harborne and Handsworth being in the former and
                    Balsall.</p>

                <p>Moseley, and Yardley in the latter. The borough itself, however—both
                    parliamentary and municipal, the boundaries being identical—is wholly in the
                    county of Warwick. It covers an area of 8420 acres (of which 5900 are built
                    upon), and includes the whole of the parishes of Birmingham and Edgbaston, and
                    about one-third of the parish of Aston. It is nearly 6 miles long, has an
                    average breadth of 3 miles, is 21 miles in circumference, and has 190 miles of
                    streets and roads. The population, at the census of 1871, was 343,000; andin
                    June 1875 it was estimated by the registrar-general at 360,000. Birmingham was
                    enfranchised by the Reform Act of 1832, when two representatives were assigned
                    to it—and Mr Thomas Attwood and Mr Joshua Scholefield (leaders of the Political
                    Union) were elected; by the Reform Act of 1867 this number was raised to three.
                    A grant of incorporation was made to the town in 1838, when the first municipal
                    council was elected. In 1870 a School Board of fifteen members was elected,
                    under the Elementary Education Act passed in that year.</p>
                <p>The town is built upon the New Red Sandstone, on a boldly undulated site, varying
                    from 200 to 600 feet above the sea-level, steadily rising towards the north and
                    west, so that when looked at from the heights on the south-east side it presents
                    the appearance of a vast semicircle, picturesquely disposed, the masses of
                    houses being broken by spires and lofty chimneys, and the south and west sides
                    being thickly wooded on the slopes. The plan of the town is irregular, and the
                    streets are mostly winding, and many of them somewhat narrow. In the centre,
                    however, is a large open space, known as the Bull Ring and High</p>
                <p>Street, at the foot of which stands the mother church of St Martin, and in which
                    is situated the Market-Hall, one of the largest buildings of its kind in the
                    kingdom. From this centre access is obtained to the principal streets, New
                    Street and High Street; the former, about a quarter of a mile in length, derives
                    a most picturesque appearance from its slightly curved form, and from the
                    effective manner in which the sky-line is broken by lofty buildings alternating
                    with others of lower altitude. This street contains the Exchange, the Grammar
                    School, the Theatre Royal, the rooms of the Royal Society of Artists, which have
                    a fine Corinthian portico stretching across the pavement. At the upper end of
                    the street is the Town-Hall, and close to this are the corporate buildings and
                    the Post-Office. The last quarter of a century has seen a great advancement in
                    the style and accommodation of the public and commercial edifices; streets have
                    been widened and new roads opened, and the place has altogether put on a
                    livelier and wealthier look. Excepting in some of the older and poorer
                    districts, the private houses have undergone a corresponding improvement. The
                    richer classes live chiefly in the parish of Edgbaston, which belongs almost
                    entirely to Lord Calthorpe, and in which strict rules as to the description,
                    position, and area of the houses are enforced. The streets inhabited by the
                    working-classes are, of course, more crowded, and many of the houses are built
                    in enclosed courts, access to which is gained from the street, either by
                    openings between the houses, or by narrow entries, too commonly built over, and
                    thus impeding the free passage of air. Many of the courts, however, are wide
                    enough to allow of small gardens in front of the houses, while in the suburbs
                    almost every house is provided with a garden of some kind; and in a considerable
                    number of cases the houses, through means of building societies, have become <pb

                    xml:id="kp-eb0903-0799-0782"/> the property of the workmen themselves. The habit
                    exists among all classes of each family (with rare exceptions) occupying a
                    separate house⅛ a practice which greatly affects the area of the town. Thus, to
                    a population of 360.000 there are about 76,000 inhabited houses, giving an
                    average of five persons to a house. Birmingham is a town of rapid growth In 1700
                    the population was about 15,000. A century later, at the census of 1801, it had
                    increased to 73,000 In the next thirty years the population doubled, being
                    147,000 in 1831. The same process was repeated in the following term of thirty
                    years, the population in 1861 being 296,000. Between 1861 and 1871 the increase
                    was 47,000, and the returns of the registrar-general show that the same rate of
                    progress is still going on. It is, however, likely to be checked by the
                    increasing value of land within the borough, by the absorption of available
                    sites for building, and by the consequent overflow of population into the
                    suburbs. If these, inhabited solely by borough people,are takeninto account, the
                    real population at present is probably not far short of half a million.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Government.—</hi> The government of the town resided originally
                    in the high and low bailiffs, both officers chosen at the court of the lord of
                    the manor, and acting as his deputies* The system was a loose one, but by
                    degrees it became somewhat organized, and Crown writs were addressed to the
                    bailiffs. In 1832, when the town was enfranchised, they were made the returning
                    officers. About the beginning of the century, however, a more regular system was
                    instituted, by an Act creating a body of street Commissioners, who acted for the
                    parish of Birmingham,—the hamlets outside its boundaries having similar boards
                    of their own. The annoyance and difficulty caused by these bodies—thirteen in
                    number—led to a demand for the incorporation of Birmingham as a borough; and a
                    charteτ was accordingly granted by the Crown in 1838, vesting the general
                    government in a mayor, sixteen aldermen, and forty-seven councillors. The powers
                    of this body were, however, unusually restricted, the other local governing
                    bodies remaining in existence, It was not until 1851 that an Act of Parliament
                    was obtained, abolishing all governing authorities excepting the Town Council,
                    and transferring all powers to this body Under this Act, and another local Act
                    obtained in 1862, the affairs of the town are now administered, the whole
                    municipal government being in the hands of the Town Council. The importance of
                    the duties discharged by the Council may be inferred from the fact that it has
                    under its control nearly 200 miles of street and road, that it has a police
                    force of nearly 500 men, and that its revenue, derived from tolls and rates,
                    amounts to about .£300,000 a year. These responsibilities have been increased by
                    the purchase in 1875 <hi rend="subscript"> -</hi> of the gas and water-works
                    (the latter with a daily supply of 17,000,000 gallons), the two purchases making
                    a cost of more than <hi rend="italic">£3,</hi> 000,000. The growth of the
                    revenue and expenditure of the town, its rateable value, and its ordinary debt,
                    excluding the gas and water-works, will be seen from the following tabular

                    year 1821 Birmingham was in the diocese of Lichfield and Coventry; it is now in
                    the diocese of Worcester and archdeaconry of Coventry, and is a rural deanery.
                    There was formerly a religious house, the priory of St Thomas the Apostle, and a
                    Guild of the Holy Cross, an association partly religious and partly charitable,
                    having a chantry in the parish church. The possessions of the priory went to the
                    Crown at the dissolution, and the building was destroyed before the close of the
                    16th century. The lands of the Guild of the Holy Cross were granted by Edward
                    VI. to trustees for the support of a free grammar school; they are now of the
                    value of nearly £15,000 a year. Until 1715 there was but one parish church, St
                    Martin’s, a rectory, having the tithes of the entire parish of Birmingham. St
                    Martin’s was erected about the middle of the 13th century; but in the course of
                    ages was so disfigured, internally and externally, as to present no traces
                    except in the tower and spire of its former character. In 1853 the tower was
                    found to be in a dangerous condition, and together with the spire was rebuilt.
                    In 1873 the remaining part of the old church was removed without disturbing the
                    monuments, and a new and larger edifice was erected in its place, at a cost of
                    nearly £30,000. The new church constitutes the chief ecclesiastical edifice in
                    Birmingham, and indeed the handsomest structure in the town. St Philip <hi
                    rend="superscript"> v</hi> s, a stately Italian structure, designed by Archer, a
                    pupil of Wren, was the next church erected. It was consecrated in 1715. Then
                    followed St Bartholomew’s in 1749, St Mary’s in 1774, St Paul’s in 1779, St
                    James’s, Ashted, in 1791, and others, which need not be mentioned, followed in
                    due course. At present the mother parish is divided into five rectories, and
                    there are within the borough, including those mentioned, 42 churches (each
                    having an ecclesiastical district assigned to it) of the Church of England, most
                    of these having schools and missions attached to them.</p>
                <p>Under the Commonwealth Birmingham was a stronghold of Puritanism. Clarendon
                    speaks of it and the neighbourhood as “the most eminently corrupted of any in
                    England. ’’ Baxter, on the other hand, commending the garrison of Coventry, says
                    it contained “the most , religious men of the parts round about, especially from
                    Birmingham.” The traditional reputation for Nonconformity is maintained by the
                    town, all varieties of dissenters being numerous and influential.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Unitarians,</hi> the oldest body established here, have six
                    chapels. One of these, the Old Meeting, is historically interesting, the
                    congregation having been formed on the Presbyterian model by a number of
                    ministers ejected under the Act of Uniformity. Another chapel, the New Meeting,
                    in Moor Street (now occupied by the Roman Catholics), is memorable as having
                    been the place of Dr Priestley’s ministerial labours. In 1862 the Unitarians
                    removed from this place to a new Gothic edifice, called the Church of the
                    Messiah, in Broad Street, where they still preserve a monument of Priestley,
                    with a medallion portrait in profile, and an inscription written by Priestley’s
                    friend, Dr Parr. The <hi rend="italic">Society of Friends,</hi> whose first
                    meeting-house dates from about 1690, have now three places of meeting. The <hi
                    rend="italic">Independents</hi> have now eleven chapels, several of them large
                    and flourishing. The <hi rend="italic">Baptists</hi> first erected a chapel in
                    Cannon Street in 1738. They have now 16; one of them, Wycliffe Chapel, Bristol
                    Road, is a singularly handsome structure of 14th century Gothic. The <hi
                    rend="italic">Wesleyan Methodists</hi> were established in Birmingham by John
                    Wesley himself in 1745, when he was roughly handled while preaching on Gosta
                    Green. For some years they <pb break="no"

                    17 places of worship; and the other divisions of the Methodist body have 24 in
                    the aggregate. The <hi rend="italic">Presbyterians</hi> possess 5 places of
                    worship, and the <hi rend="italic">Jews</hi> have a handsome synagogue. The <hi
                    rend="italic">Roman Catholics</hi> have paid special attention to Birmingham.
                    From the Revolution of 1688 until 1789 they had no place of worship here. They
                    now have a bishop (who assumes a title from the town), a cathedral, and 9 other
                    churches or chapels, a cemetery, and other establishments in the suburbs,
                    including several religious houses, including the Oratory, founded by Dr Newman.
                    The principal edifice is the cathedral of St Chad, built from the designs of Mr
                    Pugin, at a cost of more than £30,000.</p>
                <p>The religious institutions and societies in Birmingham are very numerous, and
                    with these are associated many establishments of a benevolent character, such as
                    almshouses, asylums, refuges, societies for the aid of discharged prisoners, and
                    for the promotion of religious education in Board schools, training institutions
                    for nurses and servants, and others of various kinds, in the management of which
                    persons of different religious opinions are commonly found working together in
                    friendly association.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Charities.—</hi> These are numerous. The principal is the
                    General Hospital, Summer Lane, opened in 1779; it was founded by Dr Ash, an
                    eminent local physician. The yearly average of in-patients is about 2300, of
                    out-patients, 25,000. The Queen’s Hospital, Bath Row, the other large hospital
                    of the town, was founded in 1840 by Mr W. Sands Cox, F.R.S., an eminent local
                    surgeon, who also founded the Queen’s College as a medical school. This hospital
                    receives annually about 1300 in-patients and 17,000 out-patients. The General
                    Dispensary, the officers of which visit patients at their own homes, relieves
                    about 8000 yearly. The Children’s Hospital (free), established in 1864 by Dr
                    Heslop, relieves about 15,000 out and 1000 in-patients. It has two
                    establishments—for out-patients (a very handsome Gothic building) in Steelhouse
                    Lane, and an inpatient department in Broad Street. There is also a Women’s
                    Hospital (free) for the special diseases of women ,∙ a lying-in charity; special
                    hospitals for diseases of the eye, the ear, bodily deformities, and the teeth;
                    and a homoeopathic hospital. The parish of Birmingham maintains a large
                    infirmary at the workhouse (Birmingham Heath), and a dispensary for out-patients
                    in Paradise Street.</p>
                <p>Nearly all these medical charities depend upon subscriptions, donations,
                    legacies, and income from invested property; and the sum raised in this way is
                    probably nearly £30,000 a year. There are two public organizations for aiding
                    the charities, both of which were begun in Birmingham. One is a simultaneous
                    collection in October in churches and chapels, called the Hospital Sunday,
                    established in 1859, and now yielding over £5000 a year; the other is the
                    Saturday Hospital collection, made by the work-people in March, which was
                    established in 1873, and yields about £4000.</p>
                <p>There is also a Sanatorium at Blackwell, near the Lickey Hill, about 10 miles
                    distant, common to all the hospitals. Amongst the non-medical charities the
                    principal are the Blind Institution and the Deaf and Dumb Asylum, both at
                    Edgbaston; and Sir Josiah Mason’s Orphanage at Erdington, which receives 300
                    orphan children, and was built and endowed at the cost of about £250,000 solely
                    by Sir Josiah Mason, a Birmingham penmaker. There are also in the town numerous
                    almshouses for aged persons, the chief of which are Lench’s Trust, the James
                    Charities, the Licensed Victuallers’ Asylum. Besides the general benefit
                    societies, such as the Oddfellows’, Foresters’, &amp;c., which are strongly
                    supported in Birmingham, the work-people have numerous clubs of a charitable
                    kind, and there are several important local provident societies of a general
                    character, with many thousand members.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Educodion.—</hi> The oldest and principal institution is the
                    Grammar School of King Edward the Sixth, founded in 1552, out of the lands of
                    the Guild of the Holy Cross, then of the annual value of £21, but now yielding
                    about £15,000 a year, with a prospect of large increase. The principal or high
                    school, in New Street, was erected in 1840, in the Perpendicular period of the
                    Gothic style, from designs by Sir Charles Barry, at a cost, including land, of
                    £71,000. This school is divided into two departments, classical and English, and
                    educates about 600 boys; while connected with it there are four elementary
                    schools for boys and girls, used chiefly by the lower middle class, the number
                    of pupils being 1500. The classical school has ten exhibitions of £50 each,
                    tenable at Oxford or Cambridge. The next most important foundation is that of
                    the Midland Institute, which includes a general literary department (lectures,
                    museums, and reading-rooms), and an industrial-department, with classes in
                    science, languages, mathematics, arithmetic, history, literature, and the laws
                    of health. There are about 600 science students, and about 1600 in the other
                    departments. The Queen’s College, originally a school of medicine, founded in
                    1828, obtained a royal charter in 1843 as a kind of university, with departments
                    of literature, theology, law, science, and engineering. All these branches have
                    now fallen into disuse, excepting medicine and theology; in the latter the
                    college educates candidates for the ministry of the Church of England. An
                    important foundation is Sir Josiah Mason’s Scientific College, for the endowment
                    of which Sir Josiah has conveyed to trustees property valued at nearly £100,000,
                    and a capacious building, estimated to cost probably £40,000, is now in erection
                    in Edmund Street, near the Town-Hall. Among the other educational foundations
                    may be mentioned Spring Hill College, Moseley, for the education of
                    Congregational ministers; four industrial schools; a large reformatory for boys
                    at Saltley, and one for girls at Smethwick. For general education there are many
                    private schools, of a good class, for boys and girls. Elementary education is
                    provided in the Church of England day schools, Roman Catholic schools, and Board
                    schools. A total provision, in all the public elementary schools, is made for
                    41,791 children; there are (July 1875) 51,334 on the books, with an average
                    attendance for the previous quarter of 37,894. The School Board, though it was
                    elected only in 1870, has, by the provision of new schools, and the exercise of
                    compulsory powers, more than doubled the school attendance. It has already built
                    and opened 9 schools, with accommodation for'8800 children, at a cost, for land
                    and buildings, of about £86,000; and 8 other schools are now in progress,
                    providing accommodation for 7400 children, at an estimated cost of about
                    £103,000— making a total expenditure of nearly £200,000, and provision for a
                    total of about 16,000 children.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Libraries, Ac.—</hi> The principal libraries of the town are
                    the Birmingham Library (belonging to a body of proprietors), founded in 1798 by
                    Dr Priestley, and containing about 40,000 volumes, and the Corporation Free
                    Libraries, in Ratcliff Place, commenced in 1861. These consist of a central
                    reference library and lending library (the former containing 36,000 volumes of
                    carefully chosen books), to which is attached a central reading-room. There are
                    also four lending libraries and news-rooms in other parts of the town, and
                    news-rooms are about to be opened by the Corporation in connection with the
                    Board schools. The total issue of books from the libraries for 1874 was 521,991.
                    Included in the reference library are a special Shakespeare library, containing
                    almost all known editions of the plays and of works illustrating them; a library
                    of nearly 1000 volumes, illustrating the works of Cervantes (presented by Mr W.
                    Bragge of Sheffield); and a large and unique collection of Warwickshire books
                    and antiquities, known as the Staunton collection. An Art Gallery and Industrial
                    Museum is attached to the Free Libraries; and there is at Aston Hall another
                    museum of natural history, &amp;c., belonging to the Corporation. Art
                    instruction is provided by the Royal Society of Artists, which has classes and
                    lectures for students, and which holds two general exhibitions annually; and by
                    the School of Art, which has 900 students, together with affiliated classes in
                    schools, containing nearly 1700 students.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Miscellaneous Institutions, Parks, Ae.—</hi> These include 8
                    banks, 4 principal clubs—the Union, the Midland, the Arts, and the
                    Conservative—to which a Liberal Club is about to be added. There are 3 morning
                    and 2 evening daily papers—4 of them Liberal and 1 Conservative—and 2 weekly
                    papers. There are 2 theatres, 2 large music-halls, and several smaller ones.
                    Musical festivals for the benefit of the General Hospital are held triennially,
                    and are usually marked by the production of new and important works, and by the
                    engagement of most of the leading <pb break="no"

                    5 parks and pleasure grounds belonging to the Corporation— Aston Park and Hall,
                    45 acres; Calthorpe Park, about 35 acres; Cannon Hill Park, 65 acres; and
                    Adderley and Highgate Parks, each about 12 acres. Beside these there are
                    numerous pleasure-grounds—the Botanical Gardens, Edgbaston, open to subscribers,
                    and the Lower Grounds, a beautiful series of gardens at Aston, in which
                    important flower shows are periodically held. Sutton Park, about 8 miles
                    distant, and including about 3000 acres, is also much used by the Birmingham
                    people. The Corporation has several sets of baths and wash-houses in various
                    parts of the town. There are several extensive cemeteries.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Public Buildings.—</hi> Of these the Town-Hall, a
                    nobly-proportioned and impressive edifice, is the principal. It stands at the
                    top of New Street, and on three sides is isolated from all other buildings by
                    broad and handsome streets. The hall, completed in 1850 at a total cost of
                    £52,000, is severely classic, modelled upon a Greek temple. The lower stage
                    consists of a vast plinth or basement,23feet high, upon which is reared a facade
                    of peripteral character, with 8 Corinthian columns (36 feet high) at the two
                    principal fronts, and 13 columns on each side. These columns (imitated from
                    those of the temple of Jupiter Stator at Rome) support a bold and enriched
                    cornice, finished at each end with a lofty pediment and entablature. The
                    exterior of the hall is built of Anglesea marble. The interior consists chiefly
                    of a regularly-built room, designed specially for meetings and concerts, with an
                    orchestra containing one of the finest organs in the kingdom. The seats are
                    arranged for an audience of 2265 persons, but when cleared of benches, as is the
                    case at great political meetings, 5000 persons may find standing room. On one
                    side of the Town-Hall are the buildings of the Midland Institute and the Free
                    Libraries (of Italian design), occupying the whole of Ratcliff Place, with
                    fronts to Paradise Street and Edmund Street. A new Art Gallery is in course of
                    erection, fronting the latter street. At the back of the Town-Hall is the site
                    of the new building of the Mason College (Gothic), and in front of the hall, in
                    Paradise Street, are Christ Church (classic), the Queen’s College (Gothic), and
                    the Post-Office. On the side of the hall in Ann Street, opposite to the Midland
                    Institute, are the new Corporate Buildings (Italian), now being erected at a
                    cost of nearly £200,000. These will give accommodation for the Town Council, law
                    courts, public offices, and the mayor of the borough. Lower down New Street is
                    the building of the Royal Society of Artists (classic), with a noble portico;
                    then comes the Exchange (Gothic) in Stephenson Place; and at the bottom of the
                    latter street is the Central Railway station, used by the North-Western, the
                    Midland, and their branch railways, and fronted by the Queen’s Hotel. The
                    station is more than a quarter of a mile in length. The roof, a magnificent
                    specimen of engineering, consists of a vast arch of glass and iron, carried on
                    pillars on each side, and measuring 1100 feet in length, 80 feet in height, and
                    212 feet in width in a single span. The glass in the roof weighs 115 tons, and
                    the iron-work 1400 tons. Below the station, in New Street, is the Grammar
                    School; and in High Street, close at hand, is the Market-Hall, a magnificent
                    classic building, erected in 1833 at a cost of nearly £70,000, with an area of
                    4380 square yards, and affording room for 600 stalls. Amongst the other public
                    buildings are the Borough Gaol at Winson Green, with 467 cells, arranged on the
                    separate system; near this the Lunatic Asylum, with accommodation for 600
                    patients; and close at hand the workhouse, which receives about 2000 inmates.
                    The General and Queen’s Hospitals are also handsome buildings, the latter
                    especially so, it being remarkable for a very noble out-patient hall. This and
                    the out-patient hall at the Children’s Hospital in Steelhouse Lane (Gothic) are
                    perhaps the finest rooms of their kind in the kingdom.</p>
                <p>Birmingham had till very recently only one public monument, the statue of Nelson,
                    by Westmacott, in High Street; but several others have been erected—namely,
                    those of Joseph Sturge, at the Five Ways, and of Thomas Attwood, the founder of
                    the Political Union, in Stephenson Place, both of them by the late Mr Thomas;
                    James Watt, a singularly beautiful work, in Ratcliff Place, by the late Mr
                    Munro; Sir Robert Peel, in New Street, by Mr P. Hollins; the late
                    Prince-Consort, in the Art Gallery, by Mr Foley; Sir Rowland Hill, in the hall
                    of the Post-Office, by Mr Noble; and Dr Priestley, in New Street, by Mr F. J.
                    Williamson. Chantrey’s famous statue of James λVa)t is in a special chapel at
                    Handsworth church.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Manufactures.—</hi> From an early period Birmingham has been a
                    seat of manufactures in metal. Hutton, the historian of the town, claims for it
                    Saxon or even British antiquity in this respect, but without the shadow of
                    foundation. The first or direct mention of Birmingham trades is to be found in
                    Leland’s <hi rend="italic">Itinerary</hi> (1538). He writes :— “I came through a
                    pretty street as ever I entered into Bermingham towne. This street, as I
                    remember, is called Dirtey (Deritend). In it dwell smiths and cutlers. There be
                    many smithes in the towne that use to make knives and all manner of cutlery
                    tooles, and many lorimers that make bittes, and a great many naylors, so that a
                    great part of the towne is maintained by smithes, who have their iron and
                    sea-cole out of Staffordshire.” The cutlers no longer exist, this trade having
                    gone to Sheffield; but the smiths remain, and the heavier cutting tools are
                    still largely made here. The well-ascertained importance of Birmingham as a
                    centre of manufactures began towards the close of the l7th century, one great
                    source of it being the absolute freedom of the town, there being no guilds,
                    companies, or restrictions of any kind; besides which the easy access to cheap
                    coal and iron indirectly helped the development. It is remarkable that two
                    important trades, now located elsewhere, were first established here. Steel was
                    made in Birmingham until 1797, and was then disused for quite 70 year3, when an
                    experiment in steel-making (still carried on) was made by a single firm.
                    Cotton-spinning was begun in Birmingham by John Wyatt, and Lewis Paul, and
                    Thomas Warren as early as 1730; but the speculation was abandoned before the end
                    of the century. The great staple of Birmingham is metal-working in all its
                    various forms. The chief variety is the brass-working trade, which employs
                    several hundred masters, and about 10,000 work-people, and consumes probably
                    50,⅛00 tons of metal annually, which is worked up into an infinity of articles
                    of ornament and utility. Iron-working, though largely carried on, is a much less
                    important trade, works of this kind being chiefly established in the
                    Staffordshire district. Jewellery, gold, silver, and gilt come next to brass.
                    Then follow small arms of all kinds, some of the larger establishments being
                    capable of turning out 2000 stand per week. Buttons, hooks and eyes, pins, and
                    other articles used for dress, constitute a large class of manufactures. Glass,
                    especially table glass, is a renowned staple of the town. Screws, nails,
                    &amp;c., are made in enormous quantities; indeed, Birmingham has a monopoly of
                    the English screw trade. Steel pens are also a specialty—as much as, probably,
                    15 tons or more of steel being the weekly consumption of these articles; the
                    largest maker, Sir Josiah Mason, rolls 5 tons weekly for his own consumption,
                    and has about 60 tons of pens constantly in manufacture in various stages. About
                    20,000,000 pens are made weekly in the town, and are sold at prices ranging from
                    1⅜d, to 12s. per gross of 12 dozen. The fact that each gross requires 144 pieces
                    of steel to go through <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0903-0802-0785"/> 12 different processes, renders this cheapness of
                    sale one of the greatest marvels of manufacturing skill and industry.
                    Electro-plating, first established about 1848 by Messrs Elkington and Mason, is
                    one of the leading trades. Amongst other branches of manufacture are
                    wire-drawing, bell founding, metal rolling, railway carriage building (a large
                    and important industry), steel-toy making (including cutting implements and
                    tools of all kinds), die-sinking, papier-maché making, and a variety of others,
                    for which reference may be made to a volume entitled <hi rend="italic"
                    >Birmingham and the Midland Hardware District,</hi> prepared on the visit of the
                    British Association in 1865, and extending to more than 700 pages. It is
                    impossible, indeed, in smaller compass to give an adequate idea of the variety
                    and extent of Birmingham industry. To quote a modern writer :—</p>
                <p>“We cannot move without finding traces of the great hive of metal-makers—the
                    veritable descendants of Tubal-cain. At home or abroad, sleeping or waking,
                    walking or riding, in a carriage or upon a railway or steamboat, we cannot
                    escape reminiscences of Birmingham. She haunts us from the cradle to the grave.
                    She supplies us with the spoon that first brings our infant lips into
                    acquaintance with ‘pap,’ and she provides the dismal ‘furniture’ which is
                    affixed to our coffins. In her turn Birmingham lays the whole world under
                    contribution for her materials. For her smiths, and metal workers, and
                    jewellers, wherever nature has deposited stores of useful or precious metals, or
                    has hidden glittering gems, there industrious miners are busily digging. Divers
                    collect for her button makers millions of rare and costly shells. F or her,
                    adventurous hunters rifle the buffalo of his wide-spreading horns, and the
                    elephant of his ivory tusks. There is scarcely a product of any country or any
                    climate that she does not gladly receive, and in return stamps with a richer
                    value.”</p>
                <p>These labours Birmingham performs with the aid of many thousands of willing
                    hands, moved by busy and ingenious brains, and aided by her own great invention,
                    the steam-engine; for by the genius of Watt and the intrepid courage of Boulton,
                    Birmingham may claim the perfection of this discovery as her own. The memory of
                    the great Soho factory is one of the most precious heritages of the town, and
                    the name remains, for though the old factory has long since disappeared, the
                    firm of Boulton and Watt still continue to make steam-engines in the immediate
                    neighbourhood; and James Watt’s own private workshop continues just as he left
                    it, with no single article disturbed, carefully preserved in the garret of his
                    house at Heathfield.</p>
                <p>The mention of Watt and of Soho recalls the memories of distinguished inventors
                    and others who have been connected with Birmingham. Johnson was a frequent
                    visitor here to his friend Hector, the surgeon, on whose house in the Old Square
                    a tablet (erected by the Shakespeare Club) bears witness to the residence of the
                    great moralist. Then Baskerville, the printer, carried on his work here. The
                    famous Luιiar Society, fully described by Mr Smiles in his <hi rend="italic"
                    >Lives of the Engineers,</hi> brought together a brilliant company—Watt,
                    Boulton, Priestley, Josiah Wedgwood, Darwin, Parr, Withering, Edgeworth, Sir
                    Joseph Banks, Herschel, Dr Solander, Fothergill, Roebuck, Galton, Keir, and many
                    others. Murdoch, the inventor of gas, was a Soho man, and first used his
                    invention to light the Soho factory at the peace of Amiens in 1802. Rickman, the
                    reviver and historian of Gothic architecture, practised as an architect in
                    Birmingham. Hutton, the antiquary and historian, carried on his bookselling
                    business here. Many of the best engravers were Birmingham men, notably Willmore
                    and Pye, the special translators of Turner’s marvellous creations. In the ranks
                    of landscape painters the name of David Cox will ever confer honour upon the
                    town. Attwood, Joseph Parkes, and Bright speak for it in the region of politics
                    and statesmanship. The series of inventors is continued to our own day by the
                    names of Gillott, Elkington, Chance, Mason, and others.</p>
                <p>In many respects Birmingham is a peculiar town, and in none more than the hold it
                    has upon the affections of its people. A “Birmingham man” is usually a man of
                    strong individuality, independence of character, facility of resource, and with
                    an enduring love for “the old town.” These traits of character are the result of
                    a variety of circumstances. Birmingham is peculiar in opening a career even to
                    the humblest who are gifted with ingenuity and industry. The great number of
                    trades keeps work fairly constant, the skill required in them sustains wages of
                    artizans at a high level, and the distribution of labour, and its dependence
                    upon direct personal aptitude, afford chances of rising in the social scale
                    which cannot be found in places where manufactures are mainly of one class and
                    are conducted in factories demanding large capital. It is easy in Birmingham for
                    a man to become a small master, and gradually to push his trade until he is able
                    to establish a factory. Many of the largest employers have either been workmen
                    themselves or are the sons of workmen; while of the smaller manufacturers almost
                    all take a direct part in the handicraft work carried on in their places of
                    business.</p>
                <p>Wealth is more evenly distributed than in most other places. There are no
                    colossal fortunes in Birmingham, and comparatively few large ones, and of these
                    very few are made by speculative operations. To compensate for these
                    distinctions there is an unusually large comfortable class— people of good
                    though not excessive incomes derived from solid trade, or from savings made by
                    hard personal and associated work. This class, touching the actually wealthy on
                    one side, by easy and almost imperceptible stages touches the actual
                    working-class on the other, and this latter class is constantly rising into the
                    middle rank.</p>
                <p>The Birmingham work-people, in their way, are courteous and helpful. This is
                    probably owing to the free and open and common discussion of subjects of
                    political and social interest engaged in without distinction of class. The same
                    principle is adopted educationally—in the Midland Institute, for example—the Act
                    of Parliament which established the Institute providing that the governing
                    council shall always include artizan members. Another noticeable characteristic
                    of the town is the development of means of self-instruction and of self-help.
                    Birmingham was amongst the earliest places to establish a mechanics’
                    institution, the place of which is now more efficiently supplied by the Midland
                    Institute. Birmingham, again, was the birthplace of the freehold land and
                    building societies, by whiclι workmen are enabled, on easy terms, to acquire
                    houses of their own; and in addition to these institutions, which are numerous
                    and flourishing, it has a very large number of sick and friendly societies,
                    savings-clubs, and other organizations of a provident kind,—more in proportion
                    to population than, probably, any other of the large towns in England. Amongst
                    the social characteristics it should be mentioned that there are few serious
                    disputes between masters and workmen, and that strikes are infrequent, and when
                    they do occur are found capable of easy adjustment by friendly negotiation. One
                    point more is worthy of record—the constancy of the town to those who serve it.
                    Many of the leading manufacturers and other citizens are members of the local
                    governing bodies, and these and the parliamentary representatives are rarely
                    changed by their constituents.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">History.—</hi> Owing to its rapid expansion, and the consequent
                    newness of most of the public and other buildings, Birmingham is often supposed
                    to be a modem town. It is really one of the oldest in the country, and was in
                    existence as a community in the Saxon period. Proof of this was given in 1309 by
                    William de Bermingham, then lord of the manor, who showed in a law-suit that his
                    ancestors had a market in the place, and levied tolls, before the Conquest. Some
                    authors have endeavoured to identify the town with the supposed Roman station
                    called Bremenium, but this claim has long since been abandoned as fabulous. The
                    origin of the name is untraceable; the spelling of it is traceable in about 100
                    different forms. Dugdale, the historian of Warwickshire, adopts Brom <pb
                    break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit03newyrich/page/n803/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0903-0803-0786"/> wycham, and regards it as of Saxon derivation.
                    Hutton, the historian of Birmingham, has the fanciful etymology of <hi
                    rend="italic">Brom</hi> (broom), <hi rend="italic">wych</hi> (a descent), and
                    <hi rend="italic">ham</hi> (a home), making together, the home on the hill by
                    the heath. As regards the history of the town, we must agree with Hutton that
                    “the way is long, dark, and slippery.” In <hi rend="italic">Domesday Book</hi>
                    it is rated at four miles of land with half a mile of woods, the whole valued at
                    £203. Two hundred years later the family of De Bermingham, the owners of the
                    place, come into sight,—one of them, William, being killed at the battle of
                    Evesham, in 1265, fighting with Simon de Montfort and the barons against Henry
                    the Third. The son of this William afterwards took part in the French war, and
                    was made prisoner; his father’s estates, forfeited by treason, were restored to
                    him. Thenceforward we find the family engaged in various local and other
                    offices, but seemingly abstaining from politics. They held the place until 1527,
                    when Edward de Bermingham was deprived of his property by means of John Dudley,
                    duke of Northumberland, who trumped up a pretended charge of riot and robbery
                    against him, and procured Birmingham for nimself. On the attainder of Dudley the
                    manor passed to the Crown, and was granted to Thomas Marrow, of Berks-well, from
                    whom by marriage and descent it went to Christopher Musgrave, and finally, as
                    regards the only valuable part—the market tolls—by purchase to the town itself.
                    In the Wars of the Roses it does not seem that Birmingham took any part; but
                    energy revived in the civil war under Charles I., when the town sided actively
                    with the Parliamentarians. In 1612, when Charles was marching from Shrewsbury to
                    relieve Banbury, the Birmingham people seized part of his baggage, including
                    much plate, money, and wine, which they sent to the Parliamentary garrison at
                    λVarwick. Before the battle of Edgehill Charles rested for two nights at Aston
                    Hall, near the town, as the guest of Sir Thomas Holte. The Birmingham people
                    resented this by helping the Parliamentarians to cannonade the hall and to levy
                    a fine upon Sir Thomas Holte. They also set to work, and supplied the
                    Parliamentary army with 15,000 sword blades, refusing to make a single blade for
                    the Royalists. These manifestations of hostility were avenged in April 1613, by
                    Prince Rupert, who, with 2000 men and several pieces of artillery, attacked the
                    town, planting his cannon on an eminence near Sparkbrook, still known as
                    Camphill. The townspeople resisted, but were beaten, many persons being killed
                    oι wounded. Amongst the former was Lord Denbigh, one of the Royalist officers.
                    Having captured the place, Prince Rupert allowed his troops to plunder it, to
                    burn about eighty houses, and to set their prisoners to ransom. He also levied a
                    fine of £30,000, equal to at least £100,000 of the present value of money. This
                    bitter lesson kept Birmingham quiet during the rest of the civil war, though the
                    sympathies of the people with the Parliamentarians were unabated. In 1665
                    Birmingham suffered heavy losses by the plague, great numbers of dead being
                    buried in the Pest Field, at Ladywood, then a lonely place far outside the town,
                    but long since thickly covered with buildings. In 1688 the Revolution provoked a
                    temporary outbreak of Protestant feeling. James II. had given timber from the
                    royal forest of Needwood, near Burton, to build a Catholic chapel and convent in
                    a place still called Mass-house Lane. This edifice the mob promptly destroyed
                    when James gave place to William and Mary. Rather more than a century of quiet
                    prosperity ensued, and then occurred the serious and most lamentable outbreak of
                    popular fury known as the Church and King riots of 1791. For some years there
                    had been much political activity in Birmingham, the dissenters, particularly the
                    Unitarians, being desirous of relief from the political and religious
                    disabilities under which they laboured. The leader in these movements was the
                    famous Dr Priestley, who kept up an active controversy with the local clergy and
                    others, and thus drew upon himself and his coreligionists the hatred of the more
                    violent members of the Church and Tory party. The smouldering fire broke out on
                    the occasion of the French Revolution. On the 14th of July a dinner of
                    Birmingham Liberals was held at the Royal Hotel to celebrate the destruction of
                    the Bastille. This was the signal of a popular outbreak. A Church and King mob,
                    encouraged and organized by leaders of better station, but who were too cowardly
                    to show themselves, began an attack upon the Unitarians. Dr Priestley was not
                    present at the dinner, but his house at Fair Hill, Sparkbrook, was one of the
                    first to be sacked and burnt—his library and laboratory, with all his
                    manuscripts, the records of life-long scientific and philosophical inquiries,
                    perishing in the flames. The house and library of Hutton, the historian and
                    antiquary, were also destroyed. The Unitarian chapel was burnt, and several
                    houses belonging to members of the sect were sacked and burnt. The riot
                    continued until a strong body of troops was marched into the town, but before
                    their arrival damage to the amount of more than £60,000 had been done. Some of
                    the rioters perished in the burning buildings, in the cellars of which they
                    drank themselves into stupefaction. Others were tried and imprisoned, and four
                    of the prisoners were hanged. The persecuted Unitarians recovered a small part
                    of their losses from the county; but Dr Priestley himself, owing to the unworthy
                    prejudice against him, was in a great measure forced to remove to the United
                    States of America, where, he spent the rest of his life. A late atonement was
                    made, by the town to his memory in 1873, by the erection of a statue in his
                    honour in front of the Town-Hall, and the foundation of a Prie3tley scholarship
                    at the Midland Institute.</p>
                <p>As if ashamed of the excesses of 1791, Birmingham thenceforth became a thoroughly
                    Liberal and, with one or two exceptions, a peaceful town. In the dismal period
                    from 1817 to 1819, when the manufacturing districts were heavily distressed and
                    were disturbed by riots, Birmingham remained quiet. Even when some of the
                    inhabitants were tried and punished for demanding parliamentary representation,
                    and for electing Sir Charles Wolseley as their delegate, there was no
                    demonstration of violence—the wise counsels of the leaders inducing orderly
                    submission to the law. The same prudent course was observed when in the Reform
                    agitation of 1831-32 the Political Union was formed, under the leadership of
                    Thomas Attwood, to promote the passing of the Reform Bill. Almost the whole
                    town, and great part of the surrounding district, joined in this agitation; vast
                    meetings were held on Newhall Hill; there was much talk of marching upon London
                    100,000 strong; but, owing to the firmness and statesmanship of Mr Attwood and
                    his associates, there was no rioting or any sign of violence. Ultimately the
                    Political Union succeeded in its object, and Birmingham helped to secure for the
                    nation the enfranchisement of the middle classes and other political reforms.
                    One exception to the tranquillity of the town has to be recorded—the occurrence
                    of riots in 1839, during the Chartist agitation. Chartism took a strong hold in
                    Birmingham, and, under the influence of Mr Feargus O’Connor and some of his
                    associates, nightly meetings of a threatening character were held in the Bull
                    Ring. The magistrates resolved to put these down, and having obtained the help
                    of a detachment of the metropolitan police—the town then having no local police
                    force-a meeting was dispersed, and a riot ensued, which resulted in injury to
                    several persons, and required military force to suppress it. This happened on
                    the 4th of July. On the 15th of the same month another meeting took place, and
                    the mob, strongly armed and numbering many thousands, set fire to several houses
                    in the Bull Ring, some of which were burned to the ground, and others were
                    greatly damaged. The military again interfered, and order was restored, several
                    of the ringleaders being afterwards tried and imprisoned for their share in the
                    disturbance. There was another not in 1867, caused by the ferocious attacks of a
                    lecturer named Murphy upon the Roman Catholics, which led to the sacking of a
                    street chiefly inhabited by Irishmen; but the incident was comparatively
                    trivial, and further disorders were prevented by the prompt action of the
                    authorities. (J. T. B.)</p>
