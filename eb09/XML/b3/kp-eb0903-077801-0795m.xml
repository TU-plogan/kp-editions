                    inhabiting New Guinea and the adjacent islands, so named by the Dutch voyagers
                    in allusion to the brilliancy of their plumage, and to the current belief that,
                    possessing neither wings nor feet, they passed their lives in the air, sustained
                    on their ample plumes, resting only at long intervals suspended from the
                    branches of lofty trees by the wirelike feathers of the tail, and drawing their
                    food “from the dews of heaven and the nectaι of flowers.” Such stories obtained
                    credence from the fact that so late as the year 1760, when Linnaeus named the
                    principal species <hi rend="italic">apoda,</hi> or “footless,” no perfect
                    specimen had been seen in Europe, the natives who sold the skins to coast
                    traders invariably depriving them of feet and wings. The birds now usually
                    included under this name belong to two distinct families, the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Paradiseidoe</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">Epimachidoe,</hi> the former or
                    true Birds of Paradise being closely allied to the Crows, the latter or
                    Long-billed Paradise Birds being usually classed, from the form and size of
                    their bills, with the Hoopoes. Both families occupy the same geographical area,
                    and are alike distingushed by the enormous development of certain parts of their
                    plumage. Of the true birds of paradise, the largest is the Great Emerald Bird
                    <hi rend="italic">(Paradisea apoda),</hi> about the size of the common jay. Its
                    head and neck are covered with short thick-set feathers, resembling velvet pile,
                    of a bright straw colour above, ar.d a brilliant emerald green beneath. From
                    under the shoulders on each side springs a dense tuft of golden-orange plumes,
                    about 2 feet in length, which the bird can raise at pleasure, so as to enclose
                    the greater part of its body. The two centre tail feathers attain a length of 34
                    inches, and, being destitute of webs, have a thin wire-like appearance. This
                    splendid plumage, however, belongs only to the adult males, the females being
                    exceedingly plain birds of a nearly uniform dusky brown colour, and possessing
                    neither plumes nor lengthened tail feathers. The young males at first resemble
                    the females, and it is only after the fourth moulting, according to A. R.
                    Wallace, who recently studied those birds in their native haunts, that they
                    assume the perfect plumage of their sex, which, however, they retain permanently
                    afterwards, and not during the breeding season only as was formerly supposed. At
                    that season the males assemble, in numbers varying from twelve to twenty, on
                    certain trees, and there disport themselves so as to display their magnificent
                    plumes in presence of the females. Wallace in his <hi rend="italic">Malay
                    Archipelago,</hi> vol. ii., thus describes the attitude of the male birds at one
                    of those “sacaleli,” or dancing parties, as the natives call them; “their
                    wings,” he says, ‘ are raised vertically over the back, the head is bent down
                    and stretched out, and the long plumes are raised up and expanded till they form
                    two magnificent golden fans striped with deep red at the base, and fading off
                    into the pale brown tint of the finely-divided and softly-waving points; the
                    whole bird is then overshadowed by them, the crouching body, yellow head, and
                    emerald green throat, forming but the foundation and setting to the golden glory
                    which waves above.” It is at this season that those birds are chiefly captured.
                    The bird-catcher having found a tree thus selected for a “dancing party,” builds
                    a hut among the lower branches in which to conceal himself. As soon as the male
                    birds have begun their graceful antics, he shoots them, one after the other,
                    with blunt arrows, for the purpose of stunning and bringing them to the ground
                    without drawing blood, which would injure their plumage; and so eager are those
                    birds in their courtship that almost all the males are thus brought down before
                    the danger is perceived. The natives in preparing the skins remove both feet and
                    wings, so as to give more prominence to the commercially valuable tuft of
                    plumes. They also remove the <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0903-0796-0779"/> skull, and the skin is then dried in a smoky hut.
                    The Great Emerald Bird, so far as yet known, is only found in the Aru Islands.
                    The Lesser Bird of Paradise <hi rend="italic">(Paradisea minor'),</hi> though
                    smaller in size and somewhat less brilliant in plumage, in other respects
                    closely resembles the preceding species. It is also more common, and much more
                    widely distributed, being found throughout New Guinea and the neighbouring
                    islands. Its plumes are those most generally used as ornaments for ladies’
                    head-dresses. It has been brought alive to Europe, and has been known to live
                    for two years in the gardens of the Zoological Society of London. Both species
                    are omnivorous, feeding voraciously on fruits and insects. They are strong,
                    active birds, and are believed to be polygamous. The King Bird of Paradise <hi
                    rend="italic">(Cicinnuηιs regl·us)</hi> is one of the smallest and most
                    brilliant of the group, and is specially distinguished by its two middle tail
                    feathers, the ends of which alone are webbed, and coiled into a beautiful spiral
                    disc of a lovely emerald green. In the Red Bird of Paradise <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Paradisea rubra)</hi> the same feathers are greatly elongated and destitute of
                    webs, but differ from those in the other species, in being flattened out like
                    ribbons. They are only found in the small island of Waigiou off the coast of New
                    Guinea. Of the Long-billed Paradise Birds <hi rend="italic">(Epimachidoe)</hi>
                    the most remarkable is that known as the “Twelve-wired” <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Seleucides alba),</hi> its delicate yellow plumes, twelve of which are
                    transformed into wire-like bristles nearly a foot long, affording a striking
                    contrast to the dark metallic tints of the rest of its plumage. Like the <hi
                    rend="italic">Para-</hi><hi rend="italic">diseidoe</hi> they feed on insects and
                    fruits.</p>
