                    Oriental), a Greek fabulist, who wrote, according to Sir G. C. Lewis, shortly
                    before the Augustan age, though dates have been assigned to him from 250 <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> to 250 A.D. One of his editors, Boissonade, believes
                    that he was a Roman. His name occurs in some of the old grammarians, and a few
                    fragments were ascribed to him. The first critic who made him more than a mere
                    name, was Bentley in his <hi rend="italic">Dissertation on the Fables of</hi><hi

                    fables, which had been handed down in various collections from the time of
                    Maximus Planudes, Bentley discovered traces of versification, and was able to
                    extract a number of verses which he assigned to Babrius. Tyrwhitt followed up
                    the researches of Bentley, and for some time the efforts of scholars were
                    directed toλvards reconstructing the metrical original of the prose fables. In
                    1842, however, Μ. Mynas, a Greek, the discoverer of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Philosophoumena</hi> of Hippolytus, came upon a MS. of Babrius in the convent
                    of St Laura on Mount Athos. This MS. contained 123 fables out of the supposed
                    original number, 160. The fables are written in choliambic, <hi rend="italic"
                    >i.e.,</hi> limping or imperfect iambic verse, having a spondee as the last
                    foot, a metre originally appropriated to satire. The style is extremely good,
                    the expression being terse, pointed, and elegant, and the construction of the
                    stories is fully equal to that in the prose versions. The MS. was first
                    published by Boissonade in 1844; afterwards by Lachmann, 1845; by Orelli and
                    Baiter, 1845; by Sir George Cornewall Lewis, 1846; and by Schneidewin, 1853. The
                    genuineness of this collection of the fables was generally admitted by scholars.
                    In 1857 Mynas professed to have discovered at Mount Athos another part
                    containing 94 fables and a prooemium. According to his statement, the monks, who
                    had been willing to sell the MS. containing the first part for a sufficient
                    price, refused altogether to part with the second. He therefore made a copy
                    which was sold to the British Museum, and was published in 1859 by Sir G. C.
                    Lewis. But these fables only purport to be Babrius spoiled,, after having passed
                    through the hands of a “diasceuast,” ' that is, some late writer who has turned
                    his verses into barbarous Greek and wretched metre. In a Latin dissertation,
                    published in 1861, Professor Conington carefully examined this part, arriving at
                    the conclusion that the fables were metrical versions of the prose stories,
                    executed by some forger who must have been acquainted with Lachmann’s
                    conjectures on fragments formerly known. Cobet expresses a similar opinion, but
                    in stronger terms. It is not impossible that the forger was Mynas himself. Sir
                    G. C. Lewis, however, holds that the similarity between the fables and these
                    existing prose versions appears such as might have been produced not by a forger
                    copying from a prose writer, but rather by two grammarians recasting the same
                    work of Babrius. The standard edition of Babrius is that of Sir. G. C. Lewis;
                    there is a faithful translation in verse by Davies. For Conington’s dissertation
