                <p><label type="entry">BARRI, <hi rend="smallcaps">Girald de</hi></label>, commonly
                    called <hi rend="italic">Giraldus Cambrensis,</hi> an historian and ecclesiastic
                    of the 12th and 13th centuries, was born at the castle of Maenor Pyrr near
                    Pembroke, probably in 1147. By his mother he was descended from the princes of
                    South Wales, and the De Barris were one of the most powerful Welsh families.
                    Being a younger brother, and intended for the church, he was sent to St David’s,
                    and educated in the family of his uncle, the bishop of that see. When about
                    twenty years of age he was sent to the University of Paris, where he continued
                    for some years, and, according to his own account, became an excellent
                    rhetorician and lecturer. On his return in 1172 he entered holy orders, and was
                    made archdeacon of Brecknock. Having observed with much concern that his
                    countrymen the Welsh w ere very backward in paying tithes of wool and cheese, he
                    applied to Richard, archbishop of Canterbury, and was appointed his legate in
                    Wales for remedying this and other disorders. Barry excommunicated all, without
                    distinction, who refused to compound matters with the church, and, in
                    particular, delivered over bodily to the evil one those who withheld the tithe3.
                    Not satisfied with enriching, he also attempted to reform the clergy. He delated
                    an aged archdeacon to the archbishop, for the unpardonable crime of matrimony;

                    deprived of his archdeaconry, which was bestowed upon the zealous legate. On the
                    death of his uncle, the bishop of St David’s, ill 1176, he was elected his
                    successor by the chapter; but this choice having been made without the
                    permission and against the will of Henry II., Girald prudently declined to
                    insist upon it, and went again to Paris to prosecute his studies. He speaks with
                    exultation of the prodigious fame which he acquired by his eloquent declamations
                    in the schools, and of the crowded audiences who attended them. Having spent
                    about four years at Paris, he returned to St David’s, where he found everything
                    in confusion; and on the temporary retirement of the bishop, which took place
                    soon after, he was appointed administrator by the advice of the archbishop of
                    Canterbury, and governed the diocese in that capacity till 1184, when the bishop
                    was restored. About the same time he was called to court by Henry II., appointed
                    one of his chaplains, and sent into Ireland with Prince John, by whom he was
                    offered the united bishoprics of Femes and Leighlin. He would not accept them,
                    and employed his time in collecting materials for his <hi rend="italic"
                    >Topography of Ireland,</hi> and his history of the conquest of that island,
                    which was completed in three books in 1187. In 1188 he attended Baldwin,
                    archbishop of Canterbury, in his progress through Wales, preaching a crusade for
                    the recovery of the Holy Land,— an employment in which he tells us, with his
                    usual modesty, that he was far more successful than the primate, adding
                    significantly, that the people were most affected with Latin sermons (which they
                    did not understand), melting into tears, and coming in crowds to take the cross.
                    On the accession of Bichard I. in 1189, he was sent by that monarch into Wales
                    to preserve the peace of the country, and was even joined in commission with
                    William Longchamp, bishop of Ely, as one of the regents of the kingdom. He
                    failed, however, to improve this favourable opportunity; and having fixed his
                    heart on the see of St David’s, the bishop of which was very old and infirm, he
                    refused the bishopric of Bangor in 1190, and that of Llandaff the year
                    following. But in 1192 the state of public affairs became so unfavourable to
                    Barri’s interest at court that he determined to retire. He proceeded to Lincoln,
                    where William de Monte read lectures in theology with great applause; and here
                    he spent about six years in the study of divinity, and in composing several
                    works. At last the see of St David’s, which had long been the object of his
                    ambition, became vacant, and he was unanimously elected by the chapter, but met
                    with so powerful an adversary in Hubert, archbishop of Canterbury, that it
                    involved him in a litigation which lasted five years, cost him three journeys to
                    Rome, and ended in his defeat in the year 1203. Retiring from the world, he
                    spent the last seventeen years of his life in studious privacy. His MSS. are
                    preserved in the British Museum, the library at Lambeth, and the Bodleian
                    Library.</p>
