                    of the Bodleian library at Oxford, was born at Exeter in 1544. When he was about
                    twelve years of age, his father, John Bodley, being obliged to leave the kingdom
                    on account of his Protestant principles, settled with his family at Geneva, and
                    continued there till the death of Queen Mary. In that university, then in its
                    infancy, young Bodley studied under several eminent professors. On the accession
                    of Queen Elizabeth he returned with his father to England, and was soon after
                    entered of Magdalen College, Oxford. In 1563 he took the degree of bachelor of
                    arts, and the year following was admitted a fellow of Merton College. In 1565 he
                    read a Greek lecture in the hall of that college, took the degree of master of
                    arts the year after, and read natural philosophy in the public schools. In 1569
                    he was one of the proctors of the university, and for some time after officiated
                    as public orator. Quitting Oxford in 1576, he made the tour of Europe; and on
                    returning to his college after four years absence he applied himself to
                    historical and political studies. He became gentleman-usher to Queen Elizabeth;
                    and in 1585 he married Anne Ball, a widow lady of considerable fortune, whose
                    father, named Carew, was of Bristol. He was soon after sent as ambassador to the
                    king of Denmark, and to several German princes. He was next despatched on a
                    secret mission to France; and in 1588 he went as ambassador to the United
                    Provinces. On his return to England in 1597, finding his preferment obstructed
                    by the jarring interests of Burleigh and Essex, he retired from court, and could
                    never afterwards be prevailed on to accept of any public employment. He now
                    began the foundation of the Bodleian library; and soon after the accession of
                    King James I. he received the honour of knighthood. He died at his house in
                    London, January 28, 1612, and was buried in ths choir of Merton College chapel,
                    where a monument of black and white marble was erected to him, on which stands
                    his effigy in a scholar’s gown, surrounded with books. Sir Thomas wrote his own
                    life to the year 1609, which, with the first draught of the Statutes and his
                    Letters, has been published from the originals in the Bodleian library, by
