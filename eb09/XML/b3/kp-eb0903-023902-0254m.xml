                    All Saints, from which it takes its name, in 13° S. lat., and 38° 20' W. long.
                    Built partly along the foot and partly on the top of a steep hill, it consists
                    of an upper and lower town, communication between the two being effected by
                    large flights of steps, and since 1873 by a powerful hydraulic elevator. The
                    carrying of goods and passengers up and down these stairway-streets affords
                    employment to a large number of negro porters and chairmen. The lower town, or
                    Praya, consists mainly of one long and narrow street, with still narrower and
                    more. tortuous lanes. The houses are built of stone, and many of them are
                    several stories high. This is the business part of the city, where are situated
                    the quays, docks, warehouses, custom-houses, exchange, and arsenal; and here the
                    sailors, porters, and lower classes generally reside. The church of <hi
                    rend="italic">Nostra Senora da Praya</hi> is remarkable as having been built of
                    stones that were hewn in Lisbon and shipped across the ocean. The upper city has
                    wide and well-paved streets, open squares, and pleasant promenades, adorned with
                    orange trees and bananas. The most important is the <hi rend="italic">Passeio
                    Publico,</hi> which was opened in 1814, and overlooks the beautiful bay. There
                    is no city in Brazil that can vie with Bahia in the number and splendour of its
                    ecclesiastical buildings, among which the Jesuits’ college, now used as a
                    hospital, and the cathedral, which is built of marble, are pre-eminent. There
                    are likewise numerous educational institutions, including a lyceum (in which
                    Latin, Greek, French, and English, mathematics, philosophy, &amp;c., are
                    taught), a theological seminary, and a medical academy, which is supported by
                    the imperial Government, and has about 400 students. The museum and public
                    library also deserve mention. Among the buildings connected with the civic and
                    commercial activity of the city are the government-house, the court-house, the
                    mint, and the town-house; also the <hi rend="italic">Alfandega,</hi> where all
                    foreign importations have to be entered, and the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Consolado,</hi> where all native productions are registered for exportation.
                    There are likewise a number of banks and commercial associations of various
                    kinds. Bahia has long been a place of great traffic. The streets of the upper
                    city are very inconveniently paved, but the city and its suburbs are now
                    connected by street railways, two running in the upper town and one in the
                    lower. Bomsim is the name of the northern suburb, and Victoria that of the
                    southern; the foreign merchants for the most part reside in the latter. The
                    commerce principally consists in the exportation of cotton, coffee, sugar, rum,
                    tobacco, and rosewood, and the importation of miscellaneous foreign goods. The
                    value of the imports in 1870 was £1,671,676, of which £885,206 belonged to
                    Britain. The exports of the same year were valued at £1,790,928. The bay is one
                    of the finest in America, and is well defended by forts. The entrance is
                    protected by the large island of Itaparica, which has upwards of 16,000
                    inhabitants, of whom more than 7 000 are collected in the town of San Gonzalo. A
                    large number of these are employed in the whale-fishery, which has greatly
                    fallen off, however, from its former prosperity.</p>
                <p>Bahia was visited in 1503 by Amerigo Vespucci. The first settlement was founded
                    and called San Salvador by Diego Alvarez Correa, who had been shipwrecked on the
                    coast; but the Portuguese governor who gave formal existence to the city was
                    Thomas de Souza, who landed in 1549. It owed its increase to the Jesuits, who
                    defended it against the English in 1588. In 1623 it fell into the hands of the
                    Dutch, who held it for two years. In 1823 it was surrendered by the Portuguese
                    to the Brazilian nationality. A revolution, which broke out in the city in 1837,
                    was suppressed by the imperial Government. The <pb break="no"

                    the first sugar-mill in 1823. In 1858 railway communication was established to
                    Joazeiro.</p>
