                    celebrated chemist, was born, in 1728, at Bordeaux, where his father—a native of
                    Belfast, but of Scottish descent—was engaged in the wine trade. He was educated
                    from his twelfth to his eighteenth year at a grammar school in Belfast, whence
                    he removed, in 1746, to the university of Glasgow. There he chose medicine as
                    his profession, and devoted himself earnestly to physical science, being
                    encouraged and guided by Dr Cullen, who then lectured on chemistry in Glasgow,
                    and whose liberal and original views were in unison with Black’s own
                    aspirations. From assisting in Cullen’s chemical experiments he acquired the
                    delicate manipulative skill essential to success in original scientific
                    research.</p>
                <p>In 1751 he went to complete his medical studies at Edinburgh, and after taking
                    his medical degree there in 1754 revealed himself as a great scientific
                    discoverer. At that time the causticity of the alkalies was attributed to their
                    absorbing an imaginary fire-essence known as phlogiston, an hypothesis which
                    Black overthrew by showing that their causticity depended on their combining
                    with a ponderable gas, carbonic acid, which he named <hi rend="italic">fixed
                    air,</hi> meaning that it was found not only as a separate fluid, but as <hi
                    rend="italic">fixed</hi> in solid bodies. This discovery, made by Black in his
                    twenty-fourth year, was first sketched in a treatise, <hi rend="italic"
                    >De</hi><hi rend="italic">Acido e Cibis orto, et</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >de</hi><hi rend="italic">Magnesia,</hi> and afterwards embodied in his work,
                    <hi rend="italic">Experiments on Magnesia, Quicklime, and other Alkaline
                    Substances,</hi> which Lord Brougham has declared to be “incontestibly the most
                    beautiful example of strict inductive investigation since the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Optics</hi> of Sir Isaac Newton.”</p>
                <p>These works revolutionized chemistry. Previous investigators imagined that
                    atmospheric air was the sole permanently aeriform element, a belief to which
                    even Hales, who had shown that solids contain elastic fluids, had adhered. But
                    when Black proved that a gas not identical with atmospheric air was found in
                    alkalies, it was made plain <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit03newyrich/page/n812/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0903-0812-0795"/> that various dissimilar gases might exist, and
                    pneumatic chemistry was founded.</p>
                <p>Although the full value of this discovery was not immediately visible, it added
                    so greatly to Black’s reputation that in 1756 he was chosen to succeed Dr Cullen
                    as lecturer on chemistry in Glasgow University. He was also appointed to the
                    chair of anatomy, but, not finding its duties congenial, exchanged it for the
                    professorship of medicine. For some time he was so assiduous in preparing his
                    lectures as to neglect fresh investigations, and even left the examination of
                    carbonic acid, or <hi rend="italic">fixed air,</hi> to be afterwards completed
                    by Cavendish. He was highly esteemed as a professor by his students and
                    colleagues, and became, through his attention and urbanity, a very popular
                    physician in Glasgow. From 1759 to 1763 he prosecuted inquiries resulting in his
                    theory of <hi rend="italic">latent heat,</hi> which may be thus summarized—A
                    solid liquefies or a fluid vaporizes through heat uniting with the solid or
                    fluid body, and a fluid solidifies or a gas liquefies through the loss of heat;
                    but in no case is this increase or diminution of heat detected by the senses or
                    the thermometer.· Black therefore named that heat <hi rend="italic">latent</hi>
                    which alters the condition, not the temperature, of a body. He likewise proved
                    that bodies of equal masses require different increments of heat to raise them
                    to the same sensible temperature—a doctrine now known as the law of <hi
                    rend="italic">specific heat.</hi></p>
                <p>His theory of latent heat he corroborated by numerous experiments, but he never
                    published a detailed account of it, in omission which enabled others to lay
                    claim to his great discovery. Thus M. Deluc, in 1788, declared himself its
                    author. In 1766 Black was elected to succeed Cullen in the chair of chemistry at
                    Edinburgh University. In this office he bestowed great care on his lectures,
                    striving to give a lucid exposition of ascertained facts rather than to effect
                    new discoveries; and such an interest did he communicate to his subject, that
                    chemistry was for a time, it is said, regarded as a fashionable accomplishment
                    in the Scottish capital.</p>
                <p>He was intimate with the great men who adorned Edinburgh society during the
                    second half of the eighteenth century, counting among his friends Watt, Hume,
                    Robertson, Hutton, Adam Smith, and, at a later period, Robison, Playfair, and
                    Dugald Stewart. His constitution had always been feeble, and he was ultimately
                    reduced to the condition of a valetudinarian, which may account for the
                    indifference he manifested during his latter years to original research. He
                    retired from his professorship in 1796, and on the 26th November 1799 passed
                    away so quietly that a cup of water, which he had held in his hand, remained
                    unspilled after he had breathed his last. At the instance of Lavoisier he had
                    been elected a member of the Paris Academy of Sciences.</p>
                <p>Black was singularly modest, gentle, and sincere; his philosophic tranquillity
                    was seldom ruffled; and his sagacious diffidence was equally conspicuous in his
                    scientific inquiries and in his social relations. He has been called the founder
                    of modern chemistry. When he began his career that branch of knowledge had only
                    recently been raised to the rank of a true science through the efforts of
                    Hermann Boerhaave, and was in many quarters even regarded with suspicion as
                    being akin to alchemy on the one hand, and to humble trades on the other. But
                    after Black’s discoveries its scope and capabilities were immensely extended,
                    and no one could then question its claim to rank with the most important
                    sciences. The only works of his which appeared in print during his lifetime were
                    <hi rend="italic">Experiments on Magnesia,</hi> &amp;c., <hi rend="italic"
                    >Observations on the more ready Freezing of JVater that has been boiled,</hi>
                    and <hi rend="italic">Analysis of the Waters of some Boiling Springs in
                    Iceland.</hi></p>
                <p>His lectures on chemistry were issued after his death. <hi rend="italic"
