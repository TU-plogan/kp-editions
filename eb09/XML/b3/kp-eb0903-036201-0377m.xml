                    was Khizr, but he was afterwards called by the sultan <hi rend="italic"
                    >Khair-ed-deen,</hi> meaning “one good in the faith,” which was corrupted by the
                    Christians into Hayraddin. The brothers early betook themselves to piracy; and
                    after various successes and reverses, they acquired sufficient wealth and renown
                    to enable them to fit out a small fleet with which they ravaged the shores of
                    the Mediterranean, and became the pests of that sea. A richly laden vessel which
                    they presented to the sultan at Constantinople procured for them honorary
                    caftans and recognition of their services. About the year 1516, after having
                    been for some time in the service of the bey of Tunis, they began to acquire
                    considerable possessions on the coast of Africa. Hayraddin seized the island of
                    Shershel, and Aruch gained a footing in Algiers. The latter began to extend his
                    conquests into the district of Telmessan or Tlemcen, and was resisted by the
                    Arabs, who summoned the Spaniards of Oran to their assistance. Aruch fell in
                    battle in 1518, and w as succeeded at Algiers by Hayraddin, who, after the
                    reigning prince, Selim, was removed (in what way is somewhat doubtful),
                    consolidated his power by placing himself under the Sublime Porte. Solyman, who
                    was delighted at obtaining so much territory at such a small cost, conferred
                    upon Hayraddin the title of <hi rend="italic">Begler-l&gt;eg</hi> of Algiers.
                    The power of the pirates rapidly increased; Algeciras, a small island opposite
                    Algiers, was taken from the Spaniards after an obstinate resistance, and was
                    united with the mainland by a mole. The coasts of the Mediterranean were
                    completely at the mercy of Barbarossa, who carried off immense numbers of
                    slaves. In 1533, when Solyman was about to make war upon his great rival,
                    Charles V., Hayraddin joined him with a number of ships. He was received with
                    great honour, and made admiral <hi rend="italic">(caι&gt;itan-pashd)</hi> of the
                    fleet. His greatest exploit was the capture of Tunis, in which he obtained a
                    footing by adopting the cause of a rival prince. As soon as he had deposed Muley
                    Hassan, the reigning sovereign, he seized the town for himself and held it
                    despite the resistance of the people. Charles V., however, sent out a great
                    fleet, under Andrea Doria, who retook the town after a protracted siege.
                    Barbarossa escaped to Algiers, collected his fleet, and again swept the seas. He
                    plundered the coasts of Italy, captured Castelnuova, and inflicted a severe
                    defeat on Doria. He died at Constantinople 4th July 1546. (See Von Hammer, <hi
