                    jurisdiction of the Chief Commissioner of the Central Provinces, situated
                    between 20° and 22° N. lat., and 79° and 81° E. long. It is bounded on the N. by
                    the districts of Seonf and Bâlâghât, on the E. by the district of Râipur, on the
                    S. by the district of Chândâ, and on the W. by the district of Nagpur. To the
                    north, north-east, and east, a natural boundary line is marked out by lofty
                    hills, inhabited by Gonds and other aboriginal tribes, while the west and
                    north-west are comparatively open. Small branches of the Sâtpurâ range make
                    their way into the interior of the district. The Ambagarh, or Sendurjhari hills,
                    which skirt the south of the Chandpur parganâ, have an average height of between
                    300 and 400 feet above the level of the plain. The other elevated tracts are the
                    Balâhi hills, the Kanheri hills, and the Nawegâon hills. The Waingangâ is the
                    principal river in the district, and the only stream that does not dry up in the
                    hot weather,—its affluents within the district being the Bâwanthari, Bâghnadi,
                    Kanhân, and Chulban. There are 3648 small lakes and tanks in Bhandârâ district,
                    whence it is called the “lake region of Nâgpur;” they afford ample means of
                    irrigation. More than one-third of the district lies under jungle, which yields
                    gum, medicinal fruits and nuts, edible fruits, lac, honey, and the blossoms of
                    the <hi rend="italic">mdhua</hi> tree <hi rend="italic">(Bassia</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">latifolia)</hi>, which are eaten by the poorer classes, and used
                    for the manufacture of a kind of spirit. Tigers, panthers, deer, wild hogs, and
                    other wild animals abound in the forests, and during the rainy season many
                    deaths occur from snake-bites.</p>
                <p>Bhandârâ district contains an assessed area of 3148*61 square miles, or 2,015,114
                    acres, of which 819,922 acres were under cultivation in 1869; 30,845 acres,
                    grazing lands; 550,922 acres, cultivable but not under cultivation; and 613,425
                    acres uncultivable waste. The census of 1872 gave the total area of the district
                    at 3922 square miles, and returned the population at 564,819 (144 to the square
                    mile), residing in 106,121 houses and 1589 villages. Of the total population,
                    472,151, or 83*60 per cent., were Hindus; 10,696, or 1*89 per cent., Mahometans;
                    520 Buddhists or Jains; 61 Christians; and 81,379, or 14*41 per cent., were
                    aboriginal tribes of unspecified religion. The Hindu population is chiefly
                    divided into the following castes:—Brahmans, “Pardesis,” or foreigners
                    (generally Rajputs), Ponwârs, Lodhis, Kunbis, Koris, KalaJs, Telis, Dhimars,
                    Koshtis, Goârâs, and Dhers. The inhabitants are rude and unpolished in their
                    manners, and slothful in their habits. The agricultural products of the district
                    consist of rice, wheat, grain, pulses, peas, sugar-cane, oil-seeds, and cotton;
                    the following being an estimate of the acreage under different crops :— rice,
                    543,019 acres; wheat, 86,064; other food grains, 147,982; oil-seeds, 27,068;
                    sugar-cane, 12,561; fibres, 197; tobacco, 558; and vegetables, 2128 acres—total,
                    819,477 acres, or 1280*43 square miles. Iron is the chief mineral product. Gold
                    is also found in the bed of the Son Nadi, but does not repay the trouble of
                    searching for it. Laterite, shale, and sandstone occur all over the district—
                    the largest quarries being near Bhandârâ town, at Korambi, and in the Balâhi
                    hills. Native cloth, brass wrres, pot-stone wares, cartwheels, straw and reed
                    baskets, and a small quantity of silk, form the only manufactures of the
                    district. Cotton, salt, wheat, rice, oil-seeds, hardware, English piece goods,
                    tobacco, silk, dyes, and cattle, are its chief articles of import; and country
                    cloth, tobacco, and hardware its exports. The Great Eastern Road is the only
                    well-raised, bridged, and metalled road in the district; but there are also five
                    or six second-class roads, unmetalled and unbridged, but levelled, and sloped at
                    the crossings of water-courses. The revenue demand for 1868-69 amounted to
                    £40,296, 8s. from land, £5592, 2s. from excise, £3774, 18s. from stamps, £2553,
                    10s. from forests, £5051, 10s. from assessed taxes—total, £57,268, 8s. The
                    regular police force of 442 men was maintained in 1868 at a cost of £5584,10s.,
                    exclusive of the village watch. In 1868 the district contained 38 Government and
                    78 private schools, affording instruction to 7109 boys and 215 girls. Four towns
                    have upwards of 5000 inhabitants: (1.) Bhandarâ—population, 11,433; municipal
                    income, £486; expenditure, £645,6s.; rate of taxation, 10⅛d. per head; (2.)
                    Tumsal—population, 7367; municipal income, £1305; expenditure, £554, 10s.; rate
                    of taxation, 3s. 6⅛d. per head; (3.) Mohâxf— population, 6183; municipal
                    revenue, £198; expenditure, £244, 2s.; rate of taxation, 7fd. per head; (4.)
                    Pauni—population, 8976; municipal revenue, £174,10s.; expenditure, £233,18s.;
                    rate of taxation, 4|d. per head. Bhandârâ district contains 25 semi-independent
                    chiefships, having an area of 1509 square miles, and a population of 166,005
                    souls in 1866. These little states are exempted from the revenue system, and
                    only paya light tribute. Their territory, however, is included within the
                    returns of area and population above given. The climate of Bhandârâ is
                    unhealthy,—the prevailing diseases being fever, small-pox, and cholera. Nothing
                    is known of the early history of the district. Tradition says that at a remote
                    period a tribe of men, called the Gaulis or Gaulars, overran and conquered it.
                    At the end of the 17th century it belonged to the Gond Râjâ of Deogarh. In 1738
                    it was conquered by the Marhattâs, who governed it till the year 1854, when it
                    lapsed to the British Government, the Râjâ of Nâgpur having died without an
                    heir.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Bhandaea,</hi> the principal town and headquarters of the
                    district of the same name, is situated on the Waingangâ, about 38 miles east of
                    Nâgpur. The town is kept neat and clean, is well drained, and is considered
                    healthy. In 1872 it contained a total population of 11,433 souls, of whom 9657
                    were Hindus, 1450 Mahometans, 58 Buddhists and Jains, 54 Christians, and 214 of
                    unspecified religion. For income, &amp;c., see above. The town enjoys a
                    considerable trade in cotton cloth and the local hardware.</p>
