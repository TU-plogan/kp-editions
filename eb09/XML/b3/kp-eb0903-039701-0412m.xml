                <p><label type="entry">BARROWS</label>. The custom of constructing barrows, or
                    mounds of stones or earth, over the remains of the dead was the most
                    characteristic feature of the sepulchral systems of primitive times. Originating
                    in the common sentiment of humanity, which desires by some visible memorial to
                    honour and perpetuate the memory of the dead, it was practised alike by nations
                    of high and of low development, and continued through all the stages of culture
                    that preceded the introduction of Christianity. The primary idea of sepulture
                    appears to have been the provision of a habitation for the dead; and thus, in
                    its perfect form, the barrow included a chamber or chambers where the tenant was
                    surrounded with all the prized possessions of his previous life. A common
                    feature of the earlier barrows is the enclosing fence, which marked off the site
                    from the surrounding ground. When the barrow was of earth, this was usually
                    effected by an encircling trench or a low <hi rend="italic">vallum.</hi> When
                    the barrow was a stone structure, the enclosure w as usually a circle of
                    standing stones. Sometimes, instead of a chamber formed above ground, the barrow
                    covered a pit excavated under the original surface, in which the interments had
                    been made. In later times the mound itself was frequently dispensed with, and
                    the interments made under the natural surface, within the enclosure of a trench,
                    a <hi rend="italic">vallum,</hi> or a circle of standing stones. Usually the
                    great barrows occupy conspicuous sites; but in general the external form is no
                    index to the internal construction, and gives no absolute indication of the
                    nature of the sepulchral usages. Thus, while the long barrow is characteristic
                    of the Stone Age, it is impossible to tell without direct examination whether it
                    may bo chambered or unchambered, or -whether the burials within it may be those
                    of burnt or of unburnt bodies.</p>
                <p>In England the long barrow usually contains a single chamber, entering by a
                    passage underneath the higher and wider end of the mound. In Denmark the
                    chambers are at irregular intervals along the body of the mound, and have no
                    passages leading into them. The long barrows of Great Britain are often from 200
                    to 400 feet in length by GO to 80 feet wide. Their chambers are rudely but
                    strongly built, with dome-shaped roofs, formed by overlapping the successive
                    courses of the upper part of the side walls. In Scandinavia, on the other hand,
                    such dome-roofed chambers are unknown, and the construction of the chambers as a
                    rule is megalithic, five or six monoliths supporting a capstone of enormous
                    size. Such chambers denuded of the covering mound, or over which no covering
                    mound has been raised, are popularly known in England as “cromlechs” and iι <hi
                    rend="superscript"> r</hi> France as “dolmens.” The prevailing mode of sepulture
                    in all the different varieties of these structures is by the deposit of the body
                    in a contracted position, accompanied by weapons and implements of stone,
                    occasionally by ornaments of gold, jet, or amber. Vessels of clay, more or less
                    ornate in character, which occur with these early interments of unburnt bodies,
                    are regarded as food vessels and drinking cups, differing in character and
                    purpose from the cinerary urns of the Cremation Period in which the ashes of the
                    dead were deposited.</p>
                <p>The custom of burning the body commenced in the Stone Age before the long barrow
                    or the cromlech, with their contracted burials, had passed out of use. While
                    cremation is rare in the long barrows of the south of England, it is the rule in
                    those of Yorkshire and the north of Scotland. In Ireland, where the long barrow
                    form is all but unknown, the round barrow. or chambered cairn, prevailed from
                    the earliest Pagan period till the introduction of Christianity. The Irish
                    barrows occur in groups in certain localities, which seem to have been the royal
                    cemeteries of the tribal confederacies, whereof eight are enumerated in an
                    ancient Celtic manuscript on Pagan cemeteries. The best known of these was the
                    burial-place of the kings of Tara. It is situated on the banks of the Boyne
                    above Drogheda, and consists of a group of the largest cairns in Ireland. One of
                    these, at New Grange, is a huge mound of stones and earth, over 300 feet in
                    diameter at the base, and 70 feet in height. Around its base are the remains of
                    a circle of large standing stones. The chamber, which is 20 feet high in the
                    centre, is reached by a passage 70 feet in length. (See illustration, vol. ii.
                    p. 384.)</p>
                <p>As in the case of the long barrows, the traditional form <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit03newyrich/page/n413/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0903-0413-0398"/> of the circular chambered barrows was retained
                    through various changes in the sepulchral customs of the people, and we find it
                    used both in connection with burnt and with unburnt burials. It was the natural
                    result of the practice of cremation, however, that it should induce a
                    modification of the barrow structure. The chamber, no longer regarded as a
                    habitation to be tenanted by the deceased, became simply a cist for the
                    reception of the urn which held his ashes. The degradation of the chamber
                    naturally produced a corresponding degradation of the mound which covered it,
                    and the barrows of the Bronze Age, in which cremation was the rule, are smaller
                    and less imposing than those of the Stone Age, but often surprisingly rich in
                    the relics of the life and of the art workmanship of the time. In addition to
                    the varied and beautiful forms of implements and weapons,—frequently ornamented
                    with a high degree of artistic taste,—armlets, coronets, or diadems of solid
                    gold, and vases of elegant form and ornamentation in gold and bronze, are not
                    uncommon. The barrows of the Bronze Period, like some of those of the Stone Age,
                    appear to have been used as tribal or family cemeteries. In Denmark as many as
                    seventy deposits of burnt interments have been observed in a single mound,
                    indicating its use as a burying-place throughout a long succession of years.</p>
                <p>In the early Iron Age there was a partial return to the more massive construction
                    of the earlier periods. Sometimes chambers are found formed of timber instead of
                    stones, in which the bodies were deposited unburnt, although the custom of
                    cremation was largely continued. In Scandinavia both of these modes of sepulture
                    lingered till the close of the Pagan time. One of the latest examples of the
                    great timber-chambered barrow is that at Jellinge in Jutland, known as the
                    barrow of Thyre Danebod, queen of King Gorm the Old, who died about the middle
                    of the 10th century. It is a mound about 200 feet in diameter, and over 50 feet
                    in height, containing a chamber 23 feet long, 8 feet wide, and 5 feet high,
                    formed of massive slabs of oak. Though it had been entered and plundered in the
                    Middle Ages, a few relics, overlooked by its original violators, were found when
                    it was recently reopened, among which were a silver cup, ornamented with the
                    interlacing work characteristic of the time, and some personal ornaments. It is
                    highly illustrative of the tenacity with which the ancient sepulchral usages
                    were retained even after the introduction of Christianity that King Harald, son
                    and successor of Gorm the Old, who is said to have Christianized all Denmark and
                    Norway, followed the Pagan custom of erecting a chambered tumulus over the
                    remains of his father, on the summit of which was placed a rude pillar-stone,
                    bearing on one side the memorial inscription in Runes, and on the other a
                    representation of the Saviour of mankind distinguished by the crossed nimbus
                    surrounding the head. The Kings’ Hows at Upsala in Sweden rival those of
                    Jellinge in size and height. In the chamber of one of them, which was opened in
                    1829, there was found an urn full of calcined bones; and along with it were some
                    ornaments of gold showing the characteristic workmanship of the 5th and 6th
                    centuries of the Christian era. Along with the calcined human bones were bones
                    of animals, among which those of the horse and the dog were distinguished. In
                    much earlier times the favourite horse or dog of the deceased was frequently
                    deposited in Etruscan tombs, and the custom continued in Northern Europe until
                    cremation, and the barbarous rites which usually accompanied it, were abolished
                    by the stringent prohibitions of the Christian church.</p>
                <p>Comparing the results of the researches in European barrows with such notices of
                    barrow-burial as may be gleaned from early writings, we find them mutually
                    illustrative.</p>
                <p>The Homeric account of the building of the barrow of Hector (77. xxiv.) brings
                    vividly before us the scene so often suggested by the examination of the tumuli
                    of prehistoric times. During nine days wood was collected and brought, in carts
                    drawn by oxen, to the site of the funeral pyre. Then the pyre was built and the
                    body laid upon it. After burning for twenty-four hours the smouldering embers
                    were extinguished with libations of wine. The white and calcined bones were then
                    picked out of the ashes by the friends and placed in a metallic urn, which was
                    deposited in a hollow grave, or cist, and covered over with large wellfitting
                    stones. Finally, a barrow of great magnitude was heaped over the remains, and
                    the funeral feast was celebrated. The obsequies of Achilles, as described in the
                    <hi rend="italic">Odyssey,</hi> were also celebrated with details which are
                    strikingly similar to those observed in tumuli both of the Bronze and Iron Ages.
                    The body was brought to the pile in an embroidered robe, and jars of unguents
                    and honey were placed beside it. Sheep and oxen were slaughtered at the pile.
                    The incinerated bones were collected from the ashes and placed in a golden urn
                    along with those of Patroclus, Achilles’s dearest friend. Over the remains a
                    great and shapely mound was raised on the high headland, so that it might be
                    seen from afar by future generations of men.</p>
                <p>Herodotus, describing the funeral customs of the Scythians, states that, on the
                    death of a chief, the body was placed upon a couch in a chamber sunk in the
                    earth and covered with t imber, in which were deposited all things needful for
                    the comfort of the deceased in the other world. Ono of his wives was strangled
                    and laid beside him, his cupbearer and other attendants, his charioteer, and his
                    horses, were killed and placed in the tomb, which was then filled up with earth,
                    and 'an enormous mound raised high over all. The barrows which cover the plains
                    of ancient Scythia attest the truth of this description. A Siberian barrow,
                    described by Demidoff, contained three contiguous chambers of unhewn stone. In
                    the central chamber lay the skeleton of the ancient chief, with his sword, his
                    spear, his bow, and a quiver full of arrows. The skeleton reclined upon a sheet
                    of pure gold, extending the whole length of the body, which had been wrapped in
                    a mantle broidered with gold and studded with precious stones. Over it was
                    extended another sheet of pure gold. In a smaller chamber at the chief’s head
                    lay the skeleton of a female, richly attired, extended upon a sheet of pure
                    gold, and similarly covered with a sheet of the same metal. A golden chain
                    adorned her neck, and her arms were encircled with bracelets of pure gold. In a
                    third chamber, at the chief’s feet, lay the skeleton of his favourite horse with
                    saddle, bridle, and stirrups.</p>
                <p>So curiously alike in their general features were the sepulchral usages connected
                    with barrow-burial over the whole of Europe, that we find the Anglo-Saxon Saga
                    of Beowulf describing the chambered tumulus with its gigantic masonry “held fast
                    on props with vaults of stone,” and the passage under the mound haunted by a
                    dragon, the guardian of the treasures of heathen gold which it contained.
                    Beowulf’s own burial is minutely described in terms which have a strong
                    resemblance to the parallel passages in the <hi rend="italic">Iliad</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">Odyssey.</hi> There is first the preparation of the pile, which is
                    hung round with helmets, shields, and coats of mail. Then the corpse is brought
                    and laid in the midst; the pile is kindled, and the roaring flame rises, mingled
                    with weeping, till all is consumed. Then, for ten long days, the λvarriors
                    labour at the rearing of his mighty mound on the headland, high and broad, to be
                    seen afar by the passers by on land and sea.</p>
                <p>The pyramids of Egypt, the mausolea of the Lydian kings, the sepulchres of the
                    Atreidae at Mycenae, and tho Etruscan tombs at Caere and Volci, are lineally
                    descended <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit03newyrich/page/n414/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0903-0414-0399"/> from the chambered barrows of prehistoric times,
                    modified in construction according to the advancement of architectural art at
                    the period of their erection. There is no country in Europe destitute of more or
                    less abundant proofs of the almost universal prevalence of barrow-burial in
                    early times. It can be traced on both sides of the basin of the Mediterranean,
                    in Northern Africa, and in Asia Minor, across the plains of Mesopotamia, in the
                    valley of Cabul, and throughout Western India. But more extended research in the
                    archaeology of these vast regions is needed to enable U3 to correlate their
                    ancient remains with those of the European continent.</p>
                <p>In the New World as well as in the Old, the same customs prevailed over vast
                    areas from a very remote period. In the great plains of North America the dead
                    were buried in barrows of enormous magnitude, which occasionally present a
                    remarkable similarity to the long barrows of Great Britain. In these mounds
                    cremation appears more frequently than inhumation; and both are accompanied by
                    implements, weapons, and ornaments of stone and bone. The pottery accompanying
                    the remains is often elaborately ornamented, and the mound builders were
                    evidently possessed of a higher development of taste and skill than is evinced
                    by any of the modern aboriginal races, by whom the mounds and their contents are
                    regarded as utterly mysterious.</p>
                <p>It is not to be wondered at that customs so widely spread and so deeply rooted as
                    those connected with barrow-burial should have been difficult to eradicate. In
                    fact, compliance with the Christian practice of inhumation in the cemeteries
                    sanctioned by the church,was only enforced in Europe by capitularies denouncing
                    the punishment of death on those who persisted in burying their dead after the
                    Pagan fashion or in the Pagan mounds. Yet even in the Middle Ages kings were
                    buried with their swords and spears, and queens with their spindles and
                    ornaments; the bishop was laid in his grave with his crosier and comb, his
                    chalice and vestments; and clay vessels filled with charcoal (answering to the
                    urns of heathen times) are found with the interments in the churches of France
                    and Denmark.</p>
