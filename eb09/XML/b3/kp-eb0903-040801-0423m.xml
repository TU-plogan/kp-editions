                    those of Solothurn and Berne. The canton is traversed by the Jura chain, the
                    highest peaks of which rise to from 4000 to 5000 feet. With the exception of the
                    Rhine and its tributaries,—the Birse and the Ergolz,—there are no streams of any
                    magnitude. The soil is for the most part fertile and well cultivated, the
                    mountain sides affording excellent pasturage. The principal pursuits of the
                    people are agricultural and pastoral, though here and there, as at Liestal,
                    Sissach, and Münchenstein, coal-mining is carried on. The chief manufactures are
                    ribbons, woollen, linen, and cotton goods, and iron and steel wares. Politically
                    the canton consists of two divisions, one urban and the other rural (Basel-stadt
                    and Basel-landschaft), each with its own constitution and laws. The former sends
                    two members to the National Council; its legislative power is in the hands of a
                    Great Council which consists of 134 members, chosen for six years, and its
                    executive power belongs to a Lesser Council of 15 members. In the rural division
                    the legislative body (or <hi rend="italic">LandratK)</hi> is chosen for three
                    years, and has the ultimate authority over all departments; the executive
                    council consists of five members elected for the same period; it sends three
                    members to the National Council. The prevailing language is German. Population
                    of Basel-stadt in 1870, 47,760, and of Basel-landschaft, 54,721.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Basel,</hi> or <hi rend="smallcaps">Bâle,</hi> the capital
                    of the above canton, and, next to Geneva, the largest city in Switzerland, is
                    situated on both sides of the Rhine, 43 miles N. of Berne, in lat. 47° 33' N.,
                    and long. 7° 35' E. Great Basel, or the city proper, lies on the south side of
                    the river, and is connected with Little Basel on the north side by a handsome
                    bridge 800 feet long, which was originally erected in 1229. The city is
                    generally well-built, but there are fewer remarkable edifices than in many other
                    Continental cities of similar size. The fine old Gothic cathedral, founded 1010,
                    still standβ, and contains a number of interesting monuments, besides the tombs
                    of Erasmus, Oecolampadius, and other eminent persons. A re-decoration was
                    skilfully effected in 1852-1856. Among other ecclesiastical buildings of
                    interest may be mentioned St Martin’s, restored in 1851; St Alban’s, formerly a
                    monastery; the church of the Bare-footed Friars, which now serves as a
                    store-house; Elizabeth’s Church, of modern erection; and St Clara’s in Little
                    Basel. The town-hall was built in 1508 and restored in 1826. A post-office, a
                    new bank, and an hospital are of recent erection. Besides the university, which
                    was founded by Popo Pius II. in 1459, and reorganized in 1817, Basel possesses a
                    public library of 95,000 vols., with a valuable collection of MSS., a
                    picture-gallery, a museum, a theological seminary for missionaries (established
                    in 1816), a gymnasium, an industrial school, a botanical garden, an
                    orphan-asylum, an institution for deaf-mutes, and various learned societies. Of
                    these may be mentioned the Society for the Propagation of Useful Knowledge,
                    founded in 1777 by Iselin, the Society of Natural History, the Society of
                    National Antiquities, and the Bible Society, which dates from 1804 and was the
                    first of the kind on the Continent. Basel is the seat of an active transit-trade
                    between France, Germany, and Switzerland, and possesses important manufactures
                    of silk, linen, and cotton, as well as dyeworks, bleachfields, and ironworks,
                    the most valuable of all being the ribbon-trade. It has railway communication
                    with both south and north. The Baden line has a station in Little Basel; and the
                    central station for the Swiss and Alsace railways lies to the south-east of the
                    city proper. Basel was the birthplace of Euler, Bernouilli, Iselin, and perhap3
                    of Holbein; and the names of Erasmus, Oecolampadius, Grynaeus, Merian, De Wette,
                    Hagenbach, and Wecknernagel, are associated with the university. Population in
                    1870, 44,834.</p>
                <p>Basel <hi rend="italic">(Rasilia)</hi> first appears in the 4th century as a

                    10th century, and obtained a variety of privileges and rights. In 1356 the most
                    of its buildings were destroyed by an earthquake.</p>

                <p>In 1392 the town of Little Basel was acquired from the bishop by purchase. From
                    1431 to 1443 the meetings of a General Council were held in the city (see next
                    article). After the battle of St Jacob in 1444, in the immediate neighbourhood,
                    Basel was visited by the plague, and its population considerably diminished. In
                    1501 it became a member of the Swiss Confederacy; and it was one of the chief
                    seats of the Reformation movement. The position of the city exposed it to many
                    dangers during the Thirty Years’ War and the subsequent disturbances of the
                    neighbouring states; but in spite of all it continued to flourish. A peril of a
                    more critical kind arose from within. The quasi-aristocratic Government of the
                    city appropriated all political rights, and left the inhabitants of the rural
                    districts unrepresented,—which gradually led to much discontent on the part of
                    the latter, and ultimately to actual rebellion. It was not till 1833 that peace
                    was firmly restored by the complete separation of the canton into the two
                    divisions of <hi rend="italic">Basel-stadt</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >Basel-landschaft,</hi> the former being allowed to include not only the city
                    proper, but also the communes of Reihen, Bettingen, and Klein-Hiiningen. The
                    capital of the rural division is Liesthal, with (in 1870) a population of
                    3873.</p>
