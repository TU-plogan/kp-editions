                    and essential oil, in such proportions that the substance is in a viscous or
                    semi-fluid condition. The gradations from a solid resin to a limpid essential

                    exudation, only hardening by exposure to air. It has been proposed to limit the
                    name balsam to such substances as contain cinnamic or an analogous acid in
                    addition to the volatile oil and resin which turpentines contain alone; but this
                    distinction has not been carried out.</p>
                <p>The fragrant balsams which contain cinnamic or benzoic acid may, however, be
                    regarded as a distinct class, allied to each other by their composition,
                    properties, and uses. Those of this class found in commerce are the balsam of
                    Peru, balsam of Tolu, liquid storax, and liquidambar. <hi rend="italic">Balsam
                    of Peru</hi> is the produce of a lofty leguminous tree, <hi rend="italic"
                    >Myrospermum peruiferum,</hi> growing within a limited area in San Salvador,
                    Central America, but now introduced into Ceylon. It is a thick, viscid
                    oleo-resin of a deep brown or black colour and a fragrant balsamic odour. It has
                    been analysed by Kaehler, who thus states its percentage composition,—cinnamic
                    acid 46, resin 32, benzylic alcohol 20. It is used in perfumery, and in medicine
                    as a stimulant application to indolent sores, as well as internally for <pb

                    >Balsam, of Tolu</hi> is likewise produced from a species of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Myrospermum, Μ. toluiferum.</hi> It is of a brown colour, thicker than Peru
                    balsam, and attains a considerable degree of solidity on keeping. It also is a
                    product of equatorial America, but is found over a much wider area than is the
                    balsam of Peru. Tolu balsam consists of a combination of inodorous resin with
                    cinnamic acid, no benzoic acid being present in it. It is used in perfumery and
                    as a constituent in cough syrups and lozenges. <hi rend="italic">Liquid</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">storax</hi> is a balsam yielded by <hi rend="italic"
                    >Liquidambar</hi><hi rend="italic">orientalis,</hi> a native of Asia Minor. It
                    is a soft resinous substance, with a pleasing balsamic odour, especially after
                    it has been kept for some time. It contains a principle—styrol or cinnamene—to
                    which it owes its peculiar odour, besides cinnamic acid, stryacin, and a resin.
                    Liquid storax is used in medicine as an external application in skin diseases,
                    and internally as an expectorant. An analogous substance is derived from <hi
                    rend="italic">Liquidambar Altingia</hi> in Java. <hi rend="italic">Liquidambar
                    balsam,</hi> is derived from <hi rend="italic">Liquidambar styraciflua,</hi> a
                    tree found in the United States and Mexico. It contains cinnamic acid, but is
                    destitute of benzoic acid.</p>
                <p>Of balsams entirely destitute of cinnamic and benzoic constituents the following
                    are found in commerce :— <hi rend="italic">Mecca Balsam,</hi> or <hi

                    >Balsamodendron Berryi (B. gileadense</hi> of De Candolle), a tree growing in
                    Arabia and Abyssinia, is supposed to be the balm of Scripture and the <hi
                    rend="italic">βάλσαμον</hi> of Theophrastus. When fresh it is α viscid fluid,
                    with a penetrating odour, but it solidifies with age. It was regarded with the
                    utmost esteem among the nations of antiquity, and to the present day it is
                    peculiarly prized among the people of the East. <hi rend="italic">Balsam of
                    Copaiba</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Capivi</hi> is a fluid oleo-resin of a pale
                    brown or straw colour, produced from several trees of the genus <hi
                    rend="italic">Copaifera,</hi> growing in tropical America. It possesses a
                    peculiar odour and a nauseous persistent tarry taste. Balsam of copaiba contains
                    from 40 to 60 per cent, of essential oil, holding in solution a resin from which
                    capivic acid can be prepared. It is chiefly used in medicine for the treatment
                    of inflammatory affections of mucous surfaces. Under the name of JFo&lt;κZ <hi

                    rend="italic">turbinatus,</hi> which has the odour and properties of copaiba,
                    and is used for it in East Indian hospital practice. Wood oil is also used as a
                    varnish in India, and forms an effective protection against the attacks of white
                    ants. A substitute for copaiba is also found in the dark red balsam yielded by

                    >Abies balsamea</hi> is known in commerce as Balsam of Canada. It is a very
                    transparent substance, somewhat fluid when first run, but thickening
                    considerably with age, possessed of a delicate yellow colour, and a mild
                    terebinthous odour. According to Fliickiger and Hanbury it contains 24 per cent
                    of essential oil, 60 per cent, of resin soluble in alcohol, and 16 per cent, of
                    resin soluble only in ether. It has been used for the same purposes as copaiba,
                    but its chief uses are for mounting preparations for the microscope and as a
                    varnish.</p>
