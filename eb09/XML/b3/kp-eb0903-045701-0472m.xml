                    Ligny. As a youth he was distinguished for comeliness, affability of manner, and
                    skill in the tilt-yard. In 1494 he accompanied Charles VIII. into Italy, and was
                    knighted after the battle of Fornova, where he had captured a standard. Shortly
                    afterwards, entering Milan alone in pursuit of the enemy, he was taken prisoner,
                    but w as set free without a ransom by Ludovic Sforza. His powers and daring were
                    conspicuous in the Italian wars of this period. On one occasion it is said that,
                    single-handed, he made good the defence of a bridge over the Garigliano against
                    about 200 Spaniards, an exploit that brought him such renown that Pope Julius
                    II. sought to entice him into the Papal service, but unsuccessfully. The
                    captaincy of a company in the royal service was’given him in 1508, and the
                    following year he led a storming party at the siege of Brescia. Here his
                    intrepidity in first mounting the rampart cost him a severe wound, which obliged
                    his soldiers to carry him into a neighbouring house, the residence of a
                    nobleman, whose wife and daughters he protected from threatened insult. On his
                    recovery he declined a gift of 2500 ducats, with which they sought to reward
                    him. At this time his general was the celebrated Gaston de Foix, who acted
                    greatly in accordance with his advice, and, indeed, fell at the battle of
                    Ravenna through neglecting it. In 1513, when Henry VIII. of England routed the
                    French at the battle of the Spurs, Bayard, in trying to rally his countrymen,
                    found his escape cut off. Suddenly riding up to an English officer who was
                    resting unarmed, he summoned him to yield, and the knight complying, Bayard in
                    return gave himself up to his prisoner. He was taken into the English camp, but
                    on relating this gallant incident was immediately set free by the king without
                    ransom. On the accession of Francis I. in 1515 he was made lieutenant-general of
                    Dauphiné; and after the victory of Marignano, to which his valour largely
                    contributed, he had the honour of conferring knighthood on his youthful
                    sovereign. When war again broke out between Francis I. and Charles V., Bayard,
                    with 1000 men, held Mézières, a town which had been declared untenable, against
                    an army of 35,000, and after six weeks compelled Nassau to raise the siege. This
                    stubborn resistance saved Central France from invasion, as the king had not then
                    sufficient forces to withstand the imperialists. All France rang with the
                    achievement. Parliament thanked Bayard as the saviour of his country; the king
                    made him a knight of the order of St Michael, and commander in his own name of
                    100 gens d’armes, an honour till then reserved for princes of the blood. After
                    allaying a revolt at Genoa, and striving with the greatest assiduity to check a
                    pestilence in Dauphiné, Bayard was sent, in 1523, into Italy with Admiral
                    Bonivet, who, being defeated at Rebec, implored him to assume the command and
                    save the army. He repulsed the foremost pursuers, but in guarding the rear at
                    the passage of the Sesia was mortally wounded. He had himself placed against a
                    tree that he might die facing the <pb break="no"

                    pity for him, he replied, “My lord, I thank you, but pity is not for me, who die
                    a true man, serving my king; pity is for you who bear arms against your prince,
                    your country, and your oath.” He expired after repeating the <hi rend="italic"

                    Chivalry, deprived of fantastic extravagance, is perfectly mirrored in the
                    character of Bayard. He combined the merits of a skilful tactician with the
                    romantic heroism, piety, and magnanimity of the ideal knight-errant. Even
                    adversaries experienced the fascination of his virtues, and joined in the
                    sentiment that he was, as his contemporaries called him, “Le chevalier sans peur
                    et sans reproche.” <hi rend="italic">(Cf.</hi> Walford’s <hi rend="italic"
