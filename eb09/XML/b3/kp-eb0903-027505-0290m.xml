                <p><label type="entry">BALDUR</label>, one of the most interesting figures of the
                    Scandinavian mythology, was the son of Odin and Frigg. His name (from <hi
                    rend="italic">baldr,</hi> the foremost or pre-eminent one) denoted his supreme
                    excellence and beauty. In the <hi rend="italic">Gylfeginning</hi> we read that
                    he was so amiable that all loved him, so beautiful that a light seemed to shine
                    about him, and his face and hair were for ever refulgent. He was the mildest,
                    wisest, and most eloquent of the Aesir; and when he pronounced a judgment, it
                    was infallible. His dwelling was in Brejdablik (far-sight), where nothing impure
                    could come, and where the most obscure question could be explained. The
                    wonderful legend of his death is first dimly recorded in the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Voluspa,</hi> the grandest and most ancient of Eddaic poems, and more fully in
                    the younger Edda. Baldur was visited by evil dreams, and felt his life to be in
                    danger. His mother, Frigg, took oath of all thing3 in the world, animal,
                    vegetable, and mineral, that they should not slay her son. The gods being then
                    secure, found pastime in setting the good Baldur in their midst, and in shooting
                    or hurling stones at his invulnerable body. Then Loki, the evil god, took on him
                    the form of a woman and went to Frigg in Fensal. From Frigghe learned that of
                    all things in the earth but one could injure Baldur, and that was a little tree
                    westward from Valhal, that was too young to take the oath. Thither went Loki and
                    found the plant; it was the mistletoe. He plucked it up, fashioned it into an
                    arrow, and went back to the Aesir. They were still in a circle, shooting at
                    Baldur; and outside the ring stood the blind god Höder, of whom Loki asked
                    wherefore he did not shoot. When Höder had excused himself because of his
                    blindness, Loki offered to aim for him, and Höder, shooting the arrow of
                    mistletoe, Baldur suddenly fell, pierced and dead. No such misfortune had ever
                    yet befallen gods or men; there was long silence in heaven, and then with one
                    accord there broke out a loud noise of weeping. The Aesir dared not revenge the
                    deed, because the place was holy, but Frigg, rushing into their midst, besought
                    them to send one to Hel to fetch him back. Hel promised to let him go if all
                    things in heaven and earth were unanimous in wishing it to be so; but when
                    inquiry was made, a creature called Thökt was found <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit03newyrich/page/n291/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0903-0291-0276"/> in the cleft of a rock that said, “Let Hel keep
                    its booty.” This was Loki, and so Baldur came not back to Valhal. His death was
                    revenged by his son Vale, who, being only one night old, slew Höder; but Loki
                    fled from the revenge of the gods. In Baldur was personified the light of the
                    sun; in his death the quenching of that light in winter. In his invulnerable
                    body is expressed the incorporeal quality of light; what alone can wound it is
                    mistletoe, the symbol of the depth of winter. It is noticeable that the Druids,
                    when they cut down this plant with a golden sickle, did so to prevent it from
                    wounding Baldur again. According to the <hi rend="italic">Voluspa,</hi> Baldur
                    will return, after Ragnarök, to the new heavens and the new earth; so the sun
                    returns in spring to the renovated world. In the later versions it was no
                    ordinary season, but the Fimbul winter, which no summer follows, which Baldur’s
                    death prefigured. It must not be overlooked that the story of Baldur is not
                    merely a sun-myth, but a personification of that glory, purity, and innocence of
                    the gods which was believed to have been lost at his death, thus made the
                    central point of the whole drama of the great Scandinavian mythology. Baldur has
                    been also considered, in relation to some statements of Saxo Grammaticus, to
                    have been a god of peace, —peace attained through warfare; this theory has been
                    advanced by Weinhold with much ingenuity. Several myths have been cited as
                    paralleling the story of the death of Baldur; those of Adonis and of Persephone
                    may be considered as the most plausible. <hi rend="smallcaps">(e. w.
