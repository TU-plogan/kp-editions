                <p><label type="entry">BISON</label>, a genus of Ruminant Mammals belonging to the
                    family <hi rend="italic">Bovidoe,</hi> and comprising two widely separated
                    species—the European and American Bisons. They are distinguished from other
                    bovine animals by the greater breadth and convexity of their foreheads, superior
                    length of limb, and the longer spinal processes of the dorsal vertebrae, which,
                    with the powerful muscles attached for the support of the massive head, form a
                    protuberance or hump on the shoulders. The bisons have also fourteen pairs of
                    ribs, while the common ox has only thirteen. The forehead and neck of both
                    species are covered with long, shaggy hair of a dark brown colour; and in winter
                    the whole of the neck, shoulders, and hump are similarly clothed, so as to form
                    a “curly felted mane.” This mane in the European species disappears in summer;
                    but in the American Bison it is to a considerable extent persistent. The
                    European Bison <hi rend="italic">{Bison bonassus),</hi> or Aurochs of the
                    Germans, is the largest of existing European quadrupeds, measuring about 10 feet
                    long, exclusive of the tail, and standing nearly 6 feet high. Formerly it was
                    abundant throughout Europe, as is proved by its fossil remains found on the
                    Continent and in England, associated with those of the extinct mammoth and
                    rhinoceros. These remains, while indicating larger proportions in the ancient
                    aurochs than in those now living, do not, in Professor Owen’s opinion, exhibit
                    any satisfactory specific distinction. Caesar mentions the aurochs as abounding,
                    along with the now extinct <hi rend="italic">Bos</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >primigenius,</hi> in the forests of Germany and Belgium, where it appears to
                    have been occasionally captured, and afterwards exhibited alive in the Roman
                    amphitheatres. At that period, and long after, it seems to have been common
                    throughout Central Europe, the Caucasus, and the Carpathian Mountains. It is now
                    only found in one of the forests of Lithuania, where it is saved from immediate
                    extinction by the protection of the emperor of Russia, but notwithstanding this
                    it is gradually dying out. Many years ago the Lithuanian bisons numbered over
                    1000, but by the year 1872 they had diminished to 528, and all attempts to
                    domesticate them have failed. The aurochs feeds on grass and the bark of young
                    trees. The American Bison <hi rend="italic">{Bison amerixanus)</hi> has its home
                    on the eastern slopes of the Rocky Mountains, being seldom found to the west of
                    these, and rarely to the east of the Appalachian range. Northwards it extends to
                    lat. 63°, and southward as far as New Mexico. Those bisons or buffaloes, as the
                    settlers call them, roam in enormous herds over the western prairies in quest of
                    fresh pastures, being specially fond of the tender grass that springs up after a
                    prairie fire. The two sexes live in separate herds during the greater part of
                    the year, although one or two aged bulls, it is said, always accompany the
                    females. During the rutting season when the sexes come together, the bulls
                    engage in fierce fights among themselves, and at such seasons it is highly
                    dangerous to approach them. At other times they are shy, and retreat before man;
                    but when wounded they become furious, and then all the dexterity of the
                    practised hunter is needed to make good his retreat. The Indians capture them in
                    various ways; by hunting on horseback, and shooting them with bows and arrows,
                    or with fire-arms; by snaring them within immense enclosures of snow, which the
                    bisons are unable to overleap; or by attracting the herd towards a precipice,
                    and then setting it in motion from behind, so that those in front are pushed
                    irresistibly forward and over. The American Bison, though still found in
                    considerable numbers, is rapidly diminishing before the advance of the white
                    settler; and should man in the meantime not succeed in domesticating it, it will
                    probably ere long share the fate which threatens its European congener. To the
                    Indian the bison has hitherto been indispensable as an article of food, and for
                    the many useful purposes to which its horns, skin, and hair are applied. Its
                    hide forms an excellent fur wrapper; its great value in this respect was proved
                    during the Crimean war.</p>
