                    N. by Sondrio, E. by Tyrol and Brescia, S. by Cremona, and W. by Milan and Como.
                    The northern portion is mountainous and well wooded, while the southern belongs
                    to the alluvial plain of Lombardy. To the N. and W. of Lake Iseo there are
                    numerous mineral wells, the most important of which are those of Trescoro.
                    Marble is abundant in the mountains, and there are valuable iron mines. At an
                    early period the wealth of the capital appears to have been increased by the
                    working of copper mines in the district. (See Finazzi, <hi rend="italic">Sidle
                    antiche</hi><hi rend="italic">miniere</hi><hi rend="italic">di Bergamo,</hi>
                    Milan, 1860.) The vine and flax are largely grown, and the culture of the
                    silk-worm is extensively carried on. The people speak a rough dialect, and are
                    liable to be laughed at by the other Italians. The two stock characters of
                    popular Italian comedy, Harlequin or Truffaldino and the sly Brighella, were
                    both at one time represented as natives of the Bergamo district.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Bergamo,</hi> the capital of the above province, is situated
                    between the Brembo and Serio, two tributaries of the Adda, 39 miles N.E. of
                    Milan, on the railway that runs from Venice to the Lake of Como. It consists of
                    a new and an old town, the latter known as the <hi rend="italic">Città,</hi> or
                    city, being built on a hill, while the former, or <hi rend="italic"
                    >Borgo</hi><hi rend="italic">S. Leonardo,</hi> occupies the level ground below.
                    On the eastern side there are also two important suburbs, £. <hi rend="italic"
                    >Caterina</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Palazzo.</hi> Bergamo is the seat of a
                    bishop and a prefect, and possesses a school of art known as the Accademia
                    Carrara, a museum, a lyceum, a library contained in the Palazzo Vecchio or
                    Broletto, a musical institute, two theatres, and various scientific societies.
                    There are also a lunatic asylum, a hospital, and other charitable institutions.
                    Among its numerous churches may be mentioned S. Maria Maggiore, which dates from
                    1173, and the neighbouring Colleoni chapel, the old Arian church of San
                    Alessandro della Croce, S. Bartolommeo, and S. Grata. The principal objects of
                    industry in the city are silk, cotton, and woollen goods, iron-wares, waxcloth
                    and wax candles, and playing cards. A large fair, called the Fiera di S.
                    Alessandro, is annually held in the new town. It dates from the 10th century,
                    and is of great importance, especially for the silk trade. Bergamo, or <hi
                    rend="italic">Bergomum,</hi> was a municipal town during the Roman empire, and,
                    after being destroyed by Attila, became one of the most flourishing cities of
                    the Lombard kings, who made it the capital of a duchy. In the 15 th century it
                    was appropriated and fortified by the Venetians. In 1509 it was occupied by
                    Louis XII. of France, who retained it for seven years, and then restored it to
                    Venice. In 1796 the French again made themselves masters of the city, and
                    constituted it the capital of their department of Serio. Bergamo was the
                    birthplace of Tiraboschi, Rubini, and Donizetti. Population, 37,363.</p>
