                    modifications rendered necessary by the introduction of additional cards.</p>
                <p>In playing bézique, two packs of cards from which the twos, threes, fours, fives,
                    and sixes have been rejected, are shuffled together and used as one. The packs
                    should have backs similarly coloured or ornamented.</p>
                <p>The players cut for deal, and the highest bézique card deals. The cards rank as
                    follows :—Ace, ten, king, queen, knave, nine, eight, seven.</p>
                <p>The non-dealer cuts the pack to the dealer, who reunites the separated packets,
                    and deals three cards to his adversary, three to himself, then two to each, and
                    again three to each. The top card of those remaining (called the <hi
                    rend="italic">stock)</hi> is turned up for trumps. The stock is placed face
                    downwards between the players, and slightly spread. The players then take up the
                    cards dealt to them, and the non-dealer plays any card out of his hand, and the
                    dealer plays a card to it from his hand, the two cards thus played constituting
                    a <hi rend="italic">trick.</hi> There is no restriction as to the card to be
                    played; the second player need not follow suit, nor win the trick. If he wins
                    the trick by playing a higher card of the suit led, or a trump, the lead falls
                    to him. In case of ties the leader wins. Whoever wins the trick leads to the
                    next; but before playing again each player takes a card from the stock, and adds
                    it to his hand, the winner of the trick taking the top card of those face
                    downwards, and his adversary the next card. This alternate playing and drawing a
                    card each continues until the stock (including the trump card or card exchanged
                    for it, which is taken up last) is exhausted. The tricks remain face upwards on
                    the table, but must not be searched during the play of the hand.</p>
                <p>The 0bject3 of the play are—1. To promote in the hand various combinations of
                    cards, which when <hi rend="italic">declared</hi> entitle the holder to certain
                    scores; 2. To win aces and tens; 3. To win the so-called last trick.</p>
                <p>A declaration can only be made by the winner of a trick immediately after he has
                    won it, and before he draws from the stock. It is effected by placing the
                    declared cards (one of which at least must not have been declared before) face
                    upwards on the table. Declared cards are left face up on the table; but they
                    still form part of the hand, and can be led or played just as though they had
                    not been declared. A player is not bound to declare, although he may win a trick
                    and hold scoring cards. A card led or played cannot be declared. More than one
                    declaration may be made" to one trick, provided no card of one combination forms
                    part of another that is declared with it Thus four knaves and a marriage (see
                    table of scores) may be declared at the same time; but a player cannot declare
                    king and queen of spades and knave of diamonds together to score marriage and
                    bézique with those three cards. He must first declare one combination, say
                    bézique; and when he wins another trick he can score marriage by declaring the
                    king. A declaration cannot be made of cards that have already all been declared.
                    Thia, if four knaves (one being a bézique knave) and four queens (one being a
                    bézique queen) nave been declared, the knave and queen already declared cannot
                    be declared again as bézique. To score all the combinations with these cards,
                    after the knaves are declared and another trick won, bézique must next be made,
                    after which, on winning another trick, the three queens can be added, and four
                    queens scored. Again, if a sequence in trumps is declared, marriage of the king
                    and queen on the table cannot afterwards take place. To score both, the marriage
                    should be declared first, and after winning another trick the remaining sequence
                    cards should be added. Lastly, a card once declared can only be used again in
                    declaring in combinations of a different class. For example: the bézique queen
                    can be declared in bezique, marriage, and four queens; but having once been
                    declared in single bézique, she cannot form part of another single bézique;
                    having been married once, she cannot be married again; and having taken part in
                    one set of four queens, she cannot take part in another.</p>
                <p>The seven of trumps may bo either declared or exchanged for the turn-up after
                    winning a trick, and before drawing. When exchanged, the turn-up is taken into
                    the player’s hand, and the seven put in its place. The second seven is, of
                    course, declared, as it would be absurd to exchange one seven for another. A
                    seven when declared is not left on the table, but is simply shown.</p>

                    deduct 20 from the offender’s. The player with a card short must take two cards
                    at his next draw.</p>
                <p>If at any time during the play of the hand one player is found to hold nine
                    cards, the other having but eight, the adversary of the player with nine cards
                    may add 200 to his own score, or deduct 200 from the offender’s. The player with
                    nine cards must play to the next trick without drawing.</p>
                <p>There is no penalty at two handed bézique for exposing a card from the hand, or
                    for leading out of turn. At three or four handed bézique, a card exposed or led
                    out of turn must remain on the table, and nothing can be subsequently declared
                    in combination with it.</p>

                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Hints to Players.</hi> —The following hints, which merely
                    touch on the elements of the play, may assist the beginner :—</p>
                <p>The lead is, as a rule, disadvantageous. Therefore do not win the trick unless—(1
                    ) you want to declare; or (2) you wish to make an ace or ten of the suit led; or
                    (3) an ace or a ten is led which you desire to win.</p>
                <p>Sevens, eights, and nines in plain suits are valueless. In trumps they should be
                    kept to obtain the lead with. It is very important to keep one small tramp in
                    hand if possible. Knaves also are of but little value (except bézique and tramp
                    knaves), and may be thrown away freely.</p>
                <p>It is of more importance to win aces and tens or to make tricks with them than at
                    first sight appears. Experienced players prefer a number of small scores to
                    sacrificing them for the chance of a large one. Therefore it is not considered
                    good play as a rule to go for four aces unless you have three, and are in no
                    difficulty as to your play. Rather make tricks with the aces, and especially
                    capture tens with them. Whenever you are second player, and can win a trick with
                    a ten, take it, except in trumps, of which the ten is kept for sequence.</p>
                <p>When in difficulties, lead an ace or a ten in preference to a king or queen. As a
                    rule, if you try for aces, you have to sacrifice some other score, and are
                    pretty sure to lose some of the aces after declaring them.</p>
                <p>If driven to lead an ace or a ten, and your opponent does not win it, lead
                    another.</p>
                <p>Endeavour to recollect in what suits the aces and tens have been played, so that,
                    when leading, you may choose suits of which the most aces and tens are out.
                    Similarly, if your adversary declares aces, avoid leading the suits of the
                    declared aces; and, in discarding, retain those cards which are least likely to
                    be taken by aces and tens.</p>
                <p>Having a choice between playing a possible scoring card, or a small trump, or a
                    card that you have declared, generally play the last so as to conceal your
                    hand.</p>
                <p>Do not part with a sequence card early in the hand, even if you have a duplicate,
                    as playing it shows that you are likely to hold the duplicate, and you thus free
                    your opponent’s game, as he will immediately use his tramp sequence cards to win
                    all the aces and tens you lead.</p>
                <p>Also, do not part with bézique cards until near the end of the hand, even after
                    declaring bézique, because by so doing you give up all chance of double bézique.
                    If you draw or hold a third bézique card, sacrifice everything, even sequence
                    cards, for the chance of a double bézique.</p>
                <p>Avoid declaring combinations which show your adversary that he cannot make
                    sequence or double bézique. By keeping him in the dark you hamper his game, and
                    are very likely to cause him to refrain from tramping your aces or tens. For
                    example, if early in the hand you hold two trump queens and two bézique queens,
                    you should postpone declaring them as long as possible, or even sacrifice the
                    score altogether.</p>
                <p>You may often judge during the play of the hand what combinations your adversary
                    is going for. Thus, if he discards kings he is probably strong in queens, and
                    <hi rend="italic">vice versa.</hi> If in doubt as to whether you should keep
                    kings or queens, you of course choose the combination he is not trying for. With
                    attention and experience it is surprising how much may be inferred as to your
                    adversary’s game, and how greatly your own line of play may be thus
                    directed.</p>
                <p>It is as a rule right to win the last trick, in order to prevent the adversary
                    from declaring, for which purpose lead the ace of trumps. When within a few
                    tricks of the end of the hand, you may often prevent your opponent from scoring
                    sequence by leading out your hiσh t.ramDS,</p>
                <p>In playing the last eight tricks your object is simply to make as many aces and
                    tens as you can, and to win those of your adversary.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Polish</hi><hi rend="smallcaps">Bézique</hi> (also called
                    <hi rend="italic">Open</hi><hi rend="italic">Bézique</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >Fild∙ niski)</hi> differs from ordinary bézique in the following particulars :—
                    «</p>
                <p>Whenever a scoring card is played, the winner of the trick places it face upwards
                    in front of him (the same with both cards if two scoring cards are played to a
                    trick), forming rows of aces, kings, queens, knaves, and tramp tens (called <hi
                    rend="italic">open</hi> cards). Cards of tne same denomination are placed
                    overlapping one another lengthwise from the player towards his adversary to
                    economise space. When a scoring card is placed among the open cards, all the
                    sevens, eights, nines, and plain suit tens in the tricks are turned down. Open
                    cards cannot be played a second time, and can only be used in declaring. Whether
                    so used or not they remain face upwards on the table until the end of the hand,
                    including the last eight tricks. A player can declare after winning a trick and
                    before drawing again, when the trick won contains a card or cards, which added
                    to his open cards complete any combination that scores. Every declaration must
                    include a card played to the trick last won. Aces and tens must be scored as
                    soon as won, and not at the end of the hand. The seven of trumps can be
                    exchanged by the winner of the trick containing it; and if the tum-up card is
                    one that can be used in declaring, it becomes an open card when exchanged. The
                    seven of trumps when not exchanged is scored for by the player winning the trick
                    containing it.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Compound declarations</hi> are allowed, <hi rend="italic"
                    >i.e.,</hi> cards added to the open cards can at once be used, without waiting
                    to win another trick, in as many combinations of different classes as they will
                    form with the winner’s open cards. For example: A has three open kings, and he
                    wins a trick containing a king. Before drawing again he places the fourth king
                    with the other three, and s∞res 80 for kings. This is a simple declaration. But
                    suppose the card led was the queen of trumps, and A wins it with the king, and
                    he has the following open cards—three kings, three queens, and ace, ten, knave
                    of trumps. He at once declares royal marriage (40); four kings (80); four queens
                    (60); and sequence (250); and scores in all, 430. Again: ace of spades is turned
                    up, and ace of hearts is led. The second player has two open aces, and wins the
                    ace of hearts with the seven of trumps and exchanges. He scores for the
                    exchange, 10; for the ace of hearts, 10; for the ace of spades, 10; and adds the
                    aces to his open cards, and scores 100 for aces; in all, 130. If a declaration
                    or part of a compound declaration is omitted, and the winner of the trick draws
                    again, he cannot amend his score.</p>
                <p>The ordinary rule holds that a second declaration cannot be made of a card
                    already declared in the same class. Thus: a queen once married cannot be married
                    again; a fifth king added to four already declared does not entitle to another
                    score for kings.</p>
                <p>The fundamental point to be borne in mind is, that no declara tion can be
                    effected by means of cards held in the hand. Thus A having three open queens and
                    a queen in hand cannot add it to his open cards. He must win another trick
                    containing a queen, when he can declare queens.</p>
                <p>Declarations continue during the play of the last eight tricks just the same as
                    during the play of the other cards.</p>
                <p>The game is 2000 up. After each deal it is advisable to shuffle thoroughly;
                    otherwise a number of small cards will run together in the stock, and impair the
                    interest of the game. It is also advisable to adopt the change in the bézique
                    cards recommended for ordinary bézique, otherwise the scores of one hand may run
                    very high, and of the other very low, which spoils the game. The lead is even
                    more disadvantageous than at ordinary bézique. It is important not to lead cards
                    that can be won by bézique cards. It is often advisable to win with a high card
                    though able to win with a low one; thus having king, nine of a suit of which the
                    eight is led, if you w in the trick, you should take it with the king. It is not
                    of so much consequence to win aces and tens (especially the latter) as at
                    ordinary bézique. It is a difficult point in the game to decide whether to win
                    tricks with sequence cards, on the chance of eventually scoring sequence, or to
                    reserve trumps for the last eight tricks. As a rule, if the hand is well
                    advanced, and you are badly off in trumps, win tricks with sequence caιds, and
                    especially if you have duplicate sequence cards make them both. If badly off in
                    trumps towards the end of a hand, and your adversary may win double bézique,
                    keep in hand an ace or ten of the bézique suits, as when it comes to the last
                    eight tricks (in which suit must be followed), yen may prevent the score of
                    double bézique.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Grand</hi><hi rend="smallcaps">Bézique</hi> (also called <hi
                    rend="italic">Chinese</hi><hi rend="italic">Bézique)</hi> is played like
                    ordinary bézique, except as follows :—</p>
                <p>Four packs arc shuffled together and used as one, and nine cards are dealt to
                    each plaver, by three at a time to each. When a combination is declared,'and one
                    of the cards composing it is played away, another declaration can be completed
                    (after winning a trick) with the same cards. Thus: A declares four aces, and
                    uses one to win a trick, or throws one away. A has a fifth ace in hand and wins
                    a <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit03newyrich/page/n643/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0903-0643-0626"/> trick, he can add it to the three remaining
                    declared aces, and score four aces again, and so on. Marriages can be declared
                    over and over again; thus king, queen of hearts are declared, and the player
                    draws another king of hearts. He plays the declared king and wins the trick, he
                    can then marry the queen again. Some players object to thie, calling it bigamy;
                    but if only permitted after the declared king is played, it is not bigamy, but
                    the marriage of a widow. Bezique follows the same rule: if, say, the knave is
                    played away, another knave makes another bezique; and so on with double and
                    triple bézique, if the former declared cards which remain unplayed can be
                    matched from cards in hand to make the requisite combinations. Sequence can be
                    declared over and over again, and compound declarations made among the declared
                    cards are now generally ⅞∏∩wed. The sevens of trumps do not count, nor does the
                    last trick, oι at all events these only count by agreement. The game is 3000 up.
                    The great points to aim at are to declare four aces or sequence, which can then
                    be declared over and over again, if fresh aces or sequence cards are taken into
                    hand (the duplicate sequence cards being first played away). With fair chance of
                    sequence everything else, even aces or chance of double bezique, should be
