                <p><label type="entry">BEAUNE</label>, the chief town of an arrondissement in
                    France, in the department of Côte-d’Or, situated on the River Bourzeoise,
                    twenty-three miles S.S.W. of Dijon, on the railway from Paris to Lyons. The town
                    is of poor appearance, but has several buildings of interest, such as the
                    churches of Nôtre Dame and Saint Pierre, both of the 12th century, the hospital,
                    founded by Nicholas Rollin in 1443, and the belfry of the old town-house. Of
                    more modern erection are the public baths, the theatre, the communal college,
                    and the library. In the 18th century there were no fewer than seven monastic
                    buildings in the town besides a Bernardino abbey, a Carthusian convent, half
                    angry undertone of political protest than his usually careful and complete
                    structure of story from their frequently lax and slovenly incoherence of
                    character or plot, than his well composed and proportioned metre from their
                    lighter and looser melodies, than the bitter insistence and elaborate acrimony
                    of his judicial satire on hypocrisy or oppression from the gaiety or facility of
                    mood which suffers them in the shifting of a scene to redeem their worst
                    characters by some juggler’s trick of conversion at the last moment allowed them
                    to wind up a play with universal reconciliation and an act of oblivion on all
                    hands. They could hardly have drawn with such steady skill and explicit finish
                    an Overreach or a Luke; but the strenuous and able work of Massinger at its
                    highest point of success has no breath in it of their brighter and more
                    immediate inspiration. Shirley, on the other hand, may certainly be classed as a
                    pupil who copied their style in water-colour; his best tragedy and his best
                    comedy, <hi rend="italic">The Traitor</hi> and <hi rend="italic">The Lady of
                        Pleasure,</hi> might pass muster undetected among the plays of Fletcher, and
                    might fairly claim to take rank above the lowest class of these. In the finest
                    work of Middleton we recognize an almost exact reproduction of Fletcher’s
                    metrical effects,—a reverberation of that flowing music, a reiteration of those
                    feminine final notes. In his later tragi-comedies, throughout his masterpiece of
                        <hi rend="italic">Women beware Women,</hi> and in the noble scenes which
                    make up the tragic or serious part of <hi rend="italic">The Changeling</hi> or
                        <hi rend="italic">The Spanish Gipsy,—</hi> wherever, in a word, we find the
                    admirable but unequal genius of this poet at its best—we find a likeness wholly
                    wanting in his earlier and ruder work, which undoubtedly suggests the influence
                    of Fletcher. Other instances of imitation, other examples of discipleship, might
                    perhaps be found among lesser men of the next generation; but the mass of
                    succeeding playwrights began in a very short time to lower the style and debase
                    the scheme of dramatic poetry; and especially to loosen the last ties of
                    harmony, to deface the very form and feature of tragic verse. In Shirley, the
                    last and least of those in whom the lineal blood of the old masters was yet
                    discernible, we find side by side with the fine ancestral indications of
                    legitimate descent exactly such marks of decadence rather than degeneracy as we
                    might have anticipated in the latest heir of a long line which began with the
                    rise of Marlowe, “son of the morning,” in the highest heaven of our song, to
                    prepare a pathway for the sun. After Shakespeare there was yet room for Beaumont
                    and Fletcher; but after these and the other constellations had set, whose lights
                    filled up the measure of that diviner zodiac through which he moved, there was
                    but room in heaven for the pallid moonrise of Shirley; and before this last
                    reflex from a sunken sun was itself eclipsed, the glory had passed away from our
                    drama, to alight upon that summit of epic song whence Milton held communion with
                    darkness and the stars. <hi rend="smallcaps">(a. c. s.)</hi> and a society of
                    priests engaged in educational pursuits. Beaune enjoys considerable commercial
                    prosperity as the principal seat of the Burgundian wine-trade; it also
                    manufactures cloth, cutlery, and leather, and has dye-works, flour-mills, and
                    distilleries. Population in 1871, 10,415.</p>
                <p>Beaune appears as a fortified place as early as the 7th century, and for some
                    time was the capital of a separate duchy. United to Burgundy in 1227, it became
                    the first seat of the Burgundian parliament, or <hi rend="italic">Jours</hi><hi

                    On the death of Charles the Bold, it sided with his daughter, but was besieged
                    and taken by Louis XI. in 1478. It suffered severely in the wars of the League,
                    prospered in the reign of Henry IV., and was greatly injured by the revocation
                    of the Edict of Nantes.</p>
