                    neighbourhood his grandfather and father successively carried on business as
                    attorneys. His father, who was a wealthy man, and possessed at any rate a
                    smattering of Greek, Latin, and French, was thought to have demeaned himself by
                    marrying the daughter of an Andover tradesman, who afterwards retired to a
                    country house near Reading, where young Jeremy spent many happy days. The boy’s
                    talents justified the ambitious hopes which his parents entertained of his
                    future. When three years old he read eagerly such works as Rapin’s <hi
                    rend="italic">History,</hi> and began the study of Latin. A year or two later he
                    learnt the violin and French conversation. At Westminster school he obtained a
                    reputation for Greek and Latin verse writing; and he was only thirteen when he
                    was matriculated at Queen’s College Oxford, where his most important acquisition
                    seems to have been a thorough acquaintance with Sanderson’s logic. He became a
                    B.A. in 1763, and in the same year entered at Lincoln’s Inn, and took his seat
                    as a student in the Queen’s Bench, where he listened with rapture to the
                    judgments of Lord Mansfield. He managed also to hear Blackstone’s lectures at
                    Oxford, but says that he immediately detected the fallacies which underlay the
                    rounded periods of the future judge.</p>
                <p>Bentham’s family connections would naturally have given him a fair start at the
                    bar, but this was not the career for which he was preparing himself. He spent
                    his time in making chemical experiments and in speculating upon legal abuses,
                    rather than in reading Coke upon Littleton and the Reports. On being called to
                    the bar he “found a cause or two at nurse for him, which he did his best to put
                    to death,” to the bitter disappointment of his father, who had confidently
                    looked forward to seeing him upon the woolsack. The first fruits of Bentham’s
                    studies, the <hi rend="italic">Fragment on Government,</hi> appeared in 1776.
                    This masterly attack upon Blackstone’s praises of the English constitution was
                    variously attributed to Lord Mansfield, Lord Camden, and Lord Ashburton. One
                    important result of its publication was that, in 1781, Lord Shelburne called
                    upon its author in his chambers at Lincoln’s Inn. Henceforth Bentham was a
                    frequent guest at Bowood, where he saw the best society, and where he met Miss
                    Caroline Fox, to whom he afterwards made a proposal of marriage. In 1785 Bentham
                    started, by way of Italy and Constantinople, on a visit to his brother, Sir
                    Samuel Bentham, who became a general in the Russian service; and it was in
                    Russia that he wrote his <hi rend="italic">Defence of Usury.</hi> Disappointed
                    in the hope which he had entertained, through a misapprehension of something
                    said by Lord Lansdowne, of taking a personal part in the legislation of his
                    country, he settled down to the yet higher task of discovering and teaching the
                    principles upon which all sound legislation must proceed. His fame spread widely
                    and rapidly. He was made a French citizen in 1792; and his advice was
                    respectfully received in most of the states of Europe and America, with many of
                    the leading men of which he maintained an active correspondence. His ambition
                    was to be allowed to prepare a code of law for his own or some foreign country.
                    During nearly a quarter of a century he was engaged in negotiations with
                    Government for the erection of a “Panopticon,” which would render transportation
                    unnecessary. The scheme was eventually abandoned, and Bentham received £ 23,000
                    by <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit03newyrich/page/n593/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0903-0593-0576"/> way of compensation. In 1823 he established the
                    <hi rend="italic">Westminster Review.</hi> Some idea of the extent of Bentham’s
                    literary labours may be derived from the fact that his <hi rend="italic"
                    >Works,</hi> as edited with biographical notices by Dr Bowring in 1843, fill
                    eleven volumes octavo, of closely printed double columns. Bentham died on the
                    6th of June 1832, in his 85 th year, at the house in Queen’s Square Place, which
                    he had occupied f®r fifty years. In accordance with his directions, his body,
                    after being dissected in the presence of his friends, was embalmed, and is still
                    preserved, seated in his wonted dress, in University College, London.</p>
                <p>Bentham’s life was a happy one of its kind. His constitution, weakly in
                    childhood, strengthened with advancing years so as to alløw him to get through
                    an incredible amount of sedentary labour, while he retained to the last the
                    fresh and cheerful temperament of a boy. An ample inherited fortune permitted
                    him to pursue his studies undistracted by the necessity for making a livelihood,
                    and to maximize the results of his time and labour by the employment of
                    amanuenses and secretaries. He was able to gather around him a group of
                    congenial friends and pupils, such as the Mills, the Austins, and Bowring, with
                    whom he could discuss the problems upon which he was engaged, and by whom
                    several of his books were practically rewritten, from the mass of rough though
                    orderly memoranda which the master had himself prepared. Thus, for instance, was
                    the <hi rend="italic">Rationale of Judicial Evidence</hi> written out by J. S.
                    Mill, and the <hi rend="italic">Book of Fallacies</hi> by Bingham. The services
                    which Dumont rendered in recasting, as well as translating, the works of Bentham
                    were still more important.</p>
                <p>The popular notion that Bentham was a morose visionary is far removed from fact.
                    It is true that he looked upon general society as a waste of time, and that he
                    disliked poetry as “misrepresentation ”; but he intensely enjoyed conversation,
                    gave good dinners, and delighted in music, in country sights, and in making
                    others happy. These features of Bentham’s character are illustrated in the
                    graphic account given by the American minister, Mr Rush, of an evening spent at
                    his house in the summer of the year 1818. “If Mr Bentham’s character is
                    peculiar,” he says, “so is his place of residence. It was a kind of blind-alley,
                    the end of which widened into a small, neat courtyard. There by itself stands Mr
                    Bentham’s house. Shrubbery graced its area, and flowers its window-sills. It was
                    like an oasis in the desert. Its name is the Hermitage. Mr Bentham received me
                    with the simplicity of a philosopher. I should have taken him for 70 or upwards.
                    Everything inside the house was orderly. The furniture seemed to have been
                    unmoved since the days of his fathers, for I learned that it was a patrimony. A
                    parlour, library, and dining-room made up the suite of apartments. In each was a
                    piano, the eccentric master of the whole being fond of music as the recreation
                    of his literary hours. It is a unique, romantic-like homestead. Walking with him
                    into the garden, I found it dark with the shade of an aient trees. They formed a
                    barrier against all intrusion. The company was small, but choice. Mr Brougham;
                    Sir Samuel Romilly; Mr Mill, author of the well-known work on India; Μ. Dumont,
                    the learned Genevan, once the associate of Mirabeau, were all who sat down to
                    table. Mr Bentham did not talk much. He had a benevolence of manner suited to
                    the philanthropy of his mind. He seemed to be thinking only of the convenience
                    and pleasure of his guests, not as a rule of artificial breeding as from
                    Chesterfield or Madame Genlis, but from innate feeling. Bold as are his opinions
                    in his works, here he was wholly unobtrusive of theories that might not have
                    commended the assent of all present. When he did converse it was in simple
                    language, a contrast to his later writings, where an involved style and the use
                    of^ new or universal words are drawbacks upon the speculations of a genius
                    original and profound, but with the faults of solitude. Yet some of his earlier
                    productions are distinguished by classical terseness.”— <hi rend="italic"
                    >{Residence at the Court of London,</hi> p. 286.) Bentham’s love of flowers and
                    music, of green foliage and shaded walks, comes clearly out in this pleasant
                    picture of his home life and social surroundings.</p>
                <p>Whether or no he can be said to have founded a school, his doctrines have become
                    so far part of the common thought of the time, that there is hardly an educated
                    man who does not accept as too clear for argument truths which were invisible
                    till Bentham pointed them out. His sensitively honourable nature, which in early
                    life had caused him to shrink from asserting his belief in Thirty-nine articles
                    of faith which he had not examined, was shocked by the enormous abuses which
                    confronted him on commencing the study of the law. He rebelled at hearing the
                    system under which they flourished described as the perfection of human reason.
                    But he was no merely destructive critic. He was determined to find a solid
                    foundation for both morality and law, and to raise upon it an edifice, no stone
                    of which should be laid except in accordance with the deductions of the severest
                    logic. This foundation is “the greatest happiness of the greatest number,” a
                    formula adopted from Beccaria. The pursuit of such happiness is taught by the
                    “utilitarian” philosophy, a phrase used by Bentham himself in 1802, and
                    therefore not invented by Mr J. S. Mill, as he supposed, in 1823. In order to
                    ascertain what modes of action are most conducive to the end in view, and what
                    motives are best fitted to produce them, Bentham was led to construct
                    marvellously exhaustive, though somewhat mechanical, tables of [motives. With
                    all their elaboration, these tables are, however, defective, as they omit some
                    of the highest and most influential springs of action. But most of Bentham’s
                    conclusions may be accepted without any formal profession of the utilitarian
                    theoιy of morals. They are, indeed, merely the application of a rigorous common
                    sense to the facts of society. That the proximate ends at which Bentham aimed
                    are desirable hardly any one would deny, though the feasibility of the means by
                    which he proposes to attain them may often be questioned; and much of the new
                    nomenclature in which he thought fit to clothe his doctrines may be rejected as
                    unnecessary. To be judged fairly, Bentham must be judged as a teacher of the
                    principles of legislation. With the principles of private morals he really deals
                    only so far as is necessary to enable the reader to appreciate the impulses
                    which have to be controlled by law.</p>
                <p>As a teacher of legislation he inquires of all institutions whether their utility
                    justifies their existence. If not, he is prepared to suggest a new form of
                    institution by which the needful service may be rendered. While thus engaged no
                    topic is too large for his mental grasp, none too small for his notice; and,
                    what is still rarer, every topic is seen in its due relation to the rest.
                    English institutions had never before been thus comprehensively and
                    dispassionately surveyed. Such improvements as had been necessitated were mere
                    makeshifts, often made by stealth. The rude symmetry of the feudal system had
                    been long ago destroyed by partial and unskilful adaptations to modern
                    commercial life, effected at various dates and in accordance with various
                    theories. The time had come for deliberate reconstruction, for inquiring whether
                    the existence of many admitted evils was, as it was said to be, unavoidable; for
                    proving that the needs of society may be classified and provided for by
                    contrivances which shall not clash with one another because all shall be parts
                    of a consistent whole. This task Bentham undertook, and he brought to it a mind
                    absolutely free from professional or class feeling, or any other species of <pb
                    break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit03newyrich/page/n594/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0903-0594-0577"/> prejudice. He mapped out the whole subject,
                    dividing and subdividing it in accordance with the principle of “dichotomy.”
                    Having reached his ultimate subdivisions he subjects each to the most-thorough
                    and ingenious discussion. His earlier writings exhibit a lively and easy style,
                    which gives place in his later treatises to sentences which are awkward from
                    their effort after unattainable accuracy, and from the newly-invented technical
                    nomenclature in which they are expressed. Many of Bentham’s phrases, such as
                    “international,” “utilitarian,” “codification,” are valuable additions to our
                    language; but the majority of them, especially those of Greek derivation, have
                    taken no root in it. His neology is one among many instances of his contempt for
                    the past and his wish to be clear of all association with it. His was, indeed, a
                    typically logical, as opposed to an historical, mind. For the history of
                    institutions, which in the hands of Sir Henry Maine is becoming a new and
                    interesting branch of science, Bentham cared nothing Had he possessed such a
                    knowledge of Roman law as is now not uncommon in England, he must doubtless have
                    taken a different view of many subjects. The logical and historical methods can,
                    however, seldom be combined without confusion; and it is perhaps fortunate that
                    Bentham devoted his long life to showing how much may be done by pursuing the
                    former method exclusively. His writings have been and remain a storehouse of
                    instruction for statesmen, an armory for legal reformers. “Pillé par tout le
                    monde,” as Talleyrand said of him, “il est toujours riche.” To trace the results
                    of his teaching in England alone would be to write a history of the legislation
                    of half a century. Upon the whole administrative machinery of government, upon
                    criminal law, and upon procedure, both criminal and civil, his influence has
                    been most salutary; and the great legal revolution which has just accomplished
                    the fusion of law and equity is not obscurely traceable to the same source.
                    Those of Bentham’s suggestions which have hitherto been carried out have
                    affected the matter, or contents, of the law There seems at length some reason
                    to hope that his suggestions for the improvement of its form and expression are
                    about to receive the attention which they deserve. The services rendered by
                    Bentham to the world would not, however, be exhausted even by the practical
                    adoption of every one of his recommendations. There are no limits to the good
                    results of his introduction of a true method of reasoning into the moral and
                    political sciences.</p>
                <p>The best edition of Bentham’s works is that edited by Dr Bowring, in 11 vols.
                    8vo, the publication of which was completed in 1843. It contains a selection
                    from his correspondence, and some biographical statements, (τ. E. H.)</p>
