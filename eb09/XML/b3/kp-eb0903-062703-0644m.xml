                <p><label type="entry">BHANG</label>, an East Indian name for the hemp plant, <hi
                    rend="italic">Cannabis</hi><hi rend="italic">sativa,</hi> but applied specially
                    to the leaves dried and prepared for use as a narcotic drug. The hemp plant, as
                    cultivated in the Bengal Presidency and the North-West Provinces, yields a
                    peculiar resinous exudation, which is altogether wanting in the hemp grown on
                    account of its fibre in European countries. For this resinous exudation, in
                    which its virtues as a drug reside, hemp is cultivated in Kashmir, Bokhâra,
                    Yarkand, and Central Asia generally, besides North India, and in certain parts
                    of East Africa, where, according to Captain Burton, it is grown “before every
                    cottage door.” In India the products of the plant for use as a narcotic and
                    intoxicant are recognized under the three names and forms of Bhang, Gunja or
                    Ganja, and Churrus or Charas. Bhang consists of the larger leaves and capsules
                    of the plant on which an effloresence of resinous matter has occurred. The
                    leaves are in broken and partly agglutinated pieces, having a dark-green colour
                    and a heavy but not unpleasant smell. Bhang is used in India for smoking, with
                    or without tobacco; it is prepared in the form of a cake or manjan, and it is
                    made into an intoxicating beverage by infusing in cold water and straining.
                    Gunja is the flowering or fruit-bearing tops of the female plants. It is
                    gathered in stalks of several inches in length, the tops of which form a matted
                    mass, from the agglutination of flowers, seeds, and leaflets by the abundant
                    resinous exudation which, coats them. Churrus is the resinous
                    substance’separated from the plant. According to Dr O’Shaughnessy it is obtained
                    by men dressed in leathern aprons brushing forcibly through the growing stalks,
                    and the resin which thereby adheres to the leather is scraped off with knives.
                    It is stated that in Nepal the <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit03newyrich/page/n645/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0903-0645-0628"/> leather covering is dispensed with, and the resin
                    gathered on the naked bodies of coolies, who brush through the standing stalks.
                    Dr Boyle says, “the glandular secretion is collected from the plants on the
                    hills by the natives pressing the upper part of the young plants between the
                    palms of their hands, and scraping off the secretion which adheres.” The
                    preparation known as hashish among the Arabs is similar to the gunja of India,
                    and is used in the same manner. The use of preparations of hemp among the
                    Mussulman and Hindu population of India is very general; and the habit also
                    obtains among the population of Central Asia, the Arabs, and Egyptians,
                    extending even to the negroes of the valley of the Zambesi and the Hottentots of
                    South Africa. The habit appears to date from very remote times, for Herodotus
                    says of the Scythians, that they creep inside huts and throw hemp seeds on hot
                    stones. The seeds “soon send forth a virulent intoxicating smoke, which fills
                    the close tent, and the people inside, being overpowered with the intoxicating
                    effects, howl with excitement and delight.” The observations of Dr O’Shaughnessy
                    on the effects of the drug on the native population of India led him to conclude
                    that it alleviates pain, and causes a remarkable increase of appetite,
                    unequivocal aphrodisia, and great mental cheerfulness. Its violent effects are
                    delirium of a peculiar kind, and the production of a cataleptic condition. Sir
                    Robert Christison says, that “for energy, certainty, and convenience, Indian
                    hemp is the next anodyne, hypnotic, and antispasmodic to opium and its
                    derivatives, and often equal to it.” Preparations are used in British pharmacy
                    in the form of tincture and extract prepared from gunja, and it is understood to
                    form an ingredient in the patent medicine chlorodyne.</p>
