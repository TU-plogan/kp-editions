                    the Euxine. According to Strabo it was bounded on the east by the River
                    Sangarius; but the more commonly received division extended it as far as the
                    Parthenius, which separated it from Paphlagonia, thus comprising the district on
                    the sea-coast between these two rivers, which was inhabited by the Mariandyni.
                    Towards the west and south-west it was limited by the River Rhyndacus, which
                    separated it from Mysia; and on the south it adjoined the portion of Phrygia
                    called Phrygia Epictetus, and a part of Galatia. The territory thus defined is
                    in great part occupied by mountains and forests, but has valleys and districts
                    near the sea-coast of great fertility. The most important of the mountain ranges
                    is that known as the Mysian Olympus—from itβ proximity to that province, though
                    properly included within the limits of Bithynia— which rises to a height of
                    about 6400 feet. It towers in a commanding manner above the city of Broussa,
                    while it forms a conspicuous object as seen from Constantinople, at <pb

                    with snow for a great part of the year. Eastward of this the range now called
                    Ala-Dagh extends for above 100 miles from the River Sangarius to the confines of
                    Paphlagonia. It adjoins throughout its course the frontiers of Phrygia and
                    Galatia, and rises to a height of from 6000 to 7000 feet. Both of these ranges
                    belong to that border of mountains which bounds the great table-land of Asia
                    Minor through a great part of its extent. The country between them and the
                    sea-coast is for the most part occupied by subordinate mountain chains, which
                    may be regarded as underfalls or offshoots of the more lofty mountain ranges of
                    the interior. These constitute a very rugged and broken country, covered with
                    extensive forests, and traversed by very few lines of route, so that it is still
                    very imperfectly known. But the broad tract which projects towards the west as
                    far as the shores of the Bosphorus, though hilly and covered with forests, so as
                    to be termed by the Turks Aghatch Denizi, or “The Ocean of Trees,” is not
                    traversed by anything like a mountain chain.</p>
                <p>The western coast of Bithynia, where it adjoins the Propontis or Sea of Marmora,
                    is indented by two deep gulfs or inlets—the northernmost, now called the Gulf of
                    Ismid, anciently known as the Gulf of Astacus, penetrating to a distance of
                    between 40 and 50 miles into the interior, as far as the town of Ismid, the
                    ancient Nicomedia, which is separated by an isthmus of only about 25 miles from
                    the Black Sea. The next, known in ancient times as the Gulf of Qius, now called
                    the Gulf of Moudania or Gemlik, extends to about 25 miles. At its extremity is
                    situated the small town of Gemlik, on the site of the ancient Cius, at the mouth
                    of a valley, through which it communicated with the inland lake of Isnik, on
                    which was situated the flourishing city of Nicaea.</p>
                <p>According to the general testimony of ancient authors (He,rodotus, Xenophon,
                    Strabo, &amp;c.), the Bithynians were a tribe of Thracian origin who had
                    migrated into Asia by crossing the Bosphorus. The existence of a tribe called
                    Thyni in Thrace is well attested, and the two cognate tribes of the Thyni and
                    Bithyni appear to have settled simultaneously in the adjoining parts of Asia,
                    where they expelled or subdued the previously existing races of the Mysians,
                    Caucones, and other petty tribes, the Mariandyni alone maintaining themselves in
                    the north-eastern part of the country. Herodotus mentions the two tribes, the
                    Thyni and Bithyni, as existing side by side; but ultimately the latter people
                    must have become the more important, so as to give name to the whole country.
                    They were first subdued by Croesus, and incorporated with the Lydian monarchy,
                    together with which they soon after fell under the dominion of Persia (546 <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">b,c.)</hi> During the Persian empire they were included in the
                    satrapy of Phrygia, which comprised all the countries up to the Hellespont and
                    Bosphorus. But even before the conquest by Alexander some obscure native chiefs
                    appear to have asserted their independence in the mountains of Bithynia, and
                    successfully maintained it under two native princes named Bas and Zipoetes, the
                    last of whom transmitted his power to his son Nicomedes I., who was the first to
                    assume the title of king. He became the founder of the city of Nicomedia, which
                    soon rose to great prosperity and opulence; and during his long reign (278-250
                    <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.),</hi> as well as those of his successors, Prusias I.,
                    Prusias II., and Nicomedes IL (149-91 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi>), the
                    kingdom of Bithynia held a considerable place among the minor monarchies of
                    Asia. But the last king, Nicomedes III., was unable to maintain himself against
                    the increasing power of his neighbour Mithridates, king of Pontus; and although
                    restored to his throne by the interposition of the Roman Senate, at his death,
                    in 74 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.,</hi> he bequeathed his kingdom by will to the
                    Romans. Bithynia was now reduced into the form of a Roman province; but its
                    limits were frequently varied, and it was commonly united for administrative
                    purposes with the neighbouring province of Pontus, extending along the southern
                    shore of the Black Sea as far as Trapezus or Trebizond. This was the state of
                    things in the time of Trajan, when the younger Pliny was appointed governor of
                    the combined provinces (103-105 &amp;.D.), a circumstance to which we are
                    indebted for much valuable information concerning the Roman provincial
                    administration. Under the Byzantine empire Bithynia was again divided into two
                    provinces, separated by the River Sangarius, to the westernmost of which the
                    name of Bithynia was restricted.</p>
                <p>The most important cities of Bithynia in ancient times were Nicomedia and Nicaea,
                    which disputed with one another the rank of its capital. Both of these were
                    founded after the time of Alexander the Great; but at a much earlier period the
                    Greeks had established on the coast the colonies of Cius (afterwards named
                    Prusias), on the site of the modern Gemlik; Chalcedon, at the entrance of the
                    Bosphorus, nearly opposite Constantinople; and Heraclea, surnamed Pontica, on
                    the coast of the Euxine, about 120 miles east of the Bosphorus. All these rose
                    to be flourishing and important places of trade. Pπιsa, at the foot of Mount
                    Olympus, which was founded by Prusias, was also a considerable town under the
                    Roman empire, but did not attain in ancient times to anything like the
                    importance enjoyed by the modern city of Broussa, which became the capital of
                    the Ottoman Turks before the conquest of Constantinople, and is still (after
                    Smyrna) the second city of Asia Minor. The only other places of importance at
                    the present day are Ismid (Nicomedia) and Scutari, which, from its position on
                    the Bosphorus, may be considered as a mere suburb of Constantinople.</p>
                <p>The natural resources of Bithynia are still very imperfectly developed. Its
                    mounts ins are covered with vast forests, which would furnish an almost
                    inexhaustible supply of timber, if rendered accessible by roads. Coal also is
                    known to exist in the neighbourhood of Erekli (Heraclea), but is not worked to
                    any extent. The valleys which open towards the Black Sea abound in fruit trees
                    of all kinds, while the valley of the Sangarius and the plains near Broussa and
                    Isnik (Nicaea) are fertile and well cultivated. Extensive plantations of
                    mulberry trees supply the silk for which Broussa has long been celebrated, and
                    which is manufactured there on a large scale.</p>
                <p>The principal rivers of Bithynia are the Sangarius, still called the Sakaria,
                    which traverses the province from S. to N.; the Rhyndacus, which forms the
                    boundary that separated it from Mysia; the Billaeus (Filyas), which rises in the
                    chain of the Ala-Dagh, about 150 miles from the sea, and after flowing by the
                    town of Boli (the ancient Claudiopolis) falls into the Euxine, close to the
                    ruins of the ancient Tium, about 40 miles N.E. of Heraclea. It has a course of
                    more than 100 miles. The Parthenius (now called the Bartan), which forms the
                    boundary of the province towards the E., is a much less considerable stream. <hi
