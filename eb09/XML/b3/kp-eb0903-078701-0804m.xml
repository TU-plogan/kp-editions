                    on the N. by the bay to which it gives its name, E. by Guipuzcoa, S. by Alava,
                    and W. by Santander. Its area is 845 square miles, and its population in 1867
                    was 183,098. The coastline, which extends from Ondarroa to a short distance to
                    the east of Castro, is bold and rugged, and in some places is deeply indented.
                    The only river of any size is the Nervion or Ibaizabal, on which Bilbao is
                    situated; the others, which are numerous, are merely large mountain streams. The
                    surface of the country is for the most part very mountainous, but at the same
                    time is diversified with numerous narrow valleys and small plains. Some of the
                    mountains are almost entirely composed of naked calcareous rock, but most of
                    them are covered to their summits with forests of oaks, chestnuts, or pine
                    trees. Holly and arbutus are also common, and furze and heath abound in the
                    poorer parts. The province produces wheat, maize, barley, rye, flax, grapes,
                    peaches, apples, and other fruits. The' farms are generally small, and are for
                    the most part tilled by manual labour. The wild boar, lynx, fox, and other wild
                    animals, are found in the forests; and deer, rabbits, partridges, woodcocks, and
                    other kinds of game are plentiful. Sheep and goats are the principal domestic
                    animals. In minerals Biscay is very rich. Iron of the finest quality is found in
                    almost every part, and forms a main article of export. The best mines are those
                    of Somorostro, near the coast. The amount obtained in 1866 was about 80,000
                    tons. Lead, zinc, alum, and sulphur, are also present in smaller quantities; and
                    marble, lime, and sandstone are abundant. The manufacture of the iron ore is the
                    chief branch of industry; but porcelain, linens, copper and brass wares, ropes,
                    and leather, are also produced. The fisheries are actively prosecuted along the
                    coast by a hardy race of fishers, who were the first of their craft in Europe to
                    pursue the whale, formerly abundant in the Bay of Biscay. Cod, bream, tunny, and
                    anchovy are the principal fish taken. Bilbao is the capital of the province,
                    with a population of 17,649; the other towns, Portugalete, Miravalles, Durango,
                    and Orozco, are all very small. The principal ports, besides Portugalete, are
                    Plencia, Bermeo, and Hea. After the fall of the Romans this Cantabrian province
                    came successively into the hands of the Suevi, Franks, and Goths, and formed for
                    some time an independent lordship. The legislative authority was exercised by
                    the lord and a junta of popular representatives. The latter regularly assembled
                    every two years, and on any emergency held an extraordinary meeting under an old
                    tree at Guernica. Although incorporated with Spain, the Biscayans still maintain
                    a republican form of administration, nominating their own governors and
                    magistrates, regulating the amount of the taxes, and exercising various other
                    privileges. They are a brave and active people, and their history is largely
                    composed of exploits in defence of their liberties. For their linguistic and
                    ethnographic affinities, see the article <hi rend="smallcaps">Basque
                    Provinces.</hi> The name Biscay is not unfrequently employed as geographically
                    equivalent to Basque, in that case including the three provinces of Biscay
                    proper, Guipuzcoa, and Alava.</p>
