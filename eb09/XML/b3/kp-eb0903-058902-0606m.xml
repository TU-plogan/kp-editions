                    the 12th March 1685, at Dysert castle, on the banks of the Nore, about two miles
                    below Thomastown, Ireland. Not much is known of his family, who seem to have
                    been connected with the noble English house of the same name. His father,
                    William Berkeley, was an officer of customs, and appears to have had at one time
                    the rank of captain in the army. We know next to nothing of the mental character
                    of either him or his wife. George, their eldest son, was entered in 1696 at the
                    famous Kilkenny school, of which he was not the only pupil afterwards
                    distinguished. He was remarkably well advanced in studies for his years, and in
                    1700 was qualified to matriculate at Trinity College, Dublin. There, for the
                    first time, we begin to have a fair knowledge of the circumstances in which he
                    was placed, and of the peculiar mental qualities with which he was endowed. From
                    his own account, and from the few notices of contemporaries, we can gather that
                    his was a mind of peculiar subtilty, keen to probe to the very foundation any
                    fact presented to it, and resolutely determined to rest satisfied with no
                    doctrine which had only the evidence of authority or custom, and was not capable
                    of being realized in consciousness. This turn of mind naturally led him somewhat
                    off the beaten track of university studies; he was not understood by his college
                    companions, and began to be looked upon as either the greatest dunce or the
                    greatest genius in the university. To such a reputation his eccentricity of
                    manner, which seems to have resulted from his occasional absorption or
                    passionate enthusiasm, largely contributed. Of the greatest importance for the
                    development of his rare powers in a definite direction was the general condition
                    of thought at the time of his residence at Dublin. The older text-books of
                    physics and philosophy were no doubt in use (Dublin in this respect has always
                    been conservative), but alongside of them the influences of the new modes of
                    thinking were streaming in. The opposed physical systems of Descartes and Newton
                    had begun to be known; the new and powerful calculus was being handled; the
                    revolution in metaphysical speculation inaugurated by Descartes had reached
                    Dublin; and, above all, the first great English work on pure philosophy, the <hi
                    rend="italic">Essay</hi> of Locke, had been translated into Latin, and its
                    doctrines were being eagerly and minutely discussed by the young Trinity College
                    students. Add to this the undoubted influence exercised by the presence in
                    Dublin of such men as the university provost, Peter Browne, afterwards bishop of
                    Cork, and King, archbishop of Dublin from 1703, and it will readily be seen that
                    Berkeley, to use Professor Fraser’s words, “entered an atmosphere which was
                    beginning to be charged with the elements of reaction against traditional
                    scholasticism in physics and in metaphysics.”</p>
                <p> Although more competent than any man of his time to appreciate these new
                    movements of thought, Berkeley did not neglect the routine work of the
                    university. He had a distinguished career, was made scholar in 1702, took his
                    B.A degree in 1704, and obtained a fellowship in 1707. That his interest,
                    however, was mainly directed towards subjects purely philosophical, is evidenced
                    partly by the share he took in setting afloat a speculative society in which the
                    problems suggested by Descartes and Locke seem to have been discussed with
                    infinite vigour, but, above all, by his <hi rend="italic">Common Place
                    Book,</hi> containing his thoughts on physics and philosophy from about the year
                    1703. This curious document, one of the most valuable autobiographical records
                    in existence, throws a flood of light on the growth of Berkeley’s own
                    conceptions, and enables us to understand, far more clearly than we otherwise
                    could, the significance of his first published works. In the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Common Place Book,</hi> if in any writing, is to be found the keen
                    consciousness of possessing a fresh, creative thought, the application of which
                    will change the whole aspect of speculative science. The very first sentences
                    refer to some new principle, and the whole book thereafter is occupied turning
                    over and over again the new conception, showing the different aspects it
                    assumes, and the various applications it has, bringing it face to face with
                    possible objections, and critically considering the relation in which it stands
                    to the fundamental thoughts of his great predecessors, Descartes, Malebranche,
                    and Locke. So far as reading goes, the <hi rend="italic">Common Place Book</hi>
                    shows but a slight acquaintance with ancient or scholastic philosophies; it is
                    evident that the author does not appreciate Spinoza; he does not refer to
                    Leibnitz; Malebranche is frequently mentioned, but hardly in such a way as to
                    manifest sympathetic understanding of him; Norris, the English follower of
                    Malebranche, seems to be unnoticed; More and the Mystics, when referred to, are
                    quoted on isolated points, and to their system the young philosopher evidently
                    felt no attraction. Descartes and Locke, above all the latter, are his real
                    masters in speculation, and it is from the careful consideration of their
                    systems that the new principle has sprung to light. And what is this principle
                    <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi>? As Professor Fraser has said, there are many
                    ways of expressing it, and Berkeley himself has never given any very definite
                    enunciation. To put it in a form as nearly as possible resembling the statements
                    in the <hi rend="italic">Common Place Book,</hi> it may be expressed in the
                    proposition that no existence is conceivable and therefore possible which is not
                    either conscious spirit or the ideas <hi rend="italic">∖i.e.,</hi> objects) of
                    which such spirit is conscious. Existing things consist of ideas or objects
                    perceived or willed, while perception and volition are inconceivable and
                    impossible save as the operations of mind or spirit. In the language of a later
                    philosophy, the principle is that of the absolute synthesis of subject and
                    object; no object exists apart from mind. Mind is therefore the deepest reality;
                    it is the <hi rend="italic">prius</hi> both in thought and in existence, if for
                    the moment we assume the popular distinction between these two. From this
                    primitive truth, which, it seems to Berkeley, merely requires careful
                    consideration in order to be at once accepted, he never wavers. Let attention be
                    but confined to the only possible <hi rend="italic">meaning</hi> which existence
                    can have, and, Berkeley thinks, the principle must appear self-evident. Thus he
                    puts in a new light the perennial problems of philosophy, and instead of
                    discussing the nature and relations of assumed entities, such as matter,
                    substance, or cause, would ask us to consider whether or not these have any
                    significance apart from the perceptions or volitions of conscious spirit, what
                    in that case they do mean, and whether the supposed difficulties connected with
                    them do <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit03newyrich/page/n607/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0903-0607-0590"/> not vanish when their true interpretation is
                    thoroughly grasped Of all these difficulties that concerned with the nature of
                    matter is of greatest importance to Berkeley. From misconceptions of the true
                    nature of material substance have flowed, according to him, the materialism,
                    scepticism, and infidelity which disfigured the age; and all these are
                    completely banished by the new principle. The applications of his principle and
                    his own inclinations led Berkeley into other departments of science which he was
                    not so well qualified to handle. The first result of the principle, as he
                    conceived it, is undoubtedly empiricism in the theory of cognition. The ultimate
                    elements of knowledge are the minima of consciousness, presentative or
                    representative; pure thought and abstract ideas are not capable of being
                    realized by the mind, and are therefore impossible. The only mathematical
                    processes to which these minima can be subjected are addition and subtraction;
                    and consequently great part of the <hi rend="italic">Common, Place Book</hi> is
                    occupied with a vigorous and in many points exceedingly ignorant polemic against
                    the fundamental conceptions of the fluxional and infinitesimal calculus, a
                    polemic which Berkeley carried on to the end of his days.</p>
                <p>He soon began to appear as an author. In 1707 he published two short tracts on
                    mathematics, and in 1709 the <hi rend="italic">New Theory of Vision,</hi> in
                    which he applied his new principle, though without stating it explicitly. The
                    new theory is a critical examination of the true meaning of the externality
                    which is apparently given in visual consciousness, and which, to the
                    unphilosophical mind, is the strongest evidence of the independent existence of
                    outer objects. Such visual consciousness is shown to be ultimately a system of
                    arbitrary signs, symbolizing for us certain actual or possible tactual
                    experience—in fact, a language which we learn through custom. The difference
                    between the contents of the visual and the tactual consciousness is absolute;
                    they have no element in common. The visible and visual signs are definitely
                    connected with tactual experiences, and the association between them, which has
                    grown up in our minds through custom or habit, rests upon, or is guaranteed by,
                    the constant conjunction of the two by the will of the Universal Mind. But this
                    synthesis, whether on the objective side as the universal thought or course of
                    nature, or on the subjective side as mental association, is not brought forward
                    prominently by Berkeley. It was at the same time perfectly evident that a quite
                    similar analysis might have been applied to tactual consciousness, which does
                    not give externality in its deepest significance any more than visual; but it
                    was with deliberate purpose that Berkeley at first drew out only one side of his
                    argument In 1710 the new doctrine received its full statement in the <hi
                    rend="italic">Principles of Human Knowledge,</hi> where externality in its
                    ultimate sense as independence of all mind is considered; where matter, as an
                    abstract, unperceived substance or cause, is shown to be an impossible and
                    unreal conception; where true substance is affirmed to be conscious spirit, true
                    causality the free activity of such a spirit, while physical substantiality and
                    causality in their new meaning are held to be merely arbitrary but constant
                    relations among phenomena connected subjectively by suggestion or association,
                    conjoined objectively in the Universal Mind. In ultimate analysis, then, nature
                    is conscious experience, and forms the sign or symbol of a divine, universal
                    intelligence and will.</p>
                <p>In the preceding year Berkeley had been ordained as deacon, and in 1711 he
                    delivered his <hi rend="italic">Discourse on Passive Obedience,</hi> in which he
                    deduces moral rules from the intention of God to promote the general happiness,
                    thus working out a theological utilitarianism, which may with advantage be
                    compared with the later expositions of Austin and Mill. From the year 1707 he
                    had been engaged as college tutor; in 1712 he paid a short visit to England, and
                    in April of the following year he was presented by Swift at court. His splendid
                    abilities and fine courteous manners, combined with the purity and uprightness
                    of his character, made him a universal favourite. While in London he published
                    his <hi rend="italic">Dialogues</hi> (1713), a more popular exposition of his
                    new theory; for exquisite facility of style these are perhaps the finest
                    philosophical writings in the English language. In November of the same year he
                    became chaplain to Lord Peterborough, whom he accompanied on the Continent,
                    returning in August 1714. He travelled again in 1715 as tutor to the son of Dr
                    Ashe, and was absent from England for five years. On his way home he wrote and
                    sent to the French Academy the essay <hi rend="italic">De Motu,</hi> in which is
                    given a full account of his new conception of causality, the fundamental and
                    all-comprehensive thought in his philosophy. In 1721, during the disturbed state
                    of social relations consequent on the bursting of the the great South Sea
                    bubble, he published an <hi rend="italic">Essay towards preventing the Ruin of
                    Great Britain,</hi> which shows the intense interest he took in all practical
                    affairs. In the same year he returned to Ireland as chaplain to the duke of
                    Grafton, and was made divinity lecturer and university preacher. In 1722 he was
                    appointed to the deanery of Dromore, a post which seems to have entailed no
                    duties, as we find him holding the offices of Hebrew lecturer and senior proctor
                    at the university. The following year brought him an unexpected addition of
                    fortune, Miss Vanhomrigh, Swift’s Vanessa, having left him half her property. It
                    would appear that he had only met her once at dinner. In 1724 he was nominated
                    to the rich deanery of Derry, but had hardly been appointed before he was using
                    every effort to resign it in order to devote himself to his enthusiastically
                    conceived scheme of founding a college in the Bermudas, and extending its
                    benefits to the Americans. With infinite exertion he succeeded in obtaining from
                    Government a promise of £20,000, and, after four years spent in preparation,
                    sailed in September 1728, accompanied by some friends and by his wife, daughter
                    of Judge Forster, whom he had married in the preceding month. Their destination
                    was Rhode Island, where they resolved to wait for the promised grant from
                    Government. Three years of quiet retirement and study were spent in the island.
                    Berkeley bought a farm, made many friends, and endeared himself to the
                    inhabitants. But it gradually became apparent that Government would never hand
                    over the promised grant, if indeed they had ever seriously contemplated doing
                    so. Berkeley was therefore compelled reluctantly to give up his cherished plan.
                    Soon after his return he published the fruits of his quiet studies in <hi
                    rend="italic">Alciρhron, or the Minute Philosopher</hi> (1733), a finely written
                    work in the form of dialogue, critically examining the various forms of
                    freethinking in the age, and bringing forward in antithesis to them his own
                    theory, which shows all nature to be the language of God. The work was extremely
                    popular. In 1734 he was raised to the bishopric of Cloy ne, and at once went
                    into residence. The same year, in his <hi rend="italic">Analyst,</hi> he
                    attacked the higher mathematics as leading to freethinking; this involved him in
                    a hot controversy. The <hi rend="italic">Querist,</hi> a practical work in the
                    form of questions on what would now be called social or economical philosophy,
                    appeared in three parts, 1735, 1736, 1737. In 1744 was published the <hi
                    rend="italic">Siris,</hi> partly occasioned by the controversy with regard to
                    tar-water, but rising far above the petty circumstance from which it took its
                    rise, and in its chain of reflections revealing the matured thoughts and wide
                    reading of its author, while opening up hidden depths in the Berkeleiau
                    metaphysics. In 1751 his eldest son died, and in 1752 he removed with his family
                    to Oxford for the sake of his son George, who was studying there. On the
                    evening<pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit03newyrich/page/n608/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0903-0608-0591"/> of the 14th January 1753, he expired suddenly and
                    painlessly in the midst of his family. And thus quietly closed one of the purest
                    and most beautiful lives on record. His remains were deposited in Christ Church,
                    Oxford.</p>
                <p>Although Berkeley’s new principle is susceptible of brief statement, it is by no
                    means equally possible to give in short compass an adequate account of its
                    systematic application to the several problems of philosophy. It may be
                    sufficient here to indicate generally the relation of the new conception to
                    preceding systems, and to inquire how far the principle is metaphysically
                    justifiable. In the philosophies of Descartes and Locke a large share of
                    attention had been directed to the idea of matter, which was held to be the
                    abstract, unperceived background of real experience, and was supposed to give
                    rise to our ideas of external things through its action on the sentient mind.
                    Knowledge being limited to the ideas produced could never extend to the
                    unperceived matter, or substance, or cause which produced them, and it became a
                    problem for speculative science to deten..ine the grounds for the very belief in
                    its existence. Philosophy seemed about to end in scepticism or in materialism.
                    Now Berkeley put this whole problem in a new light by pointing out that a
                    preliminary question must be raised and answered. Before we deduce results from
                    such abstract ideas as cause, substance, matter, we must ask what in reality do
                    these mean,—what is the actual content of consciousness which corresponds to
                    these words! <hi rend="italic">Do</hi> not all these ideas, when held to
                    represent something which exists absolutely apart from all knowledge of it,
                    involve a contradiction? Are they not truly, when so regarded, inconceivable,
                    and mere arbitrary figments which cannot {&gt;ossibly be realized in
                    consciousness? In putting this question, not ess than in answering it, consists
                    Berkeley’s distinct originality as a philosopher. The essence of the answer, as
                    has been already seen, is that the universe is inconceivable apart from
                    mind,—that existence, as such, denotes conscious spirits and the objects of
                    consciousness. Matter and external things, in so far as they are thought to have
                    an existence beyond the circle of consciousness, are impossible, inconceivable,
                    absurd. External things are things known to us in immediate perception. To this
                    conclusion Berkeley seems, in the first place, to have been led by the train of
                    reflection that naturally conducts to subjective or egoistic idealism. It is
                    impossible to overstep the limits of self-consciousness; whatever Avoids I use,
                    whatever notions I have, must refer to and find their meaning in facts of
                    consciousness. And there can be no doubt that in certain earlier aspects of his
                    theory, where, for example, it appears as a mere analysis of what is meant by
                    <hi rend="italic">reality,</hi> it does not rise above this subjective
                    stand-point. But this is by no means the whole or even the principal part of
                    Berkeley’s philosophy; it is essentially a theory of causality, and this is
                    brought out gradually under the pressure of difficulties in the first solution
                    of the early problem. To merely subjective idealism, sense percepts differ from
                    ideas of imagination in degree, not in kind; both belong to the individual mind.
                    To Berkeley, however, the difference is fundamental; sense ideas are not due to
                    our own activity, they do not result from our will; they must therefore be
                    produced by some other will,—by the divine intelligence. Sense experience is
                    thus the constant action upon our minds of supreme active intellect, and is not
                    the consequence of dead inert matter. It might appear, therefore, that sensible
                    things had an objective existence in the mind of God; that an idea so soon as it
                    passes out of our consciousness passes into that of God. This is an
                    interpretation, frequently and not without some justice, put upon Berkeley’s own
                    expression. But it is not a satisfactory account of his theory. Berkeley is
                    compelled to see that an immediate perception is not a <hi rend="italic"
                    >thing,</hi> and that what we consider permanent or substantial is not a
                    sensation but a group of qualities, which in ultimate analysis means sensations
                    either immediately felt or such as our experience has taught us would be felt in
                    conjunction with these. Our belief in the reality of a thing may therefore be
                    said to mean assurance that this association in our minds between actual and
                    possible sensations is somehow guaranteed. Further, Berkeley’s own theory would
                    never permit him to speak of possible sensations, meaning by that the ideas of
                    sensations called up to our minds by present experience. He could never have
                    held that these afforded any explanation of the permanent existence of real
                    objects. His theory is quite distinct from this, which really amounts to nothing
                    more than subjective idealism. External things are produced by the will of the
                    divine intelligence; they are caused, and caused in a regular order; there
                    exist' in the divine mind archetypes, of which sense experience may be said to
                    be the realization in our finite minds. Our belief in the permanence of
                    something which corresponds to the association in our minds of actual and
                    possible sensations means belief in the orderliness of nature; and <hi
                    rend="italic">that</hi> is merely assurance that the universe is pervaded and
                    regulated by mind. Human science is occupied in endeavouring to decipher the
                    divine ideas which find realization in our limited experience, in trying to
                    interpret’ the divine language of ’ which natural things are the words and
                    letters, and in striving to bring human conceptions into harmony with the divine
                    thoughts. Instead, therefore, of fate or necessity, or matter, or the unknown, a
                    living, active mind is looked upon as the centre and spring of the universe, and
                    this is the essence of the Berkeleian metaphysics.</p>
                <p>It may be safely said that the deeper aspects of Berkeley’s new thought have been
                    almost universally neglected or misunderstood. Of his spiritual empiricism only
                    one side has been accepted by later thinkers, and has been looked upon as the
                    whole. The subjective mechanism of association which with Berkeley is but part
                    of the true explanation, and is dependent on the objective realization in the
                    divine mind, has been received as in itself a satisfactory theory. <hi
                    rend="italic">Sunt</hi><hi rend="italic">Cogitationes</hi> has been regarded by
                    thinkers who profess them· selves Berkeleians as the one proposition warranted
                    by consciousness; the empiricism of his philosophy has been eagerly welcomed,
                    while the spiritual intuition, without which the whole is to Berkeley
                    meaningless, has been cast aside. For this he is himself in no small measure to
                    blame. The deeper spiritual intuition, present from the first, was only brought
                    into clear relief in order to meet difficulties in the earlier statements; and
                    the extension of the intuition itself beyond the limits of our own
                    consciousness, which completely removes his position from mere subjectivism,
                    rests on foundations uncritically assumed, and at first sight irreconcilable
                    with certain positions of his system. The necessity and universality of the
                    judgments of causality and substantiality are taken for granted; and there is no
                    investigation of the place held by these notions in the mental constitution. The
                    relation between the divine mind and finite intelligence, at first thought as
                    that of agent and recipient, is complicated and obscure when the necessity for
                    explaining the permanence of real things comes forward. The divine archetypes,
                    according to which sensible experience is regulated and in which it finds its
                    real objectivity, are different in kind frommere sense ideas, and the question
                    then arises whether in these we have not again the “things as they are,” which
                    Berkeley at first so contemptuously dismissed. He leaves it undetermined whether
                    or not our knowledge of sense things, which is never entirely presentative,
                    involves some reference to this objective course of nature or thought of the
                    divine mind. And if so, what is the nature of the notions necessarily implied in
                    the simplest knowledge of a <hi rend="italic">thing,</hi> as distinct from mere
                    sense feeling? That in knowing objects certain thoughts are implied which are
                    not presentations or their copies, is at times dimly seen by Berkeley himself;
                    but he was content to propound a question with regard to those notions, and to
                    look upon them as merely Locke’s ideas of relation. Such ideas of relation are
                    in truth the stumbling-block in Locke’s philosophy, and Berkeley’s empiricism is
                    equally far from accounting for them.</p>
                <p>With all these defects, however, Berkeley’s new conception marks a distinct stage
                    of progress in human thought. His true place in the history of speculation may
                    be seen from the simple observation that the difficulties or obscurities in his
                    scheme are really the points on which later philosophy has turned. He once for
                    all lifted the problem of metaphysics to a higher level, and, in conjunction
                    with his great successor, Hume, determined the form into which later
                    metaphysical questions have been thrown.</p>
