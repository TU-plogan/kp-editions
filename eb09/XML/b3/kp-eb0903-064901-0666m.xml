                <p><label type="entry">BIBLE SOCIETIES</label>, associations for extending the
                    circulation of the Holy Scriptures. For a long period this object has been
                    pursued to a considerable extent by several religious institutions, such as the
                    Society for the Propagation of the Gospel in Wales, formed by the Rev. Thomas
                    Gouge, one of the two thousand ministers ejected by the Act of Uniformity in
                    1662; the Society for Promoting Christian Knowledge, founded in 1698; the
                    Society for sending Missionaries to India, established in the year 1705 by
                    Frederick IV., King of Denmark, and which numbered among its agents the
                    celebrated missionary, Christian Frederick Schwartz; the Society for Promoting
                    Christian Knowledge in the Highlands and Islands of Scotland, formed in
                    Edinburgh in 1709; the Moravian Missionary Society, founded in 1732 , the Book
                    Society for Promoting Religious Knowledge among the Poor, which was formed in
                    London in 1750, and numbered among its earliest friends Dr Doddridge and the
                    Rev. James Hervey; and the Religious Tract Society, founded in 1779. But the
                    first British association which had in view the single purpose of disseminating
                    the Scriptures was the <hi rend="smallcaps">Naval and Military Bible
                    Society,</hi> established in the year 1780, which has done immense service to
                    the army and navy of Great Britain. The sphere of its operations, however, was
                    comparatively limited, and in 1804 the <hi rend="smallcaps">British and Foreign
                    Bible Society,</hi> the greatest agency ever devised for the diffusion of the
                    Word of God, was founded. The proposal to institute this association originated
                    with the Rev. Mr Charles of Bala, whose philanthropic labours in Wales were
                    greatly impeded by the scarcity of the Scriptures in the principality, and it
                    was largely fostered at the outset by members of the committee of the Religious
                    Tract Society. The exclusive object of the British and Foreign Bible Society is
                    to promote the circulation of the Scriptures, both at home and abroad, and its
                    constitution admits the co-operation of all persons disposed to concur in its
                    support. The committee of management consists of 36 laymen, 6 of them being
                    foreigners resident in or near the metropolis, and of the remaining 30, one-half
                    are members of the Church of England, and the other half members of other
                    Christian denominations.</p>
                <p>The proceedings of this society gave rise to several controversies, one of which
                    related to the fundamental law of the society to circulate the Bible alone
                    without notes or comments. On this ground it was vehemently attacked by Bishop
                    Marsh and other divines of the Church of England, who insisted that the
                    Prayer-Book ought to be given along with the Bible. Another controversy, in
                    which the late Dr Andrew Thomson of Edinburgh took a prominent part, related to
                    the circulation on the Continent, chiefly by affiliated societies, of the
                    Apocrypha along with the canonical books of Scripture In 1826 it was resolved by
                    the committee that the fundamental law of the society be fully and distinctly
                    recognized as excluding the circulation of the Apocrypha. This step, however,
                    failed to satisfy all the supporters of the society in Scotland, who proceeded
                    to form themselves into independent associations. A third serious controversy by
                    which the society has been agitated, was occasioned by the alleged inaccuracy of
                    some of the translations issued under its authority; and a fourth referred to
                    the admissibility of non-Trinitarians to the privilege of co-operation. The
                    refusal of the society in 1831 to alter its constitution so as formally to
                    exclude such persons, led to the formation of the Trinitarian Bible Society.
                    This has, however, been exceedingly limited in its operations, and the original
                    society stands unrivalled.</p>
                <p>By a law of the British and Foreign Bible Society, no translations are adopted or
                    circulated in the languages of the United Kingdom except the Authorized Version.
                    For other countries the best ancient or received versions are printed; and in t
                    e case of new translations, every effort is made to ascertain their strict
                    fidelity and general literary merit. Most of the versions for countries not yet
                    enlightened by Christianity are made’ by resident missionaries; and these the
                    society prints at the instance of the missionary societies for whose use they
                    arc chiefly intended. These versions are made, wherever practicable, from the
                    original Hebrew or Greek text. The society has had a share, direct or indirect,
                    in the translation, printing, or distribution of Scriptures in 210 languages or
                    dialects, the number of versions thus printed being 269. Altogether the society
                    has put into circulation nearly 74 million Bibles, Testaments, and Portions
                    (i.e., single books of the Bible); and its expenditure for this purpose has
                    amounted to £7,750,000.</p>
                <p>In the course of 1874 there were issued from the society’s dépôts, at home and
                    abroad, no fewer than 2,619,427 Bibles, Testaments, and Portions. The free
                    income for 1874-5 amounted to £119,093, 7s. 7d.; adding the contributions for
                    special objects, and the proceeds by sale of Scriptures, a total is reached of
                    £222,191, 5s. 6cL The payments for translating, printing, and circulating the
                    Scriptures were only £691 in the first year of the society’s existence; while in
                    1874-75 they were £217,390, 13s. Id.</p>
                <p>Immediately after the foundation of the society an extensive correspondence was
                    opened with ministers and laymen in all parts of the world.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Auxiliary and Branch Societies</hi> were gradually formed in
                    every district of the United Kingdom and in the colonies. These became centres
                    whence the Scriptures might be obtained at cost price, and in cases of special
                    need at even less. There are at present in the United Kingdom 4496 auxiliaries
                    and branches, besides 1208 in the British colonies. Many of these are managed by
                    ladies. Juvenile associations have also been organized in many localities.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Agents</hi> have been appointed both at home and abroad to
                    investigate local requirements, to supply information for the guidance of the
                    committee, and to suggest the best means of carrying out the great purpose of
                    the society.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Dépôts</hi> for the sale of Scriptures have likewise been
                    opened in almost every town of England, and in many places abroad.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Colportage</hi> is employed to some extent in England, and very
                    largely on the Continent and in India.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Grants to Societies</hi> are made on various conditions. When
                    applied for by missionary societies and philanthropic institutions, copies of
                    the Scriptures are supplied very freely; while grants of money and paper are
                    made to other societies in aid of the translation and printing of the
                    Scriptures, when good reasons are seen for the expenditure.</p>
                <p>It may be added that the society does not encourage the <hi rend="italic"
                    >gratuitous</hi> distribution of Bibles and Testaments, except under peculiar
                    circumstances.</p>
                <p>The first English New Testament printed by the society was issued in September
                    1805. Stereotype printing had just been introduced; and this invention, coupled
                    with the society’s plan of selling the Scriptures at a very low price, brought
                    about a speedy and general reduction in the price of English Bibles. Besides
                    this indirect benefit which has thus been secured to English readers, the
                    investigations and exertions of the society first revealed, and then relieved,
                    the great scarcity of Bibles which had previously existed. To show what the
                    deficiency was, it may be mentioned that in 1812 inquiry was made into the case
                    of 17,000 families in the metropolis, when it was discovered that half of them
                    did not possess a Bible at all.</p>
                <p>The efforts of the society in India are organized upon a scale and with a
                    completeness scarcely rivalled elsewhere. Bible circulation in India owes its
                    origin mainly to the zeal of the Serampore missionaries, especially of Carey,
                    Marshman, and Ward, whose labours had begun shortly before the Bible Society was
                    formed. It was stimulated by the exertions of Dr Claudius Buchanan, and by the
                    establishment of the college at Fort William. Gradually auxiliarysocieties were
                    formed at important centres—such as Calcutta, Bombay, Madras, Allahabad, &amp;c.
                    One of these auxiliaries alone—that at Madras—circulated in 1874-75 over 120,000
                    copies, and employed 55 native colporteurs. The assistance afforded by the
                    society to India and Ceylon in grants of money, paper, and books—including
                    £27,230 supplied to Dr Carey and his associates—amounts to no less a sum than
                    £361,193.</p>
                <p>When the society began to inquire into the state of the Continent, the dearth of
                    Scriptures was found to be greater, if possible, than at home. Thus, in
                    Lithuania, among 18,000 Germans, 7800 Polish, and 7000 Lithuanian families, not
                    a Bible was to be found. One half of the population of Holland appeared to be
                    without the Scriptures. In Poland a Bible could hardly be obtained at any.price.
                    In the district of Dorpat (Esthonia), containing 106,000 inhabitants, not 200
                    Testaments were to be found, and there were Christian pastors who did not
                    possess the Scriptures in the dialect in which they preached. Into Iceland, with
                    a population of 50,000, of whom almost all could read, not above 40 or 50 copies
                    had penetrated; while in Sweden a single auxiliary found 13,900 families totally
                    unprovided.</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit03newyrich/page/n667/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0903-0667-0650"/>
                <p>Such was the state of things abroad when the society was established.
                    Correspondence was at once opened, with well-known men like Oberlin, Knapp, and
                    Herzog; the society s foreign secretary and agents personally visited tho
                    districts, and various subsidiary societies were formed. The highest patronage
                    was eften obtained for these, the emperor of Russia, the kings of Prussia,
                    Bavaria, Sweden, and Wurtemberg, and many others, entering heartily into the
                    work. Some of the societies thus formed were, however, suppressed through the
                    influence of Rome. More than 15,000,000 copies have been printed by them up to
                    the present time.</p>
                <p>Of all the foreign Bible societies, by far the most remarkable was that
                    established in Russia, in the year 1812, under the presidency of Prince
                    Galitzin, and with the direct approval and support of the Emperor Alexander I.
                    An imperial ukase was issued, giving formal sanction to the project; all
                    communities joined to speed it on its way; 289 auxiliaries were rapidly formed;
                    the Scriptures were printed in nearly 30 languages, including Modem Russ;
                    861,000 copies were circulated; and at the time of its suspension in 1826 it had
                    been aided by the British and Foreign Bible Society to the extent of
                    £16,833.</p>
                <p>Besides thus encouraging Bible circulation through friend!ycounsel and pecuniary
                    aid, the British and Foreign Bible Society has done and is doing a direct work
                    on the Continent, some illustration of which may be gathered from the following
                    particulars :—</p>
                <p>The first French Bible printed by the society was prepared for the prisoners of
                    war in 1805. After the peace was concluded, measures were taken to form centres
                    of Bible circulation through the country. As a result of these movements,
                    various Bible societies sprang up. Dépôts have also been opened in Paris and
                    many other large towns; and special provision has been made for the provincials
                    of the west, by the preparation of Basque and Breton versions. There have been
                    printed by the society, in the French tongue, upwards of seven and a half
                    million copies of the Scriptures.</p>
                <p>In 1835, when Mr W. P. Tiddy went out as agent for the society in Belgium, hardly
                    a Bible was to be found in the country, and evangelistic efforts were rare,
                    through the vehement opposition which they encountered. A staff of colporteurs
                    was appointed, and through their efforts a large supply of Scriptures was
                    distributed. This led to the formation of several Protestant communities.</p>
                <p>The society’s agent in Germany superintends the movements of between 60 and 70
                    colporteurs, and reports a yearly circulation of about 300,000 copies. The
                    services rendered during the Franco-Prussian war were so signal as to call forth
                    not only the grateful appreciation of the Germans, but a written acknowledgment
                    from the emperor, who is himself an annual subscriber to the society.</p>
                <p>Efforts were made by Dr Pinkerton in 1816 to establish a National Bible Society
                    for Austria; but through the influence of the Pope the emperor was induced to
                    reject the proposal. A new beginning was made in 1850, when in less than two
                    years 41,659 copies of the Scriptures, in German, Bohemian, and Hungarian, were
                    put into circulation. Fresh opposition was, however, soon awakened, and the
                    authorities ordered the whole stock on hand to be withdrawn from the country. In
                    compliance with this order, Mr E. Millard, the society’s agent, retired to
                    Prussia, where he laboured for several years with marked success. After a while
                    he was permitted to return to Vienna, and to open dépôts at such centres as
                    Pesth, Trieste, Klausenburg, and Prague. By these means, and through a large
                    staff of colporteurs, he has issued during the past ten years 1,250,000
                    copies.</p>
                <p>Very little direct work was done in Italy until the Revolution of 1848. Then the
                    society gladly hailed the opportunity of entering the country; but soon the door
                    was again closed. The Pope issued an encyclical in 1849, in which the
                    condemnation of Bible societies was emphatically repeated. As a consequence,
                    3000 New Testaments, just printed at Florence, were seized, presses were
                    confiscated, paper and type carried off, and the society’s agent compelled to
                    retire. All this is now altered. The headquarters of the society’s Italian
                    agency are at Rome, and the Scriptures are distributed from dépôts and by
                    colporteurs in all parts of the peninsula.</p>
                <p>Little could be done in Spain prior to the Revolution of 1868, which threw open
                    the country and established religious liberty. All available means were then
                    adopted for printing and circulating the Spanish Bible. The issues from the
                    Madrid depot have exceeded half a million copies, but during the recent civil
                    troubles the movements of the colporteurs have been much restricted.</p>
                <p>Between 300,000 and 400,000 copies of the Scriptures have been printed in the
                    Portuguese tongue.</p>
                <p>Mr Paterson paid a visit to Sweden in 1809 on behalf of the society, and found
                    the poor almost entirely without the Scriptures. Thus in one diocese 10,000
                    families were discovered without a Bible in their possession. An agency was
                    established in 1831. Special grants have been made to the army and navy, and for
                    the students in the universities. The total issues since 1832 have been over
                    2,000,000, and that in a population of less than 4,000,000.</p>
                <p>To give even an outline of the work done by the British and Foreign Bible Society
                    in the more remote parts of the world would be to write a volume. All the great
                    missionary societies are its debtors. Its undenominational character has secured
                    what could hardly otherwise have been attained—the use of the same version by
                    missionaries of different churches; and it has often proved a healer and a
                    peace-maker abroad, while it has been a bond of union at home. To the linguist
                    and to the comparative philologist its operations are of intense interest; and
                    the boon conferred on the thought and language of many natione through its
                    versions of the Scriptures is well-nigh inestimable.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="smallcaps">Edinburgh Bible Society</hi> originated in the
                    controversy respecting the circulation of the Apocrypha, and was composed of
                    Protestants professing their belief in the doctrine of the Holy Trinity, and
                    disposed to co-operate in promoting the dissemination of the Scriptures.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="smallcaps">Scottish Bible Society</hi> was instituted upwards of
                    forty years ago. At the time of its establishment, the other Bible societies'in
                    Scotland employed their funds chiefly in circulating the Scriptures in foreign
                    countries. This association was intended exclusively for the distribution of the
                    Bible at home, and its funds were at first derived from collections made in the
                    parish churches within the Synod of Lothian and Tweeddale.</p>
                <p>The Scotch Bible societies were amalgamated in 1861, and took the name of the <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">National Bible Society of Scotland.</hi> During the year 1874
                    the society issued 340,908 Bibles, Testaments, and “Portions,” its receipts,
                    including the proceeds of sales, amounting to £26,840.</p>
                <p>The first Bible society in America is believed to have been established by a few
                    Baptists in New York in 1804; its object was to purchase and lend Bibles for a
                    month at a time. The <hi rend="smallcaps">Philadelphia Bible Society,</hi> which
                    was instituted December 12, 1808, was for some years the only association in the
                    country for the gratuitous distribution of the sacred Scriptures. The <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">American Bible Society</hi> was formed at New York, May 8,
                    1817. It has numerous auxiliaries throughout the several states of the Union. In
                    1875 its income amounted to $577,569. Its issues during that year were 926,900
                    Bibles and Testaments, and since its formation 31,893,332.</p>
                <p>Among other societies may be mentioned the <hi rend="smallcaps">Bible Translation
                    Society,</hi> whose versions embody the views of the Baptists, and the <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Porteusian Bible Society</hi> (named from Bishop Porteus), for
                    the circulation of Bibles marked so as to show the practical bearing of each
                    chapter.</p>
                <p>It is believed that there are altogether about 7 0 Bible societies in the world.
                    The issues of the 7 leading societies may be summarized as follows :—</p>

                <p>The monopoly of the right to print the Bible in England is still possessed by the
                    Universities of Oxford and Cambridge, and her Majesty’s printer for England. But
                    after a controversy, which was carried on for some time with great warmth
                    (1840-41), the prices of the common Bibles and Testaments were greatly reduced,
                    and they have gradually attained their present remarkable cheapness.</p>
                <p>In Scotland, on the expiry of the monopoly in 1839, Parliament refused to renew
                    the patent, and appointed a Bible Board for Scotland, with power to grant
                    licences to print the Authorized Version of the Scriptures. This step produced a
                    great reduction in the price of the sacred volume, and its circulation was
                    considerably increased.</p>
