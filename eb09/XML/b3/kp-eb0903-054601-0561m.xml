                    Glaucus of Corinth, who is spoken of as a son of Poseidon, and in some way
                    himself a marine deity. To account for the name, <hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi>
                    “slayer of Belleros,” an otherwise unknown hero of this name was invented. But
                    it is by no means certain that « Belleros” is a personal name; it may mean
                    nothing more than “monster.”</p>
                <p>The first act of Bellerophon was to capture the horse Pegasus, when it alighted
                    on the Acrocorinth to drink at the fountain of Peirene, with a bridle which he
                    found by his side on awaking from sleep beside the altar Of Athene, where he had
                    laid himself down on the advice of a seer Polyidus. The goddess had appeared to
                    him in a dream, reached him a golden bridle, and told him to sacrifice a white
                    bull to his father Poseidon. The next incident occurs in Tiryns, at the court of
                    Proetus, who⅛e wife, Stheneboea (or Anteia, as Homer calls her), failing to
                    seduce Bellerophon, charges him with an attempt on her virtue <hi rend="italic"
                    >{∏iad,</hi> vi. 150-211). Proetus now sends him to Iobates, his wife’s father,
                    the king of Lycia, with a letter or sealed tablet, in which were instructions,
                    apparently by means of signs, to take the life of the bearer. Arriving in Lycia,
                    he was received as a guest and entertained for nine days. On the tenth, being
                    asked the object of his visit, he handed the letter to the king, whose first
                    plan for complying with it was to send him to slay the Chimaera, a monster which
                    was devastating the country. Its forepart was that of a lion, its hindpart that
                    of a serpent; a goat’s head sprang from its back, and fire was vomited from its
                    mouth. Bellerophon, mounted on Pegasus, kept up in the air out of the way of the
                    Chimaera, but yet near enough to kill it with his spear, or as he is at other
                    times represented, with his sword or with a bow. He was next ordered out against
                    the Solymi, a hostile tribe, and afterwards against the Amazons, from both of
                    which expeditions he not only returned victorious, but also on his way back slew
                    an ambush of chosen warriors whom Iobates had placed to intercept him. His
                    divine origin was now proved; the king gave him his daughter in marriage; and
                    the Lycians presented him with a large and fertile estate on which he lived, and
                    reached the pinnacle of happiness, surrounded by two sons, Isander and
                    Hippolochus, and one daughter, Laodamia. But, as in the case of Hercules, the
                    gods now punished him with frenzy. His son Isander fell in battle; his daughter
                    was slain by Artemis; and he himself wandered in the “plain of madness” (πiδiov
                    ’ <hi rend="italic">A.ληlov').</hi> The cause of his misfortune, Pindar <hi
                    rend="italic">{Isthm.,</hi> vii. 44; <hi rend="italic">Olymp.,</hi> xiii. 91)
                    says, was his ambitious attempt to mount to the heavens on Pegasus.</p>
                <p>The early relations between Lycia and Argolis are attested by the tradition that
                    the walls of Mycenae had been built by Cyclopes from Lycia. In both districts
                    the worship of the sun-god had exercised great influence in very early times.
                    The two most frequent representations of Bellerophon in ancient art are (1) when
                    he slays the Chimaera, and (2) when he departs from Argos with the letter. Among
                    the first is to be noted a terra-cotta relief from Melos in the British Museum,
                    where also, on a vase of black ware, is what seems to be a representation of his
                    escape from Stheneboea.</p>
