                    concerns, with the exception of the Sheffield Banking Company, of which he was
                    chairman for many years. Although an ardent Liberal of most advanced views, he
                    took little or no active part in political affairs. On two occasions, at the
                    earnest solicitation of his numerous friends and admirers, he stood for
                    Sheffield, but without success. The “Bentham of Hallamshire,” as he has been
                    called, was of too retiring a disposition, and had too much of the philosophical
                    politician about him to win the admiration or suffrages of an ordinary body of
                    electors. His life is for the most part a history of hi3 numerous and varied
                    publications, and his name is known to a very limited circle. The intimation of
                    his sudden death on the 18th January 1870, with the subsequent notice of his
                    munificent gift of £90,000 to his native town, excited some curiosity and
                    interest, which, however, quickly died away. This is not quite as it should be.
                    Bailey has certainly given to the world no work of first-rate importance, but
                    there are few authors of modern times who have written more elegantly and
                    clearly, or with more originality of treatment, on the various problems of
                    psychology and political science. His first work, <hi rend="italic">Essays on
                    the Formation and Publication of Opinions,</hi> published anonymously in 1821
                    (2d ed. 1826, 3d ed. 1837), a thoughtful, practical, and clearly written
                    treatise, has attracted a greater share of public attention and favour than any
                    of his other writings. A sequel to it appeared in 1829, <hi rend="italic">Essays
                    on the Pursuit of Truth, on the Progress of Knowledge, and on the Fundamental
                    Principle of all Evidence and Expectation</hi> (2d ed. 1844). Intermediate
                    between these two were <hi rend="italic">Questions on Political Economy,
                    Politics, Morals,dec.,</hi> 1823, and a <hi rend="italic">Critical Dissertation
                    on the Nature, Measure, and Causes of Value,</hi> directed against the opinions
                    of Ricardo and his school. His next publications were also on economic or
                    political subjects, <hi rend="italic">Rationale of Political
                    Representation,</hi> 1835, and <hi rend="italic">Money audits Vicissitudes,</hi>
                    1837; about the same time also appeared some of his pamphlets, <hi rend="italic"
                    >Discussion of Parliamentary Reform, Right of Primogeniture Examined, Defence of
                    Joint-Stock Banks.</hi> Bailey seems then to have turned his attention almost
                    entirely to speculative philosophy. In 1842 appeared his <hi rend="italic"
                    >Review of Berkeley's Theory of Vision,</hi> an acute and able work, which
                    called forth rejoinders from J. S. Mill in the <hi rend="italic">Westminster
                    Review</hi> (reprinted in <hi rend="italic">Dissertations),</hi> and from
                    Ferrier in <hi rend="italic">Blackwood</hi> (reprinted in <hi rend="italic"
                    >Lectures and Remains,</hi> ii.) Bailey replied to his critics in <hi
                    rend="italic">A Letter to a Philosopher, dec.,</hi> 1843. In 1851 he published
                    one of his best works, <hi rend="italic">Theory of Reasoning</hi> (2d ed. 1852),
                    a thoughtful discussion of the nature of inference, and an able criticism of the
                    functions and value of the syllogism. In 1852 he published <hi rend="italic"
                    >Discourses on Various Subjects;</hi> and finally summed up his philosophic
                    views in the <hi rend="italic">Letters on the Philosophy of the Human Mind</hi>
                    (three series, 1855, 1858, 1863), which is at once the most considerable and the
                    most valuable of his contributions to mental science. Bailey had not entirely
                    given himself up to abstract studies; in 1845 he had ventured on poetical
                    composition. <hi rend="italic">Maro,</hi> a poem in four cantos (85 pp.,
                    Longmans), contains a somewhat lively description of the mental state of a young
                    poet who printed 1000 copies of his first poem, of which only 10 were sold. He
                    had also been a diligent student of Shakespeare, and his last literary work was
                    the treatise, in two volumes, <hi rend="italic">On the Received Text of</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Shakespeares</hi><hi rend="italic">Dramatic Writings and its
                    Improvement.</hi> It must be confessed that many of the emendations suggested by
                    him are more fantastic than felicitous.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Letters</hi> contain, in clear and lively language, a very
                    fresh discussion of many of the principal problems in philosophy, or rather in
                    psychology. Bailey can hardly be classed as belonging either to the strictly
                    empirical or to the idealist school, but his general tendency is towards the
                    former. The following are the most interesting points in his work :—(1.) In
                    regard to method, he founds psychology entirely on introspection; critical study
                    of one’s own consciousness is, according to him, the only means of obtaining
                    materials for philosophy. He thus, to a certain extent, agrees with the Scotch
                    school, but he differs from them in rejecting altogether the doctrine of mental
                    faculties. What have been designated faculties are, upon his view, merely
                    classified facts or phenomena of consciousness. He criticises very severely the
                    habitual use of figurative or metaphorical language in describing mental
                    operations. (2.) His doctrine of perception, which is, in brief, that “the
                    perception of external things through the organs of sense is a direct mental act
                    or phenomenon of consciousness not susceptible of being resolved into anything
                    else,” and the reality of which can be neither proved nor disproved, is not
                    worked out in detail, but is supported by elaborate and sometimes subtle
                    criticisms of all other theories. Upon this point Bailey’s remarks are deserving
                    of attention. (3.) With regard to general and abstract ideas and general
                    propositions, his opinions are those of the empirical school, but his analysis
                    frequently puts the matter in a new light, and brings forward points of novelty.
                    (4.) In the theory of morals Bailey is an advocate of Utilitarianism, and works
                    out with great skill the steps in the formation of the “complex” mental facts
                    involved in the recognition of duty, obligation, right. His handling of the
                    moral sentiments <hi rend="italic">{Letters,</hi> iii. 193-258) is one of the
                    best specimens of his general style of psychological analysis.</p>
