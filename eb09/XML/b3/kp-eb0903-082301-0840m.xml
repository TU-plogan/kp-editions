                    While attending the elementary school there, he gave evidence of such ability
                    that his father sent him, after he had acquired some knowledge of Latin and
                    Greek, in his sixteenth year, to the gymnasium at Lübeck, where he spent three
                    years, and there imbibed so great a love for the languages of antiquity, that he
                    abandoned the idea of a legal career, which he had once entertained, and
                    resolved to devote himself to the study of theology. After spending some time at
                    the University of Kiel, he repaired to Berlin, and there, from 1814 to 1817,
                    enjoyed the instructions of De Wette, Neander, and Schleiermacher. The teaching
                    of these distinguished men, especially of the last named, exercised a decisive
                    influence upon the whole of his after life. So highly were his merits
                    appreciated by his professors—Schleiermacher was accustomed to say of Bleek that
                    he possessed a special <hi rend="italic">charisma</hi> for the science of
                    “Introduction”—that in 1818, after he had passed the <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit03newyrich/page/n841/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0903-0841-0824"/> necessary examinations for entering the church,
                    he was recalled to Berlin to occupy the position of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Repetent</hi> or tutor in theology, a temporary post which the theological
                    faculty had obtained for him, with a view of retaining his services in
                    connection with that department of the university. In this position, besides
                    discharging his duties in the theological seminary, he published, in
                    Schleiermacher’s and Liicke’s <hi rend="italic">Journal</hi> (1819, 1820, 1822),
                    two dissertations, one on the “Origin and Composition of the Sibylline Oracles,”
                    and another on the “Authorship and Design of the Book of Daniel.” These articles
                    attracted much attention, and were distinguished by those qualities of solid
                    learning thorough investigation, and candour of judgment, which characterized
                    all the productions of his pen. Bleek’s merits as a rising scholar were
                    recognized by the minister of public instruction, who continued his stipend as
                    <hi rend="italic">Repetent</hi> for a third year, and promised further
                    advancement in due time. But the attitude of the political authority underwent a
                    change. The excitement caused in academic circles by the dismissal of De Wette
                    from his professorship in 1819, in consequence of certain injudicious
                    expressions in the letter of sympathy which he had written to the mother of
                    Sands, the murderer of Kotzebue, had not died out, and the odium and punishment
                    which fell upon De Wette were shared in a greater or less degree by his friends.
                    Bleek, who had been a favourite pupil of the banished professor, incurred the
                    suspicion of the Government as one who was believed to hold extreme democratic
                    opinions. Not only was his stipend as <hi rend="italic">Repetent</hi>
                    discontinued, but his nomination to the office of extraordinary professor, which
                    had already been signed by the minister Altenstein, was withheld for two years.
                    The mystery at last was cleared up. Bleek had been confounded with another
                    individual of a similar name, one Baueleven Blech. Tardy justice was at length
                    done, and in 1823 Bleek received the appointment to which his merits so well
                    entitled him.</p>
                <p>During the six years that Bleek remained at Berlin he twice declined a call to
                    the office of ordinary professor of theology, once to Greifswald and once to
                    Königsberg. In 1829, however, he was induced, on the death of Lücke, to accept
                    his chair in the recently-founded university of Bonn, and entered upon his
                    duties there in the summer of the same year. For the space of thirty years he
                    laboured with ever increasing success, attracting students to his lectures, not
                    by any attractions of manner nor by the enunciation of novel or bizarre opinions
                    on theological subjects, but by the soundness and thoroughness of his
                    investigations, the remarkable impartiality of his critical judgments, and the
                    exceeding clearness of his method of presentation. In 1843 he was raised to the
                    office of consistorial councillor, and was selected by the university to hold
                    the office of rector, a distinction which has not since been conferred upon any
                    theologian of the Reformed Church. After a long and honoured academic life he
                    died suddenly of apoplexy on the 27th February 1859, having been able to lecture
                    to his students as usual on the previous day.</p>
                <p>Bleek’s works belong entirely to the departments of Biblical criticism and
                    exegesis. His great merits as a critic and exegete consist, as has been already
                    observed, in the thoroughness of his investigations, and especially in the
                    candour of his judgment The latter quality, indeed, he possessed in so
                    remarkable a degree, that, as a recent writer ha3 remarked, it has become
                    “proverbial.” His views, indeed, on questions of <hi rend="italic">Old</hi>
                    Testament criticism would be regarded in this country as those of the “advanced”
                    school; for on all the disputed points concerning the unity and authorship of
                    the books of the Old Covenant he was led to form conclusions opposed to received
                    opinions. But with respect to the <hi rend="italic">New</hi> Testament, his
                    position was highly conservative. His defence of the genuineness and
                    authenticity of the gospel of St John is still regarded as the ablest that has
                    yet appeared; and although, on some minor points, his views did not altogether
                    coincide with those of the traditional school, his critical labours on the New
                    Testament must nevertheless be regarded as among the most important
                    contributions to the maintenance of orthodox opinions that the present century
                    has produced. Bleek’s works were published partly during his lifetime, and
                    partly after his death. His greatest work, his commentary on the epistle to the
                    Hebrews <hi rend="italic">(Brief an die</hi><hi rend="italic">Hebräer erläutert
                    durch Einleitung, TJeb er Setzung, und fortlaufenden</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Commentar)</hi> appeared in three parts, in 1828, 1836, and 1840 respectively.
                    Of it De Wette said that “It was so distinguished for comprehensive learning and
                    thorough untiring industry, for so pure and transparent a love of truth and so
                    profound a theological feeling, that it was entitled to one of the foremost, if
                    not the very foremost, place among the exegetical works of our time;” and
                    Delitzsch adds that “every one acquainted with the subject will endorse the
                    judgment.” This work was abridged by Bleek for his college lectures, and was
                    published in that condensed form after his death by Pfarrer Windrath in 1868. In
                    1846 he published his contributions to the criticism of the gospels <hi
                    rend="italic">(Beiträge zur Evangelien Kritik,</hi> pt. i.), which contained his
                    defence of St John’s gospel, and which arose out of a review of Ebrard’s <hi
