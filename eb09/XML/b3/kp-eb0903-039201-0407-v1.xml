                        rend="smallcaps">Jean Nicolas, Comte de,</hi> a distinguished actor in the
                    great French Revolution, was born in June 1755. He was a descendant of a noble
                    family in Provence, and at an early age entered the army. He was twice in India
                    with his regiment, but retired from the service after attaining the rank of
                    captain. Like many others, he saw in the Revolution a good opportunity for
                    retrieving his fortunes, which had been ruined by his extravagance and
                    dissipation; and his penetration enabled him to foresee the certain fall of the
                    royalist party. He threw in his lot with the revolutionists, and speedily
                    distinguished himself by his vigour and hardihood. When elected a member of the
                    National Convention, he gave an uncompromising vote for the king’s death; and at
                    the siege of Toulon, where for the first time he met Napoleon, his energetic
                    measures contributed much to the success of the French arms. Robespierre, who
                    hated Barras for his dissolμte habits, and feared him for his boldness,
                    endeavoured to have his name included in one of his prescription lists, but, on
                    the 9th Thermidor 1794 Barras completely overthrew his power. His success from
                    this period was secured; after the 13th Vindémiaire 1795, he was nominated
                    general-in-chief; and after the affair of the 18th Fructidor 1797, in which
                    Augereau played a prominent part, he was practically dictator. Bonaparte’s <hi
                        rend="italic">coup d’etat</hi> of the 18th Brumaire 1799 changed the whole
                    aspect of affairs. Barras, seeing that resistance to his powerful protégé was
                    useless, gave in his resignation, and retired to his country seat. His latter
                    years were spent in various intrigues, in which he showed a strong leaning
                    towards the royalist party. He died in 1829. The character of Barras has little
                    in it that is worthy of admiration. He was dissolute in private life, and can
                    scarcely be said to have had any definite public policy. At the same time he was
                    courageous, prudent, and, on occasions, an able speaker.</p>
