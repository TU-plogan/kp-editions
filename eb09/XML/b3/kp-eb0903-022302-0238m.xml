                    Oxus. The name has been variously spelt Badascian, Balacian, Balakhshan,
                    Balashan, Balaxien and Balaxia. Including Wakhan, it lies between 35° 50' and
                    38° N. lat., and between 69° 30' and 74° 20' E. long. The chief ascertained
                    positions are as follows: Faizâbâd, 37° 2' N., 70° 36' E.; Ishkashm, 36° 45' N.,
                    71° 38' E.; Punja, 37° 5' N., 72° 39' E.; and Karkat Yassin lake, 37° 14' N.,
                    74° 18' E. Its extent from east to west is about 200 miles, and from north to
                    south about 150 miles. On the north it is bounded by Kulab and Darwaz; on the
                    east by the lofty table-land of Pamir; on the south by the Hindu Kush range; and
                    on the west by Kunduz. The Pamir land is the principal watershed of Asia, and
                    Badakhshan forms part of the western water slope constituting the basin of the
                    Oxus. The country is for the most part mountainous, but there are numerous
                    plains and fertile valleys. The general slope of the country is great, since
                    Kunduz is probably not more than 500 feet above the level of the sea, while Lake
                    Victoria, close to the principal watershed, is estimated at 15,600 feet.</p>
                <p>Badakhshan comprises 16 districts. The principal district called Faizâbâd is
                    under the rule of the Mir Mahmüd Shah; the others are dependencies ruled by
                    relatives of the Mir, or by hereditary feudatories. Each ruler is independent,
                    but is bound to aid the Mir of Faizâbâd in time of need. The Mir himself pays
                    tribute to the Amir of Cabul. The other districts besides Faizâbâd are Daraim,
                    Shahr-i-buzurq, Gumbuz,Farakhar, Kishm, Rustak, Rushân, Shighnân, Ishkâshm,
                    Wakhân, Zebak, Minjân,Ragh, Daung, and Asiâbâ. Each district has its
                    sub-divisions. In Faizâbâd there are several fertile tracts; amongst them are
                    the hilly regions of Yaftal and Shewâ, which are thickly populated, the former
                    by Tajiks, and the latter by Turks of the Jakha Moghal tribe; and the plateaus
                    of Argd and Shewâ, of which the former is somewhat higher than the plain of
                    Faizâbâd, about 15 miles in length by about 8 in breadth, and well cultivated,
                    while the latter is still higher, and forms the best and largest pasture ground
                    in Badakhshan. A lake named Sir-i-kol, about 20 miles in circumference, is
                    situated on the Shewâ plateau. In and around Faizâbâd there are numerous
                    excellent fruit and flower gardens; the principal manufactures are cast-iron
                    pots, boots and shoes, and a material woven from silk and cotton, called <hi
                    rend="italic">ilacha.</hi> The district of Jirm, also subject to Mahmùd Shah,
                    comprises numerous rich valleys, as well as the famous mineral region called
                    Yamgan, or “all mines.” The mines yield rubies, lapis lazuli, lead, alum,
                    sal-ammoniac, sulphur, copper, &amp;c. The annual yield of lapis lazuli averages
                    about £1500, which is sold at the rate of seven shillings per pound; it is
                    exported to Russia, Kashmir, and China. The Dasht-Baha-rak is an extensive plain
                    in this district, on which was formerly situated a large city, once the capital
                    of Badakhshan. There are several villages on it, as also the summer residence of
                    the Mir. The caravan route from India to Faizâbâd passes over this plain. The
                    districts of Rustak, Ragh, Kishm, Daraim, and Shahr-i-buzurg are next in
                    importance as regards fertility and population. They abound in fertile hills and
                    plains. The principal cultivated products are wheat, rice, <hi rend="italic"
                    >Cicer arietinum, Phaseolus</hi><hi rend="italic">Mungo,</hi> cotton, linseed,
                    poppy, sesame, apples, grapes, mulberries (which form the principal article of
                    food in these regions), pears, apricots, walnuts, melons, gourds, turnips,
                    radishes, carrots, spinach, leeks, as also numerous garden flowers and timber
                    trees. The districts of Minjan and Rushan are more mountainous, have a cooler
                    climate, and are more sparsely populated than the foregoing. Their inhabitants
                    are also distinct, differing in physical features, creed, language, and habits.
                    The celebrated ruby mines are in Ishkashm; they have not been worked for more
                    than 30 years, except temporarily in 1866. It is, however, suspected that they
                    are worked surreptitiously by the people. They yield the well-known Balas (i.e.,
                    Badakhshan) ruby.</p>
                <p>The principal domesticated animal is the yak. There are also large flocks of
                    sheep, cows, goats, ponies, numerous fine dogs, and Bactrian camels. The more
                    important wild animals are a large wild sheep <hi rend="italic">{O</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">vis poli),</hi> foxes, wolves, jackals, bears, boars, deer, and
                    lions; amongst birds, there are partridges, pheasants, ravens, jays, sparrows,
                    larks, a famous breed of hawks, &lt;tc.</p>
                <p>Badakhshan proper is peopled by Tajiks, Turks, and Arabs, who speak the Persian
                    and Turki languages, and profess the orthodox doctrines of the Mahometan law
                    adopted by the Sunnite sect; while the mountainous districts are inhabited by
                    Tajiks, professing the Shia creed, and speaking distinct dialects in different
                    districts.</p>
                <p>Badakhshan was visited by Hwen Thsang in 630 and 644. The Arabian geographers of
                    the 10th century speak of its mines of ruby and azure, and give notices of the
                    flourishing commerce and large towns of WakshandKhotl, regions which appear
                    either to have in part corresponded with or to have lain close to Badakhshan. In
                    1272-73 Marco Polo and his companions stayed for a time in Badakhshan. During
                    this and the following centuries the country was governed by kings who claimed
                    to be descendants of Alexander the Great. The last of these kings was Shah
                    Mahomet, who died in the middle of the 15th century, leaving only his married
                    daughters to represent the royal line. Early in the middle of the 16th century
                    the Uzbeks obtained possession of Badakhshan, but were soon expelled, and then
                    the country was generally governed by descendants of the old royal dynasty by
                    the female line. About the middle of the 18th century the present dynasty of <pb
                    break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit03newyrich/page/n239/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0903-0239-0224"/> Mirs established its footing in place of the old
                    one which had become extinct. In 1765 the country was invaded and ravaged by the
                    ruler of Cabul. During the first three decades of the present century it was
                    overrun and depopulated by Kokan Beg and his son Murad Beg, chiefs of the
                    Kataghan Uzbeks of Kundus. The country was still suffering from these disasters
                    when Wood visited it in 1837. When Murad Beg died, the power passed into the
                    hands of another Uzbek, Mahomet Amir Khan. In 1859 the Kataghan Uzbeks were
                    expelled; and Mir Jahander Shah, the representative of the modem royal line, was
                    reinstated at Faizâbâd under the supremacy of the Afghans. In 1867 he was
                    expelled by the Afghans and replaced by the present ruler, Mir Mahomet Shah, and
                    other representatives of the same family. According to the latest accounts the
                    country was reviving from its past misfortunes, and the towns were again rising.
                    Badakhshan owes part of its prosperity to the baneful traffic in slaves. A
                    strong man is considered a fair exchange for a large dog or horse, and a fine
                    girl for about four horses. The district is of some political interest in
                    connection with the frontier line of Afghanistan, which has recently been the
                    subject of discussion between the Russian and British Governments.</p>
                <p>In 1867 a report on Badakhshan was drawn up by the Pundit Mun·phool after a
                    sojourn of two or three years in the country. For further information, see the
