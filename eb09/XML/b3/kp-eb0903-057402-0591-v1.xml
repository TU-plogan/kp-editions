                <p><label type="entry">BENNETT, <hi rend="smallcaps">John Hughes</hi></label>, for
                    twenty-six years professor of the institutes of medicine at Edinburgh
                    University, was born in London on the 31st August 1812. He was educated at
                    Exeter, and being destined for the medical profession was articled to a surgeon
                    in Maidstone. In 1833 he began his studies at Edinburgh, and in 1837 graduated
                    with the highest honours. During the next four years he studied in Paris and
                    Germany, and on his return to Edinburgh in 1841 published a work on cod-liver
                    oil, the recommendation of which as a remedy in all consumptive diseases made
                    his name widely known. In 1848 he obtained the chair of institutes of medicine,
                    having already gained high reputation as an extra-academical lecturer and
                    teacher. In 1871 his health gave way; he retired to the south of France, and in
                    1874 resigned his professorship. In August 1875 he was able to be present at the
                    meeting of the British Medical Association in Edinburgh, on which occasion he
                    received the degree of LL.D. The fatigue he then underwent brought on a relapse,
                    and he was compelled to have the operation of lithotomy performed. He sank
                    rapidly and died on the 25th September. Professor Bennett was an able teacher,
                    and his original investigations entitle him to a high place in the history of
                    medicine. His publications are very numerous, including many articles in medical
                    journals and several exhaustive treatises. Of these the best known are <hi
