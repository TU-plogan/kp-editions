                <p><label type="entry">BARROW, <hi rend="smallcaps">Isaac</hi></label>, an eminent
                    mathematician and divine, was the son of Thomas Barrow, a linen draper in
                    London, where he was born in 1630. He was at first placed for two or three years
                    at the Charter-house school. There, however, his conduct gave but little hopes
                    of his ever succeeding as a scholar, for he was inattentive and extremely fond
                    of fighting. But after his removal from this establishment, his disposition took
                    a happier turn; and having soon made considerable progress in learning, he was
                    in 1643 entered at St Peter’s College, and afterwards at Trinity College,
                    Cambridge, where he applied himself with great diligence to the study of
                    literature and science, especially of natural philosophy. He at first intended
                    to adopt the medical profession, and made some progress in anatomy, botany, and
                    chemistry, after which he studied chronology, geometry, and astronomy. He then
                    travelled in France and Italy, and in a voyage from Leghorn to Smyrna gave
                    proofs of great personal bravery; for the ship having been attacked by an
                    Algerine pirate, Barrow remained upon deck, and fought with the utmost
                    intrepidity, until the pirate, unprepared for the stout resistance made by the
                    ship, sheered off and left her to pursue her voyage.</p>
                <p>At Smyrna he met with a most kind reception from the English consul, Mr Bretton,
                    upon whose death he afterwards wrote a Latin elegy. From this place he proceeded
                    to Constantinople, where he received similar civilities from Sir Thomas Bendish,
                    the English ambassador, and Sir Jonathan Dawes, with whom he afterwards
                    contracted an intimate friendship. While at Constantinople he read and studied
                    the works of Chrysostom, once bishop of that see, whom he preferred to all the
                    other Fathers. He resided in Turkey somewhat more than a year, after which he
                    proceeded to Venice, and thence returned home through Germany and Holland in
                    1659. Immediately on his reaching England he received ordination from Bishop
                    Brownrig, and iu 1660 he was appointed to the Greek professorship at Cambridge.
                    When he entered upon this office he intended to have prelected upon the
                    tragedies of Sophocles; but he altered his intention, and made choice of
                    Aristotle’s rhetoric. His lectures on this subject having been lent to a friend
                    who never returned them, are irrecoverably lost. In July 1662 he was elected
                    professor of geometry in Gresham College, on the recommendation of Dr Wilkins,
                    master of Trinity College, and afterwards bishop of Chester; and in May 1663 he
                    was chosen a fellow of the Royal Society, at the first election made by the
                    council after obtaining their charter. The same year the executors of Mr Lucas,
                    who, according to the terms of his will, had founded a mathematical chair at
                    Cambridge, fixed upon Barrow as the first professor; and although his two
                    professorships were not inconsistent with each other, he chose to resign that of
                    Gresham College, which he did on the 20th May 1664. In 1669 he resigned his
                    mathematical chair to his illustrious pupil Isaac New ton, having now determined
                    to renounce the study of mathematics for that of divinty. Upon quitting his
                    professorship Barrow was only a fellow of Trinity College; but his uncle gave
                    him a small sinecure in Wales, and Dr Seth Ward, bishop of Salisbury, conferred
                    upon him a prebend in that church. In the year 1670 he was created doctor in
                    divinity by mandate; and, upon the promotion of Dr Pearson, master of Trinity
                    College, to the see of Chester, he was appointed to succeed him by the king’s
                    patent, bearing date the 13th February 1 672. In 1675 Dr Barrow was chosen
                    vice-chancellor of the university. He died on the 4th of May 1677, in the 47th
                    year of his age, and was interred in Westminster Abbey, where a monument,
                    surmounted by his bust, was soon after erected by the contributions of his
                    friends. By his English contemporaries Barrow was considered a mathematician
                    second only to Newton. Continental writers do not place him so high, and their
                    judgment is probably the more correct one. He was undoubtedly a clear-sighted
                    and able mathematician, who handled admirably the severe geometrical method, and
                    who in his <hi rend="italic">Method of Tangents</hi> approximated to the course
                    of reasoning by which Newton was afterwards led to the doctrine of Ultimate
                    Ratios; but his substantial contributions to the science are of no great
                    importance, and his lectures upon elementary principles do not throw much light
                    on the difficulties surrounding the border-land between mathematics and
                    philosophy. His <hi rend="italic">Sermons</hi> have long enjoyed a high
                    reputation; they are weighty pieces of reasoning, elaborate in construction and
                    ponderous in style.</p>
                <p>His scientific works are very numerous. The most important are:—1. <hi
                        rend="italic">Euclid s Elements;</hi> 2. <hi rend="italic">Euclid's
                        Data;</hi> 3. <hi rend="italic">Optical Lectures,</hi> read in the public
                    school of Cambridge; 4. <hi rend="italic">Thirteen Geometrical Lectures;</hi> 5.
                        <hi rend="italic">The Works cf Archimedes, the Four Books of Apollonius's
                        Conic Sections, and Theodosius's Spherics, explained in a New Method;</hi>
                    6. A <hi rend="italic">Lecture,</hi> in which Archimedes’s Theorems of the
                    Sphere and Cylinder are investigated and briefly demonstrated; 7. <hi
                        rend="italic">Mathematical Lectures,</hi> read in the public schools of the
                    University of Cambridge. The above were all written in Latin. His English works
                    have been collected and published in four volumes folio.</p>
