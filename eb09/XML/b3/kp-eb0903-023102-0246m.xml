                <p><label type="entry">BAGHDAD</label>, a city of Asia, formerly the capital of the
                    empire of the caliph, and long renowned for its commerce and its wealth, is
                    situated on an extensive and desert plain, which has scarcely a tree or village
                    throughout its whole extent; and though it is intersected by the Tigris, it
                    stands mostly on its eastern bank, close to the water’s edge. Old Baghdad on the
                    W. is now considered as merely a suburb to the larger and more modern city on
                    the eastern shore, the former containing an area of only 146 acres, while the
                    latter extends over 591. It has, however, numerous and extensive streets, well
                    furnished with shops, and is protected by strong walls, with three gates opening
                    towards Hillah on the Euphrates and Kazimeen. Beyond these modern ^bulwarks
                    vestiges of ancient buildings, spreading in various directions, are visible in
                    the plain, which is strewed with fragments of brick, tiles, and rubbish. A
                    burying-ground has extended itself over a large tract of land formerly occupied
                    by the streets of the city; and here is the tomb of Zobeide, the favourite wife
                    of Haroun el Raschid, built of brick, of a high octagonal shape, and surmounted
                    by a lofty superstructure in the form of a cone. It was originally built in 827
                    A.D., but has been frequently restored. The two towns of Old and New Baghdad are
                    connected by a bridge of thirty pontoons. The form of the new city is that of an
                    irregular oblong, about 1500 paces in length by 800 in breadth; and a brick
                    wall, about five miles in circuit, encloses the town on both sides of the river.
                    This wall, which is built of brick, has been constructed and repaired at
                    different periods; and, as in most other works of the same nature in Mahometan
                    countries, the oldest portion is the best, and the more modern the worst part of
                    the fabric. At the principal angles are large round towers, with smaller towers
                    intervening at short distances; and on these large towers batteries are planted,
                    with brass cannon of different calibre, badly mounted. Of two of these angular
                    towers Mr Buckingham remarked that the workmanship is equal to any ancient
                    masonry that he had ever seen. The wall has three gates—one on the S.E., one on
                    the N.E., and a third on the N.W. of the city; and it is surrounded by a dry
                    ditch of considerable depth. A fourth gate on the northern side, which has been
                    closed since the capture of the city by Sultan Amurath IV. in 1638, is a good
                    specimen of Saracenic brick-work. It was formerly called " the white Gate,” but
                    is now known as the <hi rend="italic">“Bab-el-Tilism,” or</hi> “Talismanic
                    Gate,” from a fine Arabic inscription in relief on a scroll border round the
                    tower, which bears the date of 618 <hi rend="smallcaps">a.h.</hi> (1220 A.D.)
                    The town has been built without the slightest regard to regularity. The streets
                    are even more intricate and winding than those in most other Eastern towns; and,
                    with the exception of the bazaars and some open squares, the interior is little
                    else than a labyrinth of alleys and passages. The streets are unpaved, and in
                    many places so narrow that two horsemen can scarcely pass each other; and as it
                    is seldom that the houses have windows facing the great public thoroughfares,
                    and the doors are small and mean, they present on both sides the <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0903-0247-0232"/> gloomy appearance of dead walls. All the
                    buildings, both public and private, are constructed of furnace-burnt bricks, of
                    a yellowish-red colour, taken chiefly from the ruins of other edifices, as their
                    rounded angles evidently show. A house is generally laid out in ranges of
                    apartments opening into a square interior court, and furnished with subterranean
                    rooms called <hi rend="italic">serdaubs,</hi> into which the inhabitants retreat
                    during the day for shelter from the intense heats of summer; and with terraced
                    roofs, on which they take their evening meal, and sleep in the open air.
                    Occasionally in the months of June, July, and August, when the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Sherki</hi> or south wind is blowing, the thermometer at break of day is known
                    to stand at 112° Fahr.; while at noon it rises to 119°, and a little before two
                    o’clock to 122°, standing at sunset at 117°, and at midnight at 114°. But this
                    scale of temperature is exceptional. During the summer months the wind is
                    usually in the north-west, and the air, though hot, is fresh and exhilarating,
                    the thermometer ranging from about 75° at sunrise to 107° at the hottest time of
                    the day. The interiors of the houses of the rich are splendidly furnished, and
                    ornamented in the ceilings with a sort of chequered work, which has a handsome
                    appearance. A great portion of the ground within the walls of the town is
                    unoccupied by buildings, especially in the north-eastern quarter; and even in
                    the more populous parts of the city near the river, a considerable space between
                    the houses is occupied by gardens, where pomegranates, grapes, figs, olives, and
                    dates grow in great abundance, so that the city when seen from a distance has
                    the appearance of rising out of the midst of trees.</p>
                <p>The principal public buildings in Baghdad are the mosques, the khans or
                    caravanserais, and the serai or palace of the pasha. The palace, which is
                    situated in the north-western quarter of the town, not far from the Tigris, is
                    distinguished rather for extent than grandeur. It is a comparatively modern
                    structure, built at different periods, and forming a large and confused pile,
                    without proportion, beauty, or strength. There are no remains of the ancient
                    palace of the caliphs.</p>
                <p>In all Mahometan cities the mosques are conspicuous objects. The number in
                    Baghdad is above 100; but of these not more than thirty are distinguished by the
                    characteristic minarets or steeples, the rest being merely chapels and venerated
                    places of prayer. The most ancient of these mosques was erected in the year of
                    the Hegira 633, or 1235 of the Christian era, by the Caliph Mustansir. All that
                    remains of the original building is the minaret, and a small portion of the
                    outer walls; the former a short, heavy erection, of the most ungraceful
                    proportions, built of bricks of various colours, diagonally crossed. The jamah
                    or mosque of Merjaneeah, not far distant from the former, though the body of it
                    is modern, has some remains of old and very rich arabesque work on its surface,
                    dating from the 14th century. The door is formed by a lofty arch of the Pointed
                    form, bordered on both sides by rich bands exquisitely sculptured, and having
                    numerous inscriptions. The mosque of Khaseki, supposed to have been an old
                    Christian church, is chiefly distinguished by the niche for prayer, which,
                    instead of a simple and unadorned recess, is crowned by a Roman arch, with
                    square pedestals, spirally fluted shafts, a rich capital of flowers, and a fine
                    fan or shell-top in the Roman style. Around the arch is a sculptured frieze; and
                    down the centre, at the back of the niche, is a broad band, richly sculptured
                    with vases, flowers, &amp;c., in the very best style of workmanship,—the whole
                    executed on a white marble ground. The building in its present state bears the
                    date of 1682 <hi rend="smallcaps">a,i&gt;.,</hi> but the sculptures which it
                    contains belong probably to the time of the early <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit03newyrich/page/n248/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0903-0248-0233"/> caliphs. The mosque of the vizier, near the
                    Tigris, has a fine dome and lofty minaret; and the great mosque in the square of
                    El Meidan is also a noble building. The others do not merit any particular
                    notice. The domes of Baghdad are mostly high, and disproportionately narrow.
                    They are richly ornamented with glazed tiles and painting, the colours chiefly
                    green and white, which, being reflected from a polished surface, impart more
                    liveliness than magnificence to the aspect of these buildings. In the opinion of
                    Mr Buckingham, they are not to be compared to the rich and stately domes of
                    Egypt, as the minarets, although they have the same bright assemblage of
                    colours, are far from being equal “to the plain and grave dignity of some of the
                    Turkish towers at Diarbekir, Aleppo, and Damascus, or to the lighter elegance of
                    many of those in the larger towns on the banks of the Nile.”</p>
                <p>There are about thirty khans or caravanserais in Baghdad, all of inferior
                    construction to those in the other large towns of Turkey. The only remarkable
                    building of this class is called <hi rend="italic">Khan-el-Aourtmeh,</hi> and
                    adjoins the Merjaneeah mosque, to which it formerly belonged. The vaulted roof
                    of this building is a fine specimen of Saracenic brickwork, and like the
                    adjoining mosque, bears the date of 1356 <hi rend="smallcaps">a.d.</hi> It is
                    said, however, to occupy the site of an ancient Christian church. The bazaars,
                    which are numerous, are mostly formed of long, straight, and tolerably wide
                    avenues. The one most recently built is the largest and the best; still it has
                    an air of meanness about it that is not common in the bazaars of large Turkish
                    cities. It is long, wide, and lofty, and well filled with dealers and wares of
                    all sorts. Several of these bazaars are vaulted over with brick-work; but the
                    greater number are merely covered with flat beams which support a roof of straw,
                    dried leaves, or branches of trees and grass. There are about fifty baths in
                    Baghdad, which are also very inferior in their accommodations to those in the
                    other large towns of Mesopotamia. The only other Mahometan remains which it is
                    necessary to mention are—1. The Tekiyeh, or shrine of the Bektash dervishes, on
                    the western bank of the river. The shrine is in ruins, but it contains a fine
                    Cufic inscription now mutilated, which bears the date of 333 <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">a.h.</hi> (or 944 <hi rend="smallcaps">a.d.)</hi> 2. The tomb
                    of the famous</p>
                <p>Maaruf-el-Kerkhi, in the immediate vicinity, dating from 1215 <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">a.d.</hi> 3. In Eastern or New Baghdad the college of
                    Mustansir, near the bridge, now in ruins, but bearing a fine inscription dated
                    630 <hi rend="smallcaps">a.h.</hi> (or 1233 <hi rend="smallcaps">a.d.)</hi> 4.
                    The shrine of the famous Saint Abdul Kadir, which is visited by pilgrims from
                    all parts of the Mahometan world. The original tomb was erected about 1252 <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">a.d.,</hi> but the noble dome which now canopies the grave
                    dates from about two centuries later. An aqueduct, the only one in the city,
                    conveys water from the river to this shrine. None of the other mosques or tombe
                    require particular notice.</p>
                <p>Baghdad is about 500 miles from the mouth of the Tigris (following itβ course),
                    and about 400 from Bussorah; and with the latter place it carries on a constant
                    communication by means of boats of from twenty to fifty tons burden, though the
                    river is navigable for larger vessels. With a northerly wind these boats will
                    make the passage to Bussorah in seven or eight days; in calms, when they have
                    merely the aid of the current, the passage occupies from ten to fifteen days.
                    Sir R. K. Porter mentions that the stream of the Tigris runs at the rate of
                    seven knots an hour. This, however, is probably during floods, since, with such
                    a powerful current, a boat could not occupy ten or fifteen days on its passage
                    from Baghdad to Bussorah. Incoming up the stream, thirty or forty days are
                    required to reach Baghdad. Of late years, however, steam communication has
                    almost entirely superseded the use of the native craft between Baghdad and
                    Bussorah. British steamers were first placed upon the Tigris and Euphrates by
                    Colonel Chesney in 1836, and, with the sanction of the Turkish Government, they
                    have ever since been maintained there, one small vessel of the Indian naval
                    service being attached to the British Residency, and two commercial steamers
                    belonging to an English company being employed in navigating the Tigris for
                    trade purposes. The Turks have also endeavoured to establish a line of
                    mercantile steamers of their own between Baghdad and Bussorah, but they have not
                    hitherto been very successful. The smaller craft, used for bringing supplies of
                    provisions and fruit to the city, are circular boats of basket-work, covered
                    with skins, the same that have been employed from the remotest antiquity. The
                    Euphrates and the Tigris are liable to spring floods; and the streams of both
                    rivers being sometimes joined, inundate the desert plain on which Baghdad
                    stands, when the city appears like an island in the midst of the sea. The
                    inhabitants are supplied with water from the Tigris, which is brought to their
                    houses in goats’ skins, the convenience of water-works, cisterns, and pipes
                    being entirely unknown.</p>
                <p>Baghdad has much declined from its ancient importance. It was formerly a great
                    emporium of Eastern commerce; and it still receives, by way of Bussorah, from
                    Bengal the manufactures and produce of India, which are distributed over Arabia,
                    Syria, Kurdistan, Armenia, and Asia Minor. At the same time the inland trade
                    from Persia and the East has fallen off. The productions and manufactures of
                    Persia, which were intended for the Syrian, Armenian, and Turkish markets, and
                    were sent to Baghdad as a central dépôt, now reach Constantinople by the more
                    direct route of Erzeroum and Tocat. Wealth, indeed, appears to be deficient
                    among all classes, and Baghdad has many symptoms of a decayed city. It must,
                    however, be noted that a very considerable trade has sprung up of late years
                    between the European markets and Baghdad, several English houses being
                    established in the city, who import goods direct from London and Liverpool, <hi
                    rend="italic">via</hi> the Suez Canal and Bussorah, and French, German, Swiss,
                    and Greek merchants being also engaged in the traffic. The staple articles of
                    export are dates, wool, and grain, to which may be added cloth of various kinds,
                    drugs, dye-stuffs, and miscellaneous productions. A very considerable trade in
                    horses is also carried on. The total value of the exports in 1870-71 reached
                    about £46,900, while the imports for the same year were stated at upwards of
                    £285,000. There is a considerable manufacture of red and yellow leather, which
                    is made into shoes, and finds a ready sale.</p>
                <p>The population is a mixture of nations from various quarters of the East. The
                    chief officers of Government, whether civil or military, are of the families of
                    Constantinopolitan Turks, though they are mostly natives of the city; the
                    merchants and traders are almost all of Persian or Arabian descent; while the
                    lower classes consist of Turks, Arabs, Persians, and Indians. There are some
                    Jews and Christians, who still remain distinct from the other classes; while the
                    strangers in the town are Kurds, Persians, and desert Arabs in considerable
                    numbers. The dress of the Baghdad Turks is not nearly so gay or splendid as that
                    of their northern countrymen; and the costume of the residents is, upon the
                    whole, unusually plain in comparison with that of other Asiatics. As every
                    nation retains its own peculiar dress, it may be easily conceived what an
                    amusing variety of costume must be seen in the streets of Baghdad. The dress of
                    the females is as mean as that used in the poorest villages of Mesopotamia;
                    women of all classes being enveloped in a blue checked cloth, such as is worn by
                    the lowest orders in Egypt, and having their faces covered by hideous veils of
                    black horse-hair.</p>
                <p>Baghdad is governed by a pasha, assisted by a council. Ξe was formerly chosen

                    the highest officers of the Constantinople court, his term of office being
                    usually for four or five years. He is also governor-general of Irak, and
                    possesses supreme authority from Diarbekir to Bahrein, though he does not under
                    ordinary circumstances interfere with the subordinate governments of Mosul and
                    Kurdistan.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Beside3 the
                    court of superior officers which assists the pasha in the general administration
                    of the province, there is also a Mejlis, or mixed tribunal, for the settlement
                    of municipal and commercial affairs, to which both Christian and Jewish
                    merchants are admitted. Much, of course, depends on the individual character of
                    the pasha, but, on the whole, justice is fairly administered, and with less
                    disposition perhaps to press on the non-Mussulman portion of the population than
                    in any other city of Asiatic Turkey. The Jewish and Christian communities,
                    indeed, from their wealth, intelligence, and long standing in the country, enjoy
                    an exceptionally favourable social position, and live on terms of equality with
                    their Mahometan neighbours.</p><p>Baghdad is also the headquarters of the army
                    of Irak, and regular troops to the amount of five or six thousand men of all
                    arms are usually kept together in the city, while an equal force is distributed
                    in small garrisons in the Arab and Kurdish districts. Baghdad, after paying all
                    its expenses, remits about £100,000 per annum to the imperial treasury, but its
                    resources are capable of almost indefinite, development, and there is indeed no
                    reason why the valleys of the Tigris and Euphrates should not, under an
                    enlightened government, yield a revenue fully equal to that of the valley of the
                    Nile.</p></note></p>
                <p>The East India Company used to maintain a resident in Baghdad with a large
                    establishment, and his post is now replaced by that of a consul-general and
                    political agent. A French consul is also regularly appointed.</p>
                <p>Until recently Baghdad was supposed to be entirely a Mahometan city, dating from
                    the time of Al Mansιir; but Sir H. Rawlinson discovered in 1848, during an
                    unusually dry season, when the rivers had fallen six feet below the ordinary
                    low-water mark, that the western bank of the Tigris was lined with an embankment
                    of solid brick-work, dating from the time of Nebuchadnezzar, as the bricks were
                    each stamped with his name and titles; and it has been since remarked that in
                    the Assyrian geographical catalogues of the time of Sardanapalus, one of the
                    Babylonian cities bears the name of <hi rend="italic">Bagdad,</hi> and may thus
                    very possibly represent the after site of the capital of the caliphs. According
                    to the Arabian writers, however, there were no traces of former habitation when
                    Al Mansûr laid the foundation of the new city. It was adorned -with many noble
                    and stately edifices by the magnificence of the renowned Haroun el Raschid, who
                    also built on the eastern side of the river, connecting the two quarters of the
                    town by a bridge of boats. Under the auspices of Zobeide, the wife of that
                    prince, and Jaffer the Barmecide, his favourite, the city may be said to have
                    attained its greatest splendour. It continued to flourish and increase, and to
                    be the seat of elegance and learning, until the 656th year of the Hegira (1277
                    <hi rend="smallcaps">a.d.),</hi> when Hulaku the Tatar, the grandson of Genghis
                    Khan, took it by storm, and extinguished the dynasty of the Abbassides. The
                    Tatars retained possession of Baghdad till about the year 1400 of our era, when
                    it was taken by Timur, from whom the Sultan Ahmed Ben Avis fled, and finding
                    refuge with the Greek emperor, contrived afterwards to repossess himself of the
                    city, whence he was finally expelled by Kara Yusef in 1417. In 1477 his
                    descendants were driven out by Usum Cassim, who reigned 39 years in Baghdad,
                    when Shah Ishmael the First, the founder of the royal house of Sefi, made
                    himself master of it. From that time it continued for a long period an object of
                    contention between the Turks and Persians. It was taken by Soliman the
                    Magnificent, and retaken by Shah Abbas the Great; and it was afterwards besieged
                    by Amurath the Fourth, with an army of 300,000 men. After an obstinate
                    resistance, it was forced to surrender 1638 A.D.; when, in defiance of the terms
                    of capitulation, most of the inhabitants were massacred. Since that· period it
                    has remained under a nominal subjection to the Turks. Achmet, the greatest of
                    the pashas of Baghdad, and the first who rendered the pashalic independent of
                    the Porte, defended the town with such courage against Nadir Shah, that the
                    invader was compelled to raise the siege, after suffering great loss. Baghdad,
                    according to Colonel Chesney, had 110,000 inhabitants previously to the great
                    plague of 1830; but in 1853 Mr Layard estimated its population under 50,000. An
                    estimate made in 1872 on a census taken in 1869 rises as high as 150,000, but
                    this is in all probability an exaggeration <hi rend="italic">(y.</hi> Allen’s
