                <p>The Bâzigars are divided into seven castes; but besides those who are united into
                    sects or castes, there are individuals who wander about endeavouring to pick up
                    a precarious livelihood. Although the Bâzigars are distinguished by their
                    manners and customs from the natives of Hin-dr.stân, their features do not
                    certainly discriminate them as a separate race. Some of their women are reputed
                    very beautiful, and are thence sought after in those temporary alliances common
                    in the East. The Bâzigars more especially distinguished by that name are the
                    most civilized of the whole; they are Mahometans in food, apparel, and religion.
                    The Panchpiri profess no system of faith, in preference adopting indifferently
                    that of any village whither their wanderings may guide them. Some traverse the
                    country as Mahometan fakirs, and live on the chance bounty of devotees; and a
                    particular association among them, of bad repute or abject superstition, has
                    been accused of sacrificing human victims. The chief occupation of the Bâzigars
                    seems to consist in feats of address and agility to amuse the public, in which
                    both males and females are equally skilful. The former are extremely athletic,
                    and the women are taught dancing, which, instead of the graceful motions seen in
                    the north, consists principally of a display of lascivious gestures. Most of the
                    men are adroit jugglers, tumblers, and actors. Both males and females pursue a
                    systematic course of debauchery, so that few live beyond forty, and many do not
                    attain their thirtieth year. From the pursuits of the females being productive
                    to their parents, their marriages are deferred to a later period than is usual
                    in India. The females who do not attend the juggling exhibitions of the men, or
                    their feats of activity, practise physic and cupping, and perform a kind of
                    tattooing on the skin of the Hindus of their own sex, called <hi rend="italic"
                    >godnd.</hi> The men, besides their usual occupations, collect medical herbs,
                    which are prepared by their wives as curatives, especially of the complaints of
                    their own sex. In this manner, or by the sale of trinkets, they find employment
                    in the towns, <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit03newyrich/page/n475/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0903-0475-0460"/> though these occupations afford them but a
                    precarious subsistence. Some tribes also go about exhibiting wild beasts, or
                    offering for sale mats fabricated by themselves. Before the establishment of the
                    British Government in Bengal, the Bazigars were subject to the arbitrary
                    exactions of a taxgatherer, whom they greatly dreaded, and the apprehension of
                    the renewal of that officer’s powers has proved a considerable impediment to
                    investigating their manners and customs.</p>
                <p>The Bâzïgars are supposed to present many features analogous to the gipsies
                    scattered over Europe and Asia, where they subsist as a race distinct from all
                    the other inhabitants of the countries frequented by them. The Bâzigars, as well
                    as the gipsies, have a chief or king; each race has a peculiar language,
                    different from that of the people among whom they reside; and the analogy of the
                    languages is so decided, that it is difficult to deny that they have had a
                    common origin. Another resemblance, which has probably been lost in the lapse of
                    time, is supposed to consist in the three-stringed viol introduced into Europe
                    by the jugglers of the 13th century, which is exactly similar to the instrument
                    now used in Hindustân. Disjoined, these analogies may not carry conviction of
                    the identity of the European gipsies with the Indian Bâzigars; but, on combining
                    the whole, it does not seem unlikely, that if Asia was their original country,
                    or if they have found their way from Egypt to India, they may also have
                    emigrated farther at a period of remote antiquity, and reached the boundaries of
                    Europe.</p>
