                <p><label type="entry">BASTIAT, <hi rend="smallcaps">Frederic</hi></label>, the son
                    of a merchant of Bayonne, was born in that town on the 19th of June 1801. After
                    being educated at the Colleges of Saint-Sever and of Sorèze, he entered in 1818
                    the counting-house of his uncle at Bayonne. Here his intensely active mind soon
                    began to interest itself in the study of the principles of commerce, but he felt
                    no enjoyment in the practical routine of mercantile life, and in 1825 retired to
                    a property at Mugron, of which he became possessor on the death of his
                    grandfather. Thus withdrawn from society, he devoted himself with eagerness to
                    meditation and study, mastering the English and Italian languages and
                    literatures, speculating on the problems of philosophy and religion, digesting
                    the doctrines of Adam Smith and Say, of Charles Comte and Dunoyer, cultivating
                    music, experimenting in farming, and talking over all that he read, thought, and
                    desired, with his able, dearly loved, and life-long friend, Μ. Felix Coudroy. He
                    welcomed with enthusiasm the Revolution of 1&amp;30. In 1831 he became a justice
                    of peace of Mugron, and in 1832, a member of the Council-General of the Landes.
                    In 1834 he published his first pamphlet. In 1840 he visited Spain and Portugal,
                    and spent a few weeks in London. Between 1841-44 three pamphlets appeared from
                    his pen, all, like his first brochure, on questions of taxation affecting local
                    interests. During this period an accidental circumstance led him to become a
                    subscriber to an English newspaper, the <hi rend="italic">Globe and
                    Traveller,</hi> through which he was made acquainted with the nature and
                    progress of the crusade so vigorously and skilfully carried on by the
                    Anti-Corn-Law League against Protectionist doctrines and practices. After
                    closely studying the movement for two years he resolved to make his countrymen
                    aware of its history and significance, and to inaugurate, if possible, a similar
                    movement in France. To prepare the way he contributed in 1844 to the <hi
                    rend="italic">Joτιrnal</hi><hi rend="italic">des Économistes</hi> an article
                    “Sur Γinfluence des tarifs Anglais et Français,” which attracted great
                    attention, and which he followed up by others, including the first series of his
                    brilliant <hi rend="italic">Sophismes Économiques.</hi></p>
                <p>In 1845 he came to Paris in order to superintend the publication of his <hi
                    rend="italic">Cobden</hi><hi rend="italic">et la Ligue, ou l'agitation Anglaise
                    pour la liberté des échanges,</hi> and was very cordially received by the
                    economists of the capital; from Paris he went to London and Manchester, and made
                    the personal acquaintance of Cobden, Bright, and other leaders of the league.
                    When he returned to France he found that his writings had been exerting a
                    powerful influence; and in 1846 he assisted in organizing at Bordeaux the first
                    French Free Trade Association. The rapid spread of the movement soon required
                    him to abandon the sweet and fruitful leisure of his beloved Mugron for the
                    feverish and consuming activity of Paris. During the eighteen months which
                    followed this change his labours were prodigious. He acted as secretary of the
                    central committee of the association, organized and corresponded with branch
                    societies, waited on ministers, procured subscriptions, edited a weekly paper,
                    the <hi rend="italic">Libre-Échange,</hi> contribute^ to the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Journal des</hi><hi rend="italic">Economistes,</hi> and to three other
                    periodicals, addressed meetings in Paris and the provinces, and delivered a
                    course of lectures on the principles of political economy to students of the
                    schools of law and of medicine. The cause to which he thus devoted himself, with
                    a zeal and a selfdenial most admirable in themselves, but fatal to his own
                    health and life, appeared for a time as if it would be as successful in France
                    as in England; but the forces in its favour were much weaker and those opposed
                    to it w ere much stronger in the former country than in the latter, and this
                    became always the more apparent as the struggle proceeded, until it was brought
                    to an abrupt end by the Revolution of February 1848. This event allowed the
                    socialism and communism which had been gathering and spreading in secret during
                    the previous thirty years to <pb break="no"

                    favourable circumstances. Louis Blanc, Victor Considérant, Pierre Leroux, J. P.
                    Proudhon, and other representatives of these theories laboured zealously and
                    effectively to gain to them the needy and uneducated masses of their countrymen,
                    and to discredit as utterly evil the existing order of society. In this grave
                    crisis Bastiat nobly performed his duty. Although exhausted by the far too heavy
                    labours in which he had been engaged, although robbed of his voice by the malady
                    which was preying upon him, so that he could do but little to defend the truth
                    from the tribune of the Constituent Assembly, he could still suggest wise
                    counsels in the Committee of Finance of which he was vice-president, and he
                    could still use his pen with a vigour and dexterity which made him capable of
                    combating single-handed many opponents.</p>
                <p>He wrote in rapid succession a series of brilliant and effective pamphlets and
                    essays, showing how socialism was connected with protection, and exposing the
                    delusions on which it rested. Thus within the space of two years there appeared
                    <hi rend="italic">Propriété et Loi,</hi><hi rend="italic">Justice</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">et Fraternité, Propriété et Spoliation, L'État, Baccalauriet et

                    rend="italic">Ce qu'on voit et ce qu'on ne voit pas.</hi> While thus occupied he
                    was meditating the composition of a great constructive work, meant to renovate
                    economical science by basing it on the principle that “interests, left to
                    themselves, tend to harmonious combinations, and to the progressive
                    preponderance of the general good.” The first volume of this work <hi
                    rend="italic">Les Harmonies</hi><hi rend="italic">Economiques</hi> was published
                    in the beginning of 1850. In the autumn of that year, when working on the second
                    volume, the increase of his malady compelled him to repair to Italy. After
                    lingering at Pisa and Florence he reached Rome, but only to die there on the
                    24th of December 1850, in the fiftieth year of his age. An affecting account of
                    the last days of this illustrious martyr to the cause of economical science and
                    political justice was published by his friend, Μ. Paillottet.</p>
                <p>The life-work of Bastiat, in order to be fairly appreciated, requires to be
                    considered in three aspects. (1.) He was the advocate of free trade, the
                    opponent of protection. The general theory of free trade had, of course, been
                    clearly stated and solidly established before he was born, and his desire to see
                    its principles acted on in France was quickened and confirmed by the agitation
                    of the Anti-Corn-Law League for their realization in England, but as no one
                    denies it to have been a great merit in Cobden to have seen so distinctly and
                    comprehensively the bearing of economical truths which he did not discover, no
                    one should deny it to have been also a great merit in Bastiat. He did far more
                    than merely restate the already familiar truths of free trade. He showed as no
                    one before him had done how they were applicable in the various spheres of
                    French agriculture, trade, and commerce. Now, the abstract theory of free trade
                    is of comparatively little value; its elaboration so as to cover details, its
                    concrete application, and its varied illustration are equally essential. And in
                    these respects it owes more, perhaps, to <hi rend="subscript"> z</hi> Bastiat
                    than to any other economist. In the <hi rend="italic">Sophismes Economiques</hi>
                    we have the completest and most effective, the wisest and the wittiest exposure
                    of protectionism in its principles, reasonings, and consequences which exists in
                    anylanguage. (2). He was the opponent of socialism. In this respect also he had
                    no equal among the economists of France. He alone fought socialism hand to hand,
                    body tn body, as it were, not caricaturing it, not denouncing it, not
                    criticizing under its name some merely abstract theory, but taking it as
                    actually presented by its most popular representatives, considering patiently
                    their proposals and arguments, and proving conclusively that they proceeded on
                    false principles, reasoned badly, and sought to realize generous aims by foolish
                    and harmful means. Nowhere will reason find a richer armoury of weapons
                    available against socialism than in the pamphlets published by Bastiat between
                    1848 and 1850. These pamphlets will live, it is to be hoped, at least as long as
                    the errors which they expose. (3). He attempted to expound in an original and
                    independent manner political economy as a science. In combating, first, the
                    Protectionists, and, afterwards, the Socialists, there gradually rose on his
                    mind a conception which seemed to him to shed a flood of light over the whole of
                    economical doctrine, and, indeed, over the whole theory of society, viz., the
                    harmony of the essential tendencies of human nature. The radical error, he
                    became always more convinced, both of protectionism and socialism, was the
                    assumption that human interests, if left to themselves, would inevitably prove
                    antagonistic and anti-social, capital robbing labour, manufactures ruining
                    agriculture, the foreigner injuring the native, the consumer the producer,
                    &amp;c.; and the chief weakness of the various schools of political economy, he
                    believed he had discovered in their imperfect apprehension of the truth that
                    human interests, when left to themselves, when not arbitrarily and forcibly
                    interfered with, tend to harmonious combination, to the general good. Such was
                    the point of view from which Bastiat sought to expound the whole of economical
                    science. The sphere of that science he limited to exchange, and he drew a sharp
                    distinction between utility and value. Political economy he defined as the
                    theory of value, and value as “the relation of two services exchanged.” The
                    latter definition he deemed of supreme importance. It appeared to him to correct
                    what was defective or erroneous in the conflicting definitions of value given by
                    Adam Smith, Say, Ricardo, Senior, Storch, &lt;fcc., to preserve and combine what
                    was true in them, and to afford a basis for a more consistent and developed
                    economical theory than had previously been presented. It has, however, found
                    little acceptance, and Roscher, Cairnes, and others seem to have shown it to be
                    ambiguous and misleading. ^ A consequence of it on which he laid great stress
                    was that the gratuitous gifts of nature, whatever be their utility, are
                    incapable of acquiring value,—what is gratuitous for man in an isolated state
                    remaining gratuitous for him in a social condition. Thus, land, according to
                    Bastiat, is as gratuitous to men at the present day as to their first parents,
                    the rent which is paid for it—its so-called value—being merely the return for
                    the labour and capital which have been expended on its improvement. In the
                    general opinion of economists he has failed to establish this doctrine, failed
                    to show that the properties and forces of nature cannot be so appropriated as to
                    acquire value. His theory of rent is nearly the same as Mr Carey’s, <hi
                    rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> decidedly anti-Ricardian. His views on the growth of
                    capital and interest, on landed property, competition, consumption, wages, and
                    population, are independent, and, if not unqualifiedly true, at least richly
                    suggestive. His <hi rend="italic">Oeuvres</hi><hi rend="italic">Completes</hi>
                    are in 7 vols. The first contains an interesting <hi rend="italic">Memoir</hi>
                    by Μ. Paillottet. The following articles on Bastiat may be specified,—Reybaud’s
                    in the <hi rend="italic">Revue des Deux Mondes,</hi> Sept. 1, 1858; Macleod’s in
                    his <hi rend="italic">Dictionary of Political Economy;</hi> and that of Cairnes
                    in the <hi rend="italic">Fortnightly Review,</hi> Oct. 1, 1870. There is a good
                    statement of his distinctive views in Kautz, <hi rend="italic">Geschichte,
                    der</hi><hi rend="italic">National-Oelconomik,</hi> ii. 578-584. His <hi
                    rend="italic">Harmonies</hi> have been well translated by Dr P. J. Stirling. (R∙
