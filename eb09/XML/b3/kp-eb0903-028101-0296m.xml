                    greatest breadth is 50 miles. A chain of mountains crosses the island in a
                    direction E. and W., and terminates on the E. in the volcanic peak Gunung-agung,
                    12,379 feet above the sea-level. The climate and soil are the same as in Java;
                    it has mountains of proportionate height, several lakes of great depth, and
                    streams well fitted for the purposes of irrigation. Rice is produced in great
                    quantities, and is even exported to Madura, Celebes, Timor, and Java. The other
                    productions are tobacco, maize, pulses, oil, and salt; also cotton of an
                    excellent quality. Coffee is now grown with great success; in the district of
                    Teja Kulo alone, 150,000 trees were planted in the first four months of 1873.
                    The inhabitants (estimated at about 800,000), though originally sprung from the
                    same stock as those of Java, exceed them in stature and muscular power, as well
                    as in activity and enterprising habits. “They have,” says Sir Stamford Raffles,
                    “a higher cast of spirit, independence, and manliness than belongs to any of
                    their neighbours.” They are good agriculturists and skilful artisans, especially
                    in textile fabrics and the manufacture of arms. The imports are iron and cotton
                    cloths, and opium to a great extent; in the district of Tabanan alone, forty
                    chests of this drug are annually consumed. Both imports and exports are on the
                    increase; but trade is chiefly in the hands of Europeans, Chinese, and Arabs,
                    who have their firms or agents in Batavia, Surabaya, Makassar, and Singapore.
                    The trade returns in the port of Padang Cove are estimated at £500,000 to
                    £600,000 per annum; those of Buleleng and Jembrana were about £500,000 in 1873.
                    The island is divided into the eight independent principalities of Buleleng,
                    Karang Asam, Bangli, Tabanan, Mengui, Klong-kong, Gyanyar, and Badong, each
                    under its own ruler. The deputy-commissioner of Banyuwangi in east Java is also
                    charged with the superintendence of the island of Bali in behalf of the Dutch
                    Government. Though native rule is described as very tyrannical and arbitrary,
                    especially in the principalities of Badong and Tabanan, trade and industry could
                    not flourish if insecurity of persons and property existed to any great extent.
                    The natives have also a remedy against the aggression of their rulers in their
                    own hands; it is called <hi rend="italic">Metilas,</hi> consists in a general
                    rising and renunciation of allegiance, and proves mostly successful. Justice is
                    administered from a written civil and criminal code. Slavery is abolished.
                    Hinduism, which was once the religion of Java, but has been extinct there for
                    four centuries, is still in vogue in the islands of Bali and Lombok, where the
                    cruel custom of widow burning is still practised, and the Hindu system of the
                    four castes, with a fifth or Pariah caste (called <hi rend="italic"
                    >Chanddla</hi><hi rend="italic superscript"> y</hi><hi rend="italic">),</hi>
                    adhered to. It appears partly blended with Buddhism, partly overgrown with a
                    belief in <hi rend="italic">Kalas,</hi> or evil spirits. To appease these,
                    offerings are made to them either direct or through the mediation of the <hi
                    rend="italic">Devas</hi> (domestic or agrarian deities); and if these avail not,
                    the <hi rend="italic">Menyepi,</hi> or Great Sacrifice, is resorted to. Buddhism
                    prevails only in three districts. The Mahometan religion is said to be on the
                    wane, in spite of the good influence it has exerted upon the people. Of the
                    early history of their island the Balinese knownothing. The oldest tradition
                    they possess refers to a time shortly after the overthrow of the Majapahit
                    dynasty in Java, about the middle of the I5th century; but, according tc Lassen,
                    who identifies Bali with the island visited by <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit03newyrich/page/n297/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0903-0297-0282"/> Jambulos, there must have been Indian settlers
                    there before the middle of the 1st century, by whom the present name, probably
                    cognate with the Sanskrit <hi rend="italic">balin,</hi> strong, was in all
                    likelihood imposed. It was not till 1633 that the Dutch attempted to enter into
                    alliance with the native princes, and their earliest permanent settlement at
                    Port Badong only dates from 1845. Their influence was extended by the results of
                    the war which they waged with the natives about 1847-9. A geological survey of
                    the whole island is at present (1874-5) in progress under their auspices. The
                    Balinese language belongs to the same group of the Malayan class as the
                    Javanese, Sundanese, Madurese, &lt;fcc., but is as distinct from each of these
                    as French is from Italian. It is most nearly akin to the Sasak language spoken
                    in Lombok and on the east coast of Bali. The literary language has embodied many
                    of its ingredients from the Old Javanese, as spoken in Java at the time of the
                    fall of Majapahit (15th century), while the vulgar dialect has kept free from
                    such admixture. Javanese influence is also traceable in the use of three
                    varieties of speech, as in the Javanese language, according to the rank of the
                    people addressed. The alphabet is with some modifications the same as the
                    Javanese, but more complicated. The material universally used for writing on is
                    the prepared leaf of the lontar palm. The sacred literature of the Balinese is
                    written in the ancient Javanese or <hi rend="italic">Kawi</hi> language, which
                    appears to be better understood here than it is in Java. (See R. van Eck, <hi

                    taal,</hi> Utrecht, 1874.) In the years 1871 and 1872, 15,000 people died of
                    small-pox in the island; since then vaccination has been introduced by the
                    Dutch. In September 1874 several districts were fearfully ravaged by cholera; in
                    Sampidi alone out of its 3000 inhabitants 700 fell victims to the scourge; the
                    rest fled into the woods.</p>
