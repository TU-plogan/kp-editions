                    definition of belief; but this is not to be expected from them, especially if,
                    as may be laid down with some confidence, no logical definition of the process
                    be possible. It may be described and marked off from similar or contrasted
                    states, but a rigidly scientific definition of what appears to be a simple,
                    ultimate fact is not attainable. The general explanation, however, is so far
                    unsatisfactory in that it throws no light upon the most interesting question
                    with regard to belief, its province, and does not tell us what are the objects
                    of belief as opposed to those of knowledge. To answer this it is necessary to
                    describe somewhat more minutely the mental process under examination.</p>
                <p>1. Unfortunately for purposes of analysis, the word belief is used in a variety
                    of relations which seem at first sight to have but little in common. We are said
                    to believe in what lies beyond the limits of our temporal experience, in the
                    supersensible, in God and a future life. Again, we are said to believe in the
                    first principles or ultimate verities from which all trains of demonstration
                    must start; as conditions of demonstration, these are themselves indemonstrable,
                    and are therefore objects of belief.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    believe from memory the facts of past experience; we have expectation or belief
                    in future events. We accept truths on the evidence of testimony; and finally, we
                    believe that our actual consciousness of things is in harmony with reality. From
                    this unsystematic arrangement of objects of belief it will be possible to
                    eliminate certain classée by noting in the first instance what we are not said
                    to believe, but to know. By knowledge may be understood generally the conviction
                    of truth which rests on grounds valid for all intelligence, and which is
                    expressed in propositions necessary both for our thinking and for reality. At
                    the same time we are commonly and correctly said to know states of consciousness
                    when they are immediately present, together with their differences,
                    similarities, connections, and relations to self. Whatever is necessarily
                    connected with present experience, and can be logically deduced from it, is also
                    matter not of belief but of knowledge. Again, we know all propositions of
                    apodictic certainty, such as those of mathematics and logic. Mathematical
                    propositions carry us beyond mere thinking; the laws which flow from the
                    relations of space and time are not only thought but known to be true of all
                    objects of sensible experience, for no objects whatsoever can form part of that
                    experience save under these quantitative conditions. It is therefore an error to
                    say that we believe abstract mathematical laws apply to objects; we know this
                    with absolute certainty. So also our cognizance of logical principles, such as
                    the laws of identity and contradiction, is matter of knowledge, of insight, not
                    of belief. It would appear, therefore, that knowledge extends to facts
                    immediately present in consciousness, and to certain relations true of all facts
                    of sensible experience; but in neither of these classes of cognition does there
                    seem to be given an absolute guarantee for the <hi rend="italic">existence</hi>
                    of any fact which is not immediately before us. That one object presented to us
                    is known seems to give no actual knowledge that another object ideally connected
                    with it has at the same time real being. Mathematical and logical laws are
                    absolutely true of all experience to which they apply, but this truth gives no
                    certainty that there will be experience. If there be objects of experience at
                    all, they must be subject to mathematical and logical law; but the question
                    remains, is there any ground, absolutely necessary and compelling assent, for
                    holding that there will be such experience.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    knowledge and philosophical belief, and leads directly into the deepest problems
                    of metaphysical science, its solution depending upon the answer given to thie
                    doubt whether or not our thinking is merely formal, receiving materials and
                    working them up in forms which may have no correlates in reality. Hume, who in
                    this connection has given the impulse to all subsequent British thinking, laid
                    his finger with unerring precision on the crucial point, and deliberately
                    relegated all <hi rend="italic">matters of fact</hi> to the province of belief.
                    According to him, knowledge never passes beyond immediate intuition of ideas and
                    their relations. Whenever we touch upon real existence, past or future, belief,
                    not knowledge, is our instrument. An adequate discussion of the difficulty would
                    lead beyond the limits of the present inquiry; it may suffice to indicate
                    generally what can be said on one typical point of the debate. Is the
                    supposition of a causal connection among phenomena merely belief, or is it a
                    necessary condition of knowledge? If the latter, then our thinking carries us
                    with apodictic certainty beyond present experience of facts, for every causal
                    judgment is, <hi rend="italic">ipso facto,</hi> universal, and therefore extends
                    to all or any time. Now, no proof of the universality of law among phenomena can
                    ever be given from empirical grounds, for all such attempts virtually involve
                    the very principle in question. It is a necessary presupposition, without which
                    knowledge would be impossible. Its contrary is certainly not self-contradictory,
                    if by self-contradiction be meant impossibility of representation, for chaos can
                    be pictured; but the power of imagination is surely not the criterion of truth.
                    It is the power of knowing objects that is in question, and the non-existence of
                    the causal relation among phenomena would render actual experience impossible.
                    Objects cannot be known save under this supposition. A similar line of argument
                    directed towards others of the notions involved in what Kant has called
                    synthetical judgments <hi rend="italic">a priori,</hi> would show that such
                    notions are constitutive of our experience, that thought penetrates deeply into
                    phenomena, and that phenomenal relations are but types of the forms of real
                    cognition. It might, of course, still be maintained that all these synthetical
                    propositions are only formal,—are only true if experience be given,—and that a
                    wide field is still left for belief. Under certain conditions this may be
                    admitted. A doubt as to the very existence of experience is hardly a valid
                    argument, but that there should be specific connections of phenomena, permanent
                    and constant—that, for example, the same cause should continue to have the same
                    effects—may seem not quite a matter of knowledge. The real element of doubt in
                    such a case is not, however, whether the same cause under the same conditions
                    shall give the same effects, but whether in any definite instance we have
                    attained a thorough knowledge of the cause itself, and whether the conditions
                    will recur. The first of these doubts is overcome in the ordinary progress of
                    knowledge; the other concerns the empirical appearance of the effects, relates
                    therefore to what may be called the contingent, and forms the object of
                    belief.</p>
                <p>It follows from what has been said that we exclude from the province of belief
                    primitive truths and facts of immediate experience, with such phenomena, past or
                    future, aβ are connected causally or by rational links with facts immediately
                    known. There is still a wide field left for belief, (a.) In the stage of
                    knowledge which we call sensible cognition belief introduces itself <hi
                    rend="italic">; for</hi> consciousness, which unhesitatingly affirms the
                    correspondence of its content with reality, readily exhibits its falsity λvhen
                    submitted to analysis. The belief, though firm, is shown to be erroneous,—to be
                    merely the rapid summation of a number of signs, which themselves do not come
                    clearly before consciousness, and are therefore accepted without examination,
                    (δ.) In memory of our own past experience belief is involved. When I remember, I
                    have present to consciousness ideas which represent past reality. To have ideas
                    simply is to imagine; to have ideas which we are convinced represent past
                    experience is to have imagination <hi rend="italic">plus</hi> belief, <hi
                    rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> to remember. It should be observed that we are
                    frequently said to trust our memory, to believe that what we remember is true.
                    This phraseology is objectionable; we cannot properly be said to <hi
                    rend="italic">trust</hi> our memory, we simply use it. In the very fact of
                    remembering is involved the reference to past reality which is the essence of
                    belief, (c.) We believe testimony, <hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> we accept as
                    true facts not in our experience, and which possibly may never be. In this case
                    our belief is, that under certain conditions we should have the experience which
                    from the testimony we can picture to ourselves, (d.) Expectation, so far as
                    merely contingent elements are concerned, is a pure case of belief.</p>
                <p>2. So far as we have yet seen, all objects of belief have been or may be objects
                    of knowledge; and the most prominent distinction between the two is the presence
                    in the one of an actual intuition and its absence in the other. This
                    distinction, however, as we have pointed out,· is not absolute; all thinking of
                    reality is not belief. Belief is rather the thinking of reality which is
                    determined by grounds not necessarily valid for all intelligence, but
                    satisfactory for the individual thinker. The difference between imagination and
                    the thought of some reality does not seem capable of further analysis; it
                    expresses an ultimate fact. Attempts, however, have been made to work out a
                    psychology of belief, and to point out the characteristics differentiating ideas
                    believed in from mere pictures of the mind. These have been generally due to
                    British thinkers; and, since the time of Hume, the problem has become one of
                    considerable importance. Locke, who marked out very carefully the province of
                    belief and considered its grounds, made no attempt to analyse the state itself.
                    Hume,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>A theory somewhat
                    similar to that of Hume is worked out by Mr Bagehot, <hi rend="italic"

                    clearly before himself and returns an unhesitating answer. “As it is certain,”
                    he says, “there is a great difference betwixt the simple conception of the
                    existence of an object and the belief of it, and as this difference lies not in
                    the parts or composition of the idea which we conceive, it follows that it must
                    be in the manner in which we conceive it. When we are convinced of any matter of
                    fact, we do nothing but conceive it along with a certain feeling, different from
                    what attends the reveries of imagination.” “This feeling is nothing but a firmer
                    conception or a faster hold that we take of the object.” “This <hi rend="italic"
                    >manner</hi> of conception arises from a customary conjunction of the object
                    with something present to the memory or senses.” From the last sentence to the
                    elaborate theory of James Mill is but a short step. According to Mill, belief is
                    a case of constant association; an idea is believed which is irresistibly called
                    up in connection with present experience. Thus in memory, the ideas of the past
                    experience are irresistibly associated with the idea of myself experiencing
                    them, and this irresistibility constitutes belief. Expectation, again, is the
                    irresistible suggestion by present experience of a consequent or train of
                    consequents. And to memory and expectation all ordinary cases of belief may be
                    reduced.</p>
                <p>Both these theories are defective in the same point,—the analysis of what is
                    meant by object in general, and, consequently, of what is involved in thinking
                    of an object. Hume’s is open to the special objection that he makes the <pb
                    break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit03newyrich/page/n549/mode/1up"

                    the same as that between impression and idea, which is an ultimate distinction,
                    and yet holds the difference to be merely one of degree. In Mill’s account of
                    memory it may be pointed out that the ideas of <hi rend="italic">past</hi>
                    experience, and of myself as having had the experience, contain in themselves
                    the very element which is supposed to be got out of their conjunction. With
                    regard to expectation it is clear that ideas irresistibly suggested by present
                    experience are by no mean3 necessarily believed, and further, that many of our
                    beliefs do not arise from any such association. J. S. Mill,<note anchored="true"

                    subjects the association theory of belief to a searching examination, comes to
                    the conclusion that the distinction between thinking of a reality and
                    representing to ourselves an imaginary picture is ultimate and primordial With

                <p>Professor Bain, in opposition to other psychologists, holds that belief is not so
                    much an intellectual state as a “phase of our active nature, otherwise called
                    the will.” “It is a growth or development of the will under the pursuit of
                    intermediate ends.” When, for instance, we perform certain acts as means towards
                    a desired end with as much vigour as if we were realizing the end itself, “we
                    are in a very peculiar situation, not implied in desire.” This situation is
                    belief, which is essentially <hi rend="superscript"> tt</hi> an anticipation of
                    the pleasure” of attaining the end. Belief being a form of activity, our
                    primitive state is one of complete confidence. The mind is filled with its
                    present experience, and confidently believes that the future will resemble it.
                    Ideas are so strongly taken up by the mind that they are accepted as real, and
                    influence the will. The various disappointments of this primitive confidence
                    give rise to definite avoidances of certain actions, and to pursuit of others,
                    in order to escape pain or gain pleasure. Action directed towards these
                    intermediate ends involves, or rather is, belief. This theory has to explain
                    expectation and memory. With regard to the first, “we make light of the
                    difference between the conceived future and the real present;” or in other
                    words, “we are disposed to act in any direction where we have never been
                    checked.” Our primitive disposition to act is equivalent to full expectation. It
                    may be pointed out that this explanation throws no light on expectation of
                    events in which our activity could by no possibility be involved. But the theory
                    seems to break down entirely when applied to memory. There is first to be
                    explained the fact of memory, and then it has to be shown how reference to
                    activity is contained in it. “In surrendering our mind to the idea still
                    remaining, and so imparting a momentary quasi-reality, we have an experience
                    possessing the characteristic features of present reality.” ‘'We really make no
                    radical difference between a present and a proximate past.” This, in the first
                    place, would apply only to certain cases of memory. Secondly, imparting a
                    quasi-reality iβ not an explanation of the peculiar phenomenon of an idea
                    representing the past. It is an error, even on Professor Bain’s own principles

                    >Emotions and Will,</hi> 2d ed. 525), to speak of <hi rend="italic">belief</hi>
                    in a present reality, while here memory is explained as a pseudo-realization of
                    the ideas. Nor is he more successful in referring memory to activity. To
                    identify my remembrance of having run up against a wall to avoid a carriage with
                    the conviction that, should such a danger recur, I should again run up against
                    the wall (see <hi rend="italic">Emotions and Will,</hi> 2d. ed., 554),is absurd.
                    The whole theory seems but an instance of a not uncommon error in
                    psychology,—the confusion of the test or measure of a thing with the thing
                    itself. Belief is truly a motive to action,<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>It is so defined by Bain <hi rend="italic">(Ment.</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">and Moral Sc.,</hi> 372), who finds great difficulty in
                    reconciling his theory with ordinary phraseology. Such an expression as the
                    following has a curious ring :—“Belief is identical with the activity or active
                    disposition, at the moment, and with reference to the thing <hi rend="italic"
                    >believed.”—</hi> (Note to <hi rend="italic">Analysis,</hi> i. 395.)</p></note>
                    and all that has been said of it by Professor Bain would hold good of it in this
                    relation; to identify the two is to run together totally distinct processes.</p>
                <p>Modern German psychology has not approached the problem of belief from the same
                    side as the English. Beneke alone, by his analysis of <hi rend="italic"
                    >tact</hi> (see <hi rend="italic">Lehrbuch der</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Psych.,</hi> § 158, and <hi rend="italic">System</hi><hi rend="italic">der
                    Logik,</hi> i. 268, <hi rend="italic">seq.),</hi> has opened up a somewhat fresh
                    vein of thinking. His hints have been carried out by Germar <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Die</hi><hi rend="italic">alte Streitfrage, Glauben oder Wissen,</hi> 1856),
                    who gives the following definition of belief: “If the consciousness (of the
                    truth of what we think) arises from <hi rend="italic">tact,</hi> and therefore
                    without consciousness of the factors or grounds through which it is produced, it
                    is called belief; it is elevated to knowledge when these factors are brought
                    before consciousness” (p. 58).<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>With this view may be compared much of what is said by J. IL
                    Newman, <hi rend="italic">Grammar of Assent;</hi> see specially 73,
                    2S1</p></note> In general the example of Kant has been followed, who looked upon
                    the question as belonging not so much to psychology as to the theory of
                    knowledge. His own discussion of the subject and his distinction between <hi
                    rend="italic">Meinen, Glauben,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Wissen</hi> have
                    powerfully influenced later thought. According to him, <hi rend="italic"
                    >Glaube</hi> (belief, in the sense of <hi rend="italic">Fides</hi> as opposed to
                    <hi rend="italic">Credulitas,</hi><hi rend="italic">Foi</hi> as opposed to <hi
                    rend="italic">Croyance)</hi> should be confined to such propositions as rest on
                    grounds subjectively not merely sufficient but necessary; that is to say, the
                    propositions believed in are recognized as the demands of our moral or practical
                    reason, and their truth can never be disproved, for such disproof would be
                    radically inconsistent with the moral nature which we are conscious of
                    possessing. Our confidence in their truth is unwavering and practi cal, <hi
                    rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> leading to action; for without them we could not act in
                    conformity with our moral nature. Nevertheless, of the objects of such
                    propositions we can never have scientific knowledge.</p>
                <p>3. Kant’s distinction of <hi rend="italic">Meinung</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >Glaube</hi> leads us directly to the one species of belief which has not yet
                    been considered. All objects of belief, so far as has yet appeared, might come
                    within our temporal experience; but we are said to believe in the supersensible,
                    which from its very definition seems to surpass experience and, consequently,
                    knowledge. To such belief the name <hi rend="italic">faith</hi> is properly
                    restricted, and in its nature it differs somewhat from the belief hitherto
                    discussed. There is not, of course, included in it the specifically theological
                    notion of faith as <hi rend="italic">Fiducia</hi><hi rend="italic">(quoe
                    est</hi><hi rend="italic">apprehensio meriti</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Θεανθρώπου</hi><hi rend="italic">appropriativa ad me et te in</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">individuo)</hi>; it corresponds rather to the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Notitia</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Assensus,</hi> which are also elements in
                    theological faith, and may be defined as the subjective expression of man’s
                    relation to God. When understood in this sense, religious belief is by no means
                    a mere feeling, though it contains feeling as one of the stages in its
                    development, for mere feeling is in itself blind and valueless, whereas faith is
                    intelligent or rational. Nor is it a blank faith which would have the same value
                    whatever were the objects believed in, for religious belief has a definite
                    content; it is the acceptation of certain facts and truths and the active
                    realization of them. As its content is definite (for if it were not so, the
                    religions of Christ and of Mahomet, of Buddha and of Zoroaster, would stand on
                    the same level, all having subjective faith or conviction), belief of necessity
                    involves knowledge, rational construction of the facts believed. Faith is but
                    the lower stage of completed insight, and in its own development follows the
                    natural order of progress in knowledge, which begins with feeling and intuition,
                    rises through concrete representation into logical connection, <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit03newyrich/page/n550/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0903-0550-0535"/> and finally culminates in rational cognition. So
                    religious Belief, which is primarily little more than a vague feeling of
                    something over and beyond the present state of existence, combined with the dim
                    sense of our own finite and dependent condition, gradually rises to a higher
                    stage, and in its efforts to attain some cognizance of the supersensible, begins
                    even to attach itself to natural objects. But as it can find in these no
                    satisfaction, it is compelled to construct some representations of the
                    supernatural which shall harmonize with our spiritual wants. In the formation of
                    these religious ideas we are not left without help, nor are they to be looked
                    upon as mere figments of the mind. The revelation which has been given in
                    nature, both physical and moral, and in the special experience to which the name
                    is more frequently applied, furnishes matter which is laid hold of aud pressed
                    into the service. Religious belief or faith always attaches itself to
                    representations, intuitions, or facts; it gives what Newman has called Real as
                    opposed to Notional Assent But it is not the less necessary that faith should be
                    raised to insight, and that we should construe in terms of thought what
                    religious experience brings before us as direct intuition. There must be
                    theology as well as religion. Nothing is believed which is not held to be so
                    connected with the rational nature of man as irretrievably to injure that nature
                    should its truth be overthrown. This is not to put knowledge in place of faith,
                    if knowledge be understood to apply only to the logically necessary; nor is it
                    to assert that what have been called truths of revelation could have been
                    discovered by natural reason. Knowledge, however, cannot be confined to the
                    abstract understanding; and nothing is more delusive than the total opposition
                    of revelation and reason. “What is there in the nature of things,” says
                    Augustine, “that God has done unreasonably Î” To affirm that reason does not of
                    itself discover the truths of revelation, is simply to bring against it the
                    reproach it may well bear, that it does not create experience. Reason has not to
                    make new facts, but to accept given experience, and evolve from it the pure
                    elements of thought which it contains, and in which its truth consists. Faith,
                    therefore, precedes knowledge, as Anselm used to say; but its priority is that
                    of time, not of authority.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"
                    ><p>See Scotus Erigena, <hi rend="italic">De</hi><hi rend="italic">Divis.
                    Natur.,</hi> i. 69.</p></note></p>
                <p>4. There remains to be taken into account the interesting question of the grounds
                    and motives for belief. It is, of course, necessary to distinguish between these
                    two; the <hi rend="italic">cause</hi> of a belief may not be exactly a <hi
                    rend="italic">reason</hi> for it. Belief, though natural, is not always
                    rational, but frequently rests with happy unconsciousness on foundations utterly
                    inadequate to its support. But if we disregard this distinction and include both
                    causes and reasons under the title principles of belief, these may be divided
                    into three classes —(1), Testimony; (2), Feelings, Desires, or Wishes; (3),
                    Evidence of Reason. These are rarely dissevered in actual practice. Testimony,
                    to the reception of which the name belief is frequently restricted, is familiar
                    enough to require no extended notice. Our natural tendency is to accept all
                    testimony as true; it is experience alone that teaches caution. Where from the
                    nature of the case no such experience is to be had, credulity settles down into
                    firm and ineradicable conviction. The majority of men would be astonished to
                    find how much their belief depends upon the society into which they have been
                    born and in which they live. Dogmas at first forced upon a people gradually
                    become ingrained in the minds of those brought up in habitual contact with them.
                    There is hardly a limit to the possibility of instilling beliefs through
                    continued custom, and no resistance to analysis is so strong as that offered by
                    mere customary opinion, which has impercep tibly introduced itself into the very
                    life’s blood of those who share it.</p>
                <p>The feelings, though not so directly a source of convictions as testimony,
                    exercise an extensive and complex influence on belief. It has always been a
                    popular saying that a man believes what he wishes—that “the wish is father to
                    the thought;” and there can be no doubt that the superior force given to an idea
                    by the concentration on it of desire or affection, causes it to bulk so largely
                    in consciousness as to exclude the thought of its non-realization. The very idea
                    of a result opposed to what we earnestly desire is unpleasant enough to make us
                    resolutely shut it out of sight. This, however, is but a partial and limited
                    effect. We know very well that our belief is only occasionally swayed by our
                    wishes, and that necessity too often constrains us to believe what we willingly
                    would not. Our volition cannot directly compel belief. But the feelings play a
                    more important part; for it is by their means primarily that we stretch beyond
                    the field of direct knowledge and complete our limited experience with what we
                    feel to be necessary for the harmony of our moral and religious nature. We
                    believe that without which our nature would be dissatisfied, and this belief
                    takes its rise in the feelings,—the blind expressions of intellectual want,—
                    which form the first stage towards completed insight.</p>
                <p>It is hardly necessary to do more than refer to the rational grounds for belief.
                    Wherever our knowledge of any object or law is incomplete, belief is ready to
                    step in and fill up the gap by some hypothesis, which is in conformity with our
                    experience, is rationally connected with the facts to be explained, and is not
                    yet known to be true. Great portions of our so-called scientific knowledge are
                    nothing but rational belief,—hypotheses unverified, perhaps even
                    unverifiable,—and the settlement of the conditions or legitimacy of such
                    presumptions forms the principal part of inductive logic.</p>
