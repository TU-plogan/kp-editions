                        rend="smallcaps">René,</hi> one of the heroes and victims of Arctic
                    exploration, was born at Paris, March 18, 1826. At the age of fifteen he entered
                    the Naval School, in which he studied two years, and earned a high reputation.
                    He distinguished himself in the French expedition of 1845 against Tamatave in
                    Madagascar; and although he was not yet twenty he received the cross of the
                    Legion of Honour at the close of that year. He was afterwards attached to the
                    staff of the station, was promoted to the rank of <hi rend="italic">Enseigne de
                        Vaisseau</hi> in November 1847, and in 1851 obtained permission to join the
                    English expedition then preparing to go out, under the command of Captain
                    Kennedy, in search of Sir John Franklin. On this occasion he displayed great
                    courage, presence of mind, and self-devotion, rendered important services, and
                    made the discovery of the strait, which bears his name, between Boothia Felix
                    and Somerset Land. Early in 1852 he was promoted lieutenant. In the same year he
                    accompanied, as a volunteer, the expedition sent out by the English Government
                    under Captain Inglefield on the same quest. His intelligence, his devotion to
                    duty, and his courage won him the esteem and admiration of all with whom he was
                    associated. While making a perilous journey with two comrades across the ice,
                    for the purpose of communicating with Captain Inglefield, he was overtaken by a
                    storm, August 21, and being blown into an opening between the broken masses of
                    ice was seen no more. A pension was granted to his family by the Emperor
                    Napoleon III., and an obelisk was erected to his memory in front of Greenwich
                    Hospital.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">BELLOWSand</hi> BLOWING-MACHINES are machines for producing
                    a current of air, chiefly in order to assist the combustion of a fire.</p>
                <p>The common bellows now in use probably represents one of the oldest contrivances
                    for this purpose. It consists of two flat boards, of oval or triangular shape,
                    connected round their edges by a piece of leather so as to form an air chamber.
                    The leather is kept from collapsing, on separation of the boards, by two or more
                    hoops, which act like the ribs in animals. The lower board has a hole in its
                    centre covered inside by a leather flap or valve opening inwards; it has also
                    fastened to it a metal pipe or nozzle, of smaller aperture than the valve. On
                    raising the upper board, the air from without lifts the valve and enters the
                    cavity; then on pressing down the top board, this air is compressed, shuts the
                    valve, and is driven through the pipe with a velocity corresponding to the
                    pressure.</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit03newyrich/page/n565/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0903-0565-0550"/>
                <p>The blast here is, of course, not continuous, but in puffs, a certain interval
                    being needed for refilling the bellows after each discharge. This drawback was
                    remedied, by the invention of double bellows. To understand their action, it is
                    only necessary to conceive an additional board with valve, like the lower board
                    of the single bellows, attached by leather under this lower board. Thus two
                    similar cavities are obtained, separated by the lower board of what was the
                    single bellows. The lowest board is held down by a weight, and another weight
                    presses the top board. When the lowest board is raised it forces air into the
                    upper cavity, and the valve of the middle board prevents return of this air. The
                    lowest board being then depressed, air enters the lower cavity from without, and
                    this in its turn is next forced into the upper cavity. The weighted top board is
                    meanwhile continuously pressing the air of the upper cavity through the nozzle.
                    While the blast thus obtained is continuous, it is not wholly free from
                    irregularities.</p>
                <p>The common smiths’ bellows, made on the principle just indicated, are generally
                    of circular form, as shown in figs. 1 and 2. A is the blast pipe, B the movable
                    lowest board, C the fixed middle board (into which the pipe is inserted), and D
                    the movable upper board pressed by a weight. The lowest board is moved by means
                    of the lever L and the chain H working on the roller R. The weight required to
                    produce a certain force of blast is easily determined; if the diameter of the
                    bellows be 1 foot, the area will be 113 ’ 19 inches, and the upper board will
                    require a weight of 56 <hi rend="superscript"> -</hi> 5 δ&gt; for a blast
                    equivalent to a pressure of ⅛ δ» on the square inch, or a velocity of 207 feet
                    per second, which is well suited for a smith’s forge. By a simple arrangement
                    for altering the diameter of the pipe the force of the blast may be varied.</p>
                <p>It may be noted that in some parts of the Continent a simple form of bellows is
                    made of two wooden boxes, each open on one side, and the one just fitting into
                    the other. The open sides being opposed to each other, the upper enclosing box
                    is made to move up and down over the other, with which it is jointed at one
                    part, and which is provided with a nozzle, and a valve opening inwards. The
                    change of capacity produces a blast. There is considerable loss of air, however,
                    from the boxes not exactly fitting.</p>
                <p>The blowing-machines now almost exclusively used for blast furnaces are of the
                    cylinder and piston type (which is the principle adopted, it may be remarked, in
                    a small hand bellows used by the Chinese). At first the blowing cylinders were
                    single-acting, that is to say, they had the power of propelling a blast only
                    when the piston was moving in one direction. With two or more of these blowing
                    cylinders attached to one crank-shaft, worked by a water-wheel, a tolerably
                    steady pressure of air was obtained. But in these and other respects
                    considerable progress has been realized.</p>
                <p>The cylinder-engines of the present day (which are generally driven by steam) may
                    be classed in two chief systems, according as the cylinder is placed
                    horizontally or vertically. In the former case the steam and blast cylinders are
                    usually in one line, the same rod carrying the pistons of both, and being guided
                    on both sides, while a fly-wheel is employed as regulator. In the vertical
                    systems the steam and blowing cylinders are sometimes similarly connected, but,
                    in the larger engines, they are generally placed one at each end of a beam
                    connecting their pistons. The vertical engines have been most popular in England
                    and in some parts of the Continent (as Silesia), but the other type (almost
                    exclusively used in Westphalia and on the Rhine) is now adopted in several
                    English works.</p>
                <p>The general action of many of these machines may be illustrated by the large
                    blowing engine at the Dowlais iron-works, erected in 1851. Fig. 3 is a
                    representation of its blast cylinder, the piston of which, made air-tight by
                    packing, is moved by the oscillating beam of the engine. The cover of the
                    cylinder, and also its bottom, have several openings, furnished with valves <hi
                        rend="italic">v.</hi> which open inwards Other valves <hi rend="italic"
                        >v',</hi> above and below, open into a lateral chamber B, which is connected
                    by the aperture O to the different tuyeres of the furnaces. Suppose, now, the
                    piston is at the top and begins to be forced down. The air in the upper part of
                    the cylinder becomes more and more rarefied, and the difference of density
                    between it and that of the blast in chamber B, causes the upper valve <hi
                        rend="italic">v</hi> ’ to be applied firmly to the metallic surface before
                    which it is hung. The upper valves <hi rend="italic">v,</hi> on the other hand,
                    will be raised by the external air which enters to compensate the rarefaction.
                    The same motion of the piston compresses the air below it, causing the lower
                    valves <hi rend="italic">v</hi> (which open inwards) to be firmly closed, while
                    the valve <hi rend="italic">υ'</hi> will be raised and admit the air into
                    chamber B, whence it passes to the furnace. When the piston is raised the
                    reverse takes place; the lower portion of the cylinder receives air from
                    without, and the upper discharges its air through the pipes leading to the
                    furnace. Thus a nearly continuous flow is obtained. To ensure regularity the
                    pipe 0 is made to communicate with a closed reservoir of wrought iron, where the
                    variations are destroyed by the elasticity of the air itself. The cylinder here
                    figured is 144 inches in diameter, with a stroke of 12 feet, and discharges
                    about <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit03newyrich/page/n566/mode/1up"
                        xml:id="kp-eb0903-0566-0551"/> 44,000 cubic feet per minute, at a pressure
                    of 3∣ lb to the square inch.</p>
                <p>Where it is desirable to make small blast engines do the work of large ones,
                    compensating smallness of size with velocity, it becomes necessary that the air
                    valves be moved otherwise than by the simple action of the air itself. The best
                    form of such an arrangement is that devised by Mr Slate, in which there is an
                    annular slide valve placed outside the blast cylinder; it receives its motion
                    from a crank connected with the fly-wheel shaft. Thus, with lap and lead of the
                    valve properly proportioned, a high velocity can be attained, and the tremor and
                    jar that are observable in some of the larger engines are entirely absent. Two
                    such engines working together, with their cranks at right angles, give such a
                    uniform blast that no regulator of any kind is needed. In Fossey’s engine, which
                    appeared in the Exhibition of 1862, the slide valves are replaced by discs,with
                    radial perforations, which are put in slow rotatory motion by gearing connected
                    with the main shaft.</p>
                <p>The blast engines with slide valves, however, have not proved so advantageous in
                    practice as was anticipated, owing to the large amount of friction on the valve
                    surfaces, greater liability to derangement, and the wear and tear resulting from
                    such rapid motion.</p>
                <p>As a recent example of engines of the vertical type, with steam and air cylinders
                    in one line (which have now come a ∣good deal into use in the north of England)
                    we may briefly notice the compound cylinder blowing engines at the Lackenby
                    Iron-Works, Middlesborough. These engines were described by Mr Alfred Hill
                    before the Institution of Mechanical Engineers in 1871. Fig 4 (copied from the
                    drawings by permission of the Institute and of Mr Hill) presents them in
                    vertical section.</p>
                <p>They consist of a high pressure non-condensing engine and a low pressure
                    condensing engine, the latter supplied by steam from the former,—this
                    arrangement being adopted for economical reasons. A is the high pressure
                    cylinder (32 inches in diameter) and C the low pressure (80 inches). Both
                    engines have a stroke of 54 inches; and a peculiarity is that they are coupled
                    by cranks placed directly opposite each other instead of, as usual, at right
                    angles,—a light fly-wheel being relied on to carry them over the dead centres.
                    This secures a better balance of the engines, and expansion of the steam in both
                    cylinders in the most advantageous manner; it also obviates the danger of
                    breakages common in the case of right-angle cranks, which probably arises from
                    the tendency to sudden acceleration of one engine over the other at the
                    commencement of each stroke,—full steam pressure being then upon both pistons
                    simultaneously, whilst the resistance of the blast pressure is acting against
                    only one of the blowing pistons. In the blowing cylinders B, the inlet valves in
                    the bottom are circular disc valves of leather, eighteen in number. The inlet
                    valves T on the top of the cylinder are arranged in ten rectangular boxes,
                    having openings in their vertical sides, inside which are hung leather flap
                    valves. The box covers are made hollow, and are carried down between the backs
                    of the leathern flaps (so as to diminish the air-space as much as possible). The
                    outlet valves <hi rend="italic">o for</hi> air are ten in number, at each end of
                    the cylinders, and are hung against flat gratings, which are fixed round the
                    circumference of the cylinder. Enclosing each cylinder is an air-tight
                    wrought-iron case M, into w hich the blast is delivered, and a branch at one
                    side (not shown in figure) conveys the blast to the main. The area of the inlet
                    valve3 is 860 square inches, or about ⅜th the area of the piston; that of the
                    outlet valves is about ∣th. For details of the balanced slide valves of the
                    steam cylinders, the surface condenser D, the circulating pump E, the air-pump
                    F, the feed pumpe G, &amp;c., we must refer to Mr Hill’s paper.</p>
                <p>The capacity of each blowing cylinder is 157 cubic feet; consequently, the total
                    quantity of blast supplied from both cylinders at the regular speed of 24
                    revolutions per minute is 15,072 feet per minute, measured at atmospheric
                    pressure; thus the supply of blast, including loss by leakage, amounts to
                    190,000 cubic feet per ton of iron made. The pressure of blast in the blast-main
                    is very free from fluctuations,—owing, doubtless, to its large size, 12∣ times
                    the joint capacity of the two blowing cylinders. The indicated power of the
                    engine is found to give a total of 290 horse; that of the two blowing cylinders
                    258.</p>
                <p>Among the more powerful blowing engines of piston and cylinder type at present in
                    use, may be mentioned, besides that at Dowlais referred to above, those of
                    Woolwich dockyard, employed for supplying air to forty forge fires, the Kirkless
                    Hall engines, constructed from Robert Wilson’s designs for the Wigan Iron and
                    Coal Company, and the seven engines of Schneider and Co. at Creusot, three of
                    which are horizontal engines of an old type, and the other four direct-acting
                    vertical engines. Descriptions of these will be found in various standard works
                    on metallurgy and engineering. For a description of the large blowing and
                    exhausting engines lately constructed for the new PostOffice in London, see <hi
                        rend="italic">Engineering,</hi> 20th February 1874..</p>
                <p>An ingenious mode of obtaining a blast is adopted in Savoy, Carniola, and in some
                    parts of America; it is the <hi rend="italic">trompe</hi> or water-blowing
                    engine. A flow of a few yards of water is required. From the bottom of a
                    reservoir water is admitted, by removal of a plug from a conicalshaped aperture,
                    into a large vertical wooden pipe, which terminates below in a wind che3t. The
                    water, falling <pb break="no"
                        facs="ia:encyclopediabrit03newyrich/page/n567/mode/1up"
                        xml:id="kp-eb0903-0567-0552"/> in streamlets, carries down with it air drawn
                    in through eloping holes near the top of the pipe. The wind chest below has an
                    opening for escape of the water, and the air passes out from another part, in a
                    regular stream, by a nozzle pipe. To facilitate separation of the water and the
                    air, it is found advantageous to fix a small platform under the bottom of the
                    pipe, on which the water may impinge in its fall. The tension of the blast is
                    determined by the height from which the water falls; but this height seldom
                    exceeds 27 feet, which gives a pressure of from 1⅜ to 2 lb to the square inch.
                    While the blast obtained is very equable, there is the serious drawback that the
                    air supplied is always more or less laden with moisture. The action of the <hi
                        rend="italic">trompe</hi> has been investigated by Mr Rodwell <hi
                        rend="italic">(Philosophical Λfag.,</hi> 1864, 1867).</p>
                <p>Another kind of blowing engine, in which water is employed, is that invented by
                    Mr Street; in its simpler form it consists of a barrel-shaped vessel, supported
                    horizontally by the two ends of its axis. The cylinder is divided longitudinally
                    by a plane extending from the middle of the internal surface above (the barrel
                    being in its position of rest) to near the opposite side. Suppose the cylinder
                    partly filled with water and made to turn a little way round on its axis, the
                    air on one side will be compressed by the water, while that on the other will be
                    rarefied. A valve opening outwards from the condensed side admits the air to a
                    cavity from which a nozzle pipe proceeds, while a valve opening inwards on the
                    rarefied side admits external air. With additional and corresponding valves, the
                    process is repeated on the reverse oscillation of the cylinder. Thus by swinging
                    the cylinder from side to side, by a crank and rod connected with the engine,
                    alternate puffs of air are propelled into a regulative air chest of special
                    construction, which then supplies a steady blast.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Fan-blast machines</hi> are frequently employed, especially to
                    urge the fire of steam boilers, and in puddling and reheating, and in the cupola
                    furnaces where anthracite is burnt, or coke used for remelting pig-iron in
                    foundries. In one common form the fan consists of four spokes of a rimless
                    wheel, tipped with vanes and made to rotate in a cylindrical chest, in which it
                    has often a slightly eccentric position. There are openings on both sides round
                    the spindle for admission of air, which, sucked in by the centrifugal action of
                    the fan as it quickly rotates, flows towards the vanes, and is driven through an
                    exit pipe attached to another part of the cylinder.</p>
                <p>There are numerous varieties of these engines. An American machine, introduced
                    into England a few years ago by Mr Ellis, has found considerable favour. It is
                    represented in section in fig. 5. It consists of an iron cylindrical casing A,
                    open about a fourth part of its circumference (α to δ) for admission of air, and
                    an exit pipe B. Inside the casing is another cylinder, placed eccentrically to
                    it, and which always fits close up against the wooden packing C. This cylinder
                    acts as driver for the three fan blades or pistons D, which are capable of
                    passing out and in through longitudinal slits in its circumference. There is a
                    shaft passing through the small cylinder, and concentric with it at the ends,
                    but cranked in the middle part so as to become concentric with the casing. The
                    inner cylinder revolves round the axis of the ends of the shaft, and on the
                    cranked part revolve the fan blades or pistons, driven by the cylinder. The
                    outer extremities of the fan blades follow closely the inside face of the
                    casing. The crank is placed opposite to the point where the inner cylinder
                    touches the inside of the casing, always retaining, it must be remembered, the
                    same position; when passing this point, the blades are wholly withdrawn inside
                    the cylinder, but when passing the opposite point they are thrust out to the
                    fullest extent, and are always working into or out of the inner cylinder as it
                    revolves. The air is thus continually being drawn in at the upper opening,
                    compressed, and delivered by the lower one.</p>
                <p>The rotary blower, invented by Messrs Root of Connersville, Ind., is one which
                    has of late years found extensive use both in America and Europe. The
                    arrangement differs in some essential features from that of the ordinary fan; it
                    acts by regular displacement of the air at each revolution, as shown in fig 6. A
                    pair of horizontal shafts geared together at both ends traverse a case of the
                    form of two semi-cylinders separated by a rectangle equal <hi rend="italic"

                    action of which, as they revolve, takes the air in by an aperture at the bottom
                    of the machine, and expels it with considerable pressure, if required, at the
                    top. The gearing outside serves merely to keep the revolving pieces in their
                    proper position, and the power is applied directly to each shaft. One of these
                    machines, employed to give the blast in a pneumatic railway under Broadway, New
                    York, delivers, when worked to maximum speed, a volume of 100,000 cubic feet of
                    air per minute. The engine is also much used in the Bessemer steel-works of this
                    country.</p>
                <p>Among the exhibits at a recent exhibition of the Franklin Institute in America,
                    was shown a new form of blower, acting much on the same principle as the Root
                    blower, but, according to the report of the committee, offering certain
                    advantages over the latter. From a cross section of the chamber it appears that
                    three drums of equal size are enclosed in it, two in a line below and one above;
                    the upper one is provided with wings, and the two lower have wide slots along
                    their entire length, allowing the wings to enter in the course of rotation. The
                    function of the two lower drums is to supply alternately abutments to prevent
                    the escape of the air. They are caused to revolve in proper relation with the
                    motion of the upper drum by spur-wheels on the journals, which mesh into another
                    spur-wheel on the shaft of the upper drum. In the moving parts of this machine
                    there are no parts that come into actual contact except the teeth of the
                    spur-wheels. The report allows the <pb break="no"
