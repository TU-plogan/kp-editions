                    very early age he had completed two tragedies. But his acquaintance and
                    friendship with the celebrated mathematician Lacaille, and perhaps the example
                    of his brilliant young contemporary Clairaut, finally decided the direction of
                    his studies, which were then entirely devoted to science and scientific
                    investigation. The first of his labours was a calculation of the comet which
                    appeared in the year 1759. In 1763 he was admitted a member of the Academy of
                    Sciences; and in the same year he published a reduction of the observations made
                    by Lacaille in 1760 and 1761 on the zodiacal stars, a compilation of great
                    labour and utility. In 1764 he competed for the prize offered by the Academy for
                    a dissertation on the theory of Jupiter’s satellites. Lagrange, who was a
                    complete master of the most powerful analysis, was the successful competitor;
                    but Bailly’s memoir, which was published in an expanded form in 1766, showed
                    great ability, and at once established the author’s reputation as a physical
                    astronomer. He followed up his dissertation in 1771 with an able and important
                    memoir on the <hi rend="italic">Light of the Satellites,</hi> in which he
                    expounded some novel and elegant methods of observation.</p>
                <p>His attention, meantime, was not solely devoted to abstract science; he was
                    equally distinguished for eloquence and brilliancy of style. His <hi
                    rend="italic">Éloges</hi> on Corneille, Leibnitz, Molière, and others, were
                    universally admired. In 1773 he was proposed as a candidate for the
                    secretaryship of the Academy of Sciences, and was supported by Buffon; the
                    influence of D’Alembert, however, secured the appointment of the famous
                    Condorcet. In 1784 Bailly was made secretary of the French Academy, and in the
                    following year he was admitted to the Academy of Inscriptions and Belles
                    Lettres. This was the only instance, from the time of Fontenelle, of any writer
                    being at the same time a member of all the three academies.</p>
                <p>In the year 1775 he published the first volume of his most extensive work, <hi
                    rend="italic">History of Astronomy,</hi> which contained the history from its
                    origin down to the foundation of the Alexandrian school. This was followed by
                    three volumes on <hi rend="italic">Modern Astronomy,</hi> published between 1776
                    and 1783. The work is of little or no historical value, but it is admirably
                    written, and added greatly to the author’s reputation as a master of narrative
                    exposition. In 1787 he completed the history by a volume on Indian and Oriental
                    astronomy, which shows considerable erudition, but is not founded on a complete
                    knowledge of the Indian records, and is highly fantastic in its
                    speculations.</p>
                <p>The quiet course of Bailly’s life, hitherto devoted to literature and science,
                    was now broken in upon by that great convulsion, the French Revolution, of which
                    he was one of the first and most zealous promoters. In the part which he acted,
                    he has had the singular good fortune to be well spoken of by opposite factions,
                    and has never been charged either with want of integrity or with selfish
                    designs. When the states-general of France were assembled in 1789, he was
                    elected a deputy to the <hi rend="italic">tiers-état,</hi> of which he was
                    afterwards chosen president; and when the national assembly had been
                    constituted, he continued in the chair, and officiated as president at the time
                    the king’s proclamation was issued ordering that body to disperse. During the
                    struggle which took place between the national assembly and the court, Bailly
                    was amongst the most forward in asserting those popular rights which were then
                    new in France; and it was he who dictated the famous oath to the members of the
                    <hi rend="italic">tiers-état,</hi> by which they pledged themselves “to resist
                    tyrants and tyranny, and never to separate till they had obtained a free
                    constitution.” On the 14th of July following, the day on which the Bastille was
                    stormed and taken by the people, he was by universal consent appointed mayor of
                    Paris. In this high office he is allowed to have acted with great integrity,
                    courage, and moderation, and to have discharged its arduous and sometimes
                    perilous duties in a highly honourable manner, and during its course he was
                    instrumental in promoting the various measures by which the popular party at
                    length prevailed over that of the court; for which, as well as for his conduct
                    in other respects, he obtained a high degree of popularity. But the multitude,
                    newly unshackled from the fetters of despotism, greedy of novelty, fired with
                    enthusiastic and unsettled notions of freedom, and daily panting for change,
                    would brook no opposition to their wild schemes. Bailly, who probably saw too
                    late the general disposition of the people to anarchy, still wished the laws to
                    be respected, and hoped by the vigorous enforcement of them to restore and
                    maintain tranquillity. He ordered some deputies from the military insurgents of
                    Nancy to be arrested, and firmly opposed the rash proceedings of Marat and
                    Hebert; he ceased to be a member of the Jacobin club; and he exerted himself
                    strongly to persuade the populace to permit the king and royal family to depart
                    to St Cloud. By these measures, which were very distasteful to the fickle and
                    infuriated people, he lost their confidence and favour; and his popularity was
                    finally destroyed by his conduct on the occasion of the tumultuous meeting of
                    the populace on the 17th of July 1791, to demand the abolition of monarchy; for,
                    when called on by the national assembly to disperse the mob, who had assaulted
                    the soldiery, he ordered the latter to fire, by which means 40 persons were
                    killed and above 100 wounded. Finding himself after this an object of hatred and
                    suspicion to the people, whom he had faithfully served, he resigned his office
                    at the dissolution of the constituent assembly in the end of the year 1791, and
                    retired to Nantes. From there he wrote to Laplace, who was residing at Melun,
                    and proposed, if it were safe, to join him. Laplace, finding that a detachment
                    of revolutionary troops had been ordered to Melun, advised Bailly not to
                    venture, but his advice was neglected. The ex-mayor was recognised by one of the
                    soldiers, arrested, and thrown into prison. Arraigned on 10th November 1793
                    before a sanguinary tribunal, he was on the 11th condemned to death as a
                    conspirator, and executed the day following, near the spot where he had given
                    the order for the military to fire on the people. He met his death with the
                    greatest calmness and courage.</p>
                <p>Several works written by Bailly, and found in manuscript, have been published
                    since his death; particularly an <hi rend="italic">Essay on Fables and their
