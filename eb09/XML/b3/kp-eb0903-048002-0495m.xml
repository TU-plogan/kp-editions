                    >Baeda</hi></label> (commonly called The Venerable Bede), the father of English
                    history, the most learned Englishman and most eminent writer of his age, was
                    born about the year 673, in the neighbourhood of Monkwearmouth, in the N.E. of
                    the county of Durham. The story of his life is told by himself at the conclusion
                    of his most famous and most important work: “Thus much of the Ecclesiastical

                    writings of the ancients, or the tradition of our ancestors, or of my own
                    knowledge, has, with the help of God, been digested by me, Bede, the servant of
                    God, and priest of the monastery of the blessed apostles Peter and Paul, which
                    is at Wearmouth and Jarrow; who being born in the territory of that same
                    monastery, was given, at seven years of age, to be educated by the most reverend
                    Abbat Benedict, and afterwards by Ceolfrid; and spending all the remaining time
                    of my life in that monastery, I wholly applied myself to the study of Scripture;
                    and, amidst the observance of regular discipline, and the daily care of singing
                    in the church, I always took delight in learning, teaching, and writing. In the
                    nineteenth year of my age I received deacon’s orders; in the thirtieth, those of
                    the priesthood. . . . From which time, till the fifty-ninth year of my age, I
                    have made it my business, for the use of me and mine, to compile out of the
                    works of the venerable Fathers, and to interpret and explain according to their
                    meaning these following pieces” (a list of his writings follows). The two
                    associated monasteries here mentioned w ere founded by Benedict Biscop on the
                    lands between the Wear and the Tyne granted to him by King Ecgfrith. This
                    learned and pious abbot was “the first person who introduced in England
                    constructors of stone edifices, as well as makers of glass windows” (Will, of
                    Malmesb.) But a greater honour attaches to him as having collected in his visits
                    to Rome a large quantity of valuable books, which, deposited in the noble
                    buildings he erected, had much to do with the extensive learning of his
                    celebrated pupil. Bede, after three years at Wearmouth, removed with the Abbot
                    Ceolfrid to the newly-founded Jarrow monastery, where he pursued to the close of
                    his life those studies in every department of literature and science within his
                    reach, the results of which we have in his numerous works.</p>
                <p>Bede’s industry was marvellous, alike in acquiring and in communicating his
                    stores of knowledge. Besides the usual manual labours of the monastery, the
                    duties of the priest, and his additional occupation as a teacher, he succeeded
                    in writing upwards of forty distinct treatises, which together form what may be
                    looked upon as an early encyclopaedia. Of these treatises tw enty-five are on
                    Biblical subjects, including commentaries on most of the books of the Old and
                    New Testament and the Apocrypha. The remainder consist of lives of saints and
                    martyrs; lives of the <hi rend="italic">Al&gt;bats of this Monastery;</hi> his
                    <hi rend="italic">Ecclesiastical History of our Island and Nation;</hi>
                    treatises on <hi rend="italic">The Nature of Things,</hi> astronomy, chronology,
                    arithmetic, medicine, philosophy, grammar, rhetoric, poetry, music; together
                    with a <hi rend="italic">Book of Hymns,</hi> and a <hi rend="italic">Book of
                    Epigrams in heroic or elegiac verse.</hi> While exhibiting little original
                    thought or discovery, except in his historical works, and partaking of the
                    credulity of his time, Bede excels in good judgment, and in thoroughly digesting
                    and clearly arranging and expounding, in simple Latin, what he gathered in his
                    wide range of reading in classical and theological authors. His Biblical works
                    are principally made up of extracts from the Fathers, especially from St
                    Augustine—his interpretations following the allegorical mode of the Middle Ages,
                    as suggested by his own declaration: “He w ho knows how to interpret
                    allegorically will see that the inner sense excels the simplicity of the letter,
                    as apples do leaves.” The scientific treatises are founded on the Bible, and the
                    science of the ancients^as contained in such writers as Pliny. Bede’s historical
                    works, on the other hand, and especially his great historical w ork, are
                    remarkable for the patience indicated in the search after all trustworthy
                    sources of information, for his careful statement of these various sources, for
                    the sincerity and love of truth manifest throughout, and for the pleasant
                    artfessness with which the story is told.</p>
                <p>In the pursuit of knowledge Bede declined the dignity of abbot; for, he said,
                    “the office demands household care, and household care brings with it
                    distraction of mind, which hinders the prosecution of learning.” But his
                    reputation as a scholar, combined with “aptness to teach,” made very famous the
                    school of Jarrow, where it is recorded 600 monks, besides strangers from a
                    distance, were at one time in attendance. The influence and authority of the
                    modest teacher on Tyneside were acknowledged throughout the West of Europe, of
                    which Northumbria became now for a period the literary centre. By the renown of
                    its schools, its libraries, and its learning, chiefly represented by him, that
                    kingdom had some recompense for the height of military glory it had reached in
                    Bede’s youth, and from which it had recently fallen at Nechtansmere. Pope
                    Sergius, by a letter to Coelfrid, sought Bede’s presence and counsel at Rome,
                    but it is almost certain the invitation was not acted upon. In another way, we
                    can scarcely doubt, he efficiently helped the Papal court. Born about ten years
                    after Rome gained her final victory over Iona at the Synod of Whitby, and four
                    years after Theodore arrived at Canterbury to complete the ecclesiastical
                    conquest, the character and writings of Bede must have strengthened the dominion
                    of the hierarchy in the North of England. His positive efforts may have been
                    confined to his three treatises on the time of celebrating Easter—one of the
                    main questions in dispute. But indirectly, his historical works had the same
                    tendency, exalting, as they do, the missionaries from Italy, while not ignoring
                    the zealous labours of the followers of Columba. In himself, too, the people of
                    Northumbria, the scene of contest, beheld one who brought honour to them as a
                    fellow-countryman,—honour for which, at the same time, they were indebted to the
                    now dominant church that had given him his training and opportunities of study.
                    History, confirmed by the evidence of his writings, is loud in praise of Bede’s
                    humble piety as well as his learning. A long letter of his pupil Cuthbert has
                    been preserved, giving a simple and touching account of his death, which
                    probably took place in 735. Though “he suffered in his stomach, and drew his
                    breath with pains and sighs,” he was full of thanksgiving and rejoicing, singing
                    psalms, conversing with his pupils, and dictating an Anglo-Saxon translation of
                    the Gospel according to John. He was buried in the church at Jarrow, but his
                    bones were stolen by a monk from Durham and placed beside those of St Cuthbert.
                    There they continued until the middle of the 12th century, when they were
                    enclosed in a splendid shrine by Bishop Pudsey. This shrine was demolished and
                    the relics scattered in the reign of Henry VIII., there only remaining now at
                    Durham the Latin inscription, which concludes with the well-known line—</p>
                <l part="N"> “Hac sunt in fossa Bedae venerabilis ossa.” </l>
                <p>The origin of the title “Venerable” cannot be traced, but it appears as early as
                    836; and succeeding ages have gladly owned the justness of the appellation. For
                    centuries his theological and educational works held a high position as
                    authorities and even as text-books. The chief monument of his labours and
                    erudition is his <hi rend="italic">Ecclesiastical History,</hi> which gives us
                    the most and the best of our knowledge of the history of England until 731, four
                    years before his death.</p>
                <p>Bede’s works were published in 6 vols, fol., Paris, 1544, 1545, 1554, editions
                    now rare; 8 vols, fol., Basel, 1563, and Cologne, 1612 and 1688; 12 vols. 8vo,

                    into Anglo-Saxon. Other translations are by Stapelton, 1565; John Stevens, 1723;
                    and W. Hurst, 1814. Stevens’s translation improved, edited by Giles, is
