                <p><label type="entry">BERLIOZ, <hi rend="smallcaps">Hectok</hi></label>, by far the
                    most original composer of modern France, was born in 1803 at Côte-Saint-André, a
                    small town near Grenoble, in the department of Isère. His father was a physician
                    of repute, and by his desire our composer for some time devoted himself to the
                    study of the same profession. At the same time he had music lessons, and, in
                    secret, perused numerous theoretical works on counterpoint and harmony, with
                    little profit it seems, till the hearing and subsequent careful analysis of one
                    of Haydn’s quartets opened a new vista to his unguided aspirations. A similar
                    work written by Berlioz in imitation of Haydn’s masterpiece was favourably
                    received by his friends. From Paris, where he had been sent to complete his
                    medical studies, he at last made known to his father the unalterable decision of
                    devoting himself entirely to art, the answer to which confession was the
                    withdrawal of all further pecuniary assistance. In order to .support life
                    Berlioz had to accept the humble engagement of a singer in the chorus of the
                    Gymnase theatre. Soon, however, he became reconciled to his father and entered
                    the Conservatoire, where he studied composition under Reicha and Lesueur. His
                    first important composition was an opera called <hi rend="italic">Les
                        Francs-Juges,</hi> of which, however, only the overture remains extant. In
                    1825 he left the Conservatoire, disgusted, it is said, at the dry pedantry of
                    the professors, and began a course of autodidactic education, founded chiefly on
                    the works of Beethoven, Gluck, Weber, and other German masters. About this
                    period Berlioz saw for the first time on the stage the talented Irish actress
                    Miss Smithson, who was then charming Paris by her impersonations of Ophelia,
                    Juliet, and other Shakespearean characters. The young enthusiastic composer
                    became deeply enamoured of her at first sight, and tried, for a long time in
                    vain, to gain the responsive love or even the attention of his idol. To an
                    incident of this wild and persevering courtship Berlioz’s first symphonic work,
                        <hi rend="italic">Episode de la Vie d'un Artiste,</hi> owes its origin. It
                    describes the dreams of an artist who, under the influence of opium, imagines
                    that he has killed his mistress, and in his vision witnesses his own execution.
                    It is replete with the spirit of contemporary French romanticism and of
                    self-destructive Byronic despair. A written programme is added to each of the
                    five movements to expound the imaginative material on which the music is
                    founded. By the advice of his friends Berlioz once more entered the
                    Conservatoire, where, after several unsuccessful attempts, his cantata <hi
                        rend="italic">Sardanapalus</hi> (1830) gained him the first prize for
                    foreign travel, in spite of the strong personal antagonism of one of the
                    umpires. During a stay in Italy Berlioz composed an overture to <hi
                        rend="italic">King Lear,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Le Retour à la
                        Vie,—</hi> a sort of symphony, with intervening poetical declamation between
                    the single movements, called by the composer a melologue, and written in
                    continuation of the <hi rend="italic">Episode de la Vie d</hi> ’ <hi
                        rend="italic">un Artiste,</hi> along with which work it was performed at the
                    Paris Conservatoire in 1832. Paganini on that occasion spoke to Berlioz the
                    memorable words: “Vous commencez par où. les autres ont fini.” Miss Smithson,
                    who also was present on the occasion, soon afterwards consented to become the
                    wife of her ardent lover. The artistic success achieved on that occasion did not
                    prove to be of a lasting kind. Berlioz’s music was too far remote from the
                    current of popular taste to be much admired beyond a small circle of esoteric
                    worshippers. It is true that his name became known as that of a gifted though
                    eccentric composer; he also received in the course of time his due share of the
                    distinctions generally awarded to artistic merit, such as the ribbon of tbe
                    Legion of Honour and the membership of the Institute. But these distinctions he
                    owed, perhaps, less to a genuine admiration of his compositions than to his
                    influential position as the musical critic of the <hi rend="italic"
                        >Journal</hi><hi rend="italic">des Débats</hi> (a position which he never
                    used or abused to push his own works), and to his successes abroad. In 1842
                    Berlioz went for the first time to Germany, where he was hailed with welcome by
                    the leading musicians of the younger generation, P⅛obert Schumann foremost
                    amongst them. The latter paved the way for the French composer’s success, by a
                    comprehensive analysis of the <hi rend="italic">Episode</hi> in his musical
                    journal, the <hi rend="italic">Neue Zeitschrift für Musik.</hi> Berlioz gave
                    successful concerts at Leipsic and other German cities, and repeated his visit
                    on various later occasions—in 1852, by invitation of Liszt, to conduct his
                    opera, <hi rend="italic">Benvenuto Cellini</hi> (hissed off the stage in Paris),
                    at Weimar; and in 1855 to produce his oratorio-trilogy, <hi rend="italic"
                        >L'</hi><hi rend="italic">Enfance</hi><hi rend="italic">du Christ,</hi> in
                    the same city. This latter work had been previously performed at Paris, where
                    Berlioz mystified the critics by pretending to have found one part of it, the
                    “Flight into Egypt,” amongst the manuscript scores of a composer of the 17th
                    century, Pierre Ducré by name. Berlioz also made journeys to Vienna (1866) and
                    St Petersburg (1867), where his works were received with great enthusiasm. He
                    died in Paris, March 9, 1869.</p>
                <p>Berlioz has juetly been described as the French representative of musical <hi
                        rend="italic">Romanticism,</hi> and his works are in this respect closely
                    connected with the contemporary movement in literature known by that name. The
                    affinity between him and Victor Hugo, for instance, is undeniable, and must be
                    looked for deeper than in the fantastic eccentricities and breaches of the
                    established form common <pb break="no"
                        facs="ia:encyclopediabrit03newyrich/page/n616/mode/1up"

                    congenial aspirations in foreign countries, so adverse to French natural
                    prejudice, may be cited as another essentially “romantic” feature in Berlioz’s
                    character. In his case, however, the predilection for English literature, as
                    shown in the choice of several of his most important subjects from Shakespeare,
                    Byron, and Walter Scott, may be to some extent explained from his connection
                    with Miss Smithson, a striking instance of the relation between life and art in
                    a man of high creative faculty.</p>
                <p>The second powerful element in Berlioz’s compositions is the influence of
                    Beethoven’s gigantic works. The grand forms of the German master’s symphonies
                    impressed him with competitive zeal, and what has been described as the
                    “poetical idea” in Beethoven’s creations soon began to run riot in the
                    enthusiastic mind of the young medical student. But, in accordance with the
                    aversion of his national character to indistinct ideal notions, he tried to
                    condense the poetical essence of his inspiration in the tangible shape of a
                    story, and in this manner became the father of what is generally called
                    “programme-music.’ Whether the author of such works as <hi rend="italic"
                        >Harold</hi><hi rend="italic">en Italie,</hi> or the <hi rend="italic"
                        >Episode de la Vie d'un Artiste,</hi> may lay claim to the prophet’s cloak
                    is difficult to decide; he must at any rate be accepted as a man strong in his
                    own convictions, “a swallower of formulas,” and faithful ally in the great cause
                    of nature <hi rend="italic">versus</hi> traditional artificiality, of
                    Shakespeare against pseudo-classicism. Under such circumstances we can hardly be
                    surprised at seeing Berlioz appreciated sooner and more lastingly in Germany
                    than in his own country. Schumann and Liszt were, as we have mentioned, at
                    various periods amongst the foremost promoters of his music. We subjoin a list
                    of the more important works by</p>
                <p>Berlioz not mentioned above, viz., the symphonies <hi rend="italic">Roméo
                        et</hi><hi rend="italic">Juliette</hi> (1834), and <hi rend="italic"
                        >Damnation de Faust</hi> (1846); the operas <hi rend="italic">Béatrice et
                        Bénéôtict</hi> (1862), and <hi rend="italic">Les</hi><hi rend="italic"
                        >Troyens</hi> (1866); a Requiem, and <hi rend="italic">Tristia,</hi> a work
                    for chorus and orchestra, written on the death of his wife. Of his spirited
                    literary productions we mention his <hi rend="italic">Voyage musical</hi><hi
                        rend="italic">en Allemagne et en Itadie</hi> (1845), <hi rend="italic">Les
                        Soirées d'Orchestre</hi> (1853), <hi rend="italic">A travers Chant</hi>
                    (1862), and his incomparable <hi rend="italic">Traité d’instrumentation</hi>
                    (1844). The characteristics of Berlioz’s literary style are French <hi
                        rend="italic">verve</hi> and <hi rend="italic">esprit,</hi> occasionally
                    combined with English humour and German depth of idea. The time has hardly yet
                    arrived for judging finally of Berlioz’s position in the history of his art. His
                    original ideas, his poetical intentions, nobody can deny; the question is
                    whether he possesses genuine creative power to carry out these intentions, and,
                    first of all, that broad touch of nature which leads from subjective feeling to
                    objective rendering, and which alone can establish a lasting <hi rend="italic"
                        >rapport</hi> between a great artist and posterity. To decide this question
                    the performances of his works have as yet, unfortunately, been too few and far
                    between. In England, particularly, only a very small fraction of his
                    compositions has been heard. (F. H.)</p>
