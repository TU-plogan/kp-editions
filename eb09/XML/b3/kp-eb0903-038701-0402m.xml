                    or “foolish man” <hi rend="italic">(Cic. Fin.,</hi> ii. 23). Another form of the
                    same word appears to be vαro, to which Lucilius gives the meaning “a stupid
                    man," “a blockhead,” Forcellini observing that its primary senso is “a block of
                    tough, hard wood.” But with greater probability Graff derives the word baron
                    from the old German <hi rend="italic">Bar =</hi><hi rend="italic">Mann,
                    freier</hi><hi rend="italic">Mann.</hi> The word seems related to the Spanish
                    <hi rend="italic">varon,</hi> which means “a male,” “a noble person,” and its
                    root may be found in the Sanskrit verα. Like the Greek <hi rend="italic"
                    >avηp</hi> and the Latin <hi rend="italic">vir,</hi> the word <hi rend="italic"
                    >baron</hi> signifies man in general and also a <hi rend="italic">husband—</hi>
                    the old legal expression <hi rend="italic">baron</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >feme</hi> being equivalent to our ordinary phrase “man and wife.”</p>
                <p>In modern English usage the term is particularly applied to a member of the
                    lowest order of the peerage, but in ancient records (as Lord Coke observes) the
                    barony included all the (titular) nobility of England, because all noblemen were
                    barons though they might possess a higher dignity also; and the great council of
                    peers, in which were included dukes, marquesses, and earls, as well as barons,
                    was styled simply the “Council de Baronage.” In like manner we <pb break="no"

                    signed Magna Charta, although nobles of higher rank joined in both, and it is
                    usual in summoning to the Upper House a peer’s son in the lifetime of the father
                    to give, for the occasion, a separate existence to the latter’s barony.<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>The practice commenced, as
                    Dugdale states, theEdw. IV., but came into more general use in the latter part
                    of the 17th century. It will be understood that it was designed to “accelerate
                    the possession” cf a dignity^ and not to create a second.</p></note> Thus Earl
                    Fortescue sat in the House of Lords during his father’s lifetime as baron of
                    Castle Hill, county Devon— the barony held with his father’s earldom. The
                    fiction is still maintained when a commoner is raised directly to one of the
                    higher grades of the peerage, as in the case of Admiral Jervis, who was created
                    at the same time Baron Jervis and Earl St Vincent.</p>
                <p>The origin and comparative antiquity of barons have been the subject of much
                    research amongst antiquaries. The most probable opinion is that they were the
                    same as our present lords of manors; and to this the appellation of <hi
                    rend="italic">court-baron,</hi> given to the lord’s court, and incident to every
                    manor, seems to lend countenance. The term baron had, therefore, originally a
                    very extensive meaning, being applicable to all tenants-in-chief of the Crown,
                    whether holding by knight service or by grand serjeantry. But the latter only
                    were in the narrower sense the king’s barons, and as such possessed both a civil
                    and criminal jurisdiction, each in his <hi rend="italic">curia</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">baronis,</hi> and were entitled to seats in the great council of
                    the nation. “For,” says Sir H. Nicolas, “it was the principle of the feudal
                    system that every tenant should attend the court of his immediate superior; and
                    hence it was that he who held <hi rend="italic">per baroniam,</hi> having no
                    superior but the Crown, was bound to attend his sovereign in his great council
                    or parliament, which was, in fact, the great court baron of the realm” <hi
                    rend="italic">{Historic Peerage of England,</hi> ed. Courthope, p. 18). The
                    lesser barons—those, namely, who held by knight service—were also occasionally
                    summoned to parliament, but upon no fixed principles, and “the irregularity of
                    passing over many of them when councils were held for the purpose of levying
                    money, led to the provision in the Great Charter of John, by which the king
                    promises that they shall be summoned through the sheriff on such occasions ’
                    (Hallam, <hi rend="italic">Middle Ages,</hi> iii. 213). Both these classes, but
                    the former especially, might be entitled to the appellation of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Barons by Tenure;</hi> but it is evident that the mere possession of a barony
                    <hi rend="italic">{i.e.,</hi> thirteen knights’ fees and a quarter) did not give
                    its possessor an absolute right to a seat in parliament, and, of course, all
                    such baronies must have been swept away by the Act of 12 Car. II. c. 24,
                    abolishing feudal tenures and whatever depended thereupon. But from the reign of
                    Henry III. (49th year) the barons were summoned to attend the king in council or
                    parliament <hi rend="italic">by writ,</hi> and thus the dignity ceased to be
                    territorial and became altogether personal. And although the writ, w hether
                    addressed to ancient barons or to those w ho had not before been peers of
                    parliament, contained no words of limitation to the heirs of the person
                    summoned, yet it was laid down by Coke, and has always been accepted, that it
                    ennobles the blood of the person summoned, and that thus the barony becomes
                    heritable by heirs, male or female. A further change by King Richard II. in the
                    11th year of his reign, when he created John Beauchamp de Holt baron of
                    Kidderminster <hi rend="italic">by letters patent,</hi> and since that date this
                    mode of conferring the dignity of a baron has been pursued. Dugdale states that
                    the solemn investiture of barons created by patent was performed by the king
                    himself, by enrobing the peer in scarlet, and this form continued till 13 Jac.
                    I., when the lawyers declared that the delivery of the letters patent without
                    ceremony was sufficient. The letters patent express the limits of inheritance of
                    the barony. The usual limit is to the grantee and heirs male of his body;
                    occasionally (as in the case of Lord Brougham) in default of male issue, to a
                    collateral male relative; and occasionally (as in the case of Lord Nelson) to
                    the heirs of a sister. The coronation robes of a baron are the same as those of
                    an earl, except that he has only two rows of spots on each shoulder; and, in
                    like manner, his parliamentary robes have but two guards of white fur, with rows
                    of gold lace; but in other respects they are the same as those of other peers.
                    King Charles II. granted to the barons a coronet, having six large pearls set at
                    equal distances on the chaplet. A baron’s cap is the same as a viscount’s. His
                    style is <hi rend="italic">Right Honourable;</hi> and he is addressed by the
                    king or queen, <hi rend="italic">Right Trusty and Well Beloved.</hi><hi

                    <hi rend="italic">Titles of Honour,</hi> conjectures that they were originally
                    chosen from among the barons of the kingdom, and hence their name.</p>

                    Commons, elected by the Cinque Ports, two for each port. Their right to the
                    title is recognized in many old statutes, but in 1606 the use of the term in a
                    message from the Lower House drew forth a protest from the peers, that “they
                    would never acknowledge any man that sitteth in the Lower House to the right or
                    title of a baron of parliament” <hi rend="italic">{Lords' Journals').</hi> These

                    being evidence for or against the other in civil questions, and a relic of it is
                    still preserved in the criminal law, <hi rend="italic">Baron and Feme,</hi> in

                    not to be an heiress, for then her coat must be borne by the husband on an
                    escutcheon of pretence. See <hi rend="smallcaps">Heraldry. (c. j. r.)</hi></p>
