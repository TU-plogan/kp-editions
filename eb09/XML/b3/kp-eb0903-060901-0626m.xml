                    one of the most distinguished chemists of the French school, was born at
                    TaUoire, near Annecy, in Savoy, in 1748. He studied first at Chambery, and
                    subsequently at Turin, where he took his degree as a physician. In 1772 he
                    settled at Paris, and soon became the medical attendant of Philip, duke of
                    Orleans. By the publication of a volume of chemical essays, he gained such
                    reputation that he was admitted in 1781 into the Académie des Sciences. He was
                    appointed Government superintendent of the establishment for the improvement of
                    dyeing; and in 1791 he published his essay <hi rend="italic">Sur la
                    Teinture,</hi> a work that first systematized and chemically explained the
                    principles of the art. It was translated into English by Dr William Hamilton,
                    1794. Berthollet early adopted the chemical views of Lavoisier, and took part
                    with him in the formation of a new system of chemical nomenclature. He confirmed
                    and extended the discoveries of Priestley on ammonia, discovered fulminating
                    silver, and greatly extended our knowledge of the dephlogisticated marine acid
                    of Scheele, for which the name of oxymuriatic acid was then proposed, and which
                    is now termed chlorine. It was he who in 1785 first proposed to apply it to
                    bleaching. He discovered the remarkable salt now called chlorate of potash; and
                    we owe to him also an excellent essay on the chemical constitution of soaps.
                    Berthollet’s contributions to chemistry are scattered through the pages of the
                    <hi rend="italic">Journal de Physique,</hi><hi rend="italic">Annales</hi><hi

                    saltpetre for the manufacture of gunpowder was much felt; and Berthollet was
                    placed at the head of a commission for improving the processes for obtaining and
                    purifying this important product within the territory of France. Soon afterwards
                    we find him one of a commission for improving the processes in the smelting of
                    iron, and converting it into steel. In 1792 he was appointed a director of the
                    mint, and in 1794 he became a member of the committee on agriculture and the
                    arts; while he filled the office of teacher of chemistry in the Polytechnic and
                    Normal Schools of Paris, and took an active part in the remodelling of the
                    National Institute in 1795. In the following year Berthollet and Monge were
                    appointed heads of a commission to select in Italy the choicest specimens of
                    ancient and modern art, for the national galleries of Paris. In .1798 Berthollet
                    accompanied General Bonaparte to Egypt. On the overthrow of the Directory he was
                    made a senator and a grand officer of the Legion of Honour. Under the empire he
                    was created a count, and he sat as a peer on the restoration of the Bourbons.
                    His last work was his curious essay on <hi rend="italic">Chemical Statics</hi>
                    (1803), in which he controverted the views of Bergman. Berthollet was a man of
                    great modesty and unostentatious manners. For some years he lived retired at
                    Arcueil, especially after the misconduct and suicide of his only son. He died at
                    Paris of a painful malady bravely borne, November 6, 1822.</p>
