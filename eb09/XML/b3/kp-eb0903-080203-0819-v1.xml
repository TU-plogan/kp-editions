                    April, 7, 1718, at Edinburgh, where his father was a merchant. He entered
                    Edinburgh University in 1730 and won the favourable notice of Professor
                    Stevenson by an essay on the Beautiful, written for the logic class in his
                    sixteenth year. On taking the degree of M.A. in 1739, he printed a thesis <hi

                        Legis</hi><hi rend="italic">Naturoe,</hi> which contains an outline of the
                    moral principles afterwards unfolded in his sermons. He was licensed to preach
                    in 1741, and in a few months the earl of Leven, hearing of his eloquence, <pb

                    Fife. In 1743 he was elected to the second charge of the Canongate Church,
                    Edinburgh, where he performed the pastoral duties with great success, until
                    removed to Lady Yester’s, one of the city churches, in 1754. He married his
                    cousin, Katherine Bannatyne, in 1748, and by her had a son, who died in infancy,
                    and a daughter who lived to her twenty-first year. In 1757 the University of St
                    Andrews conferred on him the degree of D.D., and in the following year he was
                    promoted to the High Church, Edinburgh, the most important charge in Scotland.
                    In 1759 he commenced, under the patronage of Lord Kames, to deliver a course of
                    lectures on composition, the success of which led to the foundation of a chair
                    of rhetoric and belles lettres in the Edinburgh University. To this chair he was
                    appointed in 1762, with a salary of £70 a year. Having long taken interest in
                    the Celtic poetry of the Highlands, he published in 1763 a laudatory <hi

                        >Ossian,</hi> of which he maintained the authenticity. This critique, after
                    being greatly overrated at the time, has now fallen into neglect. In 1777 the
                    first volume of his <hi rend="italic">Sermons</hi> appeared. It was succeeded by
                    other four volumes, all of which met with the greatest success. Dr Samuel
                    Johnson praised them warmly. “I love Blair’s <hi rend="italic">Sermons</hi> ·,”
                    Johnson said, “his doctrine is the best limited, the best expressed; there is
                    the most warmth without fanaticism, the most rational transport.” The <hi
                        rend="italic">Sermons</hi> were translated into almost every language of
                    Europe, and in 1780, to signify the royal approbation, George III. conferred
                    upon him a pension of £200 a year. In 1783 he retired from his professorship and
                    pxrblished his <hi rend="italic">Lectures on Rhetoric</hi> which he had
                    carefully revised, and which have been frequently reprinted. He died, after a
                    brief illness, on the 27th December 1801. In the church Blair belonged to the
                    “moderate” or latitudinarian party, and his <hi rend="italic">Sermons</hi> have
                    been objected to as deficient in doctrinal definiteness. His once brilliant
                    reputation is now becoming forgotten. His works display little originality, but
                    are written in a flowing and elaborate style; and his <hi rend="italic"
                        >Rhetoric,</hi> although inferior to Campbell’s, and wanting in research and
                    depth of thought, is unworthy of the neglect it has met with.</p>
