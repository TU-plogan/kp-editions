                    district; on the S. by Midnapur district; and on the W. by MAnbhιim district.
                    BAnkurA forms a connecting link between the delta of the Ganges on the E. and
                    the mountainous highlands of ChhotA NAgpur on the W. Along its eastern boundary
                    adjoining BardwAn district the country is flat and alluvial, presenting the
                    appearance of the ordinary paddy lands of Bengal. Going N. and W., however, the
                    surface gradually rises into long undulating tracts; rice lands and swamps give
                    way to a region of low thorny jungle or forest trees; the hamlets become smaller
                    and more scattered, and nearly disappear altogether in the wild forests along
                    the western boundary. The principal hills are—MAnjiA hill, on the south bank of
                    the DAmodar; Koro hill, S. of the foregoing; SusuniA hill, W. of Koro; and
                    BehArinAth hill, in the N.W. corner of the district. The rivers are merely
                    mountain torrents—the largest, the DAmodar, being only navigable by country
                    boats during the rains. The census of 1872 returned the population of the
                    district at 526,772 souls, inhabiting 2028 villages, and 104,687 houses; average
                    density of population, 391 to the square mile. The Hindus numbered 487,786, or
                    92 <hi rend="superscript"> -</hi> 6 per cent, of the total population;
                    Mahometans, 13,500; Christians, 70; and persons of unspecified religion, chiefly
                    aboriginal tribes, 25,416.</p>
                <p>District area, after recent transfers to and from the districts of BardwAn and
                    MAnbhAm in 1872, 1346 square miles. Before these transfers the area was returned
                    at 1350 square miles, of which 630 were said to be cultivated, 540 cultivable
                    but not cultivated, and 180 uncultivable waste. Agricultural products—rice,
                    barley, cotton, indigo, oil-seeds, and pulses. Minerals—coal, lime, and building
                    stone. In its manufactures, the district is noted for fine descriptions of
                    coloured silk cloths. Exports—rice, oil-seeds, lac, tamarind, silk cloth, silk
                    cocoons, &amp;c. Imports—English piece goods, salt, tobacco, spices, cocoa-nuts,
                    turmeric, and different kinds of pulses. Chief trading towns and seats of
                    commerce—BAnkurA, Bishnupur, RAjgrAm, and BarjorA. Three main lines of road
                    traverse tho district. The total revenue increased from £40,934 in 1835-36 to
                    £66,392 in 1870-71, and the civil expenditure from £8006 to £17,487 within the
                    same period. BAnkurA is a permanently settled district. In 1870-71 the district
                    contained 910 estates, held by 1351 proprietors, and paying a total Government
                    land revenue of £45,362. Besides the land revenue, the following are returned as
                    the other sources of revenue in 1870-71, viz., assessed taxes, £5455; excise,
                    £3167; stamps, £6787; law and justice, £30,478; law charges, £62; and local and
                    provincial funds, £2512. The police force in 1871 numbered 5681 men, maintained
                    at a cost of £23,656. The district contained 515 schools in 1871-72, attended by
                    14,676 pupils; maintained at a total cost of £4602, of which Government paid
                    £1291. The climate of BAnkurA is generally healthy, the cold season being
                    bracing, the air wholesome and dry, and fogs of rare occurrence. The temperature
                    in the hot season is very oppressive and relaxing. Rainfall in 1868, 61 <hi
                    rend="superscript"> ,</hi> 25 inches; minimum temperature in the same year, 62°;
                    maximum, 98°. The prevailing diseases in the district are intermittent fever,
                    leprosy, and occasionally diarrhoea and dysentery. Cholera visited the district
                    in an epidemic form in the years 1855, 1860, 1864, 1866-67, and 1869, that of
                    the first year being the severest. BankurA suffered greatly from the famine of
                    1865-66. Two towns contain a population of upwards of 5000—1. BankurA, the
                    administrative headquarters; population, 16,794; municipal income in 1872, £551;
                    expenditure, £476. 2. Bishnupur—population, 18,047; municipal income, £273;
                    expenditure, £192. The Bishnupur RAj was one of the largest estates in Bengal in
                    the end of the last century, but it was sold for arrears of revenue shortly
                    after the conclusion of the permanent settlement in 1793.</p>
