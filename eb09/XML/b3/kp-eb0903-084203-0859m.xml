                    portion of it. He was born in 1313, as we know from a letter of Petrarch, in
                    which that poet, who was born in 1304, calls himself the senior of his friend by
                    nine years. The place of his birth is somewhat doubtful,—Florence, Paris, and
                    Certaldo being all mentioned by various writers as his native city. Boccaccio
                    undoubtedly calls himself a Florentine, but this may refer merely to the
                    Florentine citizenship acquired by his grandfather. The claim of Paris has been
                    supported by Baldelli and Tiraboschi, mainly on the ground that his mother was a
                    lady of good family in that city, where she met Boccaccio’s father. The balance
                    of evidence is decidedly in favour of Certaldo, a small town or castle in the
                    valley of the Elsa, 20 miles from Florence, where the family had some property,
                    and where the poet spent much of the latter part of his life. He always signed
                    his name Boccaccio da Certaldo, and named that town as his birthplace in his own
                    epitaph. Petrarch calls his friend Certaldese; and Filippo Villani, a
                    contemporary, distinctly says that Boccaccio was born in Certaldo.</p>
                <p>Boccaccio, an illegitimate son, as is put beyond dispute by the fact that a
                    special licence had to be obtained when he desired to become a priest, was
                    brought up with tender care by his father, who seems to have been a merchant of
                    respectable rank. His elementary education he received from Giovanni da Strada,
                    an esteemed teacher of grammar in Florence. But at an early age he was
                    apprenticed to an eminent merchant, with whom he remained for six years, a time
                    entirely lost to him, if we may believe his own statement. For from his
                    tenderest years his soul was attached to that “<hi rend="italic">alma</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">poesis,”</hi> which, on his tombstone, he names as the task and
                    study of his life. In one of his works he relates that, in his seventh year,
                    before he had ever seen a book of poetry or learned the rules of metrical
                    composition, he began to write verse in his childish fashion, and earned for
                    himself amongst his friends the name of “the poet.” It is uncertain where
                    Boccaccio passed these six years of bondage; most likely lie followed his master
                    to various centres of commerce in Italy and France. We know at least that he was
                    in Naples and Paris for some time, and the youthful impressions received in the
                    latter city, as well as the knowledge of the French language acquired there,
                    were of considerable influence on his later career. Yielding at last to his
                    son’s immutable aversion to commerce, the elder Boccaccio permitted him to adopt
                    a course of study somewhat more congenial to the literary tastes of the young
                    man. He was sent to a celebrated professor of canon law, at that time an
                    important field of action both to the student and the practical jurist.
                    According to some accounts—far from authentic, it is true—this professor was
                    Cino da Pistoia, the friend of Dante, and himself a celebrated poet and scholar.
                    But, whoever he may have been, Boccaccio’s master was unable to inspire his
                    pupil with scientific ardour. “Again,” Boccaccio says, “I lost nearly six years.
                    And so nauseous was this study to my mind, that neither the teaching of my
                    master, nor the authority and command of my father, nor yet the exertions and
                    reproof of my friends, could make me take to it, for my love of poetry was
                    invincible.”</p>
                <p>About 1333 Boccaccio settled for some years at Naples, apparently sent there by
                    his father to resume his mercantile pursuits, the canon law being finally
                    abandoned. The place, it must be confessed, ιvas little adapted to lead to a
                    practical view of life one in whose heart the love of poetry was firmly rooted.
                    The court of King Robert of Anjou at Naple3 was frequented by many Italian and
                    French men of letters, the great Petrarch amongst the <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit03newyrich/page/n860/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0903-0860-0843"/> number. At the latter’s public examination in the
                    noble science of poetry by the king, previous to his receiving the laurel crown
                    at Rome, Boccaccio was present,—without, however, making his personal
                    acquaintance at this period. In the atmosphere of this gay court, enlivened and
                    adorned by the wit of men and the beauty of women, Boccaccio lived for several
                    years We can imagine how the tedious duties of the market and the counting-house
                    became more and more distasteful to his aspiring nature We are told that finding
                    himself by chance on the supposed grave of Virgil, near Naples, Boccaccio on
                    that sacred spot took the firm resolution of devoting himself for ever to
                    poetry. But perhaps another event, which happened some time after, led quite as
                    much as the first mentioned occurrence to this decisive turning point in his
                    life. On Easter-eve, 1341, in the church of San Lorenzo, Boccaccio saw for the
                    first time the natural daughter of King Robert, Maria, whom he immortalized as
                    Fiammetta in the noblest creations of his muse. Boccaccio’s passion on seeing
                    her was instantaneous, and (if we may accept as genuine the confessions
                    contained in one of her lover’s works) was returned with equal ardour on the
                    part of the lady. But not till after much delay did she yield to the amorous
                    demands of the poet, in spite of her honour and her duty as the wife of another.
                    All the information we have with regard to Maria or Fiammetta is derived from
                    the works of Boccaccio himself, and owing to several apparently contradictory
                    statements occurring in these works, the very existence of the lady has been
                    doubted by commentators, who seem to forget that, surrounded by the chattering
                    tongues of a court, and watched perhaps by a jealous husband, Boccaccio had all
                    possible reason to give the appearance of fictitious incongruity to the
                    effusions of his real passion. But there seems no more reason to call into
                    question the main features of the story, or even the identity of the person,
                    than there would be in the case of Petrarch’s Laura or of Dante’s Beatrice. It
                    has been ingeniously pointed out by Baldelli, that the fact of her descent from
                    King Robert being known c,nly to Maria herself, and through her to Boccaccio,
                    the latter was the more at liberty to refer to this circumstance,—the bold
                    expression of the truth serving in this case to increase the mystery with which
                    the poets of the Middle Ages loved, or were obliged, to surround the objects of
                    their praise. From Boccaccio’s <hi rend="italic">Ameto</hi> we learn that
                    Maria’s mother was, like his own, a French lady, whose husband, according to
                    Baldelli’s ingenious conjecture, was of the noble house of Aquino, and therefore
                    of the same family with the celebrated Thomas Aquinas. Maria died, according to
                    his account, long before her lover, who cherished her memory to the end of his
                    life, as we see from a sonnet written shortly before his death.</p>
                <p>The first work of Boccaccio, composed by him at Fiammetta’s command, was the
                    prose tale, <hi rend="italic">Eilocopo,</hi> describing the romantic love and
                    adventures of Florio and Biancafiore, a favourite subject with the knightly
                    minstrels of France, Italy, and Germany. The treatment of the story by Boccaccio
                    is not remarkable for originality or beauty, and the narrative is encumbered by
                    classical allusions and allegorical conceits. The style also cannot be held
                    worthy of the future great master of Italian prose. Considering, however, that
                    this prose was in its infancy, and that this was Boccaccio’s first attempt at
                    remoulding the unwieldy material at his disposal, it would be unjust to deny
                    that <hi rend="italic">Eilocopo</hi> is a highly interesting work, full of
                    promise and all but articulate power.</p>
                <p>Another work, written about the same time by Fiammetta’s desire and dedicated to
                    her, is the <hi rend="italic">Teseide,'</hi> an epic poem, and indeed the first
                    heroic epic in the Italian language. The name is chosen somewhat
                    inappropriately, as King Theseus plays a secondary part, and the interest of the
                    story centres in the two noble knights, Palemone and Arcito, and their wooing of
                    the beautiful Emelia. The <hi rend="italic">Teseide</hi> is of particular
                    interest to the student of poetry, because it exhibits the first example of the
                    <hi rend="italic">ottava rima,</hi> a metre which has been adopted by Tasso and
                    Ariosto, and in our own language by Byron in his <hi rend="italic">Don
                    Juan.</hi> Another link between Boccaccio’s epic and our literature is formed by
                    the fact of Chaucer having in the <hi rend="italic">EnighTs Tale</hi> adopted
                    its main features.</p>
                <p>Boccaccio’s poetry has been severely criticized by his countrymen, and most
                    severely by the author himself. On reading Petrarch’s sonnets, Boccaccio
                    resolved in a fit of despair to burn his own attempts,· and only the kindly
                    encouragement of his great friend prevented the holocaust. Posterity has justly
                    differed from the author’s sweeping self-criticism. It is true, that compared
                    with Dante’s grandeur and passion, and with Petrarch’s absolute mastership of
                    metre and language, Boccaccio’s poetry seems to be somewhat thrown into shade.
                    His verse is occasionally slip-shod, and particularly his epic poetry lacks what
                    in modern parlance is called poetic diction,—the quality, that is, which
                    distinguishes the elevated pathos of the recorder of heroic deeds from the easy
                    grace of the mere <hi rend="italic">conteur.</hi> This latter feature, so
                    charmingly displayed in Boccaccio’s prose, has to some extent proved fatal to
                    his verse. At the same time, his narrative is alwayβ fluent and interesting, and
                    his lyrical pieces, particularly the poetic interludes in the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Decameron,</hi> abound with charming gallantry, and frequently rise to lyrical
                    pathos.</p>
                <p>About the year 1341 Boccaccio returned to Florence by command of his father, who
                    in his old age desired the assistance and company of his son. Florence, at that
                    time disturbed by civil feuds, and the silent gloom of his father’s house could
                    not but appear in an unfavourable light to one accustomed to the gay life of the
                    Neapolitan court. But more than all this, Boccaccio regretted the separation
                    from his beloved Fiammetta. The thought of her at once embittered and consoled
                    his loneliness. Three of his works owe their existence to this period. With all
                    of them Fiammetta is connected; of one of them she alone is the subject.</p>
                <p>The first work, called <hi rend="italic">Ameto,</hi> describes the civilizing
                    •influence of love, which subdues the ferocious manners of the savage with its
                    gentle power. Fiammetta, although not the heroine of the story, is amongst the
                    nymphs who with their tales of true love soften the mind of the huntsman.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Ameto</hi> is written in prose alternating with verse,
                    specimens of which form occur in old and middle-Latin writings. It is more
                    probable, however, that Boccaccio adopted it from that sweetest and purest
                    blossom of mediaeval French literature, <hi rend="italic">Aucassin</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">et</hi><hi rend="italic">Nicolette,</hi> which dates from the 13th
                    century, and was undoubtedly known to him. So pleased was Boccaccio with the
                    idea embodied in the character of <hi rend="italic">Ameto</hi> that he repeated
                    its essential features in the Cimone of his <hi rend="italic">Decameron</hi>
                    (Day 5th, tale i.)</p>
                <p>The second work referred to is a poem in fifty chapters, called <hi rend="italic"
                    >Hamorosa</hi><hi rend="italic">Visione.</hi> It describes a dream in which the
                    poet, guided by a lady, sees the heroes and lovers of ancient and mediaeval
                    times. Boccaccio evidently has tried to imitate the celebrated <hi rend="italic"
                    >Trwnfi</hi> of Petrarch, but without much success. There is little organic
                    development in the poem, which reads like the <hi rend="italic"
                    >catalogue</hi><hi rend="italic">raisonne</hi> of a picture gallery; but it is
                    remarkable from another point of view. It is perhaps the most astounding
                    instance in literature of ingenuity wasted on trifles; even Edgar Poe, had he
                    known Boccaccio’s puzzle, must have confessed himself surpassed. For the whole
                    of the <hi rend="italic">Amoτosa</hi><hi rend="italic">Visione</hi> is nothing
                    but an acrostic on a gigantic scale. The poem <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit03newyrich/page/n861/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0903-0861-0844"/> is written, like the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Divina</hi><hi rend="italic">Commedia,</hi> in <hi rend="italic">terza
                    rima,</hi> and the initial letters of all the triplets throughout the work
                    compose three poems of considerable length, in the first of which the whole is
                    dedicated to Boccaccio’s lady-love, this time under her real name of Maria. In
                    addition to this, the initial letters of the first, third, fifth, seventh, and
                    ninth lines of the dedicatory poem form the name of Maria; so that here we have
                    the acrostic in the second degree. No wonder that thus entrammelled the poet’s
                    thought begins to flag and his language to halt.</p>
                <p>The third important work written by Boccaccio during his stay at Florence, or
                    soon after his return to Naples, is called <hi rend="italic">Hamorosa
                    Fiammetta;</hi> and although written in prose, it contains more real poetry than
                    the elaborate production just referred to. It purports to be Fiammetta’s
                    complaint after her lover, following the call of filial duty, had deserted her.
                    Bitterly she deplores her fate, and upbraids her lover with coldness and want of
                    devotion. Jealous fears add to her torture, not altogether unfounded, if we
                    believe the commentators’ assertion that the heroine of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Ameto</hi> is in reality the beautiful Lucia, a Florentine lady loved by
                    Boccaccio. Sadly Fiammetta recalls the moments of former bliss, the first
                    meeting, the stolen embrace. Her narrative is indeed our chief source of
                    information for the incidents of this strange love-story. It has been thought
                    unlikely, and indeed impossible, that Boccaccio should thus have become the
                    mouthpiece of a real lady’s real passion for himself; but there seems nothing
                    incongruous in the supposition that after a happy reunion the poet should have
                    heard with satisfaction, and surrounded with the halo of ideal art, the story of
                    his lady’s sufferings. Moreover, the language is too full of individual
                    intensity to make the conjecture of an entirely fictitious love affair
                    intrinsically probable. <hi rend="italic">Hamorosa Fiammetta</hi> is a monody of
                    passion sustained even to the verge of dulness, but strikingly real, and
                    therefore artistically valuable.</p>
                <p>By the intercession of an influential friend, Boccaccio at last obtained (in
                    1344) his fathers permission to return to Naples, where in the meantime
                    Giovanna, grand-daughter of King Robert, had succeeded to the crown. Being young
                    and beautiful, fond of poetry and of the praise of poets, she received Boccaccio
                    with all the distinction due to his literary fame. For many years she remained
                    his faithful friend, and the poet returned her favour with grateful devotion.
                    Even when the charge of having instigated, or at least connived at, the murder
                    of her husband was but too clearly proved against her, Boccaccio was amongst the
                    few who stood by her, and undertook the hopeless task of clearing her name from
                    the dreadful stain. It was by her desire, no less than by that of Fiammetta,
                    that he composed (between 1344 and 1350) most of the stories of his <hi
                    rend="italic">Decameron,</hi> which afterwards were collected and placed in the
                    mouths of the Florentine ladies and gentlemen. During this time he also composed
                    the <hi rend="italic">Filostrato,</hi> a narrative poem, the chief interest of
                    which, for the English reader, lies in its connection with Chaucer. With a
                    boldness pardonable only in men of genius, the great English poet has adopted
                    the main features of the plot, and has literally translated parts of Boccaccio's
                    work, without so much as mentioning the name of his Italian source.<note

                <p>In 1350 Boccaccio returned to Florence, owing to the death of his father, who had
                    made him guardian to his younger brother Jacopo. He was received with great dis
                    tinction, and entered the service of the Republic, being at various times sent
                    on important missions to the margrave of Brandenburg, and to the courts of
                    several popes, both in Avignon and Rome. Boccaccio boasts of the friendly terms
                    on which he had been with the great potentates of Europe, the emperor and pope
                    amongst the number. But he was never a politician in the sense that Dante and
                    Petrarch were. As a man of the world he enjoyed the society of the great, but
                    his interest in the internal commotions of the Florentine state seems to have
                    been very slight. Besides, he never liked Florence, and the expressions used by
                    him regarding his fellow-citizens betray anything but patriotic prejudice. In a
                    Latin eclogue he applies to them the term “Batraclιos” (frog), by which, he adds
                    parenthetically— <hi rend="italic">Ego intelligo</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Florentinorum morem</hi><hi rend="italic">; loquacis-simi</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >enim sumus, verum in rebus bellicis nihil valemus.</hi> The only important
                    result of Boccaccio’s diplomatic career was his intimacy with Petrarch. The
                    first acquaintance of these two great men dates from the year 1350, when
                    Boccaccio, then just returned to Florence, did all in his power to make the
                    great poet’s short stay in that city agreeable. When in the following year the
                    Florentines were anxious to draw men of great reputation to their newly-founded
                    university, it was again Boccaccio who insisted on the claims of Petrarch to the
                    most distinguished position. He himself accepted the mission of inviting his
                    friend to Florence, and of announcing to Petrarch at the same time that the
                    forfeited estates of his family had been restored to him. In this manner an
                    intimate friend ship grew up between them to be parted only by death. Common
                    interests and common literary pursuits were the natural basis of their
                    friendship, and both occupy prominent positions in the early history of that
                    great intellectual revival commonly called <hi rend="italic"
                    >Renaissance.</hi></p>
                <p>During the 14th century the study of ancient literature was at a low ebb in
                    Italy. The interest of the lay world was engrossed by political struggles, and
                    the treasures of classical history and poetry were at the mercy of monks, too
                    lazy or too ignorant to use, or even to preserve them. Boccaccio himself told
                    that, on asking to see the library of the celebrated monastery of Monte Casino,
                    he was shown into a dusty room without a door to it. Many of the valuable
                    manuscripts were mutilated; and his guide told him that the monks were in the
                    habit of tearing leaves from the codices to turn them into psalters for
                    children, or amulets for women at the price of four or five <hi rend="italic"
                    >soldi</hi> a piece. Boccaccio did all in his power to remove by word and
                    example this barbarous indifference. He bought or copied with his own hand
                    numerous valuable manuscripts, and an old writer remarks that if Boccaccio had
                    been a professional copyist, the amount of his work might astonish us. His
                    zealous endeavours for the revival of the all but forgotten Greek language in
                    western Europe are well known. The most celebrated Italian scholars about the
                    beginning of the !5th century were unable to read the Greek characters.
                    Boccaccio deplored the ignorance of his age. He took lessons from Leone Pilato,
                    a learned adventurer of the period, who had lived a long time in Thessaly and,
                    although born in Calabria, pretended to be a Greek. By Boccaccio’s advice Leone
                    Pilato was appointed professor of Greek language and literature in the
                    university of Florence, a position which he held for several years, not without
                    great and lasting benefit for the revival of classical learning. Boccaccio was
                    justly proud of having been intimately connected with the foundation of the
                    first chair of Greek in Italy. But he did not forget, in his admiration of
                    classic literature, the great poets of his own country, ⅛e never tires in his
                    praise of the sublime Dante, whose works ho copied with his own hand. He
                    conjures his friend Petrarch to study the great Florentine, and to defend
                    himself against <pb break="no"

                    against him. A life of Dante, and the commentaries on the first 16 cantos of the
                    <hi rend="italic">Inferno,</hi> bear witness to Boccaccio’s learning and
                    enthusiasm.</p>
                <p>In the chronological enumeration of our author’s writings we now come to his most
                    important work, the <hi rend="italic">Decameron,</hi> a collection of ene
                    hundred stories, published in their combined form in 1353, although mostly
                    written at an earlier date. This work marks in a certain sense the rise of
                    Italian prose. It is true that Dante’s <hi rend="italic">Vita Nuova</hi> was
                    written before, but its involved sentences, founded essentially on Latin
                    constructions, cannot be compared with the infinite suppleness and precision of
                    Boccaccio’s prose. The <hi rend="italic">Cento</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Novelle</hi><hi rend="italic">Antiche,</hi> on the other hand, which also
                    precedes the <hi rend="italic">Decameron</hi> in date, can hardly be said to be
                    written in artistic language according to definite rules of grammar and style.
                    Boccaccio for the first time speaks a new idiom, flexible and tender, like the
                    character of the nation, and capable of rendering all the shades of feeling,
                    from the coarse laugh of cynicism to the sigh of hopeless love. It is by the
                    name of “Father of Italian Prose” that Boccaccio ought to be chiefly
                    remembered.</p>
                <p>Like most progressive movements in art and literature, Boccaccio’s remoulding of
                    Italian prose may be described as a “return to nature.” It is indeed the nature
                    of the Italian people itself which has become articulate in the <hi
                    rend="italic">Decameron;</hi> here we find southern grace and elegance, together
                    with that unveiled <hi rend="italic">naivete</hi> of impulse which is so
                    striking and so amiable a quality of the Italian character. The undesirable
                    complement of the last-mentioned feature, a coarseness and indecency of
                    conception and expression hardly comprehensible to the northern mind, also
                    appears in the <hi rend="italic">Decameron,</hi> particularly where the life and
                    conversation of the lower classes are the subject of the story. At the same
                    time, these descriptions of low life are so admirable, and the character of
                    popular parlance rendered with such humour, as often to make the frown of moral
                    disgust give way to a smile.</p>
                <p>It is not surprising that a style so concise and yet so pliable, so typical and
                    yet so individual, as that of Boccaccio was of enormous influence on the further
                    progress of a prose in a manner created by it. This influence has indeed
                    prevailed down to the present time, to an extent beneficial upon the whole,
                    although frequently fatal to the development of individual writers. Novelists
                    like Giovanni Fiorentino or Franco Sacchetti are completely under the sway of
                    their great model; and Boccaccio’s influence may be discerned equally in the
                    plastic fulness of Machiavelli and in the pointed satire of Aretino. Without
                    touching upon the individual merits of Lasca, Bandello, and other novelists of
                    the <hi rend="italic">Cinquecento,</hi> it may be asserted that none of them
                    created a style independent of their great predecessor. One cannot indeed but
                    acquiesce in the authoritative utterance of the Accademia della Crusca, which
                    holds up the <hi rend="italic">Decameron</hi> as the standard and model of
                    Italian prose. Even the Della Cruscan writers themselves have been unable to
                    deprive the language wholly of the fresh spontaneity of Boccaccio’s manner,
                    which in modern literature we again admire in Manzoni’s <hi rend="italic"
                    >Promessi sposi.</hi></p>
                <p>A detailed analysis of a work so well known as the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Decameron</hi> would be unnecessary. The description of the plague of Florence
                    preceding the stories is universally acknowledged to be a masterpiece of epic
                    grandeur and vividness. It ranks with the paintings of similar calamities by
                    Thucydides, Defoe, and Manzoni. Like Defoe, Boccaccio had to draw largely on
                    hearsay and his own imagination, it being almost certain that in 1348 he was at
                    Naples, and therefore no eye-witness of the scenes he describes. The stories
                    themselves, a hundred in number, range from the highest pathos to the coarsest
                    licentiousness. A creation like the patient Griselda, which international
                    literature owes to Boccaccio, ought to atone for much that is morally and
                    artistically objectionable in the <hi rend="italic">Decameron.</hi> It may be
                    said on this head, that his age and his country were not only deeply immoral,
                    but in addition exceedingly outspoken. Moreover, his sources were anything but
                    pure. Most of his improper stories are either anecdotes from real life, or they
                    are taken from the <hi rend="italic">fabliaux</hi> of mediaeval French poets. On
                    comparing the latter class of stories (about one-fifth of the whole <hi
                    rend="italic">Decameron)</hi> with their French originals, one finds that
                    Boccaccio has never added to, but has sometimes toned down the revolting
                    ingredients. Notwithstanding this, it cannot be denied that the artistic value
                    of the <hi rend="italic">Decameron</hi> is greatly impaired by descriptions and
                    expressions, the intentional licentiousness of which is but imperfectly veiled
                    by an attempt at humour.</p>
                <p>Boccaccio has been accused of plagiarism, particularly by French critics, who
                    correctly state that the subjects of many stories in the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Decameron</hi> are borrowed from their literature. A similar objection might be
                    raised against Chaucer, Shakespeare, Goethe (in <hi rend="italic">Faust),</hi>
                    and indeed most of the master minds of all nations. Power of invention is not
                    the only nor even the chief criterion of a great poet. He takes his subjects
                    indiscriminately from his own fancy, or from the consciousness of his and other
                    nations. Stories float about in the air, known to all yet realized by few; the
                    poet gathers their <hi rend="italic">disjecta membra</hi> into an organic whole,
                    and this he inspires and calls into life with the breath of his genius. It is in
                    this sense that Boccaccio is the creator of those innumerable beautiful types
                    and stories, which have since become household words amongst civilized nations.
                    No author can equal him in these contributions to the store of international
                    literature. There are indeed few great poets who have not in some way become
                    indebted to the inexhaustible treasure of Boccaccio’s creativeness. One of the
                    greatest masterpieces of German literature, Lessing’s <hi rend="italic">Nathan
                    the Wise,</hi> contains a story from Boccaccio <hi rend="italic"
                    >{Decameron,</hi> Day 1st, tale iii), and the list of English poets who have
                    drawn from the same source comprises amongst many others the names of Chaucer,
                    Lydgate, Dryden, Keats, and Tennyson.</p>
                <p>For ten years Boccaccio continued to reside in Florence, leaving the city only
                    occasionally on diplomatic missions or on visits to his friends. His fame in the
                    meantime began to spread far and wide, and his <hi rend="italic">Decameron,</hi>
                    in par ticular, was devoured by the fashionable ladies and gentlemen of the age.
                    About 1360 he seems to have retired from the turbulent scenes of Florence to his
                    native Certaldo, the secluded charms of which he describes with rapture. In the
                    following year took place that strange turning-point in Boccaccio’s career,
                    which is generally described as his conversion. It seems that a Carthusian monk
                    came to him while at Certaldo charged with a posthumous message from another
                    monk of the same order, to the effect that if Boccaccio did not at once abandon
                    his godless ways in life and literature his death would ensue after a short
                    time. It is also mentioned that the revelation to the friar on his deathbed of a
                    secret known only to Boccaccio gave additional import to this alarming
                    information. Boccaccio’s impressionable nature was deeply moved. His life had
                    been far from virtuous; in his writings he had frequently sinned against the
                    rules of morality, and worse still, he had attacked with bitter satire the
                    institutions and servants of holy mother church. Terrified by the approach of
                    immediate death, he resolved to sell his library, abandon literature, and devote
                    the remainder of his life to penance and religious exercise. To this effect he
                    wrote to Petrarch. We possess the poet’s answer; it is a masterpiece of writing,
                    and what is more, a proof of tenderest friendship. The message of the monk
                    Petrarch is evidently inclined <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit03newyrich/page/n863/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0903-0863-0846"/> to treat simply as pious fraud, without however
                    actually committing himself to that opinion. “No monk is required to tell thee
                    of the shortness and precariousness of human life. Of the advice received accept
                    what is good; abandon worldly cares, conquer thy passions, and reform thy soul
                    and life of degraded habits. But do not give up the studies which are the true
                    food of a healthy mind.” Boccaccio seems to have acted on this valuable advice.
                    His later works, although written in Latin and scientific in character, are by
                    no means of a religious kind. It seems, however, that his entering the church in
                    1362 is connected with the events just related.</p>
                <p>In 1363 Boccaccio went on a visit to Naples to the eneschal Acciajuoli (the same
                    Florentine who had in 1344 persuaded the elder Boccaccio to permit his son’s
                    return to Naples), who commissioned him to write the story of his deeds of
                    valour. On his arrival, however, the poet was treated with shameful neglect, and
                    revenged himself by denying the possibility of relating any valorous deeds for
                    want of their existence. This declaration, it must be confessed, came somewhat
                    late, but it was provoked by a silly attack on the poet himself by one of the
                    seneschal’s indiscreet friends.</p>
                <p>During the next ten years Boccaccio led an unsettled life, residing chiefly at
                    Florence or Certaldo, but frequently leaving his home on visits to Petrarch and
                    other friends, and on various diplomatic errands in the service of the Republic.
                    He seems to have been poor, having spent large sums in the purchase of books,
                    but his independent spirit rejected the numerous splendid offers of hospitality
                    made to him by friends and admirers. During this period he wrote four important
                    Latin works— <hi rend="italic">He</hi><hi rend="italic">Genealogia</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Heorum libmXV.,</hi> a compendium of mythological knowledge full

                    many eclogues in Latin and miscellaneous <hi rend="italic">Rime</hi> in Italian
                    (the latter collected by his biographer Count Baldelli in 1802).</p>
                <p>In 1373 we find Boccaccio again settled at Certaldo. Here he was attacked by a
                    terrible disease which brought him to the verge of death, and from the
                    consequences of which he never quite recovered. But sickness could not subdue
                    his intellectual vigour. When the Florentines established a chair for the
                    explanation of the <hi rend="italic">Hiviηa</hi><hi rend="italic">Commedia</hi>
                    in their university, and offered it to Boccaccio, the senescent poet at once
                    undertook the arduous duty. He delivered his first lecture on the 23d of October
                    1373. The commentary on part of the <hi rend="italic">Inferno,</hi> already
                    alluded to, bears witness of his unabated power of intellect. In</p>
                <p>1374 the news of the loss of his dearest friend Petrarch reached Boccaccio, and
                    from this blow he may be said to have never recovered. Almost his dying efforts
                    were devoted to the memory of his friend; urgently he entreated Petrarch’s
                    son-in-law to arrange the publication of the deceased poet’s Latin epic <hi
                    rend="italic">Africa,</hi> a work of which the author had been far more proud
                    than of his immortal sonnets to Laura.</p>
                <p>In his last w ill Boccaccio left his library to his father confessor, and after
                    his decease to the convent of Santo Spirito in Florence. His small property he
                    bequeathed to his brother Jacopo. His own natural children had died before him.
                    He himself died on the 21 st of December</p>
                <p>1375 at Certaldo, and was buried in the church of SS. Jacopo e Filippo of that
                    town. On his tombstone was engraved the epitaph composed by himself shortly
                    before his death. It is calm and dignified, worthy indeed of a great life with a
                    great purpose. These are the lines :—</p>
                <p>“Hac sub mole jacent cineres ac ossa Joannis; Mens sedet ante Deum, meritis
                    ornata laborum Mortalis vitae. Genitor Boccaccius illi; Patria Certaldum;
                    studium fuit alma po&lt;&gt;s'≡”</p>
                <p>A complete edition of Boccaccio’s Italian writings, in 17 vols., has been
                    published by Moutier (Florence, 1834). The life of Boccaccio has been written by
                    Tiraboschi, Mazzuchelli, Count Baldelli <hi rend="italic">(Vita di
                    Boccaccio,</hi> Florence, 1806), and others. The first printed edition of the
                    <hi rend="italic">Decameron</hi> is without date, place, or printer’s name; but
                    it is believed to belong to the year 1469 or 1470, and to have been printed at
                    Florence. Besides this, Baldelli mentions eleven editions during the 15th
                    century. The entire number of editions by far exceeds a hundred. A curious
                    expurgated edition, authorized by the Pope, appeared at Florence, 1573. Here,
                    however, the grossest indecencies remain, the chief alteration being the change
                    of the improper personages from priests and monks into laymen. The best old
                    edition is that of Florence, 1527. Of modem reprints, that by Forfoni (Florence,
                    1857) deserves mention. Manni has written a <hi rend="italic">Storia</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">del Decamerone</hi> (1742), and a German scholar, Μ. Landau, has
                    published (Vienna, 1869) a valuable investigation of the sources of the <hi
                    rend="italic">Decameron.</hi> An interesting English translation of the work
                    appeared in 1624, under the title <hi rend="italic">The Model of Mirth, Wit,
                    Eloquence, and Conversation.</hi> (F. H.)</p>
