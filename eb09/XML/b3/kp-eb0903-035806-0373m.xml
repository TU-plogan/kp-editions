                    most windward of the Caribbean Islands, is situated in lat. 13° 4' N. and long.
                    59° 37' W., 78 miles E. of St Vincent, the island nearest to it in the Caribbean
                    chain. It lies in the track of vessels, and is well adapted to be an <hi
                    rend="italic">entrepôt</hi> of commerce. It has nearly the size and proportions
                    of the Isle of Wight, being 21 miles in length, and about 14 J miles in its
                    broadest part. It has a superficial area of 106,470 acres, or about 166 square
                    miles,—70,000 acres (besides grass laud) are under cultivation, and nearly
                    30,000 acres of sugar-cane are annually cut. The island is almost encircled by
                    coral reefs, which in some parts extend seaward nearly three miles. There are
                    two lighthouses, one on the south point and another on the south-east coast. A
                    harbour light has also been placed on Needham’s Point. The harbour, Carlisle
                    Bay, is a large open roadstead. The inner harbour, or careenage, for small
                    vessels, is protected by a breakwater called the Molehead. Barbados presents
                    every variety of scenery,—hill and valley, smooth table-land and rugged rocks.
                    From one point of view the land rises in a succession of limestone and coral
                    terraces, which indicate different periods of upheaval from the sea. From
                    another there is nothing to be seen but a mass of abruptly-rising rocks. The
                    highest elevation, Mount Hillaby, is 1104 feet above the level of the sea. The
                    island contains but few <pb break="no"

                    the result, no doubt, of volcanic agency, are, however, very numerous, radiating
                    from the high semicircular ridge of the coralline formation in a very regular
                    manner to the west, north, and south, but not to the east, where the coral rocks
                    end abruptly. The chalky soil of the district called Scotland (from its assumed
                    resemblance to the scenery of the Highlands) contains <hi rend="italic"
                    >infusoria,</hi> and is altogether different from the deposits of the coral
                    animals which form the superficial area of six-sevenths of the island (91,000
                    acres). Besides the chalk or marl, sandstone is found in this district. The
                    climate of Barbados is healthy; the temperature equable. For eight months in the
                    year the sea breezes keep it delightfully cool for a tropical country. The
                    extent of cultivation, the absence of swamps (the porous character of the rock
                    immediately underlying the soil preventing accumulations of stagnant water)
                    account fc·r the freedom from miasma. The destruction of the forests may have
                    made the rainfall — upon which successful cultivation depends—somewhat
                    uncertain, but does not seem to have affected it to such an extent as might have
                    been anticipated. The rainfall is caused, apart from elevation, by the exposure
                    of the land to those winds laden with moisture which strike the island at
                    different periods of the year. The average rainfall of the four years 1753-6 was
                    <hi rend="italic">55'89</hi> inches; of the twenty five-years 1847—71, 57 ’ 74
                    inches; of the single year 1873, 51 "2 6 inches. The sugar production of the
                    island is calculated at 800 hogsheads of 16 cwt. each for every inch of
                    rain.</p>
                <p>The N.E. trade-wind blows for three-fourths of the year, and most of the rain
                    comes from the same quarter. March is the driest of the months, and October the
                    wettest; the average rainfall for the former being 1∣ inch, and for the latter 9
                    inches. Leprosy is not uncommon among the negroes, and elephantiasis is so
                    frequent as to be known by the name of “Barbados leg.”</p>
                <p>Bridgetown is the capital and port of the island, and the centre of business
                    activity. It contains about 23,000 inhabitants. Over the creek which received
                    the waters from the heights around the Indians had built a rude bridge. This was
                    known for a long time after the British settlement as the Indian Bridge, but as
                    the settlement grew, and after the old bridge had been replaced by a more solid
                    structure, the place received the name of Bridgetown. The town was destroyed by
                    fire in 1666, and rebuilt, principally of stone, upon a larger scale. It
                    suffered again from fire in 1766 and 1845. It has a large town-hall. The
                    Government buildings are a handsome pile close to the sea. The town follows the
                    curve of the bay. Behind it the hills begin to rise, forming the first
                    stepping-stone to the higher lands of the interior. At the southern extremity
                    are the extensive buildings for the garrison, Barbados being the headquarters of
                    the troops in the West Indian command.</p>
                <p>Opinions differ as to the derivation of the name of the island. It is probably
                    the Spanish w ord for the hanging branches of a vine which strike root in the
                    earth. In maps of the 16th century the island appears under various names, among
                    which are <hi rend="italic">St Bernardo, Bernardos, Barl&gt;u-doso,
                    Baruodos,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Baruodo.</hi> The traces of Indians in this
                    island are more numerous than in any other of the Caribbees. The first recorded
                    visit of Englishmen was in the year 1605, when the crew of the “Olive Blossom”
                    landed, and erected a cross as a memorial of the event, cutting at the same time
                    uponthe bark of a tree the words “James, king of England and of this island.”
                    This party of adventurers did not settle, but from the time of their visit the
                    history of Barbados begins. That history has some special features. It shows the
                    process of peaceful colonization, for the island, acquired without conquest or
                    bloodshedding, has never since been out of the possession of the British. It was
                    the first English colony where the sugar-cane was planted. Its colonists have
                    almost from the beginning enjoyed representative institutions, and the full
                    measure of English freedom. They have always defended their rights with spirit,
                    and shown consistent loyalty to the Crown. The prominence and accessibility of
                    the island have made it important as a military station in the wars with the
                    French and Dutch. And its varying fortunes show the effects of the commercial
                    legislation of England, from the stringent Navigation Laws of Cromwell down to
                    the repeal of the sugar duties in 1874.</p>
                <p>The first patent conveying a proprietary interest in Barbados was granted by
                    James I. to Lord Leigh, afterwards earl of Marlborough. In 1624 a ship,
                    belonging to Sir William Courteen, a rich merchant of London, called at
                    Barbados. The country was found to be thickly "wooded, and uninhabited, except
                    by a great number of wild hogs. Sir William Courteen, having received a
                    description of the place, sent out two large ships under the authority of
                    Marlborough’s patent. One of these, the “John and William,” commanded by John
                    Powell, arrived in February 1625, which is therefore the date of the earliest
                    English settlement in the island. The thirty settlers laid the foundation of a
                    town which they called Jamestown, and chose Captain William Deane their
                    governor. But the earl of Carlisle, having obtained from King James in 1624 the
                    warrant for a grant of all theCaribbean Islands, twenty-two in number, agreed,
                    in 1627, to pay the earl of Marlborough £300 a year for his right to Barbados.
                    The patent in favour of Lord Carlisle passed the great seal on 2d July 1627; but
                    during'his absence on a diplomatic mission soon after, William, earl of
                    Pembroke, the Lord Chamberlain, obtained in the interest of Sir William Courteen
                    a grant of several islands, including Barbados. Upon Lord Carlisle’s return he
                    obtained the revocation of Lord Pembroke’s grant, and the full confirmation of
                    his own rights, upon "which he acted in offering to sell parcels of land for an
                    annual payment of 40 ft&gt; of cotton. The Society of London Merchants then
                    obtained from Lord Carlisle a grant of 10,000 acres, and they appointed Charles
                    Wolferstone, a native of Bermuda, to proceed with sixty-four persons, and to
                    govern the settlement under a commission from the earl. Wolferstone and his
                    party arrived in July 1628 in the bay, know n thenceforth as Carlisle Bay. The
                    antagonism between the earlier settlers under Courteen’s auspices and
                    Wolferstone’s party broke out into actual fighting. Finding that the validity of
                    his patent was still being disputed, Lord Carlisle obtained a further
                    confirmation of it by the king in April 1629, and at once despatched Sir William
                    Tufton as commander-inchief with a sufficient force to subdue the rival
                    settlers. In 1645 Philip Bell became governor, and the real progress of the
                    colony began. Good laws were passed, a judicial system was elaborated; the
                    island was divided into eleven parishes, and a general assembly formed by two
                    representatives of each parish, elected by a majority of freeholders. A council
                    had been in existence since the time of Wolferstone.</p>
                <p>The first settlers cultivated maize, sweet potatoes, plantains, and yams for
                    their own consumption, and indigo, cotton wool, tobacco, ginger, and aloes for
                    export. Quantities of logwood, fustic, and lignum vitae were also shipped. But
                    the adaptability of the soil for cane becoming known, and the necessary
                    knowledge for the manufacture of sugar being obtained, this article at once
                    became the great staple of the colony. The value of property very largely
                    increased. The half of an estate of 500 acres, 200 under cane, with buildings
                    and appurtenances, was sold for £7000 about the year 1650, the labourers being
                    slaves from Africa.</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit03newyrich/page/n375/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0903-0375-0360"/>
                <p>It was while the rapid progress of the colony was attracting especial attention,
                    and many persons of family and means, adherents of the royal cause, were finding
                    it a refuge from the troubles at home, that Francis Lord Willoughby of Parham
                    went out as governor, with the consent of King Charles IL, who had been
                    proclaimed in Barbados as soon as the news of the execution of Charles I. had
                    arrived. Lord Carlisle had died, and his heir had been entrusted with the duty
                    of paying his debts out of the revenue from the island. Lord Willoughby agreed
                    to take a lease from the new earl of the profits of the colony for twenty-one
                    years, to pay Lord Carlisle one-half, and to accept the governorship, including
                    that of the other islands in the Carlisle grant. Upon his arrival in 1650,
                    notwithstanding the active opposition of a party headed by Colonel Walrond, he
                    procured the passing of an Act acknowledging the king’s sovereignty, the
                    proprietary rights of the earl of Carlisle, and his own interest derived from
                    the latter. But the Parliament despatched Sir George Ayscue with a squadron and
                    considerable land forces, to reduce the island to submission to its authority.
                    About the same time the famous Navigation Law was enacted, by which foreign
                    ships were prohibited from trading with British colonies, and imports into
                    England and the dependencies were not allowed in foreign bottoms. This
                    restriction had a great effect upon Barbados, which depended upon foreign
                    importation for a great deal of its provisions. Sir G. Ayscue’s expedition
                    appeared off Barbados in October 1651. After one unsuccessful attempt, a landing
                    was effected, and Lord Willoughby’s force was routed. The counsels of a moderate
                    party in the island, however, prevailed, and a compromise was effected. A treaty
                    was made declaring the authority of the Parliament, but containing provisions
                    not at all unfavourable to the inhabitants, and reserving even to Lord
                    Willoughby his rights in the island. During the Commonwealth prisoners of w ar
                    were sometimes sent to Barbados. The expedition of 1655 against St Domingo and
                    Jamaica under Penn and Venables was reinforced by a troop of horse and 3500
                    volunteers from Barbados. At the Restoration Lord Willoughby went out once more
                    to Barbados and resumed his office. Several of the faithful adherents of the
                    royal cause in the island were made baronets and knights, but the restrictions
                    upon commercial intercourse which had been imposed by the Parliament were made
                    more stringent. Then doubts began to arise in the minds of the planters as to
                    the title by which they held their estates. They had created by their exertions
                    a very valuable property, and the bare possibility of the earl of Carlisle
                    stepping in and dispossessing them caused much discontent. The death of Lord
                    Carlisle brought matters to a crisis. An arrangement was made in 1663 by which
                    the different claimants were satisfied, the proprietary or patent interest was
                    dissolved, and the Crown exercised directly its rights, and undertook the
                    government, although it was not till 1672 that the nomination of the council was
                    taken into the hands of the king. A duty of 4J per cent, upon the produce of the
                    island was levied in 1663 to satisfy the claims and defray the government
                    expenses. Lord Willoughby received a new commission, and the only practical
                    change effected in the constitution was that all laws were thenceforward made
                    subject to confirmation by the king. In 1665 the colony successfully resisted an
                    attack by the Dutch; but in conducting an expedition against the French in
                    Guadaloupe in 1666, Lord Willoughby was lost in a hurricane, and an eventful and
                    occasionally brilliant career was thus prematurely ended. He was succeeded in
                    the government by his brother, Lord William Willoughby, during whose
                    governorship the division of the Caribbean Islands into Windward and Leeward was
                    made. The hurricane of 1675 gave a serious check to the prosperity of the
                    colony. An unsuccessful application was made to the home Government, to remit,
                    on account of the distress that prevailed, the 4⅜ per cent, duty, which pressed
                    very heavily upon the planters. The island had scarcely recovered from the
                    effects of the hurricane when the supply of labour was restricted and its
                    expense increased by the Royal African Company, at the head of which was the
                    duke of York, receiving a charter for the exclusive supply of slaves to the West
                    India Islands. This company had great influence in the appointment of governors;
                    and in consequence of oppressive proceedings and depreciation of the value of
                    property, many families left the island. A number of persons implicated in the
                    duke of Monmonth’s rebellion were sent to Barbados and treated harshly. Duties
                    upon sugar were imposed by the mother country, which were increased at the
                    accession of James IL, to 2s. 4d. per cwt. on Muscovado, and to 7s. upon all
                    sugars for common use. From the survey made by governor Sir Richard Dutton in
                    1683-4, it appears that the population consisted of 17,187 free, 2381 unfree and
                    servants (prisoners of war and persons brought from England under engagements
                    for terms of years), and 46,602 slaves. The number of acres in useful possession
                    was 90,517, and of sugar-works 358. These figures show how rapidly, in spite of
                    all difficulties, the colony had grown in sixty years.</p>
                <p>The wars in Europe were reproduced upon a smaller scale, though with equal if not
                    greater intensity, among the different nationalities in theWest Indies. In such
                    times the seas swarmed with privateers; and freights were so high as to induce
                    the island Legislature to make a vain attempt to regulate them by law. The news
                    of the peace of Ryswick was received with great joy, and matters remained quiet
                    until the declaration of war against France and Spain in 1702 revived
                    privateering in West Indian waters. Events in the first half of the 18th century
                    do not call for detailed description. It was the custom of the assembly to
                    supplement the salary of the governor (which was paid by the Crown out of the 4⅛
                    per cent, duty) by special grants, sometimes of large amount. But this did not
                    prevent many constitutional conflicts between the assembly and the executive.
                    During the war which commenced] between England and France in 1756, the West
                    Indies witnessed much fighting, with its attendant suffering. In 1761 a
                    determined attempt was made to break the power of France in the archipelago.
                    Barbados entered with enthusiasm into the project. Guadaloupe had been taken in
                    1759, and the principal effort now, under Admiral Rodney and General Monckton,
                    was directed against Martinique. In 1762 that island surrendered. Barbados spent
                    .£24,000 in raising and equipping her proportion of men in the attacking forces;
                    and in 1765 the House of Commons voted £10,000 as compensation for the expense
                    incurred. By the Treaty of 1763, however, both these islands were restored to
                    France. The constant wars had naturally an injurious effect upon Barbados.
                    During the governorship of the Hon. Edward Hay, who was appointed in 1773,
                    differences of opinion arose as to the state of the island. When the war between
                    England and the American colonies began, the supply of provisions, upon which
                    Barbados depended, necessarily stopped. The assembly addressed a petition to the
                    king, praying for relief; through the interposition of the governor the relief
                    was not immediately granted, but in 1778, when the island was in a very
                    depressed state, the British ministry sent a quantity of provisions for sale at
                    prime cost. With the advent of General Cunninghame as governor another series of
                    contentious years began. In the midst of disputes as to the right of the
                    governor to exact certain fees without the consent of the assembly, a hurricane
                    visited the island and <pb break="no"

                    in 1782 granted £80,000 for relief, but an attempt to obtain the repeal of the
                    4∣ per cent, duty was again unsuccess fuL The French were regaining their
                    ascendency in the archipelago, and had it not been for the great naval victory
                    won by Sir George Rodney, Barbados and the remaining British colonies might have
                    fallen to the enemy. As the 18th century closed, the prospect of the great final
                    struggle with France overshadowed the colonies. The Barbadians energetically put
                    themselves in a state of defence, and at the same time voted and privately
                    subscribed money to assist his Majesty to carry on the war. The peace of Amiens,
                    in 1802, relieved anxiety for a brief interval, but hostilities were soon
                    renewed. When in 1805 Napoleon sent a squadron to the archipelago, with 4000
                    soldiers, the crisis put Barbados on her mettle. The French fleet was successful
                    in exacting large sums of money from adjacent colonies. Admiral Villeneuve, too,
                    was on his way with a still larger fleet and stronger force. But when Admiral
                    Cochrane arrived off Barbados the safety of the island was secured. Even amid
                    the intense excitement of these events constitutional questions were not
                    forgotten. The governor could only establish martial law when the enemy’s fleet
                    was in sight. A premature declaration drew forth a protest from the assembly,
                    and the controversy was only ended when the Home Government asserted the full
                    prerogative of the Crown to impose martial law when necessary for the safety of
                    the island. The most memorable event in 1805 was a flying visit from Lord Nelson
                    in search of a French fleet. In October of the same year the battle of Trafalgar
                    was won, and Bridgetown soon after had its Trafalgar Square and its Nelson
                    statue. In 1809 an expedition sailed from Barbados, under Governor Beckwith,
                    against the French in Martinique. After a bombardment of five days that place
                    was taken. Twelve months later Beckwith similarly attacked Guadaloupe; and when
                    that island was conquered, after some hard fighting, the power of the French in
                    the archipelago was again reduced to its lowest ebb. When the war ended in 1810
                    in the West Indies, the British were supreme in that region. But danger was
                    threatened from another source. The rupture between Great Britain and the United
                    States in 1812 caused privateering to be resumed to an extent that almost
                    destroyed the commerce of the island, until the abdication of Napoleon and the
                    peace with America in 1814 again brought relief to the colonies. The military
                    history of Barbados ceased at the close of the Peninsular War.</p>
                <p>In the meantime Barbadian affairs had attracted notice in Parliament. In 1812 a
                    motion was made in the House of Commons that the 4⅜ per cent, duty should be
                    applied exclusively to local purposes. A considerable amount of this revenue had
                    been devoted to pensions to persons entirely unconnected with the colony, and it
                    was stated in tho House of Commons that part of the money had been appropriated
                    to the king’s household in the reign of William III. Nor were the Barbadians
                    themselves backward in stating their grievances. In 1813 they protested against
                    the importation of East Indian sugars into Great Britain, and also against the
                    system of patent offices, by which non-resident officials were able to draw
                    large sums from the island for services which they never performed. By Act of
                    the Parliament 6 Geo. IV. c. 114, 1825, foreign commodities were admitted into
                    the British possessions at moderaterates of duty if the countries sending those
                    articles would give similar privileges to British ships. As the United States
                    refused reciprocity, the West Indian ports were closed against their vessels,
                    and the United States retaliated by prohibiting all intercourse with British
                    colonies. From the operation of the above-mentioned Act an important
                    constitutional question arose. These duties, levied in tho name of the king,
                    were to be paid into the local treasury for the uses of the colony, but the
                    customs officers, of course appointed from home, received instructions to retain
                    their own salaries from the revenue. This was denounced by the assembly as
                    illegal, and after a long controversy it was agreed, in 1832, that 10 per cent,
                    should be deducted to defray the expense of collecting the tax. Another question
                    arose which illustrates the relations between England a∏d the colony. By an
                    island Act of 1773, a 2s. Gd. tonnage duty was imposed, but small vessels
                    belonging to residents were only to pay on three voyages a year. By an Act of
                    Parliament in 1832 this exemption was abolished. The assembly protested and
                    denied the right of Parliament to tax colonies which had representative
                    institutions; but Lord Stanley, in 1833, declared that this right existed,
                    although its exercise was a matter of expediency. After the hurricane of 1831,
                    which was perhaps the severest the island had ever experienced, causing 1591
                    deathβ and a destruction of property estimated at more than a million and a half
                    sterling, another urgent appeal was made for the remission of the 4∣ per cent,
                    duty, but without effect, although £100,000 was granted by Parliament in 1832
                    for the relief of the islands which had suffered from the visitation; of this
                    sum Barbados took half. By an Act of Parliament passed in 1838, the 4∣ per cent,
                    duty was at length removed, after having been in existence for 175 year3.</p>
                <p>But a social revolution had begun which was destined to change not so much the
                    prosperity of the colony, as the conditions under which that prosperity arose.
                    From the first settlement, of course, the one great want was labour. As the
                    labour supply increased and became more certain the cultivation expanded, wealth
                    was created, and the importance of the colony grew. In the early days white
                    labour was employed, assisted by Indians obtained from other islands and the
                    mainland of South America, but when the sugar-cane began to be cultivated, negro
                    slaves were imported from Africa. This slave trade, mostly conducted by
                    companies or persons in England, continued until the year 1806, when it was
                    stopped by Act of Parliament. In that year there were 60,000 negroes in the
                    island. This measure was, of course, the first step to the abolition of slavery
                    itself. On the 1st August 1834, the great Act of Emancipation came into force,
                    and four years of apprenticeship began. Out of the 20 millions granted for
                    compensation, Barbados received £1,720,345, being an average payment of £20,
                    14s. on 83,176 slaves. In consequence of the large population and small extent
                    of uncultivated land, emancipation had not in Barbados such a relaxing effect
                    upon the industry of the negroes as it had in the more thinly-populated
                    colonies. An efficient system of town and rural police was, however, essential.
                    From the time of emancipation the negroes multiplied rapidly. In 1844, out of a
                    total population of 122,198, at least 90,000 were negroes, among whom females
                    were largely in excess. The population, notwithstanding an occasional epidemic
                    and almost continuous emigration, has continued to increase, as the following
                    census returns will show :—</p>

                <p>Production and commerce have undergone great fluctuations. Before the navigation

                    24,000 hhds.; in 1805 they were 19,805 hhds. In 1808, probably in consequence of
                    the stoppage of the slave trade, the exports fell to 13,996 hhds. In 1834 they

                    countries. The exports were thus distributed:—£471,175 to the United Kingdom,
                    £388,791 to British Colonies, and £164,166 to foreign countries, including
                    £125,640 to United States. Of the total exports 65 per cent, consisted of native
                    productions, sugar, molasses, and rum. The balance consists of the transit
                    trade, which contributes largely and increasingly to the commercial business of
                    the island. The number of ships entered from the United Kingdom in 1873 was 74,

                    153,400 tons. But in 1873 the crop was deficient. The figures for 1875 will show
                    the employment of a much larger quantity of shipping.</p>
                <p>Barbados is gradually becoming the central mart for all the Windward Islands,
                    even Trinidad finding it more advantageous to derive her breadstuff’s, &amp;c.,
                    from this quarter, than to import them direct from the continent. There was
                    formerly an extensive whale-fishery round the island, and recently attempts have
                    been made to revive its importance. Many other fishes would afford an excellent
                    return, but this source of wealth is in great measure neglected. The anchovy is
                    frequently driven up in shoals on the coast. The flying-fish is one of the
                    principal articles in the Bridgetown market; barracoudas, sharks, and
                    conger-eels are also exposed.</p>
                <p>The local government consists of a governor (who is also governorin-chief of St
                    Vincent, Grenada, Tobago, and St Lucia); a legislative council (the members of
                    which form as well an executive council), appointed by the sovereign, and
                    holding office during pleasure, and the house of assembly. In former times the
                    council exercised judicial functions, but in 1841 a chief-justice was appointed,
                    and recent improvements have relieved the council of their equity and nearly all
                    their appellate jurisdiction. The island is still divided into 11 parishes, each
                    of which sends two representatives to the assembly. In addition to the parishes,
                    Bridgetown sends two members. The number of voters, with the necessary property
                    qualification, is about 1350. The business of the legislature is conducted
                    according to the forms of the English Parliament, even to the election of a
                    speaker to preside over the assembly, the initiation of money bills in that
                    house, and the assertion of the right to exclude strangers. The assembly is
                    elected annually. The revenue of the island in 1873 was £123,676, derived mainly
                    from import duties, tonnage and port-dues, licences, and rum duty. The
                    expenditure was £121,796. The total parochial taxation in 1873 was £31,569,
                    which brings the gross amount of general taxation to £155,245, being at the rate
                    of £1, 9s. Id. per acre, or 17s. 6d. per head of population. The island is free
                    from debt. The judicial establishment includes a court of chancery, which is
                    conducted according to the rules, and follows the decisions, of the English
                    court; a court of common pleas, criminal sessions, &amp;c. The common law of
                    England, modified by local enactments, is in force in Barbados.</p>
                <p>The Church of England is the prevailing form of religion in the island. In 1871
                    the population was thus classified:—Church of England, 144,080; Wesleyans,
                    12,267; Moravians, 4733; and Roman Catholics, 513. Each parish has a rector, and
                    there are twenty-eight curates in the island, all paid by the colonial revenue.
                    The other denominations are also now entitled to grants. In the early days of
                    the plantation, the clergy were paid by one pound of sugar for every acre of
                    land in their parish. The first bishop of Barbados (the diocese including other
                    colonies) was the Right Rev. W. Hart Coleridge, who arrived in 1825, and
                    remained till 1842, when the diocese was divided, and the bishopric of Antigua
                    founded. Trinidad has recently withdrawn from the diocese of Barbados and the
                    Windward Islands, and founded a separate bishopric. Education is extending in
                    Barbados. There were in 1873, 79 primary schools with 8000 scholars on the
                    register, and 67 infant schools, with 5500 scholars, but the average attendance
                    is much smaller. The Government expenditure on these schools for the year was
                    £4000. The principal educational establishment is Codrington College, founded by
                    Colonel Christopher Codrington. He bequeathed two estates, known as Consett’s
                    and Codrington’s, to the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel. They
                    consisted of 763 acres, 3 windmills, sugar buildings, 315 negroes, and 100 head
                    of cattle. The society came into possession in 1712. The will declared that the
                    plantations were to be continued, and 300 negroes always kept upon them; that
                    professors and scholars were to be maintained; and physic, chirurgery, and
                    divinity were to be studied and practised. The college was commenced in 1716,
                    and has seen many vicissitudes. One of its principal objects has been the
                    preparation of candidates for holy orders. There are several theological
                    scholarships of the value of £30 per annum from the college funds, and three of
                    similar value paid by the Colonial treasury. There is a school, recently
                    assisted by the public funds, called the Codrington Collegiate Grammar School,
                    in close connection with the college. Harrison’s College, in Bridgetown,
                    established on an old foundation, has been liberally supported by the
                    Legislature, and promises useful results.</p>
