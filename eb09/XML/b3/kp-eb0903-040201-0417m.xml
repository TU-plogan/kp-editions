                    of physician to the military hospital in Normandy attached to the army of
                    observation commanded by Marshal d’Estrées. A severe attack of hospital fever
                    compelled him to leave this post; but the numerous cases which had come under
                    his notice furnished materials for several papers contributed to the <hi
                    rend="italic">Memoirs of the Academy of Sciences.</hi> In 1757 his services were
                    required in the medical staff of the army of Westphalia, where he had the rank
                    of consulting physician. After his return to Paris he acted for some time as
                    joint editor of the <hi rend="italic">Journal des Seιυans</hi> and the <hi
                    rend="italic">Encyclopédie Méthodique.</hi> In 1761 he obtained a medical
                    professorship at Montpellier, in which his abilities as a teacher soon shone
                    forth with unrivalled lustre. His success was the more honourable, inasmuch as
                    his colleagues—Lamure, Leroy, and Venel—were men of distinguished reputation,
                    and had raised the school to a high pitch of celebrity.</p>
                <p>In 1774 he was created joint chancellor of the university, with the certainty of
                    succeeding singly to the office on the death of the colleague, which happened in
                    1786. He afterwards took the degree of doctor in civil law, and was appointed
                    counsellor to the Supreme Court of Aids at Montpellier. In 1780 he was induced
                    to fix his residence in Paris, having been nominated consulting physician to the
                    king, with a brevet of counsellor of state, and a pension of a hundred louis.
                    Honours were now heaped upon him; he was admitted free associate to the
                    Academies of Sciences and of Inscriptions, and appointed first physician to the
                    duke of Orleans, in the room of Tronchin. His reputation increased in proportion
                    as his merits were displayed on a wider theatre. He practised as a physician at
                    Paris for nearly ten years, and received the most flattering testimonials of
                    public approbation.</p>
                <p>The outbreak of the French Revolution compelled Barthez to leave Paris. He lost
                    considerable part of his fortune, and retired to Carcassonne, where he devoted
                    himself to the study of theoretical medicine. It was in this retreat that he
                    gave to the world his <hi rend="italic">Nouvelle Mécanique des</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Mouvemens</hi><hi rend="italic">de</hi><hi rend="italic">V
                    Homme</hi><hi rend="italic">et des Animaux,</hi> which appeared in 1798.</p>
                <p>On the re-establishment of the College of Medicine at Montpellier, Barthez was
                    naturally looked upon as the person most likely to revive its former fame. But
                    age and infirmity operated to dissuade him from resuming the laborious office of
                    teacher, and he was accordingly nominated honorary professor. In 1802 he
                    received several marks of favour from the new government under Bonaparte; he was
                    nominated titular physician to the Government, and afterwards consulting
                    physician to the emperor, and member of the Legion of Honour.</p>
                <p>His <hi rend="italic">Traitement</hi><hi rend="italic">des Maladies</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Goutteuses,</hi> in two vols. 8vo, appeared in 1802, and he
                    afterwards occupied, himself in preparing for the press a new edition of his <hi
                    rend="italic">Elémens</hi><hi rend="italic">de la Science de ΓHomme,</hi> of
                    which he just lived to see the publication. His health had been declining for
                    some years before his death, which took place soon after his removal to Paris,
                    on the 15th of October 1806, in the 72d year of his age. He bequeathed his books
                    and manuscripts to Μ. Lordat, who, in consequence, published two volumes of <hi
                    rend="italic">Consultations de Medicine,</hi> Paris, 1810, 8vo, to which he
                    prefixed a preface of his own. Another posthumous work of Barthez, the <hi
                    rend="italic">Traité</hi><hi rend="italic">dτι Beau,</hi> preceded by some
                    account of his life, was edited in 1807 by his brother, Μ. Barthez de
                    Marmorières.</p>
                <p>Barthez has enjoyed a much higher reputation on the Continent than in England,
                    where, indeed, his writings <pb break="no"

                    work is the <hi rend="italic">Nouveaux Élémens</hi><hi rend="italic">de la

                    rend="italic">Homme,</hi> in which he unfolds his doctrine of the vital
                    principle, or formative force. He was one of the strongest opponents of the
                    theory which would explain the phenomena of life by physical or chemical laws.
