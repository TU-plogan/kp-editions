                    himself in the midst of the reactionary enthusiasm which did much to restore
                    Italy, in spite of the efforts of her reformers, to the papal authority. There
                    he was brought in contact with Philip Neri, a man who then and since has done
                    much to reconcile the speculativo student with the Church of Rome, and to
                    provide for him work in her service to which he can give his whole heart. Neri
                    had just founded the Italian Oratory, the model of many another, and he and his
                    monks had vowed to devote themselves to student lives, and to dedicate their
                    whole power of study to the Roman Catholic Church. Among the theological studies
                    pursued in the oratory, church history and ecclesiastical biography held a
                    prominent place, the greater part of every forenoon being set apart for these
                    subjects. In this small congregation Baronius found a congenial home, and his
                    superior, Philip Neri, soon saw that he had secured a coadjutor who would make
                    his oratory all he had hoped it would become. The alarm caused by the first
                    Protestant church history, the <hi rend="italic">Magdeburg Centuries,</hi> gave
                    his studies a special direction, and, as he told Pope Sixtus V., he was urged by
                    his own desires, and the encouragement of Neri, to attempt to answer the
                    Magdeburg divines. This was the origin of the <hi rend="italic">Annales
                    Ecclesiastici,</hi> his great work, which occupied thirty laborious years. These
                    <hi rend="italic">Annales,</hi> the first and in many respects the most
                    important historical work which the Roman Catholic Church has produced, begin
                    with the birth of Christ and end with the year 1198. The book is not properly
                    history; it is annals rather, as everything is subordinated to chronology. The
                    year is first given, then the reigning Pope and the year of his reign, then the
                    emperors of the East and West, and, after its institution, the name and year of
                    the emperor of the Holy Roman empire. This chronological form had one
                    advantage—theology was kept as much as possible in the background, and the facts
                    of history were the most important part. The <hi rend="italic">Annales</hi> have
                    thus become very important to every student of church history whether Protestant
                    or Roman Catholic. While Baronius was engaged in his great work he was
                    encouraged by several marks of papal favour. He was named pronotarius of the
                    papal chair; in 1596 he was elected a cardinal; and he was afterwards chosen to
                    fill the much-coveted post of librarian of the Vatican. He died on the 30th of
                    June 1607. The best and most useful edition of his works is that of Mansi, in 38
                    vols. fol.; it gives Pagi's <hi rend="italic">critica</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >lιistorico-theologica,</hi> or corrections of Baronius, at the foot of each
                    page. The best text is the Antwerp edition of 1610.</p>
