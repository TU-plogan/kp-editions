                    rend="italic">fertile,</hi> or, according to some, <hi rend="italic"
                    >basaltic;</hi> and in some of the ancient versions of the Old Testament it is
                    occasionally rendered by a word indicating fertility; thus, in Ps. xxii. 13, the
                    LXX. gives for Bashan πiov∈ς, Aquila gives λιπαροί, Symmachus, σιτιστοί. When we
                    first hear of this region in the days of Abraham it is occupied by the Rephaim,
                    whose chief city is Ashteroth Karnaim (Gen. xiv. 5). These Rephaim, with kindred
                    tribes spread over the trans-Jordanie region, were in great part subdued and
                    supplanted by the children of Lot (Deut. ii. 10. 11, 19-21), who in their turn
                    were invaded and displaced by the Amorites (Num. xx. 26-30). By this people, at
                    the time of the Exodus, the whole region north of the Arnon was occupied; and
                    they formed two kingdoms, the more northerly embracing all Bashan and a part of
                    Gilead (Deut. iii. 8, 13; Josh. xii. 4, 5). Og, who is described as a man of
                    gigantic stature, belonging to the race of the Rephaim, was, at the time
                    referred to, the ruler of this kingdom; and having come out against the
                    Israelities, he was overthrown in battle at Edrei, one of his own cities.
                    Subsequently, his country became the allotment of thehalf tribe of Slanasseh
                    (Josh, xiii. 29-31).</p>
                <p>The information given in connection with the Israelitish conquest enables us to
                    define with considerable exactness the limits of the ancient Bashan. Towards the
                    west it included Golan (Deut. iv. 43; Josh. xx. 8, xxi. 27), a name which to the
                    present day has continued attached to the district, the Jaulân, lying on the
                    east of the Jordan, in its upper course; while towards the east, it reached to
                    Salchah (Deut, iii 10, Ac.), the modern Salkhat, situated on the south-eastern
                    slope of the Haurân mountains. On the south it is represented as immediately
                    adjoining the country of Gilead, whose northern boundary is known to have been
                    the river Jarmuk, and on the north, it is expressly said to have extended to
                    Mount Hermon (Deut, iy. 48, xxxiii. 22; Josh. xii. 5, xiii. 11, 12). Within the
                    limits thus indicated, may be pointed out the towns and other localities
                    mentioned as belonging to Bashan. Ashtaroth, Og’s metropolis, doubtless the
                    Ashteroth Karnaim of Gen. xiv. 5, called also Beeshterah <hi rend="italic"
                    >(cf.</hi> Josh. xxi. 27, and 1 Chron. vi. 71), has been sought in various
                    places, especially in Tel Ashtereh (see Ne∖vbold, <hi rend="italic">Jour. Geog.
                    Sac.,</hi> vol. xvi.), but has now, with much probability, been identified (by
                    Wetzstein, <hi rend="italic">Reisebericht über</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Haurân,</hi> p. 110) with the well-known Busrâh, the Bostra of the Latins,
                    whose position admirably adapts it for a capital city, and whose ruins attest
                    its ancient splendour. Edrei, already mentioned, is to be identified with Derât,
                    on the west of Busrâh (Wetzstein, <hi rend="italic">op. cit.,</hi> p. 47, 77).
                    The position of Golan and Salchah has been indicated, while Kenath (Num. xxxii.
                    42) is recovered in the modern Kunawât (Porter, <hi rend="italic">Five Years in
                    Damascus,</hi> vol. ii. p. 111). The region of Argob will be referred to
                    immediately.</p>
                <p>Within the same limits lie the provinces included by Josephus in the Bashan of
                    the Israelites <hi rend="italic">(cf. Ant. Jud.,</hi> iv. 5, 3; ix. 8, 1; <hi
                    rend="italic">Bell. Jud.,</hi> ii. 6, 3; iii. 3, 5), and recognized generally by
                    the Greek and Roman writers. They are four—Gaulonitis, Trachonitis, Auranitis,
                    and Batanaea, answering as nearly as possible to the natural divisions of the
                    country. The first, Gaulonitis, deriving its name from the ancient Golan, and
                    coincident more or less exactly with the modern Jaulân already mentioned, forms
                    the western division, extending from the Jordan lakes to the Haj road. It is
                    spoken of as divided into two sections, the territory of Gamala, or Gamalitis,
                    and the territory of Sogana <hi rend="italic">(Bell. Jud.,</hi> iv. 1, 1). It
                    forms a fertile plateau, diversified on its northern half by a range of low,
                    richly-wooded hills, the Tell el Faras, which descends from Mount Hermon. The
                    second, Trachonitis (mentioned Luke iii. 1), lay east of the preceding, and
                    adjoined the territory of Damascus, as well as Auranitis and Batanaea <hi
                    rend="italic">(Ant. Jud.,</hi> i. 6, 4; xv. 10,1). This leads us to the
                    remarkable tract, now called the Lejâh, forming one of the two Trachônes, or
                    rocky volcanic districts, lying south and east of Damascus, mentioned by Strabo
                    <hi rend="italic">(Geog.</hi> xvi. p. 520). Inscriptions, moreover, have been
                    found in the Lejâh (see Burckhardt, <hi rend="italic">Travels in Syria,</hi> p.
                    117), which attest that the district was called Trachδn. In this province we may
                    with confidence recognize “the region of Argob,” so often mentioned in the Old
                    Testament, as included in the country of Bashan (Deut. iii. 4, 13, 14; 1 Kings
                    iv. 13). The arguments for this identification are,—1st, The etymology of the
                    word Argob (see Gesenius and Fürst, <hi rend="italic">sub voce)</hi>; 2d, the
                    descriptive term usually conjoined with the name, <hi rend="italic">chebel</hi>
                    Argob, indicating a tract clearly defined and measured off, and applied
                    elsewhere to the line of the sea coast, which the boundary of the Lejâh
                    resembles <hi rend="italic">(cf.</hi> Porter, <hi rend="italic">op. cit.,</hi>
                    vol. ii. p. 241); 3d, by the Targumists the name Argob is rendered <hi
                    rend="italic">Trachυna</hi> (Lightfoot, <hi rend="italic">Chorographical
                    Notes,</hi> § 4). The third province, Auranitis, presents a name known both in
                    ancient and in modern times. In Ezekiel (xlvii. 16, 18) mention is made of
                    Haurân (in the LXX. AυpαvΓτιs), as a locality on the border of the land of
                    Israel. The name is found also on the inscriptions of Assyria, under the form
                    Havranu (Schrader, <hi rend="italic">Die</hi><hi rend="italic">Keilinschriften
                    und</hi><hi rend="italic">das A. T.,</hi> p. 237), and it is common in Arabian
                    writers. In regard to its modern use Porter says <hi rend="italic">(Jour. Sac.
                    Lit.,</hi> July 1854, p. 303), “The name Haurân is at present applied by those
                    at a distance to the whole country east of Jaulân and Jeidûr. By the people of
                    that country, however, it is used in a much more restricted sense, and is given
                    only to the fertile plain on the south of the Lejâh, with the narrow strip on
                    the west. The whole of this district is perfectly flat, with little conical
                    hills at intervals. The soil is the most fertile in Syria, admirably adapted to
                    the production of wheat.” <hi rend="italic">(Of</hi> Burckhardt, <hi
                    rend="italic">op. cit.,</hi> p. 285). The fourth district is Batanaea, a name
                    obviously derived from, and often used by Josephus and others co-extensively
                    with, the old name Bashan. It has, however, a special application to the
                    district lying on the east of the Lejâh and of the Haurân plain, including the
                    central masses of the Jebel ed-Druz or Haurân mountain (apparently the Alsadamus
                    or Alsalamus mons of Ptolemy, and, perhaps, the Salmon of Ps. lxviii. 14; see
                    Reland, <hi rend="italic">Paloestina,</hi> p. 458; Wetzstein, <hi rend="italic"
                    >op. cit.,</hi> p. 90) and its eastern slopes. To this portion of the kingdom of
                    Bashan, the name Ard-el-Bathanyeh is still applied by the natives. Says Porter
                    <hi rend="italic">(op. cit.,</hi> p. 305), “One of the most intelligent Druzes I
                    met with in my whole journey, told me the whole mountains were comprehended in
                    the Ard-el-Bathanyeh.”</p>
                <p>The history of Bashan, after its conquest by the Israelites, merges into the
                    general history of that nation, and of Western Asia. It is last mentioned in the
                    Old Testament, in 2 King8 x. 33, in connection with the attacks made by Hazael,
                    the king of Damascus, upon the territory of Israel. Throughout the Psalms and
                    the Prophets, Bashan is celebrated for its fertility and luxuriance, its rich
                    pastures, its strong bulls, its fatlings “of rams, of lambs, and of goats, of
                    bullocks;” its oaks and its firs (Ps. xxii.</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit03newyrich/page/n426/mode/1up"

                <p>12; Amos iv. 1; Isa. ii. 13; Jer. 1. 19; Ezek. xxxix. 18, xxvii. 6); and its
                    extraordinary fertility is attested by the density of its population (Deut. iii.
                    4, 5, 14)—a density proved by the unparalleled abundance with which ruined towns
                    and cities are now strewn over the whole country. In the disturbed period which
                    followed the breaking up of the empire of Alexander, its possession was an
                    object of continual contest. “Idumaean princes, Nabathaean kings, Arab chiefs,
                    ruled in their turn.” The central portion of the country, Trachonitis, early
                    became a refuge for outlaws and haunt of robbers, a character for which it is
                    singularly fitted by nature, and which it retains to the .present day. (C <hi
                    rend="superscript"> r</hi> ∕. Josephus, Jlni. <hi rend="italic">Jud.,</hi> xv.
                    1; xvi. 9, 2; Strabo, <hi rend="italic">Geog.,</hi> xvi. p. 520; Gul. Tyr., <hi
                    rend="italic">Hist., xv.</hi> 10.) In Arabian tradition Bashan is regarded as
                    the country of the patriarch Job (see Abulfeda, <hi rend="italic">Hist.
                    Anteislamica,</hi> p. 27, 208, and esp. Wetzstein, in Delitzsch, <hi
                    rend="italic">Das Buch Job,</hi> p. 507, /;); and it holds a prominent place in
                    authentic Arabian history as the seat of the dynasty of the Ghassanides (see
                    Caussin de Perceval, <hi rend="italic">L</hi> ’ <hi rend="italic">Histoire des
                    Arabes,</hi> vol. ii. 202, <hi rend="italic">f.</hi>; Wetzstein, <hi
                    rend="italic">op. cit.,</hi> 121,∕.). At the present day the Haurân is one of
                    the seats of that singular people, the Druzes (see <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Druzes).</hi></p>
                <p>Both in its natural and its archaeological aspects, the country of Bashan is full
                    of interest. The Jebel ed-Druz, which rises to nearly 6000 feet in height, is a
                    congeries of extinct volcanoes, and the products of eruption from this source,
                    spread over the adjoining plains, have given to the soil that character of
                    fertility for which it has been in all ages remarkable. <hi rend="italic"
                    >{Cf.</hi> Lyell, <hi rend="italic">Principles of Geology,</hi> 9th ed., p.
                    394.) This volcanic soil, we are told, yields on the average, in some places,
                    eighty returns of wheat, and a hundred of barley (Wetzstein, <hi rend="italic"
                    >op. cit.,</hi> p. 30.) The mountains themselves’ are richly clothed, at least
                    on their western side, with forests of various kinds of trees, among which the
                    evergreen oak is especially abundant. The Lejâh is one of the most remarkable
                    regions on the earth’s surface. “It is,” says one of the latest observers
                    (Burton, <hi rend="italic">Unexplored Syria,</hi> vol. i. p. 164), “in fact a
                    lava bed; a stone torrent poured out . . . over the ruddy yellow clay and the
                    limestone floor of the Haurân valley, high raised by the ruins of repeated
                    eruptions, broken up by the action of fumaroles or blow holes, and cracked and
                    crevassed when cooling by earthquakes, and by the weathering of ages.” (See also
                    Burckhardt, <hi rend="italic">op. cit.,</hi> p. 112; Porter’s <hi rend="italic"
                    >Five Years in Damascus,</hi> vol. ii. p. 241; Wetzstein, <hi rend="italic">op.
                    cit.,</hi> p. 25.)</p>
                <p>In regard to the architectural monuments of the Haurân, the “striking feature,”
                    says Count de Vogué <hi rend="italic">{Recovery of Jerusalem,</hi> p. 423), “is
                    the exclusive use of stone. The country produces no wood, and the only rock
                    which can be obtained is a basalt, very hard and very difficult to work.” The
                    walls are formed of large blocks, carefully dressed, and laid together without
                    cement, and often let into one another with a kind of dovetail. Roofs, doors,
                    stairs, and windows, are all of stone. This, of course, imparts to the buildings
                    great massiveness of appearance and great solidity, and in multitudes of cases
                    the houses, though “without inhabitant,” are as perfect as when first reared.
                    Since buildings so strong are apparently capable of enduring for any length of
                    time, and since some of these are known, from the inscriptions upon them, to
                    date from before the commencement of the Christian era, it is not unnatural to
                    regard them as, in fact, the work of the earliest known inhabitants of the land,
                    the Amorites or the Rephaim. (See Ritter, <hi rend="italic">Paläst. und
                    Syrien,</hi> ii. 964 , Porter, <hi rend="italic">Giant Cities,</hi> p. 79,∕.).
                    This, however, is contested, on the ground that the extant inscriptions and the
                    architectural style point to a much later date, and must be regarded as at least
                    unproved. (See Wetzstein, <hi rend="italic">op. cit.,</hi> p. 103; Fergusson, in
                    <hi rend="italic">Athenaeum,</hi> July 1870, p. 148; Burton, <hi rend="italic"
                    >op. cit.,</hi> vol. i. p. 192.) Many inscriptions have been found in this
                    region,—most of them composed in Greek, a considerable number in two forms of
                    Shemitic writing (the Palmyrenian or Aramaean, and the Sinaitic or Nabathaean),
                    and some in an unknown character, resembling the Himyaritic. Arabic inscriptions
                    are numerous on buildings of more recent date. The oldest recognizable Greek
                    record bears the name of Herod the Great; and the Nabathaean kings, of the
                    dynasty of Aretas, who reigned from about 100 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> at
