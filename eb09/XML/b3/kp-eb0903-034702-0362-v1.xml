                <p><label type="entry">BÂNSWÂRÂ</label> (literally, the forest country), a Râjput
                    feudatory state under the Mewâr agency in Râjputânâ, extends from 23° 10' to 23°
                    48' N. lat., and from 74° 2' to 74° 41' E. long. It borders on Gujarât, and is
                    bounded on the N. by the native states of Dungarpur and Udaipur or Mewâr; on the
                    N.E. and E. by Pratâbgarh; on the S. by the dominions of Holkâr and the state of
                    Jabuâ; and on the W. by the state of Riwâkânta. Bânswârâ State is about 45 miles
                    in length from N. to S., and 33 miles in breadth from E. to W., and has an area
                    of 1440 square miles, with an estimated population of 144,000 souls. The Mahi is
                    the only river in the state, and great scarcity of water occurs in the dry
                    season. The Mahârâwal, as the chief is called, has, however, undertaken the
                    digging of wells, tanks, Ac., to meet this want. The Bânswârâ chief belongs to
                    the family of Udaipur. During the vigour of the Dehli empire Bânswârâ, formed
                    one of its dependencies; on its decline the state passed under the Marhattâs.
                    Wearied out by their oppressions, its chief in 1812 petitioned for English
                    protection, on the condition of his state becoming tributary on the expulsion of
                    the Marhattâs. The treaty of 1818 gave effect to this arrangement; England
                    guaranteeing the prince against external enemies and refractory chiefs; he, on
                    his part, pledging himself to be guided by her representative in the
                    administration of his state. There are 33 tributary chiefs or Thakurs of this
                    state, and the whole strength of force kept up in 1870-71 was G17 men. Indian
                    corn, wheat, pulses, rice, and other kinds of millet form the chief products of
                    Bânswârâ. The revenue of the state amounted to £17,595 in 1870-71, exclusive of
                    £3301 set apart for the personal expenditure of the chief and his family. The
                    total expenditure in the same year amounted to £16,745. An annual tribute of
                    £3997, or 50,000 Salimshâhi rupees, is paid by the chief to the British
                    Government. The custom of <hi rend="italic">sati,</hi> or widow-burning, has
                    long been abolished in the state, but the people retain all their superstitions
                    regarding witches and sorcery; and as late as 1870, a Bhil woman, about 80 years
                    old, was swung to death at Kusalgarh in Bânswârâ, on an accusation of
                    witchcraft. The perpetrators of the crime were sentenced to five years rigorous
                    imprisonment, but they had the sympathy of the people on their side. The chief
                    town is Bânswârâ, lat. 23° 30' and long. 74° 24', situated about 8 miles W. of
                    the Mahi river, surrounded by an old disused rampart, and adorned by various
                    Hindu temples, with the battlements of the chief’s palace overlooking it.</p>
