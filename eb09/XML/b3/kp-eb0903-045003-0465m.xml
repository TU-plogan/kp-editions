                <p><label type="entry">BAVARIA</label> (in German, <hi rend="italic">Bayern),</hi> a
                    kingdom of Southern Germany, forming part of the German Empire, consists of two
                    distinct portions, Bavaria proper and the Palatinate of the Rhine, which are
                    separated by the grand duchies of Baden and Hesse. Bavaria proper contains an
                    area of about 26,895 miles, and the Palatinate rather less than 2282, making the
                    whole extent of the kingdom about 29,177 square miles.</p>
                <p>The frontier of Bavaria proper on the north-east, towards Bohemia, consists of a
                    long range of mountains known as the Böhmerwald; while the north is occupied by
                    the Fichtelgebirge and the Frankenwald, which separate Bavaria from Reuss,
                    Meiningen, and Hesse-Darmstadt. The ranges last named seldom exceed the height
                    of 3000 or 4000 feet; but the ridges in the south, towards the Tyrol, form part
                    of the system of the Alps, and frequently. attain an elevation of 9000 or 10,000
                    feet. On the west it is bounded by Wurtemberg, Baden, and Hesse-Darmstadt. The
                    whole of the country belongs to the basins of the Danube and the Main; by far
                    the greater portion being drained by the former river, which, entering from
                    Swabia as a navigable stream, traverses the entire breadth of the kingdom, with
                    a winding course of 200 miles, and receives in its passage the Iller, the Lech,
                    the Isar, and the Inn from the south, and the Naab, the Altmühl, and the Wörnitz
                    from the north. The Inn is navigable before it enters the <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit03newyrich/page/n466/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0903-0466-0451"/> Bavarian territory, and afterwards receives the
                    Salza, a large river flowing from Upper Austria. The Isar does not become
                    navigable till it has passed Munich; and the Lech is a stream of a similar size.
                    The Main traverses the northern regions, or Upper and Lower Franconia, with a
                    very winding course, and greatly facilitates the trade of the provinces. The
                    district watered by the southern tributaries of the Danube consists for the most
                    part of an extensive plateau, with a mean elevation of 2390 feet. In the
                    mountainous parts of the country there are numerous lakes, and in the lower
                    portions considerable stretches of marshy ground. The climate of Bavaria differs
                    greatly according to the character of the region, being cold in the vicinity of
                    the Tyrol but warm in the plains adjoining the Danube and the Main. On the
                    whole, the temperature is in the winter months considerably colder than that of
                    England, and a good deal hotter during summer and autumn.</p>
                <p>The extent of forest is more than twice that of the land under wood in Great
                    Britain. It forms more than a fourth of the total area of Bavaria, while in
                    Britain the proportion is less than a twenty-sixth. This is owing to various
                    causes—the extent of hilly and mountainous country, the thinness of the
                    population, and the necessity of keeping a given extent of ground under wood for
                    the supply of fuel. Nearly a third of the forests are public property, and
                    furnish a considerable addition to the revenue. They are principally situated in
                    the provinces of Upper Bavaria, Lower Bavaria, and the Upper Palatinate. The
                    level country, including both Lower Bavaria (extending northwards to the
                    Danube), and the western and middle parts of Franconia, is very productive in
                    rye, oats, wheat, barley, and millet, and also in hemp, flax, hops, madder, and
                    (in warm situations) in vines. The last are grown chiefly in the vicinity of the
                    Lake of Constance and on the banks of the Main, in the lower part of its course,
                    while the most extensive hop-growing district is central Franconia. Potatoes are
                    cultivated in all the provinces, but especially in the Palatinate and in the
                    Spessart district, which lies in the north-west within a curve of the Main. The
                    southern division of Swabia and Upper Bavaria, where pasture-land predominates,
                    form a cattle-breeding district, and the dairy produce is extensive, no less
                    than 11,000 tons of cheese and 2386 tons of butter being sold in the course of a
                    year. The former finds a market all over Germany, and is also exported to
                    Austria, France, and other countries, while Northern Germany is the chief
                    consumer of the latter. The greater proportion of the land throughout the
                    kingdom is in the hands of peasant proprietors, the extent of the separate
                    holdings differing very much in different districts. The largest peasant
                    property may be about 170 English acres, and the smallest, except in the
                    Palatinate, about 50.</p>
                <p>According to the returns for 1863 the number of cattle iu the kingdom was
                    3,185,688; sheep, 2,058,638; swine, 926,522; and goats, 150,855. Oxen are
                    largely employed in agricultural operations instead of horses. The cattle, as a
                    general rule, are kept in sheds, and not pastured in the fields.</p>
                <p>Of mineral deposits Bavaria possesses a great variety. Tlιe quantity of iron ore
                    is very large both in the south and north, the number of mines being between 200
                    and 300. Coal-mines are likewise numerous, especially in the districts of
                    Amberg, Kissingen, Steben, Munich, and the Rhine Palatinate. The produce in 1867
                    was nearly 351,000 tons. Of quicksilver there are several mines, chiefly in the
                    Palatinate of the Rhine; and small quantities of copper, manganese, and cobalt
                    are obtained. There are numerous quarries of excellent marble, alabaster,
                    gypsum, and building stone; and the porcelain-clay is among the finest in
                    Europe. To these may be added graphite, emery, steatite, barytes, felspar, and
                    ochre, in considerable quantities; excellent lithographic stone is obtained at
                    Solnhofen; and gold and silver are still worked to an insignificant extent. Salt
                    is annually prepared on a large scale, being obtained partly from brine springs
                    and partly from mines. The principal localities are Halle, Berchtesgaden.
                    Traunstein, and Rosenheim. The gross production in 1866 was 41,119 tons, and the
                    value at the works amounted to £62,869. In the following year the Government
                    monopoly, which had existed so long, was abolished, and free trade was
                    established in salt between the members of tho customs-union, a change which has
                    led to a considerable import of salt from Prussia.</p>
                <p>A great stimulus was ' given to manufacturing industry in Bavaria by the law of
                    1868, which abolished the last remains of the old restrictions of the guilds,
                    and gave the whole country the liberty which had been enjoyed by the Rhine
                    Palatinate alone. The chief manufacturing centres are Nuremberg and Munich for
                    hardware, and Augsburg for cloth goods; but various other towns are rising into
                    importance. In Franconia are numerous paper-mills, and saw-mills are naturally
                    common in the forest districts. A considerable quantity of glass is
                    manufactured, especially in the Böhmerwald, and wooden wares are largely
                    produced at Ammergau and Berchtesgaden. The preparation of the favourite
                    national drink forms an important industry,— the breweries throughout the
                    kingdom numbering upwards of 5000. Among the most remarkable are the breweries
                    of Erlangen. Other articles of manufacture are leather, tobacco, and
                    earthenware.</p>
                <p>The exports from Bavaria consist chiefly of salt, timber, cattle, pigs, corn, and
                    madder; and the imports comprise sugar, tobacco, raw cotton and cotton-goods,
                    silks and linen, iron and iron-wares. As most of the imports are introduced
                    indirectly through other Zollverein states, no custom-house register is kept of
                    the total amount.</p>
                <p>The highroads in Bavaria extend in all over 9000 miles. In 1869 there were rather
                    more than 1600 miles of railway in operation, and nearly 300 were in course of
                    construction. The greater proportion is in the hands of the Government, and the
                    remainder belongs to the Eastern Company and the United Railway Companies of the
                    Rhine Palatinate. The principal canal in the kingdom is the Ludwigs-canal, which
                    connects the Rhine with the Danube, extending from Bamberg on the Regnitz to
                    Dietfurt on <pb break="no"

                    telegraphs, all of which belong to, and are worked by, the Government
                    post-office.</p>
                <p>The Bavarians proper form a distinct section of the German race, speaking a
                    well-defined dialect of the High German, but a large portion of the population
                    of the country is of Swabian origin. The national character resembles that of
                    the Austrians, being generally marked by fidelity and loyalty In matters of
                    religion they are credulous and even superstitious; and the will of their
                    superiors is received by the lower orders with great deference both in political
                    and ecclesiastical affairs. Independence of thought and action have, however,
                    been gradually increasing; and now that the country has become part of the
                    German empire, a rapid transfusion of intellectual and political life is
                    apparently taking place.</p>
                <p>The present form of government is founded partly on long-established usage and
                    partly on a constitutional act, passed in May 1818, and modified by subsequent
                    acts, of which the most important was passed in 1848-9. The monarchy is
                    hereditary, with a legislative body of two houses. The title of the sovereign is
                    simply king of Bavaria; that of his presumptive heir is crown-prince of Bavaria.
                    The executive power is vested altogether in the king, whose person is declared
                    inviolable, the responsibility rests with the ministers, whose functions are
                    nearly the same as those of ministers in England; and there are offices for
                    foreign affairs for the home department, for religion and education, for the
                    treasury, the army, and the administration of justice. These are all situated in
                    Munich, the capital. The upper house of the Bavarian parliament, known as the
                    Chamber of the <hi rend="italic">lieichsrathe,</hi> comprises the princes of the
                    blood-royal, the two archbishops, the barons or heads of certain noble families,
                    a Roman Catholic bishop and Protestant clergyman appointed by the Crown, and any
                    other members whom the king may nominate either as hereditary peers or as
                    counsellors for life; but these last must not exceed a third of the hereditary
                    members. The lower house, or Chamber of Representatives (<hi rend="italic"
                    >Wahlkammer),</hi> consists of about 150 deputies, who formerly were chosen in
                    definite proportions from the different classes of the community, an eighth part
                    from the nobility, another eighth from the clergy, a fourth part from the
                    burghers, and the remaining half from the landed proprietors; but since 1848
                    they may be selected without any such restrictions. A general election takes
                    place once in six years, one deputy being allowed for every 7000 families in the
                    kingdom. The election, however, is indirect,—electoral proxies, or <hi
                    rend="italic">Wahlmänner,</hi> to whom the real election is entrusted, being
                    chosen by the general body of electors at the rate of one proxy to every 500
                    men. The king generally convenes the parliament once a year, and by the
                    constitution it is obligatory on him to do so at least once in three years.</p>

                <p>The Bavarian army forms, since the 23d November 1870, a separate portion of the
                    army of the German empire, with a distinct administration; but its organization
                    is subject to the general imperial rules, and in time of war it is placed under
                    the command of the emperor. It comprises two <hi rend="italic">corps</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">d'armée,</hi> each divided into two divisions. In time of peace
                    its infantry consists of 2G,590 men, distributed in sixteen regiments; besides
                    which there are ten battalions of <hi rend="italic">chasseurs,</hi> 5500 strong,
                    and thirty-two battalions of <hi rend="italic">landwehr;</hi> the cavalry
                    numbers 7200 men divided into ten regiments, and the artillery amounts to 5528
                    men in six regiments; there are also two battalions of pioneers and as many of
                    the military train. In time of war the total force is raised to 149,892, or
                    rather more than trebled.</p>
                <p>The districts of Lower Bavaria, Upper Bavaria, and the Upper Palatinate are
                    almost wholly Catholic, while in the Rhiue Palatinate, Upper Franconia, and
                    especially Middle Franconia, the preponderance is on the side of the
                    Protestants. The exercise of religious worship in Bavaria is altogether free.
                    The Protestants have the same civil rights as the Catholics, and the sovereign
                    may be either Catholic or Protestant. Of the Roman Catholic Church the heads are
                    the two archbishops of Munich-Freising and Bamberg, and the six bishops of
                    Eichstädt, Spire, Würzburg, Augsburg, Regensburg, and Passau, of whom the first
                    three are suffragans of Bamberg. The “Old Catholic” party has recently taken
                    considerable hold of the country, and has organized congregations in all the
                    more important towns. Among the Protestants the highest authority is the general
                    consistory of Munich. The proportion of the different religions in 1871 was as
                    follows:—Roman Catholics, 3,464,364; Protestants, 1,342,592; Jews, 50,662;
                    lesser Christian sects, 5453; other religions, 379.</p>

                    but latterly considerable efforts have been made to lessen the prevailing
                    ignorance. At Munich there are scientific and literary academies, as well as a
                    university, a lyceum, a gymnasium, and other public schools. The university has
                    a very numerous attendance of students, ranking third in the new German empire;
                    and there are two provincial universities on a small scale, one (Catholic) at
                    Würzburg, the other (Protestant) at Erlangen in Franconia. In the kingdom at
                    large there are ten lyceums, twenty-eight gymnasia, about sixty progymnasia,
                    besides ten normal, twenty-six trade, three polytechnic, and upwards of 7000
                    common schools. These certainly form a great contrast to the indifference and
                    neglect of former times; and the Government continues to evince much solicitude
                    for the diffusion of instruction. Technical schools here, as in other parts of
                    Germany, have been established for the purpose of affording to mechanics more
                    suitable education than they could otherwise obtain, including mathematics,
                    mechanics, drawing, chemistry, architecture, &amp;c. These schools are supported
                    by the commune, aided when necessary by the province, and commissioners are
                    annually sent by Government to examine and report upon them to the minister of
                    trade. The course extends over three years, from the age of twelve to fifteen,
                    after which pupils may enter one of three polytechnic schools, where a still
                    higher course of instruction is imparted, also extending over three years; but
                    engineers have a special fourth year’s course. A building school was established
                    at Munich in 1823, and is chiefly intended for carpenters and masons, who are
                    there instructed in architecture, drawing, geometry, stone-cutting, modelling
                    ornaments, &amp;c.</p>
                <p>The duchy of Bavaria during the Middle Ages consisted of the southern half of the
                    present kingdom, and lay almost all to the south of the Danube, extending about
                    100 miles from that river to the Tyrol, and somewhat more from Swabia on the
                    west to Austria on the east. The addition in 1623 of the Upper Palatinate, a
                    province of full 3000 square miles, to the north of the Danube, gave the elector
                    a territory of about 15,000 square miles, with a population of less than
                    1,000,000, which in a century and a half had increased to about 1,500,000. In
                    1778 the succession of the Rhenish branch of the reigning family added the
                    Palatinate of the Rhine, and in 1806 a large augmentation was effected by
                    Napoleon, who presented the king with the districts of the Lower Main and the
                    Rezat, and with part of those of the Upper Main and the Upper Danube; not to
                    mention Tyrol, which was afterwards restored to Austria. Some slight changes
                    have taken place in the extent of the kingdom since then; but its general
                    character has not been affected. The most important cession of recent years was
                    that of part of Franconia in 1866 to Prussia, amounting to 291 square miles,
                    with a population of 32,976 inhabitants. The following table gives the present
                    and former division of the kingdom and its population in 1818, 1846, and 1871
                    respectively:—</p>

                <p>The total population in 1871, including the troops then absent in France,
                    amounted to 4,863,450. The density of population varies considerably in the
                    different districts from about 273 inhabitants to the square mile in the
                    Palatinate to 128 in Upper Bavaria. As represented by the increase of each
                    successive census the growth of the population is rather slow, but a large
                    amount of emigration to America and elsewhere has to be taken into account. A
                    very considerable number of the people are urban, as may be seen from the

                <p>The name in German, <hi rend="italic">Bayern,</hi> or <hi rend="italic"
                    >Baiern,</hi> is derived, like Latin <hi rend="italic">Boiaria,</hi> from Boii,
                    the name of a Celtic people by whom the country, which then formed part of
                    Rhaetia, Vindelicia, and Noricum, was inhabited in the time of Augustus. After
                    the fall of the Roman power the natives were governed by chieftains of their own
                    till the era of Charlemagne, who subjugated this as well as most other parts of
                    Germany. After his death Bavaria was governed by one of his grandsons, whose
                    successors bore the title of Margrave, or Lord of the Marches. In the year 920
                    the ruling margrave was raised to the rank of duke, which continued the title of
                    his successors for no less than seven centuries. During this period Bavaria was
                    connected with Germany nationally by language and politically as a frontier
                    province, but in civilization was almost as backward as Austria, and was greatly
                    behind Saxony, Franconia, and the banks of the Rhine. At last, in 1620, the
                    reigning duke, having rendered great service to Austria against an insurrection
                    in Bohemia, received an important accession of territory at the expense of the
                    Elector Palatine, and was appointed one of the nine electors of the empire. His
                    successors continued faithful members of the Germanic body and allies of Austria
                    until 1771, when the elector Max Emanuel began to assist Louis XIV. of France by
                    threatening and attacking Austria, so as to prevent her from co-operating
                    efficiently with England and Holland. This induced the duke of Marlborough, in
                    the spring of 1704, to march his army above 300 miles from the banks of the
                    Meuse to invade Bavaria, the fate of which was decided by the battle of Blenheim
                    on the 13th August 1704. For ten years from this date the elector and his
                    remaining forces served in the French armies, and his country was governed by
                    imperial commission until the peace of Utrecht, or more properly that of Baden,
                    in 1714, reinstated him in his dominions.</p>
                <p>His son Charles Albert, who succeeded him in 1726, untaught by these disasters,
                    renewed his connection with France; and, in 1740, on the death of the emperor of
                    Germany, came forward as a candidate for the imperial crown. He obtained the
                    nomination of a majority of the electors, and overran a considerable part of the
                    Austrian territory; but his triumph was of short duration, for the armies of
                    Maria Theresa not only repulsed the Bavarians, <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit03newyrich/page/n469/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0903-0469-0454"/> but obtained in 1744 possession of the
                    electorate. The elector died soon after, and his son Maximilian Joseph recovered
                    his dominions only by renouncing the pretensions of his father.</p>
                <p>Bavaria now remained tranquil above thirty years, until 1777, when, by the death
                    of Maximilian, the younger line of the house of Wittelsbach, the line which had
                    long ruled in Bavaria, became extinct. The next heir was Charles Theodore the
                    Elector Palatine, the representative of the elder line of Wittelsbach; but
                    Austria unexpectedly laid claim to the succession, and took military possession
                    of part of the country. This called into the field, on the side of Bavaria,
                    Frederic II. of Prussia, then advanced in years; but, before any blood had been
                    shed, Austria desisted from her pretensions, on obtaining from Bavaria the
                    frontier district which bears the name of Innviertel, or the Quarter of the
                    Inn.</p>
                <p>Bavaria again remained at peace until the great contest between Germany and
                    France began in 1793, when she was obliged to furnish her contingent as a
                    member, of the empire. During three years her territory was untouched; but in
                    the summer of 1796, a powerful French army under Moreau occupied her capital,
                    forced her to sign a separate treaty with France, and to withdraw her contingent
                    from the imperial army. The next war between France and Austria, begun in 1799,
                    ending disastrously for the latter, the influence of France in the empire was
                    greatly strengthened, so that, when the Austrians once more took up arms, in
                    1805, Bavaria was the firm ally of France, and for the first time found
                    advantage in the connection,— its elector, Maximilian Joseph, receiving from
                    Napoleon the title of king and several additions of territory.</p>
                <p>Bavaria continued to support the French interest with her best energies till
                    1813, when, on condition of her late acquisitions being secured to her, she was
                    led to join the Allies, and her forces contributed largely to the ultimate
                    defeat of Bonaparte. In 1818 Maximilian presented his country with a
                    constitution, of rather a mixed character, in which an attempt was made at once
                    to satisfy the growing desire for political liberty and to maintain the kingly
                    power. At the same time several beneficial measures, such as the abolition of ∙.
                    serfdom, were effected in the earlier sessions of the new parliament. 'In 1825
                    Maximilian was succeeded by his son Louis, who distinguished himself a3 a
                    promoter of the fine arts, but proved himself destitute of political capacity,
                    and in consciousness of his disagreement with the spirit of his times, abdicated
                    in March 1848 in favour of his son Maximilian II. It was not long before the
                    difficulties of the new king were distinctly brought to view by the insurrection
                    of the democratic party in Westphalia. By the assistance of Prussia the rising
                    was quelled, and punishment was so ruthlessly inflicted by the tribunals that
                    the trials became known as the bloody assizes. An anti-liberal reaction set in,
                    and many of the political gains of former years were consequently lost. In 1864
                    King Louis was succeeded by his son of the same name (Louis II.); and at this
                    time the great question on the future hegemony of Germany was being agitated
                    throughout the country. In the war of 1866 the Bavarian Government and people
                    threw in their lot with Austria, shared in the contest, and were involved in the
                    defeat and loss. On the withdrawal of Austria from the German confederation a
                    change of policy was introduced, and the Government veered round to the
                    interests of Prussia, a course which was confirmed by the Franco-German War of
                    1870, when Bavaria took an active part with Prussia against the common enemy.
                    Much ferment, however, remained in the country, and religious elements were
                    introduced into the political discussions. The clerical, or, as it styles
                    itself, the patriot party, is opposed to Prussian influence, and contends for
                    “particularism,” wishing to maintain a greater degree of independence for
                    Bavaria than seems to be compatible with imperial unity. For a number of years
                    the Government has been in the hands of the Liberal party. Thus a series of the
                    most important measures have been passed with a liberal tendency, and the
                    country is being gradually assimilated to the more advanced states of Northern
                    Germany. The focus of the Liberal party is the Palatinate of the Rhine, while
                    the “patriots” are mainly recruited from the districts of Old Bavaria. The
                    decisive triumph of the former was marked by the treaty of November 23, 1870,
                    between Bavaria and the Confederation of Northern Germany, which was followed by
                    the recognition of the king of Prussia as the head of a new German empire. At
                    the samo time a greater degree of independence was granted to Bavaria than to
                    the other members of the Confederation; it was freed from the domiciliary
                    surveillance of the empire, and allowed to retain the administration of its own
                    postal and telegraph systems, while its army has a separate organization, and
                    during peace is under the command of the Bavarian king.</p>
