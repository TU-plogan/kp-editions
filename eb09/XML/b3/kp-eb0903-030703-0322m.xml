                    stem bears several clusters of fruit, which somewhat resemble cucumbers in size
                    and form; it dies down after maturing the fruit. The weight of the produce of a
                    single cluster is sometimes as much as 80 ft&gt;, and it was calculated by
                    Humboldt that the productiveness of the banana as compared with wheat is as 133
                    to 1, and as against potatoes 44 to 1. The varieties of banana cultivated in the
                    tropics are as numerous as the varieties of apples in temperate regions, and the
                    best authorities now agree that no specific difference exists between it and the
                    plantain. The fruit is extensively used as food; and in many of the Pacific
                    islands it is the staple on which the natives depend. In its immature condition
                    it contains much starch, which on ripening changes into sugar; and as a ripe
                    fruit it has a sweet but somewhat flavourless taste. From the unripe fruit,
                    dried in the sun, a useful and nutritious flour is prepared. The following
                    represents the percentage composition of the pulp of the ripe fruit
                    :—Nitrogenous matter, 4'820; sugar, pectin, &amp;c., 19'657; fatty matter,
                    0'632; cellulose, 0'200; saline matter, 0'791; water, 73'900. An analysis of the
                    flour by Dr Murray Thomson yielded the following results :—Water, 12'33; starch,
                    7Γ60; gum and sugar, 6'82; nitrogenous matter, 2'01; cellulose, 5'99; oil, 0'50;
                    salts, 0∙64.</p>

                <p>' BANAT, a district in the south-east of Hungary, consisting of the three
                    counties of Thorontai, Temeswar, and Krasso <hi rend="subscript"> i</hi> which
                    has strangely acquired this title, though it was never governed by a “ban.” It
                    is bounded by the Theiss, the Maros, and the Danube, forming almost a regular
                    parallelogram. The soil is in many parts a remarkably rich alluvial deposit.
                    Under the Turkish yoke it was allowed to lie almost desolate in marsh and heath
                    and forest; but Joseph II. determined to render it, if possible, a populous and
                    prosperous district. He accordingly offered land, at a very low rate, to all who
                    were willing to settle within its borders. Germans, Greeks, Turks, Servians,
                    Italians, and Frenchmen responded to his call, and soon developed the
                    agricultural resources of the region. Canals were formed at great expense of
                    labour; marshes and forests were cleared; and now the Banat is one of the most
                    highly cultivated parts of the Austrian empire. Wheat, barley, oats, rye, rice,
                    maize, flax, hemp, rape, sun-flowers, tobacco, grapes, and, in short, nearly all
                    the productions of Europe, are successfully raised. The climate in summer is
                    very like that of Italy, and in winter is milder than in other parts of Hungary.
                    Nor is it any longer unhealthy, though, in 1777, Born spoke of it with horror as
                    a realm of death, and the account given of it in 1802 by Dr Samuel Clarke was
                    not much better. The scenery is extremely diversified, from the plains of
                    Thorontai to the snowy mountains of Krasso. The mineral wealth is considerable,
                    including copper, tin, lead, zinc, iron, and especially coal. Among its numerous
                    mineral springs the most important are those of Menadia, which were known to the
                    Romans as <hi rend="italic">Thermae, Herculis.</hi> Not only there but in other
                    parts of the Banat numerous remains of the Roman occupation still exist. The
                    various origin of its inhabitants may still be easily traced,—the separate
                    settlements having kept remarkably distinct, and in many cases preserving their
                    native languages and customs. The chief town is Temeswar, and other places of
                    importance are Lugos, Kikinda, Becskereh, and Werschitz. Population about
                    1,500,000.</p>
