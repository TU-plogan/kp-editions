                    had a strong bent towards the philosophy with which religion is concerned,—Mr
                    Francis Garbet of Wroxeter being the director of these studies. For a short time
                    his attention was turned to a court life, and he went to London under the
                    patronage of Sir Henry Herbert, master of the revels, to follow that course; but
                    he very soon returned home with a fixed resolve to cultivate the pursuit of
                    divinity. Practical rather than speculative theology seems to have occupied his
                    mind, and he therefore presented himself for ordination without any careful
                    examination of the Church of England system. He was nominated to the mastership
                    of the Free Grammar School, Dudley, in which place he commenced his ministry,
                    having been ordained and licensed by Thornborough, bishop of Worcester. His
                    popularity as a preacher was, at this early period, very great; and he was soon
                    transferred to Bridgnorth, where, as assistant to a Mr Madstard, he established
                    a reputation for the vigorous discharge of the duties of his office.</p>
                <p>During this time he took a special interest in the controversy relating to
                    Nonconformity and the English Church. He soon, on some points, became alienated
                    from the Church; and after the requirement of what is called “the <hi
                    rend="italic">et</hi><hi rend="italic">cetera</hi> oath,” he rejected Episcopacy
                    in its English form. He could not, however, be called more than a moderate
                    Nonconformist; and such he continued to be throughout his life. Though commonly
                    denominated a Presbyterian, he had no exclusive attachment to Presbyterianism,
                    and often manifested a willingness to accept a modified Episcopalianism. All
                    forms of church government were regarded by him as subservient to the true
                    purposes of religion.</p>
                <p>One of the first measures of the Long Parliament was to effect the reformation of
                    the clergy; and. with this view, a committee was appointed to receive complaints
                    against them. Among the complainants were the inhabitants of Kidderminster, a
                    town which had become famous for its ignorance and depravity. This state of
                    matters was so clearly proved that an arrangement was agreed to on the part of
                    the vicar, by which he allowed £60 a year, out of his income of £200, to a
                    preacher who should be chosen by certain trustees. Baxter was invited to deliver
                    a sermon before the people, and was unanimously elected as the minister of the
                    place. This happened in 1641, when he was twenty-six years of age.</p>
                <p>His ministry continued, with very considerable interruptions, for about nineteen
                    years; and during that time he accomplished a work of reformation in
                    Kidderminster and the neighbourhood which is as notable as anything of the same
                    kind upon record. Civilized behaviour succeeded to brutality of manners; and,
                    whereas the professors of religion had been but small exceptions to the mass,
                    the unreligious people became the exceptions in their turn. He formed the
                    ministers in the country around him into an association for the better
                    fulfilment of the duties of their calling, uniting them together irrespective of
                    their differences as Presbyterians, Episcopalians, and Independents. The spirit
                    in which he acted may be judged of from <hi rend="italic">The Deformed
                    Pastor,</hi> a book published in relation to the general ministerial efforts he
                    promoted. It drivée home the sense of clerical responsibility with extraordinary
                    power. The result of his action is that, to this day his memory is cherished as
                    that of the true apostle of the district where he laboured.</p>
                <p>The interruptions to which his Kidderminster life was subjected arose from the
                    condition of things occasioned by the Civil War. Worcestershire was a cavalier
                    county, and a man in Baxter’s position was, while the war continued, exposed to
                    annoyance and danger in a place like Kidderminster. He therefore removed to
                    Gloucester, and afterwards settled in Coventry, where he for the most part
                    remained about two years, preaching regularly both to the garrison and the
                    citizens. After the battle.of Naseby he took the situation of chaplain to
                    Colonel Whalley’s regiment, and continued to hold it till February 1647.</p>
                <p>His connection with the Parliamentary army was a very characteristic one. He
                    joined it that he might, if possible, counteract the growth of the sectaries in
                    that field, and maintain the cause of constitutional government in opposition to
                    the republican tendencies of the time. He regretted that he had not previously
                    accepted an offer of Cromwell to become chaplain to the Ironsides, being
                    confident in his power of persuasion under the most difficult circumstances. His
                    success in converting the soldiery to his views does not seem to have been very
                    great, but he preserved his own consistency and fidelity in a remarkable degree.
                    By public disputation and private conference, as well as by preaching, he
                    enforced his doctrines, both ecclesiastical and political, and shrank no more
                    from urging what he conceived to be the truth upon the most powerful officers
                    than he did from instructing the meanest followers of the camp. Cromwell shunned
                    his society; but Baxter having to preach before him after he had assumed the
                    Protectorship, chose for his subject the old topic of the divisions and
                    distractions of the church, and in subsequent interviews not only opposed him
                    about liberty of conscience, but spoke in favour of the monarchy he had
                    subverted. There is a striking proof of Baxter’s insight into characteι∙ in his
                    account of what happened under these circumstances. Of Cromwell he says, “I saw
                    that what he learned must be from himself.” It is worthy of notice that this
                    intercourse w ith Cromwell occurred when Baxter was summoned to London to assist
                    in settling “the fundamentals of religion,” and made the memorable declaration
                    in answer to the objection, that <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit03newyrich/page/n471/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0903-0471-0456"/> what he had proposed as fundamental “might be
                    subscribed by a Papist or Socinian.” “So much the better,” was Baxter’s reply,
                    “and so much the fitter it is to be the matter of concord,”</p>
                <p>After the Restoration in 1660 Baxter settled in London. He preached there till
                    the Ejectment Act took effect in 1662, and was employed in seeking for such
                    terms of comprehension as would have permitted the moderate dissenters with whom
                    he acted to have remained in the Church of England. In this hope he was sadly
                    disappointed. There was at that time on the part of the rulers of the church no
                    wish for such comprehension, and their object, in the negotiations that took
                    place, was to excuse the breach of faith which their rejection of all reasonable
                    methods of concession involved. The chief good that resulted from the Savoy
                    Conference was the production of Baxter’s <hi rend="italic">Reformed
                    Liturgy,</hi> a work of remarkable excellence, though it was cast aside without
                    consideration. The same kind of reputation which Baxter had obtained in the
                    country he secured in the larger and more important circle of the metropolis.
                    The power of his preaching was universally felt, and his capacity for business
                    placed him at the head of his party. That he should have been compelled by the
                    activity of party spirit to remain outside the National Church is to be deeply
                    regretted. He had, indeed, been made a king’s chaplain, and was offered the
                    bishopric of Hereford, but he could not accept the offer without virtually
                    assenting to things as they were; after his refusal he was not allowed, even
                    before the passing of the Act of Uniformity, to be a curate in Kidderminster,
                    though he was willing to serve that office gratuitously. Bishop Morley even
                    prohibited him from preaching in the diocese of Worcester. The whole case
                    illustrates afresh the vindictive bitterness of ecclesiastical factions in the
                    heat of party contests, and especially in the hour of secular triumph.</p>
                <p>From the Ejectment of 1662 to the Indulgence of 1687, Baxter’s life was
                    constantly disturbed by persecution of one kind or another. He retired to Acton
                    in Middlesex, for the purpose of quiet study, and was dragged thence to prison
                    on an illegal accusation of keeping a conventicle. He was taken up for preaching
                    in London after the licences granted in 1672 were recalled by the king. The
                    meetinghouse which he had built for himself in Oxendon Street was closed against
                    him after he had preached there but once. He was, in 1680, seized in his house,
                    and conveyed away at the risk of his life; and though he was released that he
                    might die at home, his books and goods were distrained. He was in 1684 carried
                    three times to the sessions’ house, being scarcely able to stand, and without
                    any apparent cause was made to enter into a bond for £400 in security for his
                    good behaviour.</p>
                <p>But his worst encounter was with Judge Jeffreys in May 1685. He had been
                    committed to the King’s Bench Prison for his <hi rend="italic">Paraphrase on the
                    New Testament,</hi> which was ridiculously attempted to be turned into a
                    seditious book, and was tried before Jeffreys on this accusation. The scene of
                    the trial is well known as among the most brutal perversions of justice which
                    have occurred in England. Jeffreys himself acted like an infuriated madman; but
                    there were among his blackguardisms some sparks of intelligence.</p>
                <p>Mr Rotlιeram, one of his counsel, said that Baxter frequently attended divine
                    service, went to the sacrament, and persuaded others to do so too, as was
                    certainly and publicly known; and had, in the book charged against him, spoken
                    very moderately and honourably of the bishops of the Church of England. “Baxter
                    for bishops !” Jeffreys.exclaimed, “that’s a merry conceit indeed; turn to it,
                    turn to it.” Upon this, Rotheram read out:—“That great respect is due to those
                    truly called to be bishops among us,” or to that purpose. “Ay,” said Jeffreys,
                    “this is your Fresbyterian cant— truly called to be bishops—that is himself and
                    such rascals, called to be bishops of Kidderminster and other such places,
                    bishops set apart by such factious, snivelling Presbyterians as himself. Λ
                    Kidderminster bishop he means. ’</p>
                <p>That was sharp, however coarse; for, putting the case vulgarly, it was “a
                    Kidderminster bishop” that Baxter meant. He was sentenced to pay 500 marks, to
                    lie in prison till the money was paid, and to be bound to his good behaviour for
                    seven years. It was even asserted at the time that Jeffreys proposed he should
                    be whipped at the cart’s tail through London. The old man, for he was now
                    seventy, remaiued in prison for two years.</p>
                <p>During the long time of oppression and injury which followed the Ejectment,
                    Baxter was sadly afflicted in body. His whole life was indeed one continιred
                    disease, but in this part of it his pain and languor had greatly increased. Yet
                    this was the period of his greatest activity as a writer. He was a most
                    voluminous author, his separate works, it is said, amounting to 168. A
                    considerable proportion of these, including folios and quartos of the most solid
                    description, were published by him while thus deprived of the common rights of
                    citizenship. How he composed them is matter of wonder. They are as learned as
                    they are elaborate, and as varied in their subject as they are faithfully
                    composed. Such treatises as the <hi rend="italic">Christian Directory,</hi> the
                    <hi rend="italic">Methodus Theologiae Christianae,</hi> and the <hi
                    rend="italic">Catholic Theology,</hi> might each have occupied the principal
                    part of the life of an ordinary man. One earthly consolation he had in all his
                    troubles; he was attended upon by a loving and faithful wife, whom he had
                    married in the Ejectment year. She was much younger than himself, and had been
                    brought up as a lady of wealth and station; but she adhered to him in all his
                    wanderings, sharing his sufferings, and following him to prison; and she has her
                    reward in that <hi rend="italic">Breviate</hi><hi rend="italic">of the Life of
                    Mrs Margaret Baxter,</hi> which, while it records her virtues, reveals on the
                    part of her husband a tenderness of nature which might otherwise· have been
                    unknown.</p>
                <p>The remainder of Baxter's life, from 1687 onwards, was passed in peace and
                    honour. He continued to preach and to publish almost to the end. He was
                    surrounded by attached friends, and reverenced by the religious world. His
                    saintly behaviour, his great talents, and his wide influence, added to his
                    extended age, raised him to a position of unequalled reputation. He died in
                    London on the 8th of December 1691, being seventy-six years old, and was buried
                    in Christ Church. His funeral was attended by a very large concourse of people
                    of all ranks and professions, including churchmen as well as dissenters. A
                    similar tribute of general esteem was paid to him nearly two centuries later,
                    when a statue was erected to his memory at Kiddermineter in July 1875. On that
                    occasion clergy of all denominations, among whom the bishop of Worcester and the
                    dean of Westminster were conspicuous, took part in the proceedings. - ·</p>
                <p>There are few persons of whom we can form a more distinct conception than we can
                    of Richard Baxter. His face is quite familiar to us. His thin and stooping
                    figure we seem to have seen. We can imagine the glance of his piercing eye. Who
                    has not smiled at the intensity of his argumentative nature <hi rend="italic"

                    of success, to the church at Bewdley, where he disputed all day with Mr Tombs
                    about infant baptism. Read his correspondence with Dr John Owen relative to the

                    town looked at them as at two boxers in a ring. These are but specimens of other
                    like exhibitions. And yet he was as far as possible from being a quarrelsome
                    man. It was in charity for his opponents that he fought. His pertinacity in
                    contention was the fruit of the sincerity of his aims. He must have been a
                    delightful companion to those who shared his religious or scholastic sympathies.
                    How pleasant and profitable it would have been to witness the intimate
                    intercourse at Acton between him and Sir Matthew Hale! He was at once a man of
                    fixed belief and large appreciation, so that his dogmatism and his liberality
                    sometimes came into collision. There was a universality in his genius which
                    distinguishes him from most other men. His popularity as a preacher was
                    deservedly pre-eminent; but no more diligent student ever shut himself up with
                    his books. He was singularly fitted for intellectual debate, but his devotional
                    tendency was equally strong with his logical aptitude. Some of his writings,
                    from their metaphysical subtilty, will always puzzle the learned; but he could
                    write to the level of the common heart without loss of dignity or pointedness.
                    His <hi rend="italic">Reasons for the Christian Religion</hi> is still, for its
                    evidential purpose, better than most works of its class. His <hi rend="italic"
                    >Poor Man’s Family Book</hi> is a manual that continues to be worthy of its
                    title. His <hi rend="italic">Saints’ Everlasting Rest</hi> will always command
                    the grateful admiration of pious readers. Perhaps no thinker has exerted so
                    great an influence upon Nonconformity as Baxter has done, and that not in one
                    direction only, but in every form of development, doctrinal, ecclesiastical, and
                    practical. He is the type of a distinct class of the Christian ministry,—that
                    class which aspires after scholarly training, prefers a broad to a sectarian
                    theology, and adheres to rational methods of religious investigation and appeal.
                    The rational element in him was very strong. He had a settled hatred to
                    fanaticism. Even Quakerism he could scarcely endure. An infusion of ideal
                    sentiment would have been beneficial to the conduct of his life, as well as to
                    his expositions of truth. The ministers of whom he was the type are to be found
                    in all divisions of the Christian church, but with characteristic modifications.
                    Sometimes their rationalism is most distinctive, sometimes their learning,
                    sometimes their sympathetic feeling. But Baxter excels most of the men he thus
                    represents in his union of those qualities, as well as in the intense sense of
                    religion by which he was actuated. Religion was with him all and in all,—that by
                    which all besides was measured, and to whose interests all else was
                    subordinated.</p>
                <p>A good <hi rend="italic">Life of Baxter,</hi> by the Rev. William Orme, was
                    prefixed to his <hi rend="italic">Practical Works</hi> (published in 23
                    volumes); Dr Calamy abridged his <hi rend="italic">Life and Times.</hi> The
                    abridgment forms the first volume of the account of the ejected ministers, but
                    whoever refers to it should also acquaint himself with the reply to the
                    accusations which had been brought against Baxter, and which will be found in
                    the second volume of Calamy’s <hi rend="italic">Continuation.</hi> Sir James
                    Stephen’s interesting paper on Baxter, contributed originally to the <hi
                    rend="italic">Edinl&gt;urgh Review,</hi> is reprinted in the second volume of
                    his <hi rend="italic">Essays.</hi> The best recent estimates of Baxter are those
                    given by Principal Tulloch in his <hi rend="italic">English Puritanism and its
                    Leaders,</hi> and by Dean Stanley in his address at the inauguration of the
                    statue to Baxter at Kidderminster. But most valuable of all is Baxter’s
                    autobiography, called <hi rend="italic">Reliquioe Baxterianoe,</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">or Mr Richard Baxter’s Narrative of the most memorable Passages of
                    his Life and Times.</hi> It is almost as real as a personal knowledge of its
                    subject could have been. The account he gives at the end of Part I. of the
                    spiritual changes he had undergone will never cease to be regarded as a rare and
                    profoundly interesting instance of faithful self-knowledge, and it has served
                    the cause of Christian charity more, probably, than any treatise ever written on
                    the subject.</p>
                <p>There are two testimonies to Baxter’s worth which, though they have frequently
                    been quoted, cannot be omitted from any fair notice of him. Dr Barrow said that
                    “his practical writings were never mended, and his controversial ones seldom
                    confuted,” and Bishop Wilkins asserted that “if he had lived in the primitive
                    time he had been one of the fathers of the church.”</p>
