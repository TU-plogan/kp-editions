                    acres) of the marshy district called the <hi rend="italic">Fens,</hi> the whole
                    Isle of Ely in Cambridgeshire, and a portion of the north of that county, 30,000
                    acres of Suffolk, 63,000 acres of Norfolk, 57,000 of Huntingdon, about 8000 of
                    Northamptonshire, and the south-eastern portion of Lincolnshire. The extent of
                    the whole tract is 60 miles in length, from Milton in Cambridge to Toynton in
                    Lincoln; its breadth is about 40 miles, from Peterborough in Northampton to
                    Brandon in Suffolk. The boundary on three sides is irregular, giving it
                    something of a horse-shoe shape, with the opening terminated by the sea on the
                    north.</p>
                <p>Tlιis district obtained its present name from the agreement of Francis earl of
                    Bedford, the principal landholder, and thirteen other adventurers, with Charles
                    1. in 1634, to drain the level, on condition of receiving 95,000 acres of the
                    reclaimed land. The district has within historic times undergone remarkable
                    changes. In the time of the Romans it was a dense forest, which, as a stronghold
                    of the Britons, those invaders destroyed. It then became a swamp, through which
                    the lazy waters of the Ouse, the Welland, the Nene, and Wisbeach, crept to the
                    sea. In the 13th century the sea here, as in other parts of N.W. Europe, burst
                    its boundaries, and the inundated land became a pestilential swamp. The first
                    attempt to drain this morass seems to have been made in the year 1436, and
                    embankments and ditches were formed at a great expense. These, however, were
                    swept away during the ensuing winter by the flooding of the River Ouse. Another
                    partial attempt at drainage was made by Bishop Moreton in the reign of Henry
                    VII., but this also proved a failure. An Act was passed in the 44th year of
                    Queen Elizabeth for effecting its reclamation; but the first effectual attempt
                    at reclaiming it was not made until 1634, as already mentioned, and many
                    embankments and canals were constructed at various intervals at an expense above
                    one million sterling. Three years after the agreement of the earl of Bedford and
                    his partners with the king, after an outlay of £100,000 on the part of the
                    company, the contract was annulled, on the fraudulent plea that the works were
                    insufficient; and an offer was made by King Charles to undertake its completion
                    on condition of receiving 57,000 acres in addition to the amount originally
                    agreed on. This unjust attempt was frustrated by the breaking out of the civil
                    war; and no further attempt at drainage was made till 1649, when the Parliament
                    reinstated the earl of Bedford’s successor in his father’s rights. After an
                    additional outlay of £300,000, the adventurers received 95,000 acres of
                    reclaimed land, according to the contract, which, however, fell far short of
                    repaying the expense of the undertaking. In 1664 a royal charter was obtained to
                    incorporate the company, which still exists, and carries on the concern under a
                    governor, 6 bailiffs, 20 conservators, and a commonalty, each of whom must
                    possess 100 acres of land in the level, and has a voice in the election of
                    officers. The conservators must each possess not less than 280 acres, the
                    governor and bailiffs each 400 acres. The original adventurers had allotments of
                    land according to their interest of the original 95,000 acres; but Charles II.,
                    on granting the charter, took care to secure to the crown a lot of 12,000 acres
                    out of the 95,000, which, however, is held under the directors, whereas the
                    allotments are not held in common, though subject to the laws of the
                    corporation. The level was divided in 1697 into three parts, called the North,
                    Middle, and South Levels—the second being separated from the others by the Nene
                    and Old Bedford rivers.</p>
                <p>Since then extensive works have at different times been carried on to complete
                    the drainage of this district; but the most effectual are under the Acts of 1827
                    and 1829, for “Improving the outfall of the Nene,” “The Navigation of the
                    Wisbeach,” and “The Embanking of the Salt Marshes between the canal called
                    Kinderley Cut and the sea.” Vessels of 200 to 300 tons burden can now <pb

                    those of from 500 to 600 tons at spring tides. The draining of the lower lands,
                    which, like the Dutch <hi rend="italic">Polders,</hi> are below low-water mark,
                    was carried on by windmills, but these have now been almost superseded by
                    steam-engines; in the North Level the drainage is effected by sluices. As the
                    result of these extensive operations, the level now abounds in rich pasture and
                    corn lands.</p>
