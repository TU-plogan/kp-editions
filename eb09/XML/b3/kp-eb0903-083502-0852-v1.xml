                    bishop of London, was bom on the 29th May 1786, at Bury-St-Edmund’s. He received
                    his first education at his father’s school in that, town, and was then
                    transferred to the grammar school,, where, under the able instruction of the
                    Rev. M. T. Becher, he laid the foundations of an unusually sound and thorough
                    classical scholarship. His career at Trinity College, Cambridge, which he
                    entered in 1804, was brilliant. He gained the Browne medals for Latin and Greek
                    odes, and carried off the Craven scholarship. In 1808 he graduated as third
                    wrangler and first medallist, and in the following year was elected to a
                    fellowship at Trinity College. The first-fruits of his scholarship was an
                    edition of the <hi rend="italic">Prometheus</hi> of Aeschylus, in 1810; this was
                    followed by editions of the <hi rend="italic">Septem</hi><hi rend="italic"
                        >contra</hi><hi rend="italic">Thebas,</hi><hi rend="italic">Persoe,
                        Choephoeroe,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Agamemnon,</hi> of Callimachus, and
                    of the fragments of Sappho, Sophron, and Alcaeus. Blomfield, however, soon
                    ceased to devote himself to mere scholarship. He had been ordained in 1810, and
                    held for a short time the curacy of Chesterford. He was then presented to the
                    rectory of Quarrington, and shortly afterwards to that of Dunton, in
                    Buckinghamshire, where he remained for about five years. In 1817 he was moved to
                    the benefices of Great and Little Chesterford and Tuddenham, and he was in the
                    same year appointed private chaplain to Howley, .bishop of London. In 1819 he
                    was nominated by Lord Liverpool to the rich living of St Botolph’s, Bishopsgate,
                    and in 1822 <pb break="no"

                        xml:id="kp-eb0903-0853-0836"/> he became archdeacon of Colchester. Two years
                    later he was raised to the bishopric of Chester, and in that position began his
                    career of incessant labour for the advancement of the church. Many reforms, were
                    needed in the diocese, and the new bishop’s energy and ardour succeeded in
                    effecting much, though not without stirring up enemies. In 1828 he was
                    transferred to a wider sphere of activity, being raised to the bishopric of
                    London. This important office he held for eight-and-twenty years, labouring
                    incessantly in a field where unremitting exertion was absolutely necessary. He
                    gave his whole heart to the endeavour to extend the influence and efficiency of
                    the church, and his strenuous activity was not without result. In all political
                    or social movements which concerned the church the bishop took a prominent part.
                    He was noted as being one of the best debaters on the episcopal bench in the
                    House of Lords; he took a leading position in the action for church reform,
                    which culminated in the Ecclesiastical Commission; and he did much for the
                    extension of the colonial episcopate. His health gave way under his unceasing
                    labours, and in 1856 he was permitted to resign his bishopric, retaining Fulham
                    palace as his residence, along with a pension of £6000 per annum. He died at
                    Fulham on the 5th August 1857. In private lite Blomfield was warm-hearted,
                    genial, and kindly; he was fond of travelling and of intellectual society, in
                    which he was well qualified to shine. His published works, exclusive of those
                    above mentioned, consist of charges, sermons, lectures, and pamphlets, and of a
                        <hi rend="italic">Manual of Private and Family Prayers.</hi> He was a
                    frequent contributor to the quarterly reviews, chiefly on classical subjects. An
                    admirable memoir has been published by the bishop’s son, <hi rend="italic"
