                <p><label type="entry">BASKET</label>, a utensil made of twigs, rushes, or strips of
                    wood, as well as of a variety of other materials, interwoven together, and used
                    for holding or carrying any commodity. Modern ingenuity has applied many
                    substances before unthought of to the construction of baskets, such as iron and
                    even glass. But wicker-work being the oldest as well as the most universal
                    invention, it alone will be treated of in the present article. The process of
                    interweaving twigs* seeds, or leaves, is practised among the rudest nations of
                    the world; and as it is one of the most universal of arts,, so also does it rank
                    among the most ancient industries, being probably the origin of all the textile
                    arts of the world. A bundle of rushes spread out may be compared to the warp of
                    a web, and the application of others across it to the woof, also an early
                    discovery; for basket-work 13 literally a web of the coarsest materials. The
                    ancient Britons appear to have excelled in the art of basket-making, and their
                    baskets were highly prized in Rome as we learn from Martial (xiv. 99) :—</p>
                <p>“Barbara de pictis veni bascauda Britannis; Sed me jam mavult dicere Roma suam.”
                    <hi rend="subscript"> j</hi>.</p>
                <p>Among many uncivilized tribes at the present day baskets of a superior order are
                    made and applied to various useful purposes. The North American Indians prepare
                    strong water-tight “Wattape” baskets from the roots of a species of <hi
                    rend="italic">Abies,</hi> and these they frequently adorn with very pretty
                    patterns made from the dyed quills of their native porcupine, <hi rend="italic"
                    >Erethizon dorsatum.</hi> The Indians of South America weave baskets equally
                    useful from the fronds of the Carnahuba and other palms. The Kaffres and
                    Hottentots of South Africa are similarly skilful in using the Ilala reed and the
                    roots of plants; while the tribes of central Africa and the Abyssinians display
                    great adroitness in the art of basket-weaving.</p>
                <p>Basket-making, however, has by no means been confined to the fabrication of those
                    simple and useful utensils from which its name is derived. Of old, the shields
                    of soldiers were fashioned of wicker-work, either plain or covered with hides;
                    and the like has been witnessed among modern savages. In Britain the shields of
                    the ancient warriors, and also their huts, even up to the so-called palaces of
                    the Saxon monarchs, were made of wicker-work; and their boats of the same
                    material, covered with the skins of animals, attracted the notice of the Romans.
                    Herodotus mentions boats of this kind on the Tigris and Euphrates, but with this
                    difference, that the former seem to have been of the ordinary figure of a boat,
                    whereas the latter were round and were covered with bitumen. Boats of this
                    shape, about 71 feet in diameter, are used at the present day on these rivers;
                    and boats of analogous construction are employed in crossing the rivers of India
                    which have not a rapid current. Nothing can be more expeditious or more simple
                    than the fabrication and materials of these vessels, if they merit that name.
                    One may be made by six men in as many hours,—only two substances, hides and
                    bamboo, almost always accessible, being used. Window screens, perambulators,
                    chairs, &lt;fcc., are now largely made of basketwork<pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit03newyrich/page/n437/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0903-0437-0422"/>, and the light pony basket carriages in general
                    use are the representatives of the Continental Holstein waggon of the early part
                    of the century, which was a two-horse basket carriage of considerable size. In
                    Berlin and Kiel there now exist°large factories of “Korb Möbel,” devoted to the
                    manufacture of basket-work chairs, tables, stands, frames, screens, <hi
                    rend="italic">&amp;c.,</hi> and the use of this description of furniture is very
                    general in Continental houses.</p>
                <p>The materials which are actually employed in the construction of basket-work are
                    numerous and varied, and to the principal of these allusion will be made below.
                    As it is, however, from various species of willow that the largest supply of
                    basket-making materials is produced, we shall first confine our attention to
                    this source. Willows for basket-work are extensively grown in Holland, Belgium,
                    France, and Germany, whence large quantities are exported to Great Britain and
                    even to the United States. The willows of France are highly esteemed by
                    basket-makers as firm, clean rods; and the Dutch produce are lowest in value,
                    being soft and pithy. No Continental rods equal those of English growth for
                    their tough and leathery texture, and the finest of all basket-making willows
                    are now cultivated in large quantities in the valleys of the Thames and the
                    Trent. It was only in the early part of this century that any considerable
                    attention was given in Britain to the cultivation of willows suitable for
                    basket-making; and the industry was first stimulated by premiums offered by the
                    Society for the Encouragement of Arts and Manufacturée. Mr Phillips of Ely waβ
                    one of the most successful early cultivators of willows, and to his exertions we
                    owe the introduction of a valuable willow, the Brown Norfolk, <hi rend="italic"
                    >Salix triandra.</hi> Mr Phillipa’s observations and experiments largely
                    contributed to place the willow cultivation on a satisfactory commercial basis,
                    and a similar service was rendered in Scotland by Mr Sheriffs; but the
                    systematic maintenance of willow holts has not been continued in Scotland. One
                    of the most sucessful growers of willows at the present day is Mr William
                    Scaling of Basford, Notts, who cultivates a salictum of about 100 acree in
                    extent. Mr Scaling has the advantage of being a practical basket-maker, and the
                    facts which follow regarding the growth and varieties of basket-willows are
                    chiefly gleaned from his pamphlets on willow cultivation.</p>
                <p>The genus <hi rend="italic">Salix,</hi> to which all willows and osiers belong,
                    is extremely complex in its botanical characters, and the specie3 and varieties,
                    as systematically arranged, are very numerous. Those cultivated for
                    basket-making Mr Scaling divides into four classes. The first class, which alone
                    get the name of willows among basket-makers, includes the rods of six or seven
                    different species, all of which Mr Scaling classes with <hi rend="italic"
                    >Salix</hi><hi rend="italic">fragilis.</hi> The “willows” yield inferior
                    basket-rods, having a tendency to throw out sideshoots which makes the rods
                    “rough.” The second class comprises the osiers, including about forty varieties
                    used by basket-makers all grouped around the osier, <hi rend="italic"
                    >Salix</hi><hi rend="italic">viminalis,</hi> and these form the staple of
                    basket-making materials. In the third class, "which are known in the trade as
                    “Spaniards” or Spanish willows, are included about thirty varieties -which are
                    classed under <hi rend="italic">Salix</hi><hi rend="italic">amygdalina.</hi> The
                    “Spaniards” comprise some of the most useful basket-willows, the wood being more
                    dense and elastic than is the case with osiers. The fourth class comprise the
                    bitter willows, of which <hi rend="italic">Salix purpurea</hi> is taken as the
                    type, and the rods they yield are known â3 “whipcord,” “swallow tail,” or
                    “one-yard.” These are the finest of all willows for basket-making, and owing to
                    their bitterness they are not attacked by rabbits and hares, which frequently do
                    much damage to all other varieties.</p>
                <p>It was long supposed that willows flourish nowhere but with abundance of water.
                    Undoubtedly the osier class thrive well with a considerable degree of humidity,
                    but a dry well-drained soil is best suited for all hard-wooded varieties. For
                    the laying out of a "willow holt, Mr Scaling recommends that the land should be
                    well drained, cleared and tilled to a depth of about one foot. Willows are
                    propagated solely from cuttings, which retain their vitality long, and strike
                    with great facility. The cuttings are made about 9 inches long, and two or three
                    may be obtained from a single rod. They should be planted in rows from 16 to 18
                    inches apart, the plants in each row being placed at intervals of from 8 to 12
                    inches according to the size of the willow under cultivation; and the entire
                    length of the cutting should be pushed into the ground. The planting may be done
                    at any time from late autumn to early spring during the period of plant rest,
                    when the ground is free from frost. At the end of each year the shoots are to be
                    cut down close to the ground, manure is laid on between the r0w3 and ploughed
                    in, and the soil should be kept as open and free from weeds as arable land. The
                    produce of the first year will, as a rule, be of little value; nevertheless, in
                    Mr Scaling’s opinion, it is pf consequence that the rods should be cut down. The
                    second year’s crop should yield a good return; in the third year the plants are
                    at their best, and for the ten following years they should exhibit undiminished
                    productiveness, after which they gradually decline in strength. The entire cost
                    of a salictum per acre Mr Scaling estimates, for the first year, at £33, 12s.,
                    and the return at £8,12s. The outlay for the next two years he gives as £7, 5s.
                    and £6, 15s., but the crops of these years should yield £17 and £22, just
                    covering the cost of planting, which is the ordinary calculation of growers.</p>
                <p>The rods intended for basket-making are either taken entire, cut from the root,
                    split asunder, or stripped of their bark, according to the work to be produced;
                    but in all case3 they are previously soaked in water, and indeed sometimes
                    boiled. The stripping is performed by drawing the willows through a bifurcated
                    iron implement called a brake, wlich removes the bark, and the willows are then
                    cleaned, as far as necessary, by manual operation with a knife. When they are
                    boiled previous to peeling a very nice light brown colour is developed in the
                    wood by the action of . the tannin contained in the bark, and rods this prepared
                    are much more durable than those peeled white. Next they are exposed to the sun
                    and air, and afterwards placed in a dry situation. But it is not the less
                    neceîsary to preserve willows with their bark in the same manner; for nothing
                    can be more injurious than the humidity inherent in the plant; and previous to
                    use they must be soaked some days in water also. The barked or white osier is
                    then divided into bundles or faggots according to size; the larger being
                    reserved to form the strong work in the skeleton of the basket, and the smaller
                    for weaving the bottom and sides. Should the latter be applied to ordinary work,
                    they are taken whole; but for implements of slight and finer texture, each osier
                    is divided into splits and skains of different degrees of size. Splits are
                    osiers cleft into four parts, by means of an implement employed for that purpose
                    called a cleaver, which is a wedge-shaped tool inserted at the point or top end
                    of the rod and run down through its entire length. These are next drawn through
                    an implement resembling the common spoke-shave, keeping the grain of the split
                    next the iron or stock of the shave, while the pith is presented to the steel
                    edge of the instrument, which is set in an oblique direction to the wood: and in
                    order to bring the split into a shape still more regular, it is passed through
                    anotherlimpleτnent called an upright, consisting of a flat piece of steel, each
                    end of which is fashioned into a cutting edge, like that of an ordinary chisel.
                    The flat 13 bent round, so that the two edges approach each other at a greater
                    or less interval by <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit03newyrich/page/n438/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0903-0438-0423"/> means of regulating screws, and the whole is
                    fixed into a handle. By passing the splits between the two edges they are
                    reduced to skains, the thickness of which is determined by the interval between
                    the edges of the tool.</p>
                <p>The implements required by a basket-maker are few and simple. They consist,
                    besides the preceding, of knives, bodkins, leads for keeping the work steady
                    while in process; and where the willows are worked as rods a heavy piece of iron
                    called a beater is employed to beat them close as they are woven in. On the
                    Continent, where fancy baskets are made, blocks are required on which the webs
                    of wicker-work are set to particular shapes.</p>
                <p>An ordinary basket is made by preparing the requisite number of osiers, and
                    preserving their length considerably greater than that of the finished work.
                    They are ranged in pairs on the floor parallel to each other, at small
                    intervals, in the direction of the longer diameter of the basket; and this may
                    be called the woof,—for, as we have said, basketwork is literally a web. These
                    parallel rods are then crossed at right angles by two of the largest osiers,
                    with the thick ends towards the workman, who places his foot upon them; and
                    being each woven alternately over and under the parallel pieces first laid down,
                    they are by that means confined in their places. The whole now forms what is
                    technically called the slath, which is the foundation of the basket. Next the
                    long end of one of the two rods is taken and woven under and over the pairs of
                    short ends all round the bottom, until the whole be woven in. The same is done
                    with the other rod, and then additional long osiers are also woven in, until the
                    bottom be of sufficient size, and the woof be occupied by them. Thus the bottom
                    or foundation on which the superstructure is to be raised is finished; and this
                    latter part is accomplished by sharpening the large ends of as many long and
                    stout osiers as may be necessary to form the ribs or skeleton. These are forced
                    or plaited, “scallumed,” between the rods of the bottom from the edge towards
                    the centre, and are turned up, “upset,” in the direction of the sides; then
                    other rods are woven in and out between each of them, until the basket is raised
                    to the intended height, or, more correctly speaking, the depth it is to receive.
                    The edge or brim is finished by turning down the perpendicular ends of the ribs,
                    now protruding and standing up, over each other, whereby the whole is firmly and
                    compactly united. A handle is adapted to the work by forcing one or more rods
                    called bale sticks, sharpened at the end and cut to the requisite length, down
                    the weaving of the sides, close together; and they are pinned fast, or tied by
                    means of the rods used in twisting over the bale rods, about two inches from the
                    brim, in order that the handle, when completed, may be retained in its proper
                    position. The osiers are then either bound or plaited in such fashion as pleases
                    the taste of the artist. This is the most simple kind of basket, from which
                    others differ only in finer materials and nicer execution; but in these there is
                    considerable scope for taste and fancy, and implements are produced of extreme
                    neatness and ingenuity in construction. The skains are frequently smoked and
                    dyed either of dull or brilliant colours, and by intermixing them judiciously,
                    as also by varnishing over the colour, a very good effect is produced.</p>
                <p>From the simplicity of this manufacture, a great many individuals, independent of
                    professed basket-makers, are occupied in it; and it affords suitable employment
                    to the blind in the several asylums and workshops established for their
                    reception in this and other countries.</p>
                <p>In addition to willows, a large variety of other materials is employed in the
                    fabrication of wicker-work. Among the most important of these are splits of
                    various species of bamboo, with which the Japanese and Chinese manufacture
                    baskets of unequalled beauty and finish. The bamboo wicker-work with which the
                    Japanese sometimes encase their delicate egg-shell porcelain is a marvellous
                    example of manipulation, and they and the Chinese excel in the application of
                    bamboo wicker-work to furniture. The “canes” or rattans of commerce, stems of
                    species of <hi rend="italic">Calamus</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Doemonorops</hi>
                    are scarcely less important as a source of basket materials. In India “Cajan”
                    baskets are extensively made from the fronds of the Palmyra palm, <hi
                    rend="italic">Borassus dabelliformis;</hi> and this manufacture has in recent
                    years been established in the Black Forest of Germany, where it is now an
                    important and characteristic staple. Among the other materials may be enumerated
                    the odorous roots of the Khus-Khus grass, <hi rend="italic">Anatherum</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">muricatum,</hi> and the leaves of various species of screw pine,
                    used in India and the East generally. The fronds of the palm of the Seychelles
                    Islands, <hi rend="italic">Lodoicea seychellarum,</hi> are used for very
                    delicate basket-work in those islands. Strips of the New Zealand flax plant, <hi
                    rend="italic">Phormium</hi><hi rend="italic">tenax,</hi> are made into baskets
                    in New Zealand. Esparto fibre is used in Spain and Algeria for rude fruit
                    baskets. Various species of <hi rend="italic">Maranta</hi> yield basket
                    materials in the West Indies and South America; and the Tirite, a species of <hi
                    rend="italic">Calathea,</hi> is also similarly employed in Trinidad. Baskets are
                    also frequently made from straw, from various sedges (<hi rend="italic"
                    >C</hi><hi rend="italic">y</hi><hi rend="italic">per us),</hi> and from shavings
                    and splints of many kinds of wood.</p>
                <p>In the basket trade special centres are recognized as the headquarters of various
                    styles of work met in the markets. Thus Birmingham is recognized as the source
                    of wicker perambulators; in Southport boiled willows are used, and the brown
                    baskets for gardening and market purposes are produced, and at Castle
                    Donnington, in Derbyshire, the flatskain work seen in fishing baskets, Ac., is
                    chiefly made. In the department of Aisne, France, the <hi rend="italic"
                    >berceaunette</hi> or bassinet is very largely manufactured, and in Verdun much
                    basket-work is specially prepared to suit the English market, in which the
                    French manufacturers are able freely to compete. The Black Forest and other
                    German manufacturers produce enormous quantities of light elegant baskets, which
                    are largely exported. In Austria lacquered and varnished baskets are made in
                    imitation of gold, silver, and steel, and Viennese card baskets, Ac., are
                    frequently ornamented with plaques of painted porcelain inserted in the
                    centre.</p>
