                        rend="smallcaps">b.c.,</hi> that there were none such then,— “neque enim
                    tura basilicae erant” (xxvi. 27). The earliest named is that erected by Μ.
                    Porcius Cato, the censor, 183 B.c. (Liv., xxxix. 44), and called after its
                    founder <hi rend="italic">basilica</hi><hi rend="italic">Porcia.</hi> When once
                    introduced this form of building found favour with the Romans. As many as twenty
                    basilicae are recorded to have existed within the walls of Rome, erected at
                    different periods, and bearing the names of their founders, <hi rend="italic"
                        >e.g.—</hi><hi rend="italic">Aemilia,</hi><hi rend="italic">Julia,</hi><hi
                        rend="italic">Sempronia, Ulpia</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Trajani,</hi>
                    &amp;c. The basilicas were always placed in the most frequented quarter of the
                    city, in the immediate vicinity of a forum, and on its sunniest and most
                    sheltered side, that the merchants and others who resorted thither might not
                    suffer from the severity of the weather (Vitruv., <hi rend="italic">De
                        Architect.,</hi> v. 1). Originally, the basilicas, like the Royal Exchange
                    in London and the Bourse at Antwerp, were unroofed, consisting of a central area
                    surrounded simply by covered porticoes, without side walls. Subsequently, side
                    walls were erected and the central space was covered by a roof, which was
                    generally of timber, the beams being concealed by an arched or coved ceiling,
                    ornamented with <hi rend="italic">lacunaria.</hi> Some basilicas <hi
                        rend="italic">(e.g.</hi> that of Maxentius or “the Temple of Peace ”1 were
                    vaulted.</p>
                <p>In plan the basilicas were large rectangular halls, the length of which,
                    according to the rules laid down by Vitruvius <hi rend="italic">(ubi sup.},</hi>
                    was not to be more than three times or less than twice its width. In any cases
                    where, from the necessity of the locality, the length exceeded these
                    proportions, the excess was to be masked by the construction of small apartments
                        <hi rend="italic">(chalcidica}</hi> at the further end, on both sides of the
                    tribunal. On each side of the central area was one, or sometimes, as in the
                    Ulpian and Aemilian basilicas, two rows of columns. These were returned at
                    either end, cutting off a vestibule at one extremity, and the tribunal or court
                    proper, forming a kind of transept, <pb break="no"
                        facs="ia:encyclopediabrit03newyrich/page/n428/mode/1up"
                        xml:id="kp-eb0903-0428-0413"/> elevated above the nave, at the other. Above
                    the aisles thus formed <hi rend="italic">(porticus)</hi> were galleries, formed
                    by a second row of columns supporting the roof, approached by external
                    staircases, for the accommodation of the general public— men on one side, women
                    on the other (Plin., <hi rend="italic">Epist.,</hi> vi. 33). They were guarded
                    by a parapet wall <hi rend="italic">(pluteus)</hi> between the columns, high
                    enough to prevent those in the galleries from being seen by those below.
                    Sometimes, as in Vitruvius’s ow n basilica at Fanum, and in that at Pompeii,
                    instead of a double there w as only a single row of columns, the whole height of
                    the building, on which the roof rested. In this case the galleries were
                    supported by square piers <hi rend="italic">(parastatoe)</hi> behind the main
                    columns. The building was lighted with windows in the side walls, and at the
                    back of the galleries. In the centre 'of the end-wall were the seats of the
                    judge and his assessors, generally occupying a semicircular apse, the praetor’s
                    curule chair standing in the centre of the curve. When the assessors were very
                    numerous (according to Pliny, <hi rend="italic">u.s.,</hi> they sometimes
                    amounted to one hundred and eighty), they sat in two or three concentric curves
                    arranged like the seats of a theatre. The advocates and other officials filled
                    the rest of the raised platform, divided from the rest of the building by a
                    screen of lattice-work <hi rend="italic">(cancelli).</hi> In the centre of the
                    chord of the apse stood an altar on which the <hi rend="italic">judices</hi>
                    took an oath to administer true justice. The tribunal sometimes ended square
                    instead of apsidally. This is so in the basilica at Pompeii (see the plan
                    annexed), where the tribunal is parted from the body of the hall by a <hi
                        rend="italic">podium</hi> bearing a screen of six columns, and is flanked by
                    staircases to the galleries and by the <hi rend="italic">chalcidica.</hi> The
                    larger and more magnificent basilicas were sometimes finished with an apse at
                    each extremity.</p>
                <p>The plans of Trajan’s basilica usually give this arrangement. The fragment of the
                    ground-plan in the marble tablets preserved in the Capitol, usually called that
                    of the Aemilian. but really, as Canina has shown, that of the Ulpian basilica,
                    also shows an apse, designated <hi rend="italic">(Atrium)</hi><hi rend="italic"
                        >Libertatis.</hi> This, we know from many ancient authorities, was the
                    locality for the manumission of slaves; and, therefore, the tribunal must have
                    been at the other end, and, doubtless, also apsidal. The basilica of Trajan was
                    one of the largest and most magnificent in Rome. From its existing remains we
                    learn that it was 174 feet in breadth, and more than twice as long as it was
                    broad. (The plan and supposed internal arrangements will be seen in the annexed
                    woodcuts from Canina.) The nave, 86 feet in breadth, was divided from <pb
                        break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit03newyrich/page/n429/mode/1up"
                        xml:id="kp-eb0903-0429-0414"/> the double aisles by rows of granite columns,
                    35 feet high. An upper row of columns in front of the galleries above the aisles
                    supported a ceiling, covered with plates of gilt bronze. The total internal
                    height was about 120 feet. The walls were cased with white marble from Luna. It
                    was paved with giallo antico and purple breccia. A side court, which enclosed
                    the -well-known memorial column to Trajan, was flanked by libraries, <hi
                        rend="italic">Bibliotheca Grceca</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Latina</hi>
                    (Sidon. Apollinaris, <hi rend="italic">Epigr.,</hi> ix. 1G).</p>
                <p>The basilica of Maxentius (or of Constantine), usually known as the <hi
                        rend="italic">Temple of Peace,</hi> in the Forum at Rome, was on an entirely
                    different plan from those already described. The internal colonnades were
                    dispensed with, the central space being covered by a vast quadripartite brick
                    vault, in three bays; and the aisles were roofed with three huge barrel vaults,
                    each 72 feet in span. Columns were only used for ornament. The tribunal was
                    apsidal. Its width was 195 feet, but it was 100 feet shorter than Trajan’s
                    basilica. The ground-plan of a small but interesting basilica, of which the
                    foundations remain at Otricoh (Ocriculum), is given by Agincourt (pl. lxxiii.
                    No. 100). The nave is of four bays; beyond the aisles there is an additional
                    aisle of annexed buildings or <hi rend="italic">chalcidica;</hi> the apse is
                    internal. A good example of a provincial basilica remains at Trêves. It is a
                    plain hall, about 90 feet long, the walls being 100 feet high, without aisles,
                    and it has an apsidal tribunal elevated considerably above the floor. Under the
                    empire, when architectural magnificence reached an hitherto unparalleled height,
                        <hi rend="italic">basilicae</hi> formed a part of the plan of the palaces
                    erected by the emperors and nobles of Rome (Vitruv., vi. 81). A beautiful
                    example on a small scale, the <hi rend="italic">Basilica</hi><hi rend="italic"
                        >Jovis,</hi> has been recently excavated in the ruins of the palace of the
                    Caesars on the Palatine. Only the lower part of the walls remains, but the
                    arrangements of the building are singularly perfect, even to the pierced marble
                        <hi rend="italic">cancelli,</hi> and throw the clearest light on the
                    construction of these halls.</p>
                <p>On the establishment of Christianity as the imperial religion, these vast halls
                    furnished exactly what was wanted for the religious assemblies of the Christian
                    community. The basilica was, in fact, a ready-made church, singularly adapted
                    for its new purpose. The capacious nave accommodated the ordinary congregations,
                    the galleries or aisles the females and the more dignified worshippers; while
                    the raised tribunal formed the <hi rend="italic">bema,</hi> or sanctuary,
                    separated by lattice-work from the less sacred portion below, the bishop and his
                    clergy occupying the semicircular apsis. The praetor’s curule chair became the
                    episcopal throne, the curved bench of his assessors the seat for the presbyters
                    of the church. The inferior clergy, readers, and singers took the place of the
                    advocates below the tribunal; while on the site of the heathen altar rose the
                    holy table of the Eucharistic feast, divided from the nave by its protecting
                    lattice-work screen, from which were suspended curtains guarding the sacred
                    mysteries from the intrusive gaze of the profane.</p>
                <p>The words of Ausonius to the Emperor Gratian, in which he speaks of “the
                    basilicas once full of business, but now of prayers for the emperor’s
                    preservation” <hi rend="italic">(Grat. Actio pro</hi><hi rend="italic"
                        >Consulatu),</hi> are a testimony to the general conversion of these civil
                    basilicas into Christian churches. We know this to have been the case with the
                    basilicas of St Cross (S. Croce in Gerusalemme) and St Mary Major’s at Rome,
                    which were halls in the Sessorian and Liberian palaces respectively, granted by
                    Constantine to the Christians. We may adduce also as evidence of the same
                    practice a passage from the theological romance known as <hi rend="italic">The
                        liecognitions of Clement</hi> (bk. x. ch. 71), probably dating from the
                    early half of the 3d century, in which we are told that Theophilus of Antioch,
                    on his conversion by St Peter, made over “the basilica of his house” for a
                    church. But however· this may have been, with, perhaps, the single exception of
                    St Cross, the existing Christian basilicas were erected from the ground for
                    their sacred purpose. At Rome the columns, friezes, and other materials of the
                    desecrated temples and public buildings furnished abundant materials for their
                    construction. The decadence of art is plainly shown by the absence of
                    rudimentary architectural knowledge in these reconstructions. Not only are
                    columns of various heights and diameters made to do duty in the same colonnade,
                    but even different orders stand side by side— <hi rend="italic">(e.g.,</hi>
                    Ionic, Corinthian, and Composite at St Mary’s in the Trastevere); while
                    pilasters assume a horizontal position, and serve as entablatures, as at St
                    Lawrence’s. There being no such quarry of ready-worked materials at Ravenna, the
                    noble basilicas of that city are free from these defects, and exhibit greater
                    unity of design and harmony of proportions. In all cases, however, the type of
                    the civil basilica, which had proved so suitable for the requirements of
                    Christian congregations, was adhered to with remarkable uniformity.</p>
                <p>An early Christian basilica may be thus described in its main features :—A porch
                    supported on pillars (as at St Clement) gave admission into an open court or <hi
                        rend="italic">atrium,</hi> surrounded by a colonnaded cloister (St Clement,
                    Old St Peter’s, St Ambrose at Milan, Parenzo). In the centre of the court stood
                    a cistern or fountain <hi rend="italic">(cantharus,</hi><hi rend="italic"
                        >phiale),</hi> for drinking and ablutions. In close contiguity to the
                    atrium, often to the west, was the baptistery, usually octagonal (Parenzo). The
                    church was entered through a long narrow porch <hi rend="italic">(narthex),</hi>
                    beyond which penitents, or those under ecclesiastical censure, were forbidden to
                    pass. The narthex was sometimes internal (St Agnes), sometimes an external
                    portico (St Lawrence’s, St Paul’s). Three or four lofty doorways, according to
                    the number of the aisles, set in marble cases, gave admission to the church. The
                    doors themselves were of rich wood, elaborately carved with scriptural subjects,
                    or of bronze similarly adorned and often gilt. Magnificent curtains, frequently
                    embroidered with sacred figures or scenes, closed the entrance, keeping out the
                    heat of summer and the cold of winter.</p>
                <p>The interior consisted of a long and wide nave, often 80 feet across, terminating
                    in a semicircular apse, with one or sometimes (St Paul’s, Old St Peter’s, St
                    John Lateran) two aisles on each side, separated by colonnades of marble pillars
                    supporting horizontal entablatures (Old St Peter’s, St Mary Major’s, St
                    Lawrence’s) or arches (St Paul’s, St Agnes, St Clement, the two basilicas of St
                    Apollinaris at Ravenna). Above the pillars the clerestory wall rose to a great
                    height, pierced in its upper part by a range of plain round-headed windows. The
                    space between the windows and the colonnade (the later triforium-space) was
                    usually decorated with a series of mosaic pictures in panels (Old St Peter’s, St
                    Paul’s, St Mary Major’s, St Apollinaris within the walls at Ravenna). The upper
                    galleries of the secular basilicas were not usually adopted· in the West, but we
                    have examples of this arrangement at St Agnes, St Lawrence’s, and the Quattro
                    Santi Coronati. They are much more frequent in the East. The colonnades
                    sometimes extended quite to the end of <pb break="no"
                        facs="ia:encyclopediabrit03newyrich/page/n430/mode/1up"
                        xml:id="kp-eb0903-0430-0415"/> the church (St Mary Major’s), sometimes
                    ceased some little distance from the end, thus forming a transverse aisle or
                    transept (St Paul’s, Old St Peter’s, St John Lateran). Where this transept
                    occurred it was divided from the nave by a wide arch, the western face and
                    soffit of which were richly decorated with mosaics. Over the crown of the arch
                    we often find a bust of Christ or the holy lamb lying upon the altar, and, on
                    either side, the evangelistic symbols, the seven candlesticks, and the
                    twenty-four elders. Another arch spanned the semicircular apse, in which the
                    church always terminated. This was designated the <hi rend="italic">arch of
                        triumph,</hi> from the mosaics that decorated it representing the triumph of
                    the Saviour and His church. The conch or semi-dome that covered the apse was
                    always covered with mosaic pictures on a gold ground, usually paintings of our
                    Lord, either seated or standing, with St Peter and St Paul, and other apostles
                    and saints, on either hand. The beams of the roof were generally concealed by a
                    flat ceiling, richly carved and gilt. The altar, standing in the centre of the
                    chord of the apse on a raised platform, reached by flights of steps, was
                    rendered conspicuous by a lofty canopy supported by marble pillars <hi
                        rend="italic">(ciborium,</hi><hi rend="italic">baldacchino'),</hi> from
                    which depended curtains of the richest materials. Beneath the altar was the <hi
                        rend="italic">confessio,</hi> a subterranean chapel, containing the body of
                    the patron saint, and relics of other holy persons. This was approached by
                    descending flights of steps from the nave or aisles. The <hi rend="italic"
                        >confessio</hi> in some cases reproduced the original place of interment of
                    the patron saint, either in a catacomb-chapel or in an ordinary grave, and thus
                    formed the sacred nucleus round which the church arose. We have good examples of
                    this arrangement at St Peter’s, St Paul’s, St Pudenziana, and St Lawrence. It
                    was copied, as we will see hereafter, in the original cathedral of Canterbury.
                    The bishop or officiating presbyter advanced from his seat in the centre of the
                    semicircle of the apse to the eastern side (ritually) of the altar, and
                    celebrated the Eucharist with his face to the congregation below. At the foot of
                    the altar steps a raised platform occupying the upper portion of the nave formed
                    a choir for the singers, readers, and other inferior clergy. This oblong space
                    was separated from the aisles and from the western portion of the nave by low
                    marble walls or railings. From these walls projected <hi rend="italic"
                        >ambones,</hi> or pulpits with desks, also of marble, ascended by steps.
                    That for the reader of the gospel was usually octagonal, with a double flight of
                    steps westward and eastward. That for the reader of tho epistle was square or
                    oblong.</p>
                <p>The exterior of the basilicas was usually of a repulsive plainness. The vast
                    brick walls were unrelieved by ornament, without any compensating grace of
                    outline or beauty of proportion. An exception was made for the west front, which
                    was usually covered with plates of marble mosaics or painted stucco (Old St
                    Peter’s, St Lawrence’s). This part was frequently crowned with a hollow
                    projecting cornice (St Lawrence’s, Ara Coeli). But in spite of any decorations
                    the external effect of a basilica must always have been heavy and unattractive.
                    The annexed view of St Apollinaris in Classe at Ravenna affords a typical
                    example.</p>
                <p>To pass from general description to individual churches, the first place must be
                    given, as the earliest and grandest examples of the type, to the world-famous
                    Roman basilicas; those of St Peter, St Paul, and St John Lateran, <hi
                        rend="italic">“omnium</hi><hi rend="italic">urbis et orbis ecclesiarum mater
                        et caput."</hi> It is true that no one of these exists in its original form,
                    Old St Peter’s having been entirely removed in the 16th century to make room for
                    its magnificent successor; and both St Paul’s and St John Lateran having been
                    greatly injured by fire, and the last named being so completely modernized as to
                    have lost all interest. Of the two former, however, we possess drawings, and
                    plans, and minute descriptions, which give an accurate conception of the
                    original buildings. To commence with St Peter’s, from the λvoodcuts annexed it
                    will be seen that the church was entered through a vast colonnaded <hi
                        rend="italic">atrium,</hi> 212 feet by 235 feet, with a fountain in the
                    centre,—the atrium being preceded by a porch mounted by a noble flight of steps.
                    The church was 212 feet wide by 380 feet long; the nave, 80 feet in width, was
                    six steps lower than the side aisles, of which there were two on each side. The
                    four dividing colonnades were each of twenty-two Corinthian columns. Those next
                    the nave supported horizontal entablatures. The inner colonnades bore arches,
                    with a second clerestory. The main clerestory walls were divided into two rows
                    of square panels <pb break="no"
                        facs="ia:encyclopediabrit03newyrich/page/n431/mode/1up"
                        xml:id="kp-eb0903-0431-0416"/> containing mosaics, and had windows above.
                    The transept projected beyond the body of the church,—a very unusual
                    arrangement. The apse, of remarkably small dimensions, was screened off by a
                    double row of twelve wreathed columns of Parian marble, of great antiquity,
                    reported to have been brought from Greece, or from Solomon’s Temple. The
                    pontifical chair was placed in the centre of the curve of the apse, on a
                    platform raised several steps above the presbytery. To the right and left the
                    seats of the cardinals followed the line of the apse. At the centre of the chord
                    stood the high altar beneath a ciborium, resting on four pillars of porphyry.
                    Beneath the altar was the subterranean chapel, the centre of the devotion of so
                    large a portion of the Christian world, believed to contain the remains of St
                    Peter; a vaulted crypt ran round the foundation wall of the apse in which many
                    of the popes were buried. The roof showed its naked beams and rafters.</p>
                <p>The basilica of St Paul without the walls, dedicated 324 <hi rend="smallcaps"
                        >a.d.,</hi> rebuilt 388-423, remained in a sadly neglected state, but
                    substantially unaltered, till the disastrous fire of 1823, which reduced the
                    nave to a calcined ruin. Its plan and dimensions were almost identical with
                    those of St Peter’s, as will be seen from the annexed woodcuts. Its double
                    aisles were formed by four colonnades, each of twenty Corinthian pillars, 33
                    feet high, all supporting arches. Of these pillars twenty-four were of the best
                    period of Roman art, taken from the mausoleum of Augustus, or from the basilica
                    Aemilia. The contrast between them and those of the 5th century, standing side
                    by side with them, shows how greatly art had declined. As at St Peter’s, the
                    walls above the arches were lined with a double row of mosaic panels, below
                    which was a band of circles containing portraits of the popes, from St Peter
                    downwards. The transept was parted from the nave by a solid wall, with openings
                    pierced in it, and in later times was divided down the middle by a transverse
                    colonnade. The high altar rose above a crypt, or <hi rend="italic"
                        >confessio,</hi> traditionally believed to be the catacomb of Lucina, a
                    noble Roman Christian matron, to which the body of the apostle Paul had been
                    removed 251 <hi rend="smallcaps">a.d.</hi> The narthex was external. St Paul’s
                    had completely lost its atrium. The bronze doore, covered with scriptural
                    reliefs, had beenbrought from Constantinople.</p>
                <p>The only parts of the modernized five-aisled basilica of St John Lateran (of
                    which we have a plan in its original state, Agincourt, pl. lxxiii. No. 22) which
                    retain any interest, are the double vaulted aisle which runs round the apse, a
                    most unusual arrangement, and the baptistery. The latter is an octagonal
                    building standing some little distance from the basilica to the south. Its roof
                    is supported by a double range of columns, one above the other, encircling the
                    baptismal basin sunk below the floor.</p>
                <p>Of the three-aisled basilicas the best example is the Liberian or St Mary
                    Major’s, dedicated 365, and reconstructed 432 A.D. Its internal length to the
                    chord of the apse is 250 feet, by 100 feet in breadth. The Ionic pillars of grey
                    granite, uniform in style, twenty on each side, form a colonnade of great
                    dignity and beauty, unfortunately broken towards the east by intrusive arches
                    opening into chapels. The clerestory, though modern, is excellent in style and
                    arrangement. Corinthian pilasters divide the windows, beneath w hich are very
                    remarkable mosaic pictures of subjects from Old Testament history, generally
                    supposed to date from the pontificate of Sixtus III., 432-440. The face of the
                    arch of triumph presents also a <hi rend="superscript"> -</hi> series of mosaics
                    illustrative of the infancy of our Lord, of great value in the history of art.
                    The apse is of later date, reconstructed by Paschal I. in 818.</p>
                <p>The Sessorian basilica, now St Cross (Santa Croce in Gerusalemme), is of
                    exceptional arrangement. Originally a hall of the palace known as <hi
                        rend="italic">Sessorium,</hi> it was granted by Constantine for the purposes
                    of Christian worship, and a vast apse, nearly the whole breadth of the hall, was
                    added at the east end. The side walls are pierced by two tiers of large arched
                    openings, originally communicating with a second range of aisles. Of these the
                    lower range has been built up, but the upper is still open, forming immense <hi
                        rend="superscript"> ,</hi> windows.</p>
                <p>Among the remaining basilicas of Rome those of St Lawrence (S. Lorenzo fuori le
                    Mura) and St Agnes deserve special mention, as exhibiting a gallery
                    corresponding to those of the civil basilicas and to the later triforium,
                    carried above the aisle3 and returned acr0s3 the west end. The architectural
                    history of St Lawrence’s is curious. When originally constructed, 578-590, it
                    consisted of a short nave of six bays, with an internal narthex the whole height
                    of the building. In the 13th century Honorius III. disorientated the church, by
                    pulling down the apse, and erecting a nave of twelve bays on its site and beyond
                    it, thus converting the original nave into a square-ended choir, the level bθing
                    much raised, and the magnificent Corinthian columns half buried. As a
                    consequence of the church being thus shifted completely round, the face of the
                    arch of triumph, turned away from the present entrance, but towards the original
                    one, is invested with the usual mosaics (Agincourt, pl. xxviii. Nos. 29, 30,
                    31). The basilica of St Agnes, 625-638, of which we give a plan and section, is
                    a small but interesting building, much like what St Lawrence’s must have been
                    before it was altered. From <pb break="no"
                        facs="ia:encyclopediabrit03newyrich/page/n432/mode/1up"

                    are on a level with the road at the oast end, and were originally entered from
                    it. St Cross originally had similar galleries above the arcade.</p>
                <p>Though inferior in size, and later in date than most of the basilicas already
                    mentioned, that of St Clement is not surpassed in interest by any one of them.
                    This is due to its having retained its original ritual arrangements and
                    church-fittings more perfectly than any other. These fittings have been removed
                    from the earlier church, lying below the existing building, which at some
                    unknown date and for some unrecorded reason, was abandoned, filled up with
                    earth, and a new building erected upon it as a foundation. The most probable
                    account is that the earlier church was so completely overwhelmed in the ruin of
                    the city in 1084, when Robert Guiscard burnt all the public buildings from the
                    Lateran to the Capitol, that it was found simpler and more convenient to build a
                    new edifice at a higher level, than to repair the old one. The annexed plan and
                    view show the peculiarities of the existing building. The church is preceded by
                    an <hi rend="italic">atrium,</hi> the only perfect example remaining in Rome, in
                    the centre of which is the <hi rend="italic">cantharus,</hi> or fountain for
                    ablutions. The atrium is entered by a portico made up of earlier fragments very
                    carelessly put together. The <hi rend="italic">chorus</hi><hi rend="italic"
                        >cantorum,</hi> which occupies about one-third of the nave is enclosed by a
                    low marble screen, about 3 feet high, a work of the 9th century, preserved from
                    the old church, but newly arranged. The white marble slabs are covered with
                    patterns in low relief, and are decorated with ribbons of glass mosaic of the
                    13th century. These screen-walls stand quite free of the pillars, leaving a
                    passage between. On the ritual north stands the gospel-ambo, of octagonal form,
                    with a double flight of steps westwards and eastwards. To the west of it stands
                    the great Paschal candlestick, with a spiral shaft, decorated with mosaic.
                    Opposite, to the south, is the epistle-ambo, square in plan, with two marble
                    reading-desks facing east and west, for the reading of the epistle and the
                    gradual respectively. The sanctuary is raised two steps above the choir, from
                    which it is divided by another portion of the same marble screen. The altar
                    stands· beneath a lofty <hi rend="italic">ciborium,</hi> supported by marble
                    columns, with a canopy on smaller shafts above. It retains the rods and rings
                    for the curtains to run on. Behind the altar, in the centre of the curved line
                    of the apse is a marble episcopal throne,bearing the monogram of Anastasius who
                    was titular cardinal of this church in 1108. The conch of the apse is inlaid
                    with mosaics of quite the end of the 13 th century. The subterranean church,
                    disinterred by the zeal of Father Mullooly, the prior of the adjacent Irish
                    Dominican convent, is supported by columns of very rich marble of various kinds.
                    The aisle walls, as well as those of the narthex, are covered with
                    fresco-paintings, of various dates from the 7th to the 11 th century, in a
                    marvellous state of preservation. (See <hi rend="italic">St Clement, Pope and
                        Martyr, and his Basilica in Rome,</hi> by Joseph Mullooly, O.P., Rome,

                <p>Out of Rome the most remarkable basilican churches are the two dedicated to St
                    Apollinaris at Ravenna. They are of smaller dimensions than those of Rome, but
                    the design and proportions are better. The cathedral of this city, a noble
                    basilica with double aisles, erected by Archbishop Ursus, 400 A.D. (Agincourt,
                    pl. xxiii., No. 21), was unfortunately destroyed on the erection of the present
                    tasteless building. Of the two basilicas of St Apollinaris, the earlier, S.
                    Apollinare Nuovo, originally an Arian church erected by Theodoric, 493-525,
                    measuring 315 feet in length by 115 feet in breadth, has a nave 51 feet wide,
                    separated from the single aisles by colonnades of twenty-two pillars, supporting
                    arches, a small prismatic block bearing a sculptured cross intervening with very
                    happy effect between the capital and the arch. The clerestory wall is not
                    stilted to the excessive height of the Roman examples. Below the windows a

                    deserves special attention from the fact that it preserves, in a more perfect
                    state than can be seen elsewhere, the arrangements of the seats in the apse. The
                    bishop’s throne occupies the centre of the arc, approached by a steep flight of
                    steps. Six rows of stone benches for the presbyters, rising one above another
                    like the seats in a theatre, follow the curve on either side,—the whole being
                    singularly plain and almost rude. The altar stands on a platform; the sanctuary
                    is divided from the nave by a screen of six pillars. The walls of the apse are
                    inlaid with plates of marble. The church is 125 feet by 75 feet. The narrow
                    aisles are only 7 feet in width.</p>
                <p>Another very remarkable basilica, less known than it deserves to be, is that of

                    west of it. Nine pillars divide each aisle from the nave, some of them borrowed
                    from earlier buildings. The capitals are Byzantine. The choir occupies the three
                    easternmost bays. The apse, as at Torcello, retains the bishop’s throne and the
                    bench for the presbyters apparently unaltered. The mosaics are singularly
                    gorgeous, and the apse walls, as at Torcello, are inlaid with rich marble and
                    mother-of-pearl. The dimensions are small,—121 feet by 32 feet. (See <hi

                <p>In the Eastern church, though the erection of St Sophia at Constantinople
                    introduced a new type which alm03t entirely superseded the old one, the
                    basilican form, or as it was then termed <hi rend="italic">dromical,</hi> from
                    its shape being that of a race-course <hi rend="italic">(dromos},</hi> was
                    originally as much the rule as in the West. The earliest church of which we have
                    any clear account, that of Paulinus at Tyre, 313-322 <hi rend="smallcaps"
                        >a.d.,</hi> described by Eusebius <hi rend="italic">(H. E.,</hi> x. 4, §
                    37), was evidently basilican, with galleries over the aisles, and had an atrium
                    in front. That erected by Constantine at Jerusalem, on the site of the Holy
                    Sepulchre, 333, followed the same plan (Euseb., <hi rend="italic">Γit.
                        Const.,</hi> iii. c. 29), as did the original churches of St Sophia and of
                    the Apostles at Constantinople. Both these buildings have entirely passed away,
                    but we have an excellent example of an Oriental basilica of the same date still
                    standing in the church of the Nativity at Bethlehem, rebuilt by Justinian in the
                    6th century. Here we find an oblong atrium, a vestibule or narthex, double
                    aisles with Corinthian columns, and a transept, each end of which terminates in
                    apse, in addition to that in the usual position. Beneath the centre of the
                    transept is the subterranean church of the Nativity (De Vogué, <hi rend="italic"
                        >Les</hi><hi rend="italic">Eglises</hi><hi rend="italic">de la Terre</hi><hi
                        rend="italic">Sainte,</hi> p. 46).</p>
                <p>Constantinople still preserves a basilican church of the 5th century, that of St
                    John Studios, 463, now a mosque. It has a nave and side aisles divided by
                    columns supporting a horizontal entablature, with another order supporting
                    arches forming a gallery above. There is the usual apsidal termination. The
                    chief difference between the Eastern and Boman basilicas is in the magnitude of
                    the galleries. This is a characteristic feature of Eastern churches, the
                    galleries being intended for women, for whom privacy was more studied than in
                    the West (Salzenberg, <hi rend="italic">Altchrist. Baudenkmale</hi><hi
                        rend="italic">von Constantinople}.</hi></p>
                <p>Other basilican churches in the East which deserve notice are those of the
                    monastery of St Catherine on Mount Sinai built by Justinian, that of Dana
                    between Antioch and Bir of the same date, St Philip at Athens, Bosrah in Arabia,
                    Xanthus in Lycia, and the very noble church of St Demetrius at Thessalonica.

                    of the early French basilica, dating from the <pb break="no"

                    neighbourhood of the Lake of Constance at Reichenau and Romain Motier, and at
                    Granson on the Lake of NeufchateL</p>
                <p>The first church built in England under Roman influence was the original Saxon
                    cathedral of Canterbury. From the annexed ground-plan, as conjecturally restored
                    by Professor</p>
                <p>Willis from Eadmer’s description, we see that it was an aisled basilica, with an
                    apse at either end, containing altars standing on raised platforms approached by
                    steps. Beneath the eastern platform was a crypt, or <hi rend="italic"
                        >confessio,</hi> containing relics, “fabricated in the likeness of the
                    confessionary of St Peter at Rome” (Eadmer) The western apse, dedicated to the
                    Blessed Virgin, contained the bishop’s throne. From this and other indications
                    Willis thinks that this was the original altar end, the eastern apse being a
                    subsequent addition of Archbishop Odo, <hi rend="italic">circa</hi> 950, the
                    church having been thus turned from west to east, as at the already-described
                    basilica of St Lawrence at Rome The choir, as at St Clement’s, occupied the
                    eastern part of the nave, and like it was probably enclosed by breast-high
                    partitions. There were attached towers to the north and south of the nave. The
                    main entrance of the church was under that to the south. At this <hi
                        rend="italic">suthdure,</hi> according to Eadmer, “all disputes from the
                    whole kingdom, which could not legally be referred to the king’s court, or to
                    the hundreds and counties, received judgment.” The northern tower contained a
                    school for the younger clergy.</p>
                <p>There remains one other English basilican church to be mentioned, that of
                    Brixworth in Northamptonshire, probably erected by Saxulphus, abbot of
                    Peterborough, <hi rend="italic">circa</hi> 690 <hi rend="smallcaps">a.d.</hi> It
                    consisted of a nave divided from its aisles by quadrangular piers supporting
                    arches turned in Roman brick, with small clerestory windows above, a short
                    chancel terminating in an apse, outside which, as at St Peter’s at Rome, ran a
                    circumscribing crypt entered by steps from the chancel. At the w est end was a
                    square tower, the lower story of which formed a porch.</p>
