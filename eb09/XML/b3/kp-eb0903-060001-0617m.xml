                    and 8° 28' E. long. It extends from the French and Alsace frontier south-east
                    through the heart of the Confederacy to Valais, by which it is bounded on the
                    S., while it has the cantons of Basel, Soleure, Aargau, Lucerne, Unterwalden,
                    and Uri on the E., and Vaud, Freiburg, Neufchâtel on the W. Bern is the second
                    largest canton of Switzerland, its surface being estimated at 2562 square miles.
                    The population in 1870 amounted to 506,465, of whom 436,304 were Protestants,
                    and 66,015 Catholics, while 1401 were Jews. German was spoken in 83,693
                    families, and French in 16,646, the latter language prevailing in the N.W. The
                    canton is naturally divided into three regions, in which the climate varies with
                    the elevation. The southern part, called the Oberland, is for its scenery the
                    most attractive part of all Switzerland. Many of the grandest mountains of the
                    Alpine system—such as the Grimsel, the Finsteraarhorn, the Schreckhorn, the
                    Wetterhorn, the Eiger, and the Jungfrau—lie along the frontier chain, and
                    numerous offshoots and valleys of great beauty stretch northward towards the
                    central part of the canton. This latter district consists for the most part of
                    an undulating plain, interspersed with lesser chains and hills,—the soil being
                    fertile and well cultivated. The north is occupied with the ranges of the Jura
                    system. The principal river in the canton is the Aar, which drains by far the
                    larger proportion of its surface, either directly or by means of its numerous
                    tributaries. Of these, the most important are the Saane, from the S.; the
                    Thiele, which forms the outlet of the lakes of Bienne and Neufchâtel; and the
                    Emme, which gives its name to the beautiful Emmenthal. The northern corner of
                    the canton is divided between the basins of the Rhone and the Rhine. On the
                    upper course of the Aar are the two lakes of Brienz and Thun. The mineral wealth
                    of the country is neither extensive nor varied; but iron-mines are worked, and
                    gold is found in the River Emme. Quarries of sandstone, marble, and granite are
                    abundant. The pastures in the Oberland and the Emmenthal are excellent, and
                    cattle and horses of the best description are largely reared. The latter
                    district also produces cheese of excellent quality, which is exported to Germany
                    and Italy. Fruit is extensively cultivated in the central region and in the
                    neighbourhood of the lakes of Brienz and Thun; the vine is principally grown to
                    the north ®f Lake Bienne. In the forests, which are of considerable importance,
                    the prevailing trees are the fir, the pine, and the beech. The industrial
                    productions of the canton are cotton, woollen and flaxen stuffs, leather,
                    watches, and wooden wares of all kinds. Bern is divided into thirty bailiwicks
                    or prefectures, each with a local administrator. The capital is Bern, and the
                    other chief towns are Bienne or Biel, Thun, Burgdorf or Berthoud, Porrentruy or
                    Pruntruit, and Délémont or Delsberg. The highest legislative authority is the
                    Great Council, the members of which are chosen in proportion to the number of
                    the people; and the executive power is in the hands of a lesser council of nine
                    members, chosen by the Great Council for a space of four years. The educational
                    institutions in the canton comprise a university and two gymnasiums in the
                    capital, and progymnasiums and colleges at Biel, Thun, Burgdorf, Neuenstadt,
                    Porrentruy, and Délémont. There is a deaf and dumb institution at Frienisberg,
                    and a cantonal lunatic asylum at Waldau, about a mile from Bern.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Bern,</hi> the capital of the above canton, and, since 1848,
                    the permanent seat of the Government and Diet of the Swiss Confederation. It is
                    situated in 46° 47' N. lat. and 7° 25' E. long., at an elevation of 1710 feet
                    above the sea, on a sandstone peninsula, formed by the windings of the Aar,
                    which is crossed on the south side of the city by an extensive weir, and further
                    down passes under four bridges connecting the peninsula with the right bank. It
                    is one of the most characteristically Swiss towns; some of the streets are broad
                    and regular, the houses being well built with hewn stone; in others a peculiar
                    effect is produced by the presence of lines of arcades down the sides. Prominent
                    among the public buildings is the Federal Council Hall, or <hi rend="italic"
                    >Bundes-Rathhaus,</hi> a fine structure in the <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit03newyrich/page/n618/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0903-0618-0601"/> Florentine style, which was completed in
                    1∙&gt;857. The upper story is occupied by a picture-gallery of some value. The
                    town-hall dates from 1406, and was restored in ⅛861. Among the ecclesiastical
                    buildings the first place is held by the cathedral, a richly-decorated Gothic
                    edifice, begun in 1421 and completed in 1573, from the neighbourhood of which a
                    splendid view of the Alps is obtained. Educational institutions are very
                    numerous, comprising a university, founded in 1834, which is attended by 250
                    students, a gymnasium, and a veterinary school. Attached to the university are a
                    botanical garden and an observatory; and there are, besides, a valuable museum,
                    a public library of 45,000 volumes, especially rich in works relating to Swiss
                    history, and several literary and scientific societies. Among the charitable
                    establishments are two large hospitals (the Inselspital and the Bürgerspital), a
                    foundling hospital, two orphan asylums, and a lunatic asylum. Another aeylum was
                    erected in 1854, about 2∣ miles from the city. The penitentiary is capable of
                    containing 400 prisoners. Among other buildings of interest are the granary,
                    which, till 1830, used to be stored with corn in case of famine; the clock
                    tower, with its automatic pantomime; the arsenal, with its mediaeval treasures;
                    the mint; and the Murtner Gate. The most frequent ornament throughout the city
                    is the figure of the bear, in allusion to the mythical origin of the name of
                    Bern; and the authorities still maiutain a bear’s den at municipal expense.
                    Although, properly speaking, not a commercial city, Bern carries on some trade
                    in woollen cloth, printed calico, muslin, silk stuffs, straw hats, stockings,
                    and other articles of home manufacture. The climate is severely cold in winter,
                    owing to the elevation of the situation. The population, which is mainly
                    Protestant, was 36,000 in 1870.</p>
                <p>Bern was founded, or at least fortified, by Berthold V. of Zähringen, about the
                    end of the 12th or beginning of the 13th century, and gradually became a refuge
                    for those who were oppressed by feudal exactions in the neighbouring countries.
                    In 1218 it was declared a free imperial city by the Emperor Frederick II. At
                    first its constitution was purely democratic; but in 1293 a legislative body of
                    200 citizens was appointed, which formed the germ of one of the most remarkable
                    oligarchies in modern European history. The extension of territory, gradually
                    effected by the valour of the Bernese, rendered necessary a more elaborate and
                    rigid organization than that which had sufficed while the limits of the city
                    were almost the limits of the state; and the power of the .nobility at home was
                    strengthened by every new success against the enemies of the city. The blow that
                    decided the fate of Bern was struck at Laupen on June 21, 1339, when Rudolph von
                    Erlach beat the allied army of the neighbouring states. It continued to
                    flourish, and in 1352 joined the Swiss Confederation. A fire destroyed the city
                    in 1405, but it was rebuilt on the same plan. In the 17th century the gradually
                    increasing aristocratic tendency reached its climax. The adoption of new
                    burghers was forbidden, and the burghers proper were carefully distinguished
                    from those who were merely permanent inhabitants of the city; the burghers were
                    divided into th03e capable of holding office in the state and those destitute of
                    that privilege; and the privileged class itself, which, by 1785, numbered only
                    69 families, was subdivided into a higher and a lower grade. This élite grew
                    more and more exclusive and domineering, and at last became unendurable to their
                    humbler fellow-citizens. In 1748 the discontent made itself evident in a
                    formidable conspiracy, of which the unfortunate Henzi was one of the leaders.
                    The conspiracy was crushed, but the opposition broke out through other channels.
                    At last the French Revolution came to submerge the aristocracy in a general
                    Helvetian republic; and when the flood had passed the ancient landmarks eould
                    not be replaced, though a restoration was attempted with at first an appearance
                    of success. The Liberal party has long been the strongest in the canton, which
                    has at last returned almost to democracy; for, in 1870, the <hi rend="italic"
                    >referendum</hi> was introduced, by which it is agreed that all laws, after
                    being discussed by the Great Council, shall first receive the sanction of the
                    people before they come into force.</p>
