                <p><label type="entry">BOA</label>, a name formerly applied to all large Serpents,
                    which, devoid of poison fangs, killed their prey by constriction; but now
                    confined to that section of them occurring in America, the Old World forms being
                    known as Pythons. The true boas are widely distributed throughout tropical
                    America, occurring most abundantly in Guiana and Brazil, where they are found in
                    dry sandy localities, amid forests, on the banks of rivers and lakes, and in the
                    water itself, according to the habits of the various species. They feed chiefly
                    on the smaller quadrupeds, in search of which they often ascend trees,
                    suspending, themselves from the branches by the tail, and thus awaiting
                    motionless the approach of their victim. While so hanging they are partly
                    supported by two spine-like hooks, situated one on each side of the vent, which
                    are connected with several small bones concealed beneath the skin and attached
                    to the main skeleton. These bones, terminating thus in an external claw, are
                    characteristic of the family <hi rend="italic">Boidoe,</hi> and are recognized
                    by anatomists as the rudiments of those which form the hind limbs in all
                    quadrupeds. The size of the boa’s prey often seems enormously beyond its
                    apparent capacity for swallowing, a difficulty which disappears on acquaintance
                    with the peculiar structure of the creature’s jaws. The bones composing these
                    are not knit together as in Mammals, but are merely connected by ligaments,
                    which can be distended at pleasure. The mouth of the boa can thus be made to
                    open transversely as well as vertically; and in addition to this the two jaws
                    are not connected directly as in other animals, but by the intervention of a
                    distinct bone, which adds greatly to the extent of its gape. It has also the
                    power of moving one half of the jaw independently of the other, and can thus
                    keep a firm hold of its victim while gradually swallowing it. The boa possesses
                    a double row of solid sharp teeth in the upper jaw, and a single row beneath,
                    all pointing inwards, se that, its prey once caught, it would be well-nigh
                    impossible even for the boa itself to release it. After feeding, boas, like all
                    other reptiles, become inactive, and remain so while the process of digestion is
                    going on, which, in the case of a full meal, may extend over a few weeks, and
                    during this period they are readily killed. All the species are ovoviviparous.
                    The Jiboya or <hi rend="italic">Boa constrictor</hi> —the latter name having
                    been loosely given to all the species—is an inhabitant of the dry and sandy
                    districts of tropical America, and rarely exceeds 20 feet in length. Its food
                    consists chiefly of the agoutis, capybaras, and ant-bears, which abound in those
                    districts. It seeks to avoid man, and is not feared by the inhabitants, who kill
                    it readily with a sharp blow from a stick. The Water-Boa or Anaconda <hi
                        rend="italic">(Eunxctens</hi><hi rend="italic">murinus)</hi> is a much more
                    formidable creature, attaining, it is said, a length of 40 feet, and being thus
                    probably the largest of living serpents. It inhabits the lakes, rivers, and
                    marshes of Brazil and Guiana, and passes a considerable portion of its existence
                    in the water. It is exceedingly voracious, feeding on fishes and on such animals
                    as may come to the banks of the stream to drink, for which it lies in wait with
                    only a small part of its head above the surface of the water. It also
                    occasionally visits the farmyards, carrying off poultry and young cattle, and it
                    has been known to attack man.</p>
