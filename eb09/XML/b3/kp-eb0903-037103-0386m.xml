                    the Chhotâ Nâgpur division. In 1872 Bardwân division contained an area of 12,719
                    square miles, with a population of 7,286,957, inhabiting 25,842 towns and

                <p>Bardwân is a flat plain, and its scenery is uninteresting. Chief rivers—the
                    Bhâgirathi, Dâmodar, Ajai, Bânkâ, Kunur, and Khari, of which only the Bhâgirathi
                    is navigable by country cargo boats throughout the year. Agricultural
                    products—paddy, indigo, pulses, oil-seeds, sugar-cane, potatoes, tobacco, wheat,
                    onions, garlic, pumpkins, melons, cucumbers, and vegetables of various kinds.
                    Bardwan district is one of the best cultivated in Lower Bengal. Minerals— iron,
                    copper, lime and sandstone, and above all, coal. The greater portion of the
                    coal-bearing rocks, known as the Dâmodar or Raniganj field, is enclosed between
                    the Rivers Dâmodar and Ajai, and lies between 23° 35' and 23° 45' N. lat., and
                    86° 40' and 87° 15' E. long., at a distance of from about 120 to 160 miles
                    north-west from Calcutta. The beds are composed of coarse and fine sandstones
                    and felspathic coal-seams, the latter being frequently continuous over
                    considerable areas. Those known as the Lower Dâmodars are coarse conglomerates,
                    with white sandstones and numerous coal-seams of very irregular character. The
                    working of the Râniganj coal (which at present, 1874, is included within the
                    Bardwân district) dates from 1774, when a company was formed by several English
                    gentlemen for the purpose of mining the collieries; and in the following year 91
                    tons of Bardwân coal were despatched to Calcutta. In 1860, 49 collieries were
                    worked, chiefly conducted with European capital, and yielded a total out-turn of
                    313,300 tons. In 1868 the out-turn of the whole coal-field exceeded 500,000
                    tons. There are now 44 coal-mines at work within the Bardwân district, of which
                    19 mines turn out more than 10,000 tons of coal apiece per annum. In the larger
                    and better mines coal is raised by steam from pits and galleries. In the smaller
                    mines or workings coal is raised by hand-labour from open quarries. In the
                    Râniganj coal-field 61 steam engines, with an aggregate of 867 horse-power, are
                    at work. Only one seam (or set of seams) of a less thickness than 8⅛ feet is <pb

                    the Raniganj mines is about 15 or 16 feet. The pits are mostly shallow, very few
                    being more than 150 feet deep. The Bengal Coal Company, with its mines at
                    Raniganj and westwards, is alone able to raise more than 200,000 tons of coal
                    annually. Silk and cotton cloth, brass utensils, silver and gold ornaments, and
                    indigo, are the principal manufactures of the district. Three indigo factories
                    in Bardwan are conducted with European capital. Articles of trade consist of
                    rice, tobacco, pulses, wheat, oil-seeds, jute, sugar, salt, English and country
                    made cloths, cotton, molasses, timber, and coal. In 1790 the total revenue of
                    the Bardwan district amounted to £508,093, in 1820 to £453,321, and in 1870
                    (after transfers of a large part of its area to adjoining districts) to
                    £388,773. The expenditure in 1797 amounted to £11,213, in 1820 to £17,338, and
                    in 1870 to £63,435. The land tax is the principal source of revenue, which
                    amounted in 1790 to £503,272, in 1850 (from a reduced area) to £309,618, and in
                    1870 to £305,806. For the protection of person and property Government
                    maintained in 1871 a regular constabulary force 682 strong, at a total cost of
                    £11,622 a year, besides 11,052 men of the village watch possessing service lands
                    or paid by the villagers. Bardwan contained 939 schools in 1871-72, attended by
                    21,926 pupils, and costing £4328 annually to the state. For administrative
                    purposes the district is divided into six magisterial subdivisions—Bardwan,
                    Kalna, Kâtwâ, Bud-bud, Raniganj, and Jahânâbâd, with 22 police circles.
                    Exclusive of the Bardwan city described below, there are seven towns in the
                    district containing a population of more than 5000 souls. They are also
                    municipalities, and are as follows 1. Kâlnâ—population: Hindus, 22,463;
                    Mahometans, 3557; Christians, 38; others, 1278; total, 27,336: municipal income

                    The East Indian Railway and the Grand Trunk road leading to the North-Western
                    Provinces pass through the district, which has also fifteen other roads
                    communicating with the neighbouring districts. The climate of Bardwan was
                    considered a few years back to be the healthiest in Bengal. But an epidemic
                    fever broke out about 1867, and is still (1874) raging in the district. It
                    causes havoc and depopulation among the cultivating classes. The Maharaja of
                    Bardwan, one of the largest landholders in Bengal, has an income estimated at
                    £400,000 to £500,000 sterling a year. Bardwan district was acquired by the East
                    India Company under the treaty with Nawa,b Mir Kasim in 1760, and confirmed by
                    the Emperor Shah Alam in 1765. The land revenue was fixed in perpetuity with the
                    zamindâra in 1793.</p>

                    described Bardwân town “as consisting of an assemblage of crowded suburbs, of
                    wretched huts, with walls of mud, and covered with thatch, having no temples of
                    striking aspect, and few handsome houses.” At the present time Bardwân is a
                    well-built, busy town, with commodious streets, dotted with large tanks, and
                    surrounded by luxuriant gardens. The Mahârâjâ’s palaces are handsome buildings,
                    furnished in the English style, with elegant mirrors and nick-nacks from Paris,
                    and some tolerable oil paintings. Bardwân forms the headquarters of the civil
                    authorities of the division and district, consisting of the commissioner, the
                    judge, magistrate, and collector, and their European and native assistants. In
                    1814 the town contained a population estimated at 53,927 souls; and in 1872,
                    32,321. Details of population in 1872:—Hindus, 22,013; Mahometans, 9927;
                    Christians, 223; persons of unspecified religion, 158; total, 32,321. Municipal
                    income in 1871, £5450; expenditure, £5450; rate of taxation, 3s. 4jd. per head.
                    In 1695 Bardwân was besieged by a rebel chief of the Great Mughul. The city soon
                    fell into the hands of the besiegers, the Râjâ was slain in battle outside the
                    walls, and the ladies of his family committed suicide, to avoid falling into the
                    hands of the conquerors. The present Mahârâjâ is a well-educated, liberal-minded
                    man. He maintains a great public school in the town at his own cost, and is ever
                    forward with help in time of distress or famine, as in 1866 and 1874.</p>
