                    father for state service, but his inclinations were too strong to be restrained,
                    and at the age of eighteen he entered the Society of Jesus. After studying in
                    various colleges for some years, he was appointed by the order to lecture on
                    theology at the famous university of Louvain. His seven years’ residence in the
                    Low Countries brought him into close relations with modes of thought differing
                    essentially from his own, and so compelled him to define his theological
                    principles more clearly and sharply than before. On his return to Italy he
                    received from Gregory XIII. an appointment in the newly-founded <hi
                    rend="italic">Collegium</hi><hi rend="italic">Romanum,</hi> and began to deliver
                    lectures on the principal points of difference between the Roman Catholic and
                    other forms of faith. Out of these lectures grew his famous work, <hi

                    >Controversiis</hi><hi rend="italic">Christianes</hi><hi rend="italic">Fidei
                    adversus hujus temporis</hi><hi rend="italic">Hoereticos</hi> (3 vols., 1581,
                    1582, 1593), for long the finest polemical writing on the Catholic side, and
                    still worthy of consideration. It was replied to at the time by Chemnitz,
                    Gerhard, and Charnier, and continued for many years to furnish occasions of
                    attack to Protestant theologians. So highly were Bellarmine’s abilities rated,
                    that he was selected to accompany, in the capacity of divine or theologian, the
                    legation sent into France in 1590 by Sixtus V. In 1599 he was, much against his
                    will, raised to the dignity of cardinal, and two years later was made archbishop
                    of Capua. He resigned the archbishopric in 1605, being detained in Rome by the
                    desire of the newly-elected Pope Paul V. About the same time he had a con-
                    ∙oversy with James I. of England, who, after the discovery of the Gunpowder
                    Plot, had passed severe laws against Roman Catholics. In 1610 he published his
                    work <hi rend="italic">De</hi><hi rend="italic">Potestate summi
                    Pontificis</hi><hi rend="italic">in rebus Temporcdibus,</hi> directed against
                    William Barclay, in which he asserted boldly and undisguisedly the doctrine of
                    the Pope’s temporal sovereignty. For some years before his death, which occurred
                    at Rome, 17th September 1621, he held the bishopric of his native town.
                    Bellarmine, whose life was a model of Christian asceticism, is one of the
                    greatest theologians, particularly in the department of polemics, that the
                    Romish Church has ever produced. His works, which are very numerous, are written
                    in an easy perspicuous style. The most important are the <hi rend="italic"
