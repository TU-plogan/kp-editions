                <p><label type="entry">BEAR</label>, the common name of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Ursidoe,</hi> a typical family of Plantigrade Mammals, distinguished by their
                    massive bodies, short limbs, and almost rudimentary tails. With the single
                    exception of the Honey Bear, all the species have forty-two teeth, of <hi
                    rend="superscript"> v</hi> which the incisors and canines closely resemble those
                    of the purely carnivorous mammals; while the molars, and especially that known
                    as the “carnassial,” have their surfaces tuberculated so as to adapt them for
                    grinding vegetable substances. As might have been supposed from their dentition,
                    the bears are truly omnivorous; but most of the family seem to prefer vegetable
                    food, including honey, when a sufficient supply of this can be had. The Grizzly
                    Bear, however, is chiefly carnivorous; while the Polar Bear, in a state of
                    nature, is believed to be almost wholly so. The strength and ferocity of
                    different species and of different individuals of the same species seem to
                    depend largely on the nature of their diet,—those restricted to purely vegetable
                    food showing an approach to that mildness of disposition characteristic of
                    herbivorous animals.</p>
                <p>Bears are five-toed, and are provided with formidable claws, but these are not
                    retractile as in the cats, and are thus better fitted for digging and climbing
                    than for tearing. Most of the bears climb trees, which they do in a slow,
                    lumbering fashion, and, in descending, always come hindquarters first. The
                    Grizzly Bear is said to lose this power of climbing in the adult state. In
                    northern countries the bear retires during the winter season into caves and the
                    hollows of trees, or allows the falling snow to cover it, where it remains
                    dormant till the advent of spring, about which time the female usually produces
                    her young. These are born naked and blind, and it is commonly five weeks before
                    they see, or become covered with hair. Before hibernating they grow very fat,
                    and it is by the gradual consumption of this fat—known in commerce as bear’s
                    grease—that such vital action as is necessary to the continuance of life is
                    sustained.</p>
                <p>The bear family is widely distributed, being found in every quarter of the globe
                    except Australia, and in all climates, from the highest northern latitudes yet
                    reached by man to the warm regions of India and Malaya. In the north-west corner
                    of Africa the single representative of the family found on that continent
                    occurs. Of the remaining species described in Gray’s recent monograph of this
                    family, three are European, six American, and eight Asiatic; while one
                    species—the Polar Bear—is common to the Arctic regions of both hemispheres. In
                    addition to these, the best known species are peculiarly rich in varieties.
                    Bears have been recently divided into three groups,—sea bears, land bears, and
                    honey bears.</p>
                <p>(1.) Sea bears, of which the Polar or White Bear <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Thalassarctos</hi><hi rend="italic">maritimus)</hi> is the only species known,
                    are distinguished from the other groups by having the soles of the feet covered
                    with close-set hairs,—a beautiful instance of special adaptation to the wants of
                    the creature, the bear being thereby enabled to walk more securely on the
                    slippery ice. In the whiteness of its fur also, it shows such an assimilation in
                    colour to that of surrounding nature as must be of considerable service in
                    concealing it from its prey. The food of the White Bear consists chiefly of
                    seals and fish, in pursuit of which it shows great power of swimming and diving,
                    and a considerable degree of sagacity. It also feeds on the carcases of whales,
                    and on birds and their eggs, and is said to eat berries when these can be had.
                    That it can sustain life on a purely vegetable diet is proved by instances on
                    record of its being fed for years on bread only, in confinement. These bears are
                    strong swimmers, Captain Sabine having found one “swimming powerfully forty
                    miles from the nearest shore, and with no ice in sight to afford it rest.” They
                    are often carried on floating ice to great distances, and to more southern
                    latitudes than their own, no fewer than twelve Polar bears having been known to
                    reach Iceland in this way during one winter. The female always hibernates, but
                    the male may be seen abroad at all seasons. In bulk the White Bear exceeds all
                    other members of the family, measuring nearly 9 feet in length, and often
                    weighing 1600 lb.</p>
                <p>(2.) Land bears have the soles of the feet destitute of hair, and their fur more
                    or less shaggy. Of these the Brown Bear <hi rend="italic">(Ursus arctos,</hi> —*
                    Αρκτος of Aristotle) is found in one or other of its varieties all over the
                    temperate and north temperate regions of the eastern hemisphere, from Spain to
                    Japan. Its fur is usually of a brownish colour, but there are black,
                    blackish-grey, and yellowish varieties. It is a solitary animal, frequenting the
                    wooded parts of the regions it inhabits, and living on a mixed diet of fruits,
                    vegetables, honey, and the smaller animals. In winter it hibernates, concealing
                    itself in some hollow or cavern. It does not seek to attack man; but when
                    baited, or in defence of its young, it shows great courage and strength, rising
                    on its hind legs and endeavouring to grasp its antagonist in an embrace.
                    Bear-baiting, till within comparatively recent times, was a favourite sport
                    throughout Europe, but along with cockfighting and badger-baiting, has gradually
                    disappeared before a more humane civilization. It was a favourite pastime among
                    the Romans, who imported their bears from Britain, a proof that the animal was
                    then comparatively abundant in that country; indeed, from reference made to it
                    in early Scottish history, the bear does not appear to have been extirpated in
                    Britain before the end of the 11th century. It is now found in greatest
                    abundance in Norway, Russia, and Siberia, where the bear hunt is the favourite
                    sport, and where, when dead, its remains are highly valued. Among the
                    Kamchatkans “the skin of the bear,’’ says a traveller, “forms their beds and
                    their coverlets, bonnets for their heads, gloves for their hands, and collars
                    for their dogs. The flesh and fat are their dainties. Of the intestines they
                    make masks or covers for their faces, to protect them from the glare of the sun
                    in the spring, and use them as a substitute for glass, by extending them over
                    their windows. Even the shoulder-blades are said to be put in requisition for
                    cutting grass.” In confinement the Brown Bear is readily tamed; and advantage
                    has been taken of the facility with which it can sustain itself on the hind feet
                    to teach it to dance to the sound of music. It measures 4 feet in length, and is
                    about 2∣ feet high.</p>
                <p>The American Black Bear <hi rend="italic">(Ursus</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >americanus)</hi> occurs <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0903-0477-0462"/> throughout the wooded parts of the North American
                    continent, whence it is being gradually driven to make room for man. It is
                    similar in size to the Brown Bear, but its fur is of a soft even texture, and of
                    a shining black colour, to which it owes its commercial value. At the beginning
                    of the present century Black Bears were killed in enormous numbers for their
                    furs, which at that time were highly valued. In 1803 the skins imported into
                    England numbered 25,000, but the imports have since decreased to one-half of
                    that number They are chiefly used for military accoutrements. This is a timid
                    animal, feeding almost solely on fruits, and lying dormant during winter, at
                    which period it is most frequently killed. It is an object of superstitious
                    reverence to the Indians, who never kill it without apologizing and deploring
                    the necessity which impels them to do so.</p>
                <p>The Grizzly Bear <hi rend="italic">(Ursus ferox)</hi> approaches the Polar Bear
                    in size, while it exceeds that, and all other American mammals, in ferocity of
                    disposition and in muscular strength. It is said to attack the bison, and has
                    been known to carry off a carcase weighing 1000 lb for a considerable distance
                    to its den, there to devour it at leisure. It also eats fruit and other
                    vegetables. Its fur is usually of a yellowish brown colour, coarse and grizzled,
                    and of little value commercially, while its flesh, unlike that of other bears,
                    is uneatable even by the Indians. It is found in greatest abundance on the
                    eastern slopes of the Rocky Mountains. The Syrian Bear (<hi rend="italic"
                    >Ursus</hi><hi rend="italic">syriacus)</hi> occurs on Mount Lebanon and
                    throughout Syria, and is probably the species mentioned in Scripture as having
                    destroyed the “forty-and-two children” who mocked Elisha. It is of a dirty
                    yellowish colour, and feeds mainly on vegetables. The Bruang or Malayan Bear <hi
                    rend="italic">(Helarctos malayanus)</hi> is of a jet black colour, with a white
                    semilunar mark on the chest, and attains a length of 4⅜ feet. Its food consists
                    almost solely of vegetables and honey, but the latter is its favourite food,—the
                    extreme length and pliability of the tongue enabling it to scoop out the
                    honey-combs from the hollows of trees. It is found in the Malay Peninsula and
                    Islands, and is readily tamed.</p>
                <p>(3.) Honey bears are distinguished from the other groups by the absence of two
                    upper incisors, and the very extensile character of the lips. Of these there is
                    but one species, the Sloth or Honey Bear <hi rend="italic">(Melursus
                    labiatus).</hi> This animal, from its striking outward resemblance to a sloth,
                    was, when first brought to this country, described as a species of <hi
                    rend="italic">Bradypus.</hi> It is about the size of the Brown Bear, is covered
                    with long, black hair, and is of extremely uncouth aspect. It inhabits the
                    mountainous regions of India, is readily tamed, and is the bear usually
                    exhibited by the Hindoo jugglers. It feeds on fruits, honey, and white ants</p>
                <p>Fossil remains of extinct bears first occur in strata of the Pliocene age. Those
                    of the Great Cave Bear(<hi rend="italic">Ursus</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >speloeus),</hi> found abundantly in certain caverns of Central Europe and Asia,
                    show that it must have exceeded in size the Polar Bear of the present day. Its
                    remains are also found in similar situations in Britain associated with those of
                    an allied species (<hi rend="italic">Ursus priscus).</hi></p>
