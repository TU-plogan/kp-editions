                <p><label type="entry">BÂMIÂN</label>, a once renowned city in the territory now
                    subject to the Afghans, in 34° 50' N. lat., 67° 44' E. long. Its remains lie in
                    a valley of the Hazara country, on the chief road from Kâbul towards Turkestân,
                    and immediately at the northern foot of that prolongation of the Indian Caucasus
                    now called Koh-i-Baba (see vol. i. pp. 227, 241). The passes on the Kâbul side
                    are not less than 11,000 and 12,000 feet in absolute height, and those
                    immediately to the north but little inferior. The river draining the valley is
                    one of the chief sources of the Surkhâb or Aksarai, an important tributary of
                    the Upper Oxus <hi rend="italic">(ibid.</hi> p. 241). The prominences of the
                    cliffs which line the valley are crowned by the remains of numerous massive
                    towers, whilst their precipitous faces are for 6 or 7 miles pierced by an
                    infinity of ancient cave-dwellings, some of which are still occupied. The actual
                    site of the old city is marked by mounds and remains of walls, and on an
                    isolated rock in the middle of the valley are considerable ruins of what appears
                    to have been the acropolis, now known to the people as Ghülgûlah. But the most
                    famous remains at Bâmiân are two colossal standing idols, carved in the cliffs
                    on the north side of the valley. Burnes estimates the height of the greater at
                    120 feet, the other at half as much. These images, which have been much injured,
                    apparently by cannon-shot, are cut in niches in the rock, and both images and
                    niches have been coated with stucco. There is an inscription, not yet
                    interpreted or copied, over the greater idol, and on each side of its niche are
                    staircases leading to a chamber near the head, which shows traces of elaborate
                    ornamentation in azure and gilding. The surface of the niches also has been
                    painted with figures. In one of the branch valleys is a similar colossus,
                    somewhat inferior in size to the second of those two; and there are indications
                    of other niches and idols. As seen from the rock of Ghülgûlah, Bâmiân, with its
                    ruined towers, its colossi, its innumerable grottoes, and with the singular red
                    colour of its barren soil, presents an impressive aspect of desolation and
                    mystery.</p>
                <p>That the idols of Bâmiân, about which so many conjectures have been uttered, were
                    Buddhist figures, is ascertained from the narrative of the Chinese pilgrim, Hwen
                    Thsang, who saw them in their splendour in 630 <hi rend="smallcaps">a.d.</hi>
                    His description of the position of the city and images corresponds accurately
                    with modern reports. He assigns to the greater image, which was gilt (the
                    object, probably, of the plaster coating), a height of 140 or 150 feet, and to
                    the second 100. The latter would seem from his account to have been sheathed
                    with copper. Still vaster than these was a recumbent figure, 2 miles east of
                    Bâmiân, representing Sakya Buddha entering <hi rend="italic">Nin·dna, i.e.,</hi>
                    in act of death. This was “about 1000 feet in length.” No traces of this are
                    alluded to by modem travellers, but in all likelihood it was only formed of
                    rubble plastered (as is the case still with such <hi rend="italic">NirυAna</hi>
                    figures in Indo-China), and of no durability. For a city so notable Bâmiân has a
                    very obscure history. It does not seem possible to identify it with any city in
                    classical geography: <hi rend="italic">Alexandria ad</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Caucasum</hi> it certainly was not. The first known mention of it seems to be
                    that by Hwen Thsang, at a time when apparently it had already passed its
                    meridian, and was the head of one of the small states into which the empire of
                    the White Huns had broken up. At a later period Bâmiân was for half a century,
                    ending 1214 A.p., the seat of a branch of the Ghori dynasty, ruling over
                    Tokhâristân, or the basin of the Upper Oxus. The place was long besieged, and
                    finally annihilated (1222) by Chinghiz Khan, whose wrath was exasperated at the
                    death of a favourite grandson by an arrow from its walls. There appears to be no
                    further record of Bâmiân as a city; but the character of ruins at Ghιilgulah
                    agrees with traditions on the spot in indicating that the city must have been
                    rebuilt after the time of the Mongols, and again perished. In 1840, during the
                    British occupation of Kâbul, Bâmiân was the scene of an action in which Colonel
                    Denny with a small force routed Dost Mahommed Khan, accompanied by a number of
                    Uzbeg chiefs. (Burnes, <hi rend="italic">Journey to Bokhara;</hi> Masson’s <hi
