                <p><label type="entry">BACTRIA, or <hi rend="smallcaps">Bactriana</hi></label>, an
                    ancient country of Central Asia, lying to the south of the River Oxus, and
                    reaching to the western part of the Paropamisan range, or Hindu Kush. It was
                    sometimes regarded as including the district of Margiana, or Merv, which was
                    more frequently considered as distinct. The character of the country is very
                    various, and has been well described by Curtius, whose account is confirmed by
                    the few modern travellers who have passed through it. Some portions are
                    remarkable for the beauty of their scenery, or the fertility of the soil,
                    evidenced by a rich and varied vegetation, while other parts are stretches of
                    barren and drifting sands. In early history Bactria is connected with some of
                    the most important movements of the Indo-European races, and has no small claims
                    to be regarded as the cradle of our present civilisation. According to Persian
                    tradition, it became the seat of the Iranian wanderers, who established the
                    religion of Zoroaster, and expelled the Vedic inhabitants of the country. In the
                    7th century <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> it passed under the dominion of the
                    Medes, and not long after formed part of the conquests of Cyrus. In the reign of
                    Darius it ranked as the twelfth satrapy of the empire, and furnished valuable
                    contingents to the imperial army; these are described at a later date by
                    Herodotus as wearing the Median head-dress, and making use of their native bows
                    and short spears. Like the rest of Western Asia, Bactria was subjugated by
                    Alexander, and formed part of the empire of the Seleucids; but in the 3d century
                        <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> it was raised to the rank of an independent
                    kingdom by the successful revolt of Diodotus, the Greek satrap. There thus arose
                    a remarkable dynasty—if dynasty it can be called—of Graeco-Bactrian kings, who
                    have been the object of much modern investigation, but are not as yet arranged
                    in any satisfactory order. The names of seven or eight of them are known from
                    the Greek and Roman historians, and upwards of forty are preserved on their
                    coins. The great problem to be solved by numismatists is how to dispose of so
                    many claimants in the comparatively narrow space of time at their disposal. It
                    is highly probable that many of them held contemporaneous sway in different
                    parts of the Bactrian region, sometimes with a distinct preponderance on the
                    part of one, and sometimes with practical equilibrium of power; but their
                    geographical distribution can only be conjectured from what are understood to be
                    mint-marks on their coins. The period of the final disintegration of the
                    Graeco-Bactrian power is not definitely ascertained; but as early as the time of
                    Eucratides (160 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.)</hi> there appears on the coinage the
                    so-called Bactrian Pali, a language cognate with Sanskrit but written in
                    characters of seemingly Phoenician origin. Besides these monetary legends,
                    several Bactrian inscriptions have been recently discovered, among the most,
                    important of which are the “Taxila” copperplate, which has furnished the key to
                    the Bactrian numeral system, the Peshawur vase, the Manikyala cylinder, the
                    Bimaran vase, and the Wardak urn, but none of them are of very much historical
                    value. Bactria seems to have passed successively under the power of various Saca
                    and Parthian and so-called Indo-Scythian rulers, and during the first six or
                    seven centuries of the Christian era it became one of the most important centres
                    of Buddhistic monasticism. (See <hi rend="smallcaps">Balkh.)</hi> Its modern
                    history is of but little importance, as it has never formed an independent
                    kingdom of any power or stability.</p>
