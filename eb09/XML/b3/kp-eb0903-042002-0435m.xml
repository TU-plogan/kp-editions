                    little is known of his life. He is said to have been born in Syria and to have
                    studied at Alexandria, and this is probably correct. There is, to some extent, a
                    corresponding uncertainty with regard to the precise doctrines held by him. Of
                    these there are two distinct expositions, the one given chiefly by Irenaeus,
                    which has been long before the world, the other contained in the <hi
                    rend="italic">Philosophoumena</hi> of Hippolytus, discovered in 1842. According
                    to Irenseus, the system of Basilides strongly resembled that of Valentinus. The
                    first principle or root of all things, was the supreme God, the unknown and
                    unborn Father. From Him emanated in succession <hi rend="italic">vovς,</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">λόγος, φρόνησις, σοφία,</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >δύναμης.</hi><hi rend="italic subscript">:</hi> From the last, according to
                    Irenaeus, sprang the powers who created the first heaven; according to Clemens
                    Alex., however, from <hi rend="italic">δύναμις</hi> sprang <hi rend="italic"
                    >δικαιοσύνη</hi> and <hi rend="italic">ειρήνη,</hi> and these seven with the
                    Father formed the first Ogdoad, or octave of existence. From them emanated other
                    powers, by whom the second heaven was made, and so on in succession, each system
                    being a more shadowy type or reflex of the original ogdoad. The number of
                    heavens was 365, whence the whole series was called. Abraxas, or Abrasax, a name
                    frequently applied to the lower deity, or even, as by Tertullian, to the supreme
                    God. The powers of the lowest heaven, of whom the chief was called the <hi
                    rend="italic">apχωv,</hi> created the earth. This <hi rend="italic">apχωv</hi>
                    is the God of the Jews, and against Him the other powers were arrayed. To
                    alleviate the misfortunes of the earth, the vois, or first emanation, became
                    incarnate and descended upon earth. The <hi rend="italic">vovς</hi> as
                    incorporeal could not suffer death; accordingly, he changed forms with Simon of
                    Cyrene, and stood by the cross, laughing at his enemies, while Simon suffered in
                    his place. Salvation is spiritual, pertains only to the soul; outer actions are
                    not in themselves good or bad. That Basilides taught this doctrine of moral
                    indifference is not perfectly clear, but ïrenaeus reports that his disciples
                    acted up to it.</p>
                <p>The exposition given by Hippolytus is widely different. According to the account
                    he gives, Basilides started neither with a dualism of God and matter or evil,
                    nor with a theory of emanation. His first principle was God, the unknown,
                    incomprehensible, unspeakable, non-existent one, of whom nothing can be
                    predicated, for no words are adequate to express His essence. This non-existent
                    God, by the exercise of what may be called volition, created the <hi
                    rend="italic">πανσπερμία,</hi> or seed, which contained in itself the germs of
                    all things. In this chaotic mass, which strongly resembles the <hi rend="italic"
                    >ομοιομερή</hi> of Anaxagoras, there is a mixture of elements,— <hi
                    rend="italic">σύγχισις αρχική,</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi> and at the same time
                    are embedded in it three degrees or kinds of divine sonship, consubstantial with
                    the Deity. The first kind is refined and pure, the second gross, the third
                    requiring purification. As all things naturally tend towards God, the first
                    sonship ascended and sat beside the Father. The second also strove to ascend by
                    means of the Spirit, which is to him as a wing, but he could not rise quite to
                    the Deity, and occupied an inferior position, while the wing or spirit formed
                    the firmament. The third sonship still remained immersed in matter. Then from
                    the world seed there burst forth the great <hi rend="italic">apχωv,</hi> or
                    ruler, who ascended as far as the firmament, and, imagining that there was
                    nothing beyond, glorified himself as the brightest and strongest of all beings.
                    This ruler, who is sometimes called Abraxas, but whose true name is ineffable,
                    produced a son wiser and better than himself, by whose aid he laid the
                    foundations of the world. The seat of their rule is called the Ogdoad, and it
                    extends through all the ethereal region down to the moon’s sphere, <pb
                    break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit03newyrich/page/n436/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0903-0436-0421"/> where the grosser air begins. This lower dominion
                    is ruled by a second and inferior <hi rend="italic">aρχωv,</hi> the God of the
                    Jews, who also had produced a son; and their seat is called the Hebdomad.
                    Meanwhile, the third sonship, which is truly the spiritual element in the elect,
                    is tied to matter, and is in need of deliverance. Freedom is given by the truth,
                    <hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> by a knowledge of the true system of things, and it
                    is given by a series of illuminations. First the mind of the son of the Great
                    Archon is enlightened, and he instructs his father, who learns with fear and
                    repentance that there is a sphere of being higher than his own. The light then
                    passes to the son of the Archon of the Hebdomad, who likewise instructs his
                    father. Finally, the mind of Jesus is illuminated, and he instructs those of
                    mankind who are able to receive the truth. There are thus three great stages in
                    the world’s religious history, each being an advance on its predecessor. These
                    periods are the Ante-Jewish, the Jewish, and the Christian. All the souls
                    capable of receiving the light ascend upwards, while their bodies return to the
                    primeval chaos; the minds of all others are shrouded in eternal night, the
                    darkness of ignorance. For the relation of Basilides to other Gnostics, and for
                    the interpretation of his intensely symbolic expressions, see <hi

                <p>The earlier accounts of Basilides, such as those of Neander, Baur (in the <hi
                    rend="italic">Christliche</hi><hi rend="italic">Gnosis'),</hi> and Matter, were
                    based for the most part on Irenaeus. The discovery of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Philosophoumena</hi> threw unexpected light on the subject, and the later
                    expositions generally follow Hippolytus as the exponent of the original system
                    of Basilides. Hilgenfeld still retains the older view. Full information is to be
                    found in Baur, <hi rend="italic">Kirchengeschichte,</hi> i.; L·ipsius, <hi
