                <p><label type="entry">BABRIUS, or <hi rend="smallcaps">Babrias,</hi> or <hi
                            rend="smallcaps">Gabrias</hi></label> (the original name being possibly
                    Oriental), a Greek fabulist, who wrote, according to Sir G. C. Lewis, shortly
                    before the Augustan age, though dates have been assigned to him from 250 B.c. to
                    250 A.D. One of his editors, Boissonade, believes that he was a Roman. His name
                    occurs in some of the old grammarians, and a few fragments were ascribed to him.
                    The first critic who made him more than a mere name, was Bentley in his <hi
                        rend="italic">Dissertation on the Fables of</hi><hi rend="italic"
                        >Aesop.</hi> In a careful examination of these prose Aesopian fables, which
                    had been handed down in various collections from the time of Maximus Planudes,
                    Bentley discovered traces of versification, and was able to extract a number of
                    verses which he assigned to Babrius. Tyrwhitt followed up the researches of
                    Bentley, and for some time the efforts of scholars were directed toλvards
                    reconstructing the metrical original of the prose fables. In 1842, however, Μ.
                    Mynas, a Greek, the discoverer of the <hi rend="italic">Philosophoumena</hi> of
                    Hippolytus, came upon a MS. of Babrius in the convent of St Laura on Mount
                    Athos. This MS. contained 123 fables out of the supposed original number, 160.
                    The fables are written in choliambic, <hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> limping or
                    imperfect iambic verse, having a spondee as the last foot, a metre originally
                    appropriated to satire. The style is extremely good, the expression being terse,
                    pointed, and elegant, and the construction of the stories is fully equal to that
                    in the prose versions. The MS. was first published by Boissonade in 1844;
                    afterwards by Lachmann, 1845; by Orelli and Baiter, 1845; by Sir George
                    Cornewall Lewis, 1846; and by Schneidewin, 1853. The genuineness of this
                    collection of the fables was generally admitted by scholars. In 1857 Mynas
                    professed to have discovered at Mount Athos another part containing 94 fables
                    and a prooemium. According to his statement, the monks, who had been willing to
                    sell the MS. containing the first part for a sufficient price, refused
                    altogether to part with the second. He therefore made a copy which was sold to
                    the British Museum, and was published in 1859 by Sir G. C. Lewis. But these
                    fables only purport to be Babrius spoiled,, after having passed through the
                    hands of a “diasceuast,” ' that is, some late writer who has turned his verses
                    into barbarous Greek and wretched metre. In a Latin dissertation, published in
                    1861, Professor Conington carefully examined this part, arriving at the
                    conclusion that the fables were metrical versions of the prose stories, executed
                    by some forger who must have been acquainted with Lachmann’s conjectures on
                    fragments formerly known. Cobet expresses a similar opinion, but in stronger
                    terms. It is not impossible that the forger was Mynas himself. Sir G. C. Lewis,
                    however, holds that the similarity between the fables and these existing prose
                    versions appears such as might have been produced not by a forger copying from a
                    prose writer, but rather by two grammarians recasting the same work of Babrius.
                    The standard edition of Babrius is that of Sir. G. C. Lewis; there is a faithful
                    translation in verse by Davies. For Conington’s dissertation see hw <hi
