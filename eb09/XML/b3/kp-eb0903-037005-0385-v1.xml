                    a celebrated Gnostic, was a native of Edessa in Mesopotamia, and appears tc have
                    flourished during the reign of Marcus Aurelius. Very little is known of his
                    life. He is said to have held a disputation with Apollonius, a philosopher in
                    the train of Lucius Verus, and he is known to have written against the
                    Marcionite and other heresies. There is considerable doubt whether he was ever a
                    disciple of Valentinus, but it is acknowledged that he never ceased to belong to
                    the Christian church. However seriously his principles, if rigidly interpreted,
                    might conflict with the doctrines of Christianity, he did not regard himself as
                    opposed to that-faith, and he was generally considered one of its best
                    defenders. He was especially famed for his hymns, fragments of which are still
                    extant. Of his other works <pb break="no"

                        xml:id="kp-eb0903-0386-0371"/> there seems to remain only a treatise <hi
                        rend="italic">On Fate,</hi> a portion of which was preserved by Eusebius <hi
                        rend="italic">{Prep. Evan.,</hi> vi. 10), while the whole has been printed
                    from a Syriac MS. with English translation by Cureton <hi rend="italic"
                        >{Spicilegium, Syriacum,</hi> Lond. 1855). The system of Bardesanes, so far
                    as it can be gathered from the scanty notices of other writers, had many points
                    in common with that of Valentinus, but show’s to an almost greater extent the
                    influence of Oriental mysticism and imagery. He begins, as do all the other
                    Gnostics, with postulating the existence of the Unknown God or Father, the
                    ground of all the forms of being. Alongside of God, and co-existing with Him,—in
                    fact, His necessary shadow,—is vague, unformed, eternal, and uncreated Matter.
                    From this dualism springs the possibility of evil in the universe. Evil is not,
                    indeed, correlative and equally necessary with God, but arises from matter. The
                    Eternal Father, through union with His everlastingly produced, but shadowy
                    companion, brings forth the Son, from whose union with the Holy Spirit <hi
                        rend="italic">{Sophia)</hi> spring the elements. The combinations of the
                    productive and receptive agents are called <hi rend="italic">syzygies,</hi> and
                    of them there are seven. Bardesanes, who had deeply studied the Chaldean
                    astrology, seems to have discussed at great length the influence of the stars on
                    human action. He vindicated for man, what may, with some stretch of language, be
                    termed a <hi rend="italic">transcendental</hi> freedom. His followers were
                    distinguished by the strange opinion they entertained with regard to the body of
                    Christ, which they held to be only phenomenal, not real. Besides the notices of
                    Bardesanes to be found in general works on Gnosticism,—as those of Baur, Matter,
                    Lipsius, and Mansei,—the following may be consulted :—Hahn, <hi rend="italic"
