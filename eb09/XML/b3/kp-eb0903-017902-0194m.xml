                    Samarcand. Omar died in 1495, and Baber, though only twelve years of age,
                    succeeded to the throne. An attempt made by his uncles to dislodge him proved
                    unsuccessful, and no sooner was the young sovereign firmly settled than he began
                    to meditate an extension of his own dominions. In 1497 he attacked and gained
                    possession of Samarcand, to which he always seems to have thought he had a
                    natural and hereditary right. A rebellion among his nobles robbed him of his
                    native kingdom, and while marching to recover it, his troops deserted him, and
                    he lost Samarcand also. After some reverses he regained both these places, but
                    in 1501 his most formidable enemy, Schaibani Khan, ruler of the Usbeks, defeated
                    him in a great engagement, and drove him from Samarcand. For three years he
                    wandered about trying in vain to recover his lost possessions; at last, in 1504,
                    he gathered some troops, and crossing the snowy Hundu Kush, besieged and
                    captured the strong city <hi rend="italic">of</hi> Cabul. By this dexterous
                    stroke he gained a new and wealthy kingdom, and completely re-established his
                    fortunes. In the following year lie united with Hussain Mirza of Herat against
                    Schaibani. The death of Hussain, put a stop to this expedition, but Baber spent
                    a year at Herat, enjoying the pleasures of that capital. He returned to Cabul in
                    time to quell a formidable rebellion, but two years later a revolt among some of
                    the leading Moghuls drove him from his city. He was compelled to take to flight,
                    with very few companions, but his great personal courage and daring struck the
                    army of his opponents with such dismay that they again returned to their
                    allegiance, and Baber regained his kingdom. Once again, in 1510, after the death
                    of Schaibani, he endeavoured to obtain possession of his native country. He
                    received considerable aid from Shah Ismael of Persia, and in 1511 made a
                    triumphal entry into Samarcand. But in 1514 he was utterly defeated by the
                    Usbeks, and with difficulty reached Cabul. He seems now to have resigned all
                    hopes of recovering Farghana, and as he at the same time dreaded an invasion of
                    the Usbeks from the west, his attention was more and more drawn towards India.
                    Several preliminary incursions had been already made, when in 1521 an
                    opportunity presented itself for a more extended expedition. Ibrahim, emperor of
                    Delhi, had made himself detested, even by his Afghan nobles, several of whom
                    called upon Baber for assistance. He at once assembled his forces, 12,000
                    strong, with some pieces of artillery, and marched into India. Ibrahim, with
                    100,000 soldiers and numerous elephants,, advanced against him. The great battle
                    was fought at Paniput, 21st April 1526, when Ibrahim was slain and his army
                    routed. Baber at once took possession of Agra. A still more formidable enemy
                    awaited him; the Rana Sanga of Mewar collected the enormousforce of 210,000men,
                    with which he moved against the invaders. On all sides there was danger and
                    revolt, even Baber’s own soldiers, worn out with the heat of this new climate,
                    longed for CabuL By vigorous measures and inspiriting speeches he restored their
                    courage, though his own heart was nearly failing him, and in Ins distress he
                    abjured the use of wine, to which he had been addicted. At Kanweh, on the 10tli
                    March 1527, he won a great victory, and made himself absolute master of India.
                    The remaining years of his life he spent in arranging the affairs and revenues
                    of his new empire and in improving his capital, Agra. He died 26th December
                    1530, in his forty-eighth year. Baber was above the middle height, of great
                    strength, and an admirable archer and swordsman. His mind was as well cultivated
                    as his bodily powers; he wrote well, and his observations are generally acute
                    and accurate; he was brave, kindly, and generous. Full materials for his life
                    are found in his <hi rend="italic">Memoirs,</hi> written by himself (translated
                    into English by Leyden and Erskine, London, 1826; abridged in Caldecott, <hi
