                    Utrecht; and, after returning to England, studied law in the Inner Temple. In
                    1701 he published several pamphlets in favour of the civil rights of Protestant
                    dissenters, to which class he belonged. On the recommendation of Lord Somers, he
                    was employed to induce the Presbyterians in Scotland to favour the union of the
                    two kingdoms, and in 1708 he was rewarded for this service by being appointed to
                    the office of commissioner of the customs. From this, however, he was removed on
                    the change of administration in 1711; but his fortune had, in the meantime, been
                    improved by the bequest of two considerable estates,—one of them left him by
                    Francis Barrington of Tofts, whose name he assumed by Act of Parliament, the
                    other by John Wildman of Becket. Barrington now stood at the head of the
                    dissenters. On the accession of George I. he was returned member of parliament
                    for Berwick-upon-Tweed; and in 1720 the king raised him to the Irish peerage, by
                    the title of Viscount Barrington of Ardglass. But having unfortunately engaged
                    in the Harburg lottery, one of the bubble speculatione of the time, he incurred
                    the disgrace of expulsion from the House of Commons in 1723,—a punishment which
                    was considered greatly too severe, and was thought to be due to personal malice
                    on the part of Walpole. In 1725 he published his principal work, entitled <hi

                    History of the Apostles as is contained in Scripture, in an Abstract of their

                    was tho author of various other tracts, chiefly on subjects relating to

                    was secretary at war, from 1761 to 1762 chancellor of the exchequer,from 1762 to
                    1765 treasurer of the navy, and from 1765 to 1778 secretary at war again. He
                    resigned in that year, receiving a handsome pension. In 1782 he held office for

                    the third son, born in 1727, was a distingished antiquary and naturalist. Ho was
                    educated for the profession of the law, and after filling various posts, was
                    appointed a Welsh judge in 1757, and afterwards second justice of Chester. He
                    never rose to much eminence at the bar, but he showed his knowledge of the law
                    as a subject of liberal study by a valuable publication, entitled <hi

                    among historians and constitutional antiquaries. In 1773 he published an edition
                    of Orosius, with Alfred’s Saxon version, and an English translation with
                    original notes. His <hi rend="italic">Tracts on the Probability of reaching the

                    of discovery undertaken by Captain Phipps, afterwards Lord Mulgrave. In them he
                    has accumulated a variety of evidence favourable to his own opinion of the
                    practicability of attaining the object in w hich that voyage had failed; and it
                    is not improbable that his views and arguments had some effect in determining
                    the Government at a later period to renew the attempt. Mr Barrington’s other
                    writings are chiefly to be found in the publications of the Royal and
                    Antiquarian Societies, of both of which he was long an assiduous member, and of
                    the latter vice-president. Many of these were collected by him in a quarto
                    volume entitled <hi rend="italic">Miscellanies on various Subjects*</hi> 1781.

                    his way to a post-captaincy. He was distinguished for his bravery and skill, and
                    in 1778 attained the rank of rear-admiral. He held command for some time in the
                    West Indies, and repulsed a superior French force at Sta Lucia.</p>

                    to Salisbury, and in 1791 to Durham. He published several volumes of sermons and
