                    antiquary, descended from an ancient family distinguished by its loyalty, was
                    born at Crook in 1656. He was educated at the free school at Durham, and
                    proceeded thence, in 1674, to St John’s College, Cambridge, where he afterwards

                    refusing to read James II.’s Declaration of Indulgence. The bishop who disgraced
                    him for this refusal, and who was afterwards specially excepted from William’s
                    Act of Indemnity, took the oaths to that king, and kept his bishopric till his
                    death. Baker, on the other hand, though he had opposed James, refused to take
                    the oaths to William; he resigned Long-Newton on the 1st of August 1690f&gt;and
                    retired to St John’s, in which he was protected till the 20th of January
                    1716-17, when he and one-and-twenty others were deprived of their fellowships.
                    After the passing of the Registering Act in 1723, he could not be prevailed on
                    to comply with its requirements by registering his annuity of £40, although that
                    annuity, left him by his father, with £20 per annum from his elder brother’s
                    collieries, was now his whole subsistence. He retained a lively sense of the
                    injuries he had suffered; and inscribed himself in all his own books, as well as
                    in those which he gave to the college library, <hi rend="italic">socius</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">ejectus,</hi> and in some <hi rend="italic">rector</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">ejectus.</hi> He continued to reside in the college as
                    commoner-master till his death on the 2d of July 1740. The whole of his valuable
                    books and manuscripts he bequeathed to the university. The only works he
                    published were, <hi rend="italic">Reflections on Learning, showing the Insufli
                    ciency thereof in its several particulars, in order to evince the usef ulness

                    without his name. His valuable manuscript collections relative to the history
                    and antiquities of the university of Cambridge, amounting to thirty-nine volumes
                    in folio and three in quarto, are divided between the British Museum and the
                    public library at Cambridge,—the former possessing twenty-three volumes, the
                    latter sixteen in folio and three in quarto. The life of Baker has been written
                    by Robert Masters, 8vo, 1784, and by Horace Walpole, in the quarto edition of
                    his works.</p>
