                <p><label type="entry">BARONET</label>, a name originally given to the <hi
                    rend="italic">lesser barons</hi> mentioned in the preceding article, but now
                    confined to the lowest grade of our hereditary nobility. The order was
                    instituted by King James I. in 1611, at the suggestion of Sir Robert Cotton, to
                    whom the plan had been submitted by Sir Thomas Sherley of VViston, its actual
                    inventor. Originally, the creation of this order w as merely an expedient to
                    raise money, and the cost of a baronetcy in each case amounted to £1095,
                    exclusive of the fees. The money thus raised was professedly destined for the
                    defence and maintenance of the new plantation in the province of Ulster, but it
                    actually passed at once into the king’s exhausted exchequer. According to the
                    instructions given to the commissioners appointed for admitting to the new
                    dignity, none were eligible but “men of quality, state of living, and good
                    reputation, worthy of the same, and, at the least, descended of a grandfather
                    (by the father’s side) that bore arms, and who have also of certain yearly
                    revenue ”—£1000 per annum. The number created at first was 200, and the king
                    engaged for himself, his heirs, and successors, that this should not be
                    exceeded; and for himself also promised that no vacancies in the original number
                    should be filled up. Charles I. disregarded the stipulated limitation, and the
                    original terms have never since been carried out. The first twenty patents
                    issued <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit03newyrich/page/n404/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0903-0404-0389"/> were dated 22d May 1G11, and begin with that
                    given to Sir Nicholas Bacon (son of the lord keeper) whose descendant still
                    retains the position of premier baronet of England.</p>
                <p>Baronets take precedence according to the dates of their patents, conformably to
                    the terms of which no intermediate honour between baron and baronets can be
                    established, and they rank above all knights except those of the Garter. The
                    title or prefix of *S⅛r is granted them by a peculiar clause in their patents,
                    and until 1827 they could claim for themselves and the heirs male of their
                    bodies the honour of knighthood. All baronets are entitled to bear in their
                    coats-of-arms, either in a canton or an escutcheon at their choice, the arms of
                    Ulster, viz., a bloody hand.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Baronets of Scotland,</hi> called also <hi rend="italic"
                    >Baronets of Nova Scotia.</hi> —This order of knights-baronets was instituted by
                    Charles I. in the year 1625, when the first person dignified with the title was
                    Sir Robert Gordon of Gordonstone, a younger son of the earl of Sutherland. The
                    professed object of the institution was to encourage the plantation and
                    settlement of Nova Scotia in North America; hence the king granted to each of
                    them a certain portion of land in that province, which they were to hold of Sir
                    William Alexander, afterwards earl of Stirling, with precedency to them and
                    their heirs-male for ever, before all knights called <hi rend="italic">equites
                    aurati,</hi> all lesser barons called <hi rend="italic">lairds,</hi> and all
                    other gentlemen, except Sir William Alexander, his Majesty’s lieutenant in Nova
                    Scotia, his heirs, their wives and children. It was further provided that the
                    title of &gt;Szr should be prefixed to their Christian name, and <hi
                    rend="italic">Baronet</hi> added to their surname , and that their own and their
                    eldest sons’ wives should enjoy the title of <hi rend="italic">Lady, Madam,</hi>
                    or <hi rend="italic">Dame.</hi> The baronets of Scotland had assigned to them as
                    an addition to their armorial bearings the ensign of Nova Scotia, viz., argent,
                    a cross of St Andrew, azure, to be borne in a canton or in escutcheon; but in
                    1629, after Nova Scotia was sold to the French, this privilege was changed into
                    permission to wear a badge about their necks pendent from an orange-tawny silk
                    ribbon.</p>
                <p>Malone has given the following curious note upon this subject, in his learned <hi
                    rend="italic">Life of Dryden,</hi> prefixed to his edition of the prose works of
                    that writer :—</p>
                <p>“When the order of baronets was first established in 1611, King James engaged
                    that they should not exceed two hundred. However, towards the close of his
                    reign, that number being completed, and the creation of baronets being found a
                    useful engine of Government (the courtier by whose influence the title was
                    obtained receiving usually £1000 for the grant), it was not lightly to be parted
                    with. A scheme, therefore, of creating <hi rend="italic">Baronets of
                    Scotland</hi> was devised, which, it was conceived, would be no infraction of
                    the original compact to confine the grants to a limited number; and as the
                    English baronets were created under the great seal of England, for the reduction
                    of Ulster in Ireland, so the Scottish baronets were created under the great seal
                    of Scotland, for the reduction of Acadia, or <hi rend="italic">Bova Scotia.</hi>
                    The scheme, however, was not carried into execution by King James; but early in
                    the reign of his successor several Scottish baronets were made. From this
                    statement it appears that there is no more necessity for calling a baronet
                    created under the great seal of Scotland (whether he be an Englishman or
                    Scotchman), a <hi rend="italic">Baronet of Nova Scotia,</hi> than there is to
                    denominate one created under the great seal of England a <hi rend="italic"
                    >Baronet of Ulster.”—</hi> (Malone’s <hi rend="italic">Dryden,</hi> vol. i. pp.
                    28, 29.)</p>
                <p>After the Union with England in 1707 the baronets of Scotland charged their arms
                    with the Ulster badge, being created as baronets of the United Kingdom.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Baronets of Ireland.—</hi> This order was likewise instituted
                    by King James I. in the 18th year of his reign, for the same purpose and with
                    the same privileges within the kingdom of Ireland as had been conferred on the
                    analogous order in England; for which also the Irish baronets paid the same fees
                    into the treasury of Ireland. (c. J. <hi rend="smallcaps">r.)</hi></p>
