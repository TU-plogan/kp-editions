                <p><label type="entry">BESSARABIA</label>, a government in the S.W. of European
                    Russia, on the borders of Austria and the Danubian principalities, with an area,
                    since the cessions of the Paris peace in 1856, of 14,577 English square miles.
                    Till the last Eastern war Bessarabia occupied the whole space between the
                    Dniester and the Pruth from the Austrian frontier to the Black Sea. The northern
                    portion of Bessarabia is mountainous, the southern flat and low,—the limit
                    between the two being marked by the so-called upper Trajan wall, an artificial
                    elevation executed, according to some, in the end of the 2d century <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">ad.,</hi> under Trajan, but, according to others, in the 3d
                    century, under Probus. This wall extends from the.confluence of the Botna with
                    the Dniester to the Pruth. In northern or mountainous Bessarabia two systems of
                    elevations may be distinguished. The first is an immediate offshoot of the
                    Carpathians, and occupies the whole of Khoteen, or the north-western district of
                    the government. It rises about 450 feet above the valley of the Dniester, and
                    consists of strata of Palaeozoic formation, sandstones, schists, and limestones.
                    The second system is especially extended in the very middle of Bessarabia, and
                    may be called the Yassa-Orgievian range. It consists of limestone of secondary
                    formation, and its highest point is Mount Megura, about 20 miles S. of Bielitz,
                    between Bakhmut and Poltava. The low portion of Bessarabia stretches south from
                    the Trajan wall, with a length of 133 miles and a breadth of 33, and is well
                    known as the Budjak steppes. The surface is perfectly level; and the soil,
                    except in the region along the shore, consists of a thick bed of loam. The
                    province is washed on its eastern parts by the Black Sea only for the distance
                    of 20 miles to the south of the estuary of the Dniester. Its only seaport is
                    that of Akerman, situated on the estuary of the Dniester. This river divides
                    Bessarabia from Kherson and Podolia for a distance of almost 600 miles. The
                    shores of the Dniester are in general high and steep, and numerous bare obstruct
                    its channel, particularly at Yampol and Bakat. On the Bessarabian bank are
                    situated the towns Khoteen, Cosoka, and Bender; and thirteen natural harbours
                    for ships are counted along this side of the river. Among the principal
                    tributaries are the Reuth, the Ikel, the Buik, and Botna. Another important
                    stream is the Pruth, of which the left shore skirts the province for a distance
                    of more than 140 miles. The navigation on the Pruth is not important; its course
                    13 impeded by bars and falls. The only important lakes in the government lie
                    along the coast of the Black Sea in the Akerman district. Marshes extend along
                    the Reuth and its tributaries, and there are also some along the Botna; they
                    offer no great obstacles, however, to free communication. Bessarabia up to 1856
                    possessed great quantities of sedimental salt; but after the cessions of the
                    Black Sea coast and the salt lakes, the quantity obtained, which formerly
                    exceeded 60,000 tons, almost came to nothing. The climate of Bessarabia is
                    temperate. The medium annual temperature of Keesheneff, 230 feet above the
                    sea-level, is 50° Fahr.; the temperature of the warmest month, about 73°; of the
                    coldest, about 20°. In the valley of the Dniester the climate is in general much
                    healthier than in that of the Pruth; the climate of the north-west is much
                    colder, and spring commences there ten days later.</p>
                <p>In all the upper part there are forests, consisting principally of beech, oak,
                    and sorb, besides small quantities of birch. The chief forest region lies along
                    the heights of the Orgieff and Yassa districts about the Megura Mountains, and
                    extends thence east to the Dniester and south-west tσ Keesheneff. The Khoteen
                    hills are almost all covered with timber. The three northern districts, Khoteen,
                    Bielitz, and Soroka, are especially suited for agriculture, and may be regarded
                    as the granary of Bessarabia. The two intermediate districts of Orgieff and
                    Keesheneff, though possessing a sufficiently fertile soil, are pre-eminently
                    woodland; while the two southern, Bender and Akerman, although also fertile,
                    have a steppe-like character, and are better adapted to the rearing of
                    cattle.</p>
                <p>Bessarabia, in keeping with its position near the Danube, played an important
                    historic part in ancient times, especially in the beginning of our era, when it
                    served as a key to the eastern approaches of the Byzantine empire. And thus,
                    from immemorial times, nations were ceaselessly alternating with nations within
                    its borders. The original inhabitants were the Cymri, succeeded by the
                    Scythians. Herodotus, who had been in the Greek colonies of the Black Sea,
                    relates that near the mouth of the Dniester (Tyras) there lived the Tyritians,
                    possessing on the estuary of that river the town of Tyras (Oxeia or, according
                    to Pliny, Ophiusa). In the 2d century after Christ Bessarabia was occupied by
                    the Geti and offshoots from the Bastroni, and in 106 <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >a.d.,</hi> the Geti were conquered by Trajan. After this subjugation of the
                    land by the Romans, the present Bessarabia went along with Walachia, Moldavia,
                    and Transylvania, to compose Dacia. In the 3d century appeared the Goths,
                    recently converted to Christianity. In the 5th century Bessarabia was overrun by
                    the Huns; after the Huns, in the end of the 5th century, arrived the Avars and
                    the Bulgarians; and last of all came the Slavonians (Lutichi and Tevertzi), who
                    built themselves the town of Bielgorod. In the 7th century appeared the race of
                    the Bessi from whom the country acquired its present name. In the 9th century
                    arrived the Ugrians; in the 10th the Pechenegs; in the 11th the Kumans, the
                    Uses, and the Polovtzians; and in the 13th the Mongolians, under the leadership
                    of Batia. In this last century, also, the Genoese founded their colonies on the
                    shores of the Dniester. In 1367 Bessarabia formed a part of Moldavia. In 1503

                <p>arn portion of the country, or Budjak, fell under the power of the Turks; and in
                    1560 there settled in that district 30,000 Nogaitzians, who had devastated
                    northern Bessarabia, then inhabited by Roumanians. These Nogaitzians acquired
                    the name of the Bielgorod horde. Russian armies occupied Bessarabia during all
                    the Turkish wars in the 18th century, and again in 1806-12, when it was united
                    to Russia by the Bukharest treaty. By the Paris convention of 1856, Russia ceded
                    the districts of Ismael and the greater part of the Cagul to Turkey, and these
                    now form a part of Roumania. At present the government is divided into seven
                    districts, those of Keesheneff, Akerman, Bender, Orgieff, Soroka, Khoteen, and
                    Vassa. Bender and Akerman are subdivided into five cantons, each of the others
                    into four. In 1860 the population numbered 988,431, and had a very varied
                    ethnographical character. The principal portion consisted of Moldavians,
                    descendants of the ancient Dacians. The Russnayks or Galicians and Raeyani (that
                    is, those who have inhabited the raeyas provinces of the Turkish empire),
                    amounted to 130,000, mostly found in the districts of Khoteen, Soroka, Yassa,
                    and Orgieff. Malo-Russians (or Little Russians) began to settle in the country
                    in the 17th century, and now number 70,000. The Bulgarians began their
                    immigration from the Turkish provinces in 1806-12, afterwards in 1830-34, and
                    finally after 1856; they number 60,000. These colonies are administratively
                    divided into three circles :—theUpper Budjak, consisting of 19, the Lower Budjak
                    of 19, and the Ismael of 5. The Germans began to settle in Bessarabia in 1814.
                    Their colonies, to the number of 25, are situated n the Akerman district, along
                    the River Cogalnika. The Jews, who number 70,000, live partly in the cities
                    Keesheneff, Khoteen, &amp;c., but arc also settled in 16 agricultural colonies.
                    The Gypsies, or Zigan, amount to 10,000. They live a wandering life; but in the
                    Akerman district two villages, Pharaonofo and Kaera, are permanently inhabited
                    by them. A considerable number of Arme nians and Greeks have also settled in the
                    country during the present century.</p>
