                    academies, and a dissertation on a Latin inscription which procured him
                    membership of the Academy of Floral Games of Toulouse. Such was the smooth
                    beginning of a career which ultimately became unparalleled for meanness,
                    cowardice, lying, and atrocious cruelty. At the age of thirty he married. Four
                    years later, in 1789, he was elected deputy by his own province to the
                    States-general, which met in May. He had made his first visit to Paris in the
                    preceding year. His personal appearance, his manners, social qualities, and
                    liberal opinions, gave him a good standing among the multitude of provincial
                    wise-heads then thronging into Paris, eager to be the saviours of France, or at
                    least of themselves. He took his place at first with the monarchical party; and
                    his·, glib pen found occupation in the preparation of various reports, and in
                    editing a journal, the <hi rend="italic">Point du Jour,</hi> containing reports
                    of the debates of the National Assembly. For a time he formed a connection with
                    the House of Orleans, passing over soon to the republican party. Barère appears
                    to have been wholly free from the restraints of conscience or any guiding
                    principle; his conduct was regulated only by the determination to be on the side
                    of the strongest. After the close of the National Assembly he was nominated one
                    of the judges of the newly-instituted Court of Cassation. In 1792 he was elected
                    deputy to the National Convention for the department of the Hautes Pyrénées. At
                    first he took part with the Girondists; but on the trial of the king he voted,
                    with the Mountain, for the king’s death “<hi rend="italic">sans appel et sans
                    sursis.”</hi> He closed his speech with a sentence which became memorable, <hi
                    rend="italic">“L’arbre de la liberté ne saurait croître s’il n’était arrosé du
                    sang du rois.”</hi> As the Mountain became the strongest party Barère advanced
                    with it, unscrupulously carrying out its extremest projects, and playing a
                    prominent part in the Reign of Terror. The light-heartedness with which he acted
                    in these awful scenes, the fluency and flippancy of his speeches and reports,
                    procured him the title of the “Anacreon of the Guillotine.” He supported
                    Robespierre in his atrocious measure against the Girondists, crawled like a
                    slave at the feet of the “incorruptible” Maximilian till the day of his fall,
                    and then advocated his execution without a hearing. It was Barère who had
                    proposed the decree that no quarter should be given to any English or Hanoverian
                    soldier, which was unanimously adopted. This procured him admission by
                    acclamation to the Jacobin Club, from which he had been previously excluded. The
                    decree, however, remained a dead letter. A few months after the fall of the
                    Convention, proceedings were taken against Barère and his colleagues of the
                    Terror, Collot d’Herbois and Billaud-Varennes, and he was sent to the Isle of
                    Oléron. He was removed to Saintes, and thence escaped to Bordeaux, where he lay
                    in concealment for several years. In 1795 he was elected member of the Council
                    of Fire Hundred, but was not allowed to take his seat. When Napoleon Bonaparte
                    was First Consul he was anxious to employ Barère, but Barère refused the
                    overture. It was only for a while. The witling of the Terror became the hireling
                    and the spy of the new tyranny. On the fall of Napoleon, Barère played the part
                    of royalist, but on the final restoration of the Bourbons in 1815 he was
                    banished for life from France, and then withdrew into Belgium and temporary
                    oblivion. After the Revolution of July 1830 he reappeared in France, was reduced
                    by a series of lawsuits to extreme indigence, accepted a small pension assigned
                    him by Louis Philippe (on whom he had heaped <pb break="no"

                    of the Committee of Public Safety, January 15, lt&gt;41. Two years after his

                    then is this, that Barère approached nearer than any person mentioned in history
                    or fiction, whether man or devil, to the idea of consummate and universal
                    depravity. In him the qualities which are the proper objects of hatred, and the
                    qualities which are the proper objects of contempt, preserve an exquisite and
                    absolute harmony. In almost every particular sort of wickedness he has had
                    rivals. His sensuality was immoderate; but this was a failing common to him with
                    many great and amiable men. There have been many men as cowardly as he, some as
                    cruel, a few as mean, a few as impudent. There may also have been as great
                    liars, though we never met with them or read of them. But when we put every·
                    thing together, sensuality, poltroonery, baseness, effrontery, mendacity,
                    barbarity, the result is something which in a novel we should condemn as
                    caricature, and to which, we venture to say, no parallel can be found in
