                    third baron of Dunham Massey, and had considerable endowments. The priors sat in
                    the parliaments of the earls of Chester, and enjoyed all the dignities and·
                    privileges of palatinate barons. A fine crypt and some interesting ruins of the
                    priory still exist. From a comparatively obscure fishing village Birkenhead has
                    become a large and important town, with a rapidity truly marvellous. The
                    inhabitants numbered only 200 in 1821; in 1831 they were 2569; the following
                    table shows the increase since 1841 :—</p>

                <p>Birkenhead began to develop itself as a market-town in the year 1833, when an Act
                    was obtained for paving, lighting, watching, cleansing, and improving the town,
                    and for regulating the police and establishing a market. By this Act the
                    Improvement Commissioners were originally constituted, and at that time included
                    the mayor, bailiffs, and four aldermen of Liverpool· Immediately after the
                    passing of this Act the town made rapid progress. The principal streets were
                    laid out on a regular plan, intersecting each other at right angles. A line of
                    tramway, the first laid in England, affords every facility of street
                    communication. Hamilton Square, which occupies the summit of the rising ground
                    near <hi rend="subscript"> ι</hi> the river, forms the basis or starting point
                    for all the parallel and rectangular lines of streets. The houses of the square
                    are four stories in height, with stone fronts, the centres and ends of each
                    terrace being relieved or ornamented with columns and porticos in the Tuscan
                    order of architecture.</p>
                <p>Birkenhead has (exclusive of the out townships) nine churches belonging to the
                    Established Church. St Mary’s, built in 1821 by Mr. F. R. Price, late lord of
                    the manor, is in the Decorated Gothic style of architecture, with a
                    well-proportioned tower and spire. The churchyard includes the burial 'ground
                    and ruins of the ancient priory and chapel of St Mary. In addition to the
                    Established churches there are twenty-four places of worship belonging to
                    various Nonconforming denominations, viz., five Presbyterian, three Independent
                    or Congregational, 2 Baptist, four Wesleyan, one Primitive Methodist, one
                    Society of Friends, two Plymouth Brethren, three Roman Catholic, one Catholic
                    and Apostolic, two Unitarian. Many of these buildings are fair examples of
                    Gothic and classic architecture. St Aidan’s Theological College, in connection
                    with the Established Church, occupies a fine and elevated site adjoining the
                    western boundary of Claughton. It is a handsome building in the Tudor style of
                    architecture. There are seven public elementary schools in connection with the
                    Established churches, and seven in connection with other religious bodies. There
                    is also a first-class proprietary school, conducted on the model of the great
                    public schools, besides several private academies.</p>
                <p>There are several public buildings in Birkenhead worthy of notice. The
                    market-hall is a large and commodious building, 430 feet long and 130 feet wide,
                    <hi rend="superscript"> r</hi> with substantial and lofty vaults extending under
                    its entire area. It was opened in 1845, and built at a cost of £35,000. The
                    public slaughter-houses in Jackson Street, belonging to the Birkenhead
                    Commissioners, form an extensive pile of buildings; they were erected in 1846 at
                    a cost, exclusive of the site, of about £11,000, and were the first public
                    slaughter-houses of any extent erected in England. The town water-works also
                    belong to the Birkenhead Commissioners, and consist of two pumping stations, the
                    wells of which yield an aggregate supply of about 2⅜ million gallons in
                    twenty-four hours. The town-hall in Hamilton Street is a one-story building, and
                    formed when first erected the front of the old market-hall; it contains a police
                    court, fire-engine station, and chief bridewell; there are, besides, two branch
                    bridewells. Among other buildings are the post-office in Conway Street, the
                    borough hospital, and the School of Art, also in Conway Street, both erected by
                    the late Mr John Laird, M.P., and a free hbrary in Hamilton Street. The large
                    and commodious industrial schools in Corporation Road were built at the cost of
                    Sir Wm. Jackson, Bart., as a memorial to the late Prince Consort. The Music Hall
                    and the Queen’s Hall are situated in Claughton Road. There is also a neat and
                    commodious theatre and opera-house in Argyle Street.</p>
                <p>Birkenhead Park, opened in 1847, occupies 190⅜ acres of ground, and was laid out
                    at a cost (including the land) of <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit03newyrich/page/n797/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0903-0797-0780"/> £140,000. Birkenhead Cemetery, on Flaybrick Hill,
                    occupies 20∣ acres of ground, and cost about £40,000.</p>
                <p>Woodside Ferry may be regarded as the principal entrance to Birkenhead and Wirral
                    from Liverpool; and its exclusive right of ferryage dates back to 1332. In 1842
                    the Birkenhead Commissioners purchased this ferry, under an Act of Parliament,
                    from Mr F. R. Price, the lord of the manor. At the present time the annual
                    receipts for passengers alone amount to £36,000, and the number of persons
                    conveyed in the twelve months is upwards of nine millions, the single fare being
                    one penny. A large landing-stage, 800 feet in length and 80 feet in width, is
                    moored at this ferry, the passenger traffic being conducted to and from the
                    stage by means of a double gangway bridge, covered by two circular glass and
                    iron roofs. The goods traffic is conveyed to and from the stage by a
                    well-constructed floating bridge, 670 feet in length and 30 feet in width, which
                    enables the traffic to be carried on at any state of the tide. Handsome and
                    commodious saloon steamers, built and designed upon an improved principle, and
                    capable of carrying above 1700 passengers each, are now used upon this ferry.
                    The late Mr William Laird, whose name is so well known in connection with iron
                    shipbuilding, first conceived the idea of turning to advantage the capabilities
                    of Wallasey Pool for the formation of a dock. After a lapse of many years, the
                    Commissioners of Birkenhead, alive to the advantages which this project would
                    confer upon the town, employed the late Mr Bendel as their engineer, and applied
                    to Parliament for powers to construct the necessary works. The foundation-stone
                    of the new docks was laid in October 1844, and the first dock was opened by the
                    late Lord Morpeth on 5th April 1847. Subsequently, the dock powers of the
                    Commissioners were entrusted to a corporate body of trustees who afterwards
                    transferred the property to the corporation of Liverpool; and ultimately it was
                    vested in the Mersey Docks and Harbour Board, a corporation created by the Act
                    of 1857 for the management of the docks on both sides of the Mersey. At that
                    time the area of the dock space open and in use in Birkenhead was about 7
                    acres.</p>
                <p>The docks bound the town on the north and north-east and partly on the east,
                    extending from the landing-stage at Woodside Ferry to the Wallasey Bridge, a
                    distance of over two miles. The Great Float has been constructed on the site of
                    the Wallasey Pool, forming an immense dock of 150 acres, with a quay space of
                    about five miles. The Great Float separates Birkenhead from
                    Poulton-cum-Seacombe, in the parish of Wallasey, and communicates on the east
                    with a low water basin of about 14 acres (now being converted into a dock) and
                    the Alfred Dock (about 8 acres, and quay space 460 lineal yards), and on the
                    south-east with the Egerton, Morpeth, and Morpeth Branch Docks. The Morpeth Dock
                    (about 11 acres, quay space 1299 lineal yards) is connected with the Morpeth
                    Branch Dock (about 3£ acres, quay space 600 lineal yards), both set apart for
                    steamers. The total water area of these docks is about 170 acres, and the lineal
                    quay space about 10 miles.</p>
                <p>The entrances to the Birkenhead Docks are capable of docking the largest class of
                    steamers afloat. The massive iron bridges across the dock entrances are opened
                    and closed by hydraulic power, which is likewise applied to the cranes, coal
                    hoists, warehouse lifts, and other appliances about the docks. At the extreme
                    western end of the West Float are three large graving docks, two about 750 feet
                    in length, and 130 feet and 80 feet in width respectively, and the largest, now
                    in course of construction, measuring about 900 feet in length and 130 feet in
                    width.</p>
                <p>Substantial and commodious sheds and warehouses have been erected at various
                    places along the dock quays for the full development of the traffic.</p>
                <p>The block of warehouses known by the name of the corn warehouses are immense
                    piles of buildings, with a canal between to give access to the separate blocks
                    of buildings, and with machinery for carrying the grain, &amp;c., from floor to
                    floor, and for despatching it by railway.</p>
                <p>In 1847 the Birkenhead Dock Warehousing Company opened their first warehouses,
                    capable of storing 80,000 tons of goods. Each block is detached, and the whole
                    premises are surrounded by a wall 12 feet high. A railway branch, called the
                    Dock Extension Railway, is carried round the property. The company also built
                    blocks of houses for their workmen, known as the Dock Cottages. This property is
                    now in the hands of the Mersey Docks and Harbour Board. ⅛</p>
                <p>The commerce of Birkenhead is in all respects a branch of that of Liverpool, and
                    chiefly devoted to coal, guano, and grain,—the quantity of coal alone exported
                    being over one million tons per annum. Many manufactories have sprung up within
                    the last few years on the margin of the Great Float and other parts of the town,
                    such as iron foundries, boiler-works, oilcake and seed mills, &amp;c., some of
                    the engineering works, shipbuilding yards, and forges being on a large scale.
                    The Birkenhead Iron-works of Messrs Laird Brothers employ from 3000 to 4000 men;
                    these works, in connection with their shipbuilding yards, have turned out some
                    of the largest iron-clad ships; the engine-works, also belonging to the same
                    firm, are on a very extensive scale. The Canada Works, belonging to Messrs
                    Thomas Brassey and Co., carry on an extensive business in marine engines,
                    iron-bridge building, pontoon and general railway work. There are also the
                    Britannia Works (Messrs James Taylor and Co.) for portable engines, marine
                    engines, traction engines, steam cranes, &amp;c.; Messrs Clay and Inman’s Forge,
                    for heavy shafting, &amp;c.; the Wirral Foundry, for large engine castings,
                    &amp;c.; and the Starbuck Car and Waggon Co.’s Works, for building tramway cars,
                    &amp;c.; and Messrs Clover and Clayton’s shipbuilding premises as well as other
                    manufactories of less extent.</p>
                <p>The affairs of the township of Birkenhead and Claughton-cum-Grange are managed by
                    twenty-one Commissioners, chosen by the ratepayers. The town contains a head
                    postoffice, county court, police court, petty sessional court for the hundred of
                    Wirral, and two banks. Two newspapers are published weekly. The principal
                    market-day is Saturday, but a large hay, straw, and vegetable market is held on
                    Tuesdays in the hay market, a large open space of ground, having an area of
                    about 1⅜ acres. The total area of the Commissioners’ district is 1684 acres,
                    including 365 acres of water space, viz., Birkenhead, 1248 acres, and
                    Claughton-cum-Grange, 436. The parliamentary borough of Birkenhead was
                    constituted in 1861, and returns one member to parliament. Its parliamentary
                    limits include the extra-parochial chapelry of Birkenhead, the several
                    “townships of Claughton, Tranmere, and Oxton, and so much of the township of
                    Higher Bebington as lies to the eastward of the road leading from Higher
                    Tranmere to Lower Bebington.” The population of this district in 1861 was
                    51,649, and in 1871 it had increased to 64,671.</p>
