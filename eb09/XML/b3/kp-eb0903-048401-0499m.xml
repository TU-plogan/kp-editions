                <p>THE bee, from its singular instincts, its active industry, and the useful
                    products resulting from its labours, has, from the remotest times, attracted
                    general attention and interest. No nation upon earth has had so many historians
                    as this remarkable class of insects. The patience and sagacity of the naturalist
                    have had an ample field for exercise in the study of the structure, physiology,
                    and domestic economy of bees; their preservation and increase have been objects
                    of assiduous care to the agriculturist; and their reputed perfection of policy
                    and government have long been the theme of admiration, and have supplied copious
                    materials for argument and allusion to the poet and the moralist in every age.
                    It is a subject that has been celebrated by the muse of Virgil, and illustrated
                    by the philosophic genius of Aristotle. Cicero and Pliny record that
                    Aristomachus devoted sixty years to the study of these insects; and Philiscus is
                    said to have retired into a remote wood, that he might pursue his observations
                    on them without interruption. A very great number of authors have written
                    express treatises on bees; periodical works have been published relating
                    exclusively to their management and economy; arid learned societies have been
                    established for the sole purpose of conducting researches on this subject.</p>
                <p>In so complicated a branch of natural history, correct observation and induction
                    require laborious and long-continued efforts. But, on the subject of bees, the
                    inquirer after truth had, besides, many obstacles to encounter from the very
                    general diffusion of errors, which had been transmitted without due examination
                    from one author to another. The history of the opinions of successive writers
                    sufficiently proves how gradual and slow has been the growth of an accurate
                    knowledge of these insects,—what is now known being the result of the
                    persevering labours of ages. The accumulation of curious and interesting facts,
                    indeed, which has accrued from the researches of Swammerdam, Maraldi, Reaumur,
                    Schirach, Huber, Dzierzon, and Von Siebold, constitutes almost a new science. It
                    will therefore be proper, in this place, to give a connected and systematic
                    account of the natural history of the bee; and the principal features of
                    internal conformation will be described along with the particular functions. Our
                    descriptions will apply, more especially, to the common and best-known species,
                    the A∕&gt;is <hi rend="italic">mellifica,</hi> which is the one particularly
                    prized on account of the rich products it affords.</p>
                <p>We shall begin with a brief account of the different sorts of bees inhabiting the
                    hive, and of the respective offices of each; we shall then proceed to consider
                    their comparative physiology, including the leading particulars relating to the
                    functions of their various organs, sensitive pow ers, in stincts, secretions,
                    and diseases. We shall also explain the theory of parthenogenesis and the
                    impregnation of queens, and shall follow the bees in their different labours,
                    from the period when the swarm has settled in a new habitation,—detailing the
                    complex structure of their combs, their curious processes of architecture, and
                    the pains they bestow on rearing their progeny, and in sending forth new swarms;
                    and, in the last place, we shall notice the best systems of modern bee-keeping,
                    and give some account of hives and apiarian implements.</p>
                <p>The leading feature in the natural history of bees, and one which distinguishes
                    them from almost all other insects, is their singular distribution into three
                    different kinds, constituting to all appearance so many different modifications
                    of sex. The drone (fig. I), which is characterized by a thicker body, a round
                    head, a more flattened shape, and more obtusely terminated abdomen, within which
                    are contained the male organs of generation, is undoubtedly the male of the
                    species. It is distinguished also by the absence of a sting, and by the humming
                    noise that accompanies its flight. The queen-bee (fig. 2), which is
                    unequivocally recognized as the female, is larger than any of the others, has
                    the abdomen of greater length, and is provided with a sting and two ovaria of
                    considerable size. The worker bees (fig. 3) compose the third class, and are
                    distinguished by the smallness of their size, their lengthened proboscis, the
                    peculiar structure of their legs and thighs, which are adapted to the collection
                    of certain materials obtained from vegetables, and by the apparent absence of
                    every trace of generative organs,—we say <hi rend="italic">apparent,</hi>
                    because, as will be shown, rudiments of ovaria do exist, which, however, are not
                    perceptible without a very minute and careful dissection. Till recently the
                    worker bees were regarded as devoid of sex, and were accordingly termed <hi
                    rend="italic">neuters.</hi> It is their function to perform all the laborious
                    offices for the community, to construct the interior of their habitation, to
                    explore the country in search of nourishment and other materials, to collect and
                    bring them to the hive, and apply them to different purposes, to attend upon the
                    queen, and supply all her wants, to defend the hive from the attacks of
                    depredators, and to carry on hostilities against the various enemies of the
                    tribe. The life of the queen is chiefly engrossed with the duties of laying
                    eggs. The drones producing neither wax nor honey, and depending on the rest for
                    their subsistence, are idle spectators of the others’ labours. They appear to be
                    formed only for the momentary but important duty of impregnation, since they
                    perish when this purpose is accomplished. There is commonly only one perfect
                    queen existing at a time within each hive, and she usually appears to be treated
                    by all the other bees with every mark of affection and of deference. The number
                    of workers is very different in different hives; sometimes there are only a few
                    thousands; at other times from twenty to forty, or even fifty thousand. The
                    drones, even in the spring, seldom compose more than one-thirtieth or
                    one-fortieth of the whole; and, at other seasons, there are none to be found in
                    the hive when a fertile queen is present. In order to form some estimate of the
                    number of bees wdιich can occupy a certain space, Hunter counted what number of
                    drowned bees could be contained in an alehouse pint, and found it to be 2160; so
                    that if a swarm were to fill two quarts, their numbers would be nearly 9000.
                    Reaumur, with the same view of ascertaining their numbers, employed the more
                    accurate method of weighing them; he found that a collection, weighing one
                    ounce, consisted of 336 bees, and, therefore, that 16 ounces, or one pound,
                    would consist of 5376 bees.</p>
                <p>Notwithstanding the difference in conformation, instincts, and offices between
                    the queen-bee and the workers, it is now established on the most
                    incontrovertible evidence that they both originally proceed from the same kind
                    of <hi rend="italic">egg</hi> or larva, which is capable of being converted,
                    according to <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit03newyrich/page/n500/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0903-0500-0485"/> circumstances, either into a worker or a queen.
                    It has been proved that the former, although exhibiting no appearance of sexual
                    organs on a superficial examination, are in reality females, and have the
                    rudiments of these organs, which, however, not being developed, are incapable of
                    exercising theiι* proper functions, although it sometimes happens that they
                    become sufficiently so to enable a worker to lay unfecundated eggs. It may be
                    remarked that the idea of the worker bees being radically females had been
                    suggested long ago by Dr Warder in his <hi rend="italic">Monarchy of Bees,</hi>
                    in which he terms them “True Amazons;” but no attention had been paid to his
                    opinion. The real merit of this great discovery, which affords a key to a
                    multitude of hitherto inexplicable facts, unquestionably belongs to Schirach.
                    When first announced to the world it was received with suspicion by the greater
                    number of naturalists, and with complete incredulity by others. It was, indeed,
                    at variance with the whole tenor of the observations of Swammerdam, Maraldi, and
                    Reaumur. Wilhelmi, the brother-in-law of Schirach, though an eye-witness of the
                    experiments from which this theory had been deduced, for a long time refused to
                    admit the doctrine, but at length became one of its most strenuous supporters.
                    It is noticed in a vein of sarcastic ridicule by John Hunter in his otherwise
                    excellent paper on bees in the <hi rend="italic">Philosophical
                    Transactions.</hi> Needham wrote a <hi rend="italic">Memoir</hi> for the
                    Imperial Academy of Brussels in 1777 for the express purpose of refuting it, and
                    he then inveighs in strong language against those naturalists who had deigned to
                    give it the least countenance. Bonnet, after exercising a laudable scepticism,
                    and making a diligent inquiry, in which he displays a genuine spirit of
                    philosophy, yielded a reluctant assent. But the truth of the doctrine has since
                    been placed beyond the reach of controversy by a multiplied series of
                    observations and experiments in different parts of Europe and America.</p>
                <p>In considering the physiology of the bee, the first function that claims our
                    notice is that of nutrition. The food of bees is principally of two kinds,
                    namely, the fluid secretions of vegetables contained in the nectaries of the
                    flowers, and the dust of the anthers, which has been termed by botanists the
                    pollen, but which, when collected by the bees, has received a variety of
                    appellations, such as farina, bee-bread, &amp;c. Occasionally, however, we find
                    bees feeding upon other saccharine substances besides honey, such as honey-dew,
                    syrup, &amp;c.</p>
                <p>The organs by which they collect food are extremely complex, comprising
                    instruments adapted to the reception of liquid aliment as well as those fitted
                    for the division of solid materials. Reaumur has given a most elaborate
                    description of these organs, and corrects some errors into which Swammerdam had
                    fallen. For the purpose of taking up fluids, bees are provided, in common with
                    all hymenopterous insects, with a long and flexible proboscis or trunk, which
                    may be considered as a lengthened tongue, though, strictly speaking, it is
                    formed by a prolongation of the under lip. It is not tubular, as Swammerdam had
                    supposed, but solid throughout; and the minute depression at its extremity is
                    not the aperture of any canal through which liquids can be absorbed. The trunk
                    of the bee performs strictly the office of a tongue, and not that of a tube for
                    suction; for when it takes up honey or any other fluid aliment, the under or the
                    upper surfaces are more immediately applied to it, and rolled from side to side,
                    and the bee thus licks up what adheres to it, while the extremity of the trunk
                    is frequently not applied at all to the substance taken up. The trunk is
                    supported on a pedicle, which admits of being bent back or propelled forwards,
                    and thus can retract or stretch out the trunk to a considerable extent.
                    Protection is given to it by a double sheath; the external part consisting of
                    two scales furnished by the expansion of one of the portions of the labial
                    palpi, and the internal formed by the prolongation of the two external portions
                    of the jaw. The whole member thus consists of five principal parts, on which
                    account .Fabricius termed it <hi rend="italic">lingua quinquefida.</hi></p>
                <p>For the purpose of mechanically dividing solid materials, the mouth is furnished
                    with two strong mandibles and four palpi; they are but little employed in
                    eating, but are of great use in enabling the insect to seize and break down hard
                    substances for other purposes. In the worker bee all these parts are of larger
                    dimensions than in the other kinds. The teeth are two in number, and have the
                    form of concave scales with sharp edges; they are fixed to the ends of the jaws,
                    and play horizontally as in other insects. Reaumur describes and delineates a
                    large aperture above the root of the proboscis, which is so surrounded with
                    fleshy parts as not to be readily seen unless the proboscis be extended and bent
                    downwards. This he considers as the mouth or orifice of the gullet; on the upper
                    side of which, and of course opposite to the root of the proboscis, a small
                    fleshy and pointed organ is seen, which he regards as the tongue, assisting in
                    the deglutition of the food. Through this orifice, it is presumed, all the
                    aliment, whether liquid or solid, passes; the former being conveyed to it by the
                    trunk, which, by its contractile power, presses forward the fluids it has
                    collected between itself and the inner sheath, and the latter being received
                    directly after its comminution by the teeth, behind which it is situated.
                    Latreille, however, whose authority is great on a point of this nature, thinks
                    that Reaumur has deceived himself with regard to such an aperture, and
                    disbelieves its existence. He conceives that the food simply passes on by the
                    sides of the tongue, finding its way from thence into the oesophagus and so on
                    to the stomach.</p>
                <p>The bee has two stomachs. The first is a large transparent membranous bag,
                    pointed in front and swelling out into two pouches behind. It performs an office
                    in some respects analogous to that of the crop in birds; for it receives and
                    retains for a time the fluid of the nectaries, which does not appear to differ
                    in any respect from honey. Hunter observes that whatever time the contents of
                    this reservoir may be retained he never found them altered so as to give the
                    idea of digestion having taken place. The coats of this reservoir are muscular,
                    by which means it is capable of throwing up the honey into the mouth, so that it
                    is regurgitated into the honey cells or imparted to other bees. None of it ever
                    passes out from the extremity of the trunk as Swammerdam had believed. For the
                    purpose of digestion a second stomach is provided, which takes its origin from
                    the middle of the two posterior lobes of the former, and is of a lengthened
                    cylindrical shape. Its communication with the intestine is not direct, but takes
                    place by a projecting or inverted pylorus, thickest at its most prominent part,
                    with a very small opening in the centre, of a peculiar construction. This inward
                    projecting part is easily seen through the coats of the reservoir, especially if
                    full of honey. A similar kind of structure takes place at the communication of
                    the first with the second stomach, and having the properties of a valve, must
                    effectually prevent all regurgitation from the latter into the former. *</p>
                <p>The pollen, or fertilising dust of flowers, is collected by the bees for the
                    purpose of feeding the young. It is stored in the cells until required, and then
                    partly digested by the nurses with honey, and a kind of chyle formed of it. When
                    natural pollen cannot be obtained the bees will eagerly take farina, either of
                    rye, chestnuts, or pease, as a substitute, which appears to answer the same
                    purpose. The bees, by means of the pencil of hair which grows on the tarsi,
                    first collect a certain quantity of pollen, ar.d then <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit03newyrich/page/n501/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0903-0501-0486"/> knead it together into a ball, and place it in
                    the space situated at the middle joint or tibia of the hinder leg, which has
                    been termed the basket. This portion of the leg is smooth and concave, somewhat
                    like the bowl of a spoon, with stout hairs of moderate length rising from its
                    left edge and nearly straight. Other hairs on the right side are much longer and
                    are curved, rising up with a high arch and crossing more than half the width of
                    the hollow, making a large basket-like enclosure for a load of pollen. In order
                    to gather large quantities at once, the bees are sometimes observed to roll
                    their bodies on the flower, and then brushing off the pollen which adheres to
                    them with the feet, form it into two masses, which they dispose of as before
                    mentioned; and it is said that in moist weather, when the particles of pollen
                    cannot be readily made to adhere, they return to their hive dusted all over with
                    pollen, which they then brush off with their feet. The part in Nature’s economy
                    thus unconsciously performed by the bee in common with other insects is most
                    important. By this means the pollen is carried from flower to flower, or from
                    the stamens to the pistils, and plants are made fertile which without such aid
                    would often remain barren.</p>
                <p>It was long the received opinion that wax was but a modification of pollen, which
                    required for this conversion only a slight pressure and a kind of kneading by
                    the feet of the bees. But it hae been completely proved, by the researches of
                    Duchet, Hunter, and Huber, that wax is a secretion from the abdomen of the bee,
                    and that it depends not at all on the pollen which the insect may consume
                    (indeed, it is doubtful if it consumes any), but on the quantity of honey or
                    other saccharine substance which it receives into its stomach. The first light
                    thrown on this subject was in a letter of Wilhelmi to Bonnet in 1768, in which
                    he says that wax, instead of being ejected by the mouth, exudes from the rings
                    which enclose the posterior part of the body. Of this we may satisfy ourselves
                    by drawing out the bee from the cell in which it is working with wax, by means
                    of the point of a fine needle; and we may perceive, in proportion as the body is
                    elongated, that the wax will make its appearance under the rings in the form of
                    small scales. Duchet, in his <hi rend="italic">Culture</hi><hi rend="italic">des
                    Abeilles,</hi> gives a full statement of the principal circumstances attending
                    the production of wax, which he very j ustly ascribes to the conversion of honey
                    into this substance in the body of the bee. These facts appear to have been
                    entirely overlooked till the subject was again brought forward by Hunter, in his
                    paper in the <hi rend="italic">Philosophical Transactions</hi> for 1792. Huber
                    was engaged in prosecuting his inquiries on this subject at the same period with
                    Hunter, and discovered, in 1793, the existence of regular receptacles or
                    pouches, from the coats of which the wax is secreted, and within which it
                    accumulates till its edges raise the scales, and become apparent externally.
                    These plates of wax are withdrawn by the bee itself, or some of its
                    fellow-labourers, and are applied in a manner hereafter to be described.</p>
                <p>Huber has shown, by a series of well-conducted experiments, that, in a natural
                    state, the quantity of wax secreted is in proportion to the consumption of
                    honey, but that an equal or even greater quantity will be formed if the bee be
                    fed on a solution of sugar in water. Warmth and rest promote this process of
                    secretion; for the bees, after feeding plentifully on saccharine food, hang
                    together in a cluster without moving, for several hours, at the end of which
                    time large plates of wax are found under the abdominal rings. This happened when
                    bees were confined and restricted from any other sort of nourishment, whilst
                    those that were fed on pollen and fruits alone did not produce any wax. In the
                    second volume of Huber’s <hi rend="italic">Nouvelles</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Observations</hi><hi rend="italic">sur les Abeilles,</hi> he describes minutely
                    the anatomy of the pouches or receptacles for the wax, which are parts peculiar
                    to the working bees, being totally absent iu the males and queens, The cavities
                    are lined with a membrane, which presents a number of folds, forming an
                    hexagonal net-work, not unlike the appearance in the second stomach of ruminant
                    quadrupeds, and evidently destined to perform the office of secretion.</p>
                <p>Among the secretions peculiar to the bee, the poison which is poured into the
                    wounds made by the sting deserves to be noticed. It is said to owe its
                    mischievous efficacy to certain pungent salts. If a bee is provoked to strike
                    its sting against a plate of glass, a drop of poison will be discharged; and if
                    this is placed under a microscope, the salts may be seen to concrete, as the
                    liquor dries, into clear, oblong, pointed crystals. The sting consists of a
                    finely-pointed tubular instrument, open along the whole length of its upper
                    surface, this opening being closed by two slender horny barbs each having about
                    ten serrations on its outer edge. These barbs are not projected in advance of
                    the sting as usually described, neither are they within the sting, but complete
                    its outer tubular surface, down the centre of which the poison is injected from
                    a little bag at the root of the sting. The serrations prevent the worker bee
                    from withdrawing its sting from an eneniy; and, consequently, it is torn from
                    the body, with a portion of the intestines, causing the death of the bee.</p>
                <p>Respiration is effected by means totally different from those which are usual in
                    the higher classes of the Animal Kingdom. As the blood, or fluid corresponding
                    to the blood, cannot be presented to the air in any separate organ, the air must
                    be conducted to the blood wherever such a fluid is met with. For this purpose
                    tracheae, or air-tubes, having several external openings or spiracles, are made
                    to ramify like arteries, and are distributed in an infinite number of branches
                    to every part of the body. The condition of a hive of bees in which many
                    thousand individuals, full of animation and activity, are crowded together in a
                    confined space, having no communication with the external air but by means of a
                    very small aperture in the lowest part, which aperture is frequently obstructed
                    by a throng of bees passing in and out during sultry weather, would without some
                    precautions be of all possible conditions the one least favourable to life. Bees
                    cannot exist in an impure atmosphere any more than creatures of a larger growth.
                    And on examining the air of a populous hive it is found scarcely to differ in
                    purity from the surrounding atmosphere. The means by which this is effected
                    observation has shown is by the rapid vibration of the bees’ wings, a certain
                    number being told off to imitate the action of flying, for which purpose they
                    fasten themselves with their feet to the floor of the hive, so that the whole
                    effect of that impulse which, were they at liberty, would carry them forwards
                    with considerable velocity is exerted on the air, wnich is therefore driven
                    backwards in a powerful current. Some bees occasionally perform these
                    ventilating motions on the outside of the hive, near the entrance, but a still
                    greater number are employed in this office within doors. Sometimes twenty are
                    thus occupied at once, and each bee continuée its motions for a certain time,
                    occasionally for nearly half an hour, and is then relieved by another, which
                    takes its place. So rapid a motion of the wings is thus produced that they
                    cannot be seen except at the two extremities of the arc of vibration, which is
                    at least one of 90°. This is the occasion of that humming sound which is
                    constantly heard from the interior of the hive when the bees are in a ε <hi
                    rend="superscript"> l</hi> ate of activity. The immediate cause of these actions
                    is probably some impression made on their organe by the presence of vitiated
                    air, for a bee may be made to ventilate itself by placing near it substances
                    which have to it an unpleasant odour.</p>

                    xml:id="kp-eb0903-0502-0487"/> temperature is remarkably exemplified in bees,
                    among which, in consequence of their collecting together in large numbers, the
                    heat is not readily dissipated, and admits also of being easily ascertained by
                    the thermometer. Hunter found it to vary from 73° to 84° Fahr.; and Huber
                    observed it on some occasions to rise suddenly from about 92° to above 104°</p>
                <p>The physiology of the external senses in a class of animals of a nature so remote
                    from our own species must necessarily be very imperfectly understood by us. The
                    infinite diversity of character presented by the different tribes of insects, as
                    well as of other animals, naturally suggests the idea that external objects
                    produce on their sentient organs impressions widely different from those which
                    they communicate to ourselves. The notions we form of their senses must not only
                    be liable to great inaccuracy, but may often be totally inadequate
                    representations of the truth. A finer organisation and more subtile perceptions
                    would alone suffice to extend the sphere of their ordinary senses to an
                    inconceivable degree, as the telescope and the microscope have with us extended
                    the powers of vision. But they possess in all probability other organs
                    appropriated to unknown kinds of impressions, which must open to them avenues to
                    knowledge of various kinds to which we must ever remain total strangers. Art has
                    supplied us with many elaborate modes of bringing within our cognizance some of
                    the properties of matter which nature has not immediately furnished us w ith the
                    means of detecting. But who will compare our thermometers, spectroscopes, or
                    hygrometers, however elaborately constructed, with those refined instruments
                    with which the lower orders of animals, and particularly insects, are so
                    liberally provided?</p>
                <p>The antennae, which are so universally met with in this class of animals, are
                    doubtless organs of the greatest importance in conveying impressions from
                    without. Their continual motion, the constant use which is made of them in
                    examining objects, the total derangement in the instincts of those insects which
                    have been deprived of them, point them out as exquisite organs of sense. To
                    impressions of touch arising from the immediate contact of bodies they are
                    highly sensitive, but their motions evidently show that they are affected by
                    objects at some distance. They are, no doubt, alive to all the tremulous
                    movement of the surrounding air, and probably communicate perceptions of some of
                    its other qualities. Composed of a great number of articulations, they are
                    exceedingly flexible, and can readily embrace the outline of any body that the
                    bee wishes to examine, however small its diameter. Newport, in a paper published
                    in the <hi rend="italic">Transactions of the Entomological Society,</hi> says he
                    is convinced from experiments that the antennae are auditory organs; and that
                    however varied may be their structure, they are appropriated to the perception
                    and transmission of sound. The majority of modern physiologists and
                    entomologists coincide in this view, and the weight of authority in favour of it
                    is certainly very great, comprising as it does Sulzer, Scarpa, Schneider,
                    Borkhausen, Bonsdorf, Carus, Straus-Durckheim, Oken, Burmeister,Kirby and
                    Spence, Lespès, and Hicks. Nevertheless, other eminent entomologists, as, for
                    instance, Lyonet, Küster, Robineau-Desvoidy, Vogt, and Erichson, regard these
                    organs as the seat of smell. The question may be considered as yet undetermined,
                    and it is possible that they are the organs of some sense of which we know
                    nothing, and which we consequently cannot describe. It is by these instruments
                    that the bee is enabled to execute so many works in the interior of the hive,
                    from which the light must be totally excluded. Aided by them it builds its
                    combs, pours honey into its magazines, feeds the larvae, and ministers to every
                    want which it appears to discover and judge of solely by the sense of touch. The
                    antennae appear also to be the principal means employed for mutual communication
                    of impressions. The different modes of contact constitute a kind of language
                    which seems to be susceptible of a great variety of modifications, capable of
                    supplying every sort of information for which they have occasion.</p>
                <p>The sense residing in the antennae appears to be on many occasions supplementary
                    to that of vision, which in bees, as in other insects, is less perfect than in
                    the larger animals. During the night, therefore, they are chiefly guided in
                    their movements by the former of these senses. In full daylight, however, they
                    appear to enjoy the sense of vision in great perfection. A bee alights
                    unerringly on the flowers in search of nectar or pollen, and as truly at its own
                    hive’s entrance on its arrival there. When returning from the fields to its hive
                    it seems to ascertain the proper direction by rising with a circular flight into
                    the air; it then darts forward with unfailing precision, passing through the air
                    in a straight line with extreme rapidity, and never failing to alight at the
                    entrance of its own hive, though whether its course be determined by vision
                    alone we are unable to say.</p>
                <p>Their perceptions of heat and cold are extremely delicate. The influence of the
                    sun’s rays excites them to vigorous action. Great cold will reduce them to a
                    state of torpor, and inferior degrees of cold are unpleasant to them; a
                    temperature of 40° Fa∙hr. will so benumb a bee as to deprive it of the power of
                    flight, and it will soon perish unless restored to a warmer atmosphere. "When,
                    however, bees are in the usual winter’s cluster in the hive, they will bear a
                    very great degree of cold without injury. In America hives often stand where the
                    external temperature is as low as 20° below zero, and from the condensed vapour
                    within the hive, the bees may be found in a solid lump of ice, and yet, with
                    returning spring, they awake to life and activity. The degree of cold which bees
                    can endure has not been ascertained, though it is no doubt considerable. They
                    survive the winter in many cold parts of Russia, in hollow trees, without any
                    attention being paid to them; and their hives are frequently made of the bark of
                    trees, which does not afford a very complete protection from the effects of
                    frost. Many bees which are thought to die of cold in winter die in reality of
                    famine or damp. A rainy summer and cold autumn often prevent their laying in a
                    sufficient store of provisions; and the hives should, therefore, be carefully
                    examined in the after-part of the season, and the amount of food ascertained. Mr
                    White judiciously observes, that bees which stand on the north side of a
                    building whose height intercepts the sun’s beams all the winter will waste less
                    of their provisions than others which stand in the sun; for, coming forth
                    seldom, they eat little, and yet are as forward in the spring to work and swarm
                    as those which had twice as much honey left -with them the preceding autumn.
                    They show by their conduct that they are sensible of changes in the state of the
                    weather for some time before we can perceive such alterations. Sometimes when
                    working with great assiduity they will suddenly desist from their labours, none
                    will stir out of the hive, while all the workers that are abroad hurry home in
                    crowds, and press forward so as to obstruct the entrance of the hive. Often,
                    when they are thus warned of the approach of bad weather, we can distinguish no
                    alteration in the state of the atmosphere. Gathering clouds sometimes produce
                    this effect on them; but perhaps they possess some species of hygrometrical
                    sense unconnected with any impression of vision. Huber supposes that it is the
                    rapid diminution of light that alarms them, for if the sky be uniformly overcast
                    they proceed on their excursions, and even the first drops of a shower do not
                    make them return with any great precipitancy.</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit03newyrich/page/n503/mode/1up"

                <p>Their taste is, perhaps, the most imperfect of their senses. They use scarcely
                    any discrimination in the collection of honey from different flowers. They are
                    not repelled by the scent or flavour of such as are extremely offensive to our
                    organs, and scruple not to derive supplies from such as are highly poisonous. In
                    some districts in America it is well known that honey acquires in this way very
                    deleterious properties. The qualities of honey are observed to vary much
                    according to the particular situation from which it is obtained. In their
                    selection of flowers they are guided by the quantity of honey they expect to
                    meet with, and in no respect by its quality. That gathered from ivy blossoms in
                    England is sometimes so bitter and nauseous as to be useless for our eating,
                    although the bees consume it readily. But their smell must be sufficiently acute
                    to enable them to discover honey at great distances, and in concealed situations
                    direct experiment has indeed proved this to be the case. Huber found that they
                    proceeded immediately towards boxes which contained honey concealed from view;
                    and such, in fact, is the situation of the fluid of the nectaries in flowers.
                    Some odours, and especially all kinds of smoke, are highly obnoxious to them;
                    and this is also the case with ammonia and other volatile chemical agents, upon
                    receiving the impression of which they immediately set about ventilating
                    themselves in the usual manner. The odour of the poison of their sting produces
                    similar effects, exciting them to immediate rage and hostility. It has been
                    observed that bees recognize the presence of a stranger in their hive by the
                    smell; and in joining two stocks into one, if the bees are united without
                    precautions, a battle will probably ensue. To obviate this bee-keepers are in
                    the practice of strongly scenting both families by means of peppermint, tobacco
                    smoke, or other strong-smelling agent; this overpowering the bees’ natural
                    scent, they are unable to distinguish their own party from the intruders, and
                    peace is insured. The sense of vision does not appear to aid them, for where
                    Ligurians are added to common black bees the effect is the same, although in
                    colour the two varieties are very different. In the introduction of an alien
                    queen to a stock it is also usual to imprison the new sovereign within the hive
                    which she is to rule until she has acquired the peculiar scent of her future
                    subjects, who will then make no objections to her, while had she been at once
                    set at liberty she would probably have met her death.</p>
                <p>Although it is clear that insects possess the power of smell, yet the particular
                    organ of this sense has never been accurately ascertained, and the opinions of
                    naturalists have been much divided on the subject. These opinions have been
                    supported more by arguments drawn from the analogy of what happens in other
                    classes of animals than by direct experiment on insects themselves. We know that
                    in all animals respiring by means of lungs, the organs of smell are placed at
                    the entrance of the air-passages; and it has often been concluded that in like
                    manner the stigmata, or the orifices of the air-tubes, are the seat of this
                    sense in insects. Huber’s opinion was that in the bee this sense resides in the
                    mouth itself, or in its immediate vicinity. Here, indeed, would be its proper
                    station if this faculty be intended, as we may reasonably suppose it to be, to
                    apprise the individual of the qualities of the food prior to its being eaten.
                    When the mouth of a bee was plugged up with paste, which was allowed to dry
                    before the insect was set at liberty, it remained quite insensible to the same
                    odours to which it had before manifested the strongest repugnance.</p>
                <p>It is generally supposed that bees possess the sense of hearing. The common
                    practice of making a loud noise by drums and kettles in order to attract a swarm
                    is founded on this supposition. But the evidence is by no means conclusive, for
                    we find that they are not disturbed by a loud clap of thunder, or by the report
                    of a gun, or by any other noise that may happen to arise round them. Sir John
                    Lubbock, who has made a great many observations in this direction, says that he
                    could never find them take notice of any sound he made even when it was close to
                    them. He tried them with a violin, dog whistle, shrill pipe, and set of tuning
                    forks, also by shouting, &amp;c., close to their heads, but in spite of his
                    utmost efforts the bees took no notice, not even by a twitch of the antennae
                    showing they heard. It is, however, certain that they are capable of emitting a
                    variety of sounde which appear expressive of anger, fear, satisfaction, and
                    other passions; and it would seem that they are even capable of communicating
                    certain emotions to one another in this manner. Huber observed that the young
                    queens not yet liberated from their cocoons sent forth a peculiar piping sound,
                    and this is answered by the old queen, who apparently must hear the note of her
                    aspiring rival.</p>
                <p>A certain cry or humming noise from the queen will strike with sudden
                    consternation all the bees in the hive, and they remain for a considerable time
                    motionless and stupified. Hunter has noticed a number of modulations of sound
                    emitted by bees under different circumstances, and has instituted an inquiry
                    concerning the means employed by them in producing these sounds; for an account
                    of this see his paper in the <hi rend="italic">Philosophical
                    Transactions.</hi></p>
                <p>If the function of sensation in insects be involved in doubt and obscurity, the
                    knowledge of those more interior faculties, which are the springs of voluntary
                    action, is hid in still deeper mystery. Buffon refuses to allow bees any portion
                    of intelligence, and contends that the actions we behold, however admirably they
                    are directed to certain ends, are in fact merely the results of their peculiar
                    mechanism. Other philosophers, such as Reaumur and Brougham <hi rend="italic"
                    >{Works,</hi> vol. vi.), have gone into the opposite extreme, and have
                    considered them as endued with extraordinary wisdom and foresight, as animated
                    by a disinterested patriotism, and as uniting a variety of moral and
                    intellectual qualities of a higher order. The truth, no doubt, lies between
                    these overstrained opinions; but it is nevertheless extremely difficult to
                    decide in what degree these respective principles operate in the production of
                    the effects we witness. The term <hi rend="italic">instinct</hi> should properly
                    be regarded, not as denoting a particular and definite principle of action,
                    whose operation we can anticipate in any new or untried combination of
                    circumstances, but as expressive of our inability to refer the phenomena we
                    contemplate to any previously known principle. Thus the actions which an animal
                    performs in obedience to the calls of appetite are not properly said to be
                    instinctive; nor can the term be applied to actions λvhich are the consequence
                    of acquired knowledge, and of which the object is with certainty foreseen by the
                    agent. But when an animal acts apparently under a blind impulse, and produces
                    effects useful to itself or to the species, which effects it could not have
                    previously contemplated as resulting from those actions, it is then customary to
                    say that it is under the guidance of instinct, that is, of some unknown
                    principle of action. It will be proper, therefore, to keep this distinction in
                    view in judging of the voluntary actions of the lower animals.</p>
                <p>In no department of natural history is it more necessary to be aware of the
                    proper import of the term instinct, than in studying the phenomena presented by
                    the bee; for nowhere is it more difficult to discriminate between the regular
                    operation of implanted motives and the result of acquired knowledge and habits.
                    The most striking feature of their history, and the one which apparently lays
                    the foundation for those extraordinary qualities which raise them above <pb
                    break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit03newyrich/page/n504/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0903-0504-0489"/> the level of other insects, is the disposition to
                    social union. It may in general, indeed, be remarked, that animals which
                    associate together so as to form large communities, display a higher degree of
                    sagacity than those which lead a solitary life. This is especially observable
                    among insects. The spidet and <hi rend="italic">Formica</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >leonis</hi> may exhibit, particular talents, or practise particular stratagems
                    in the pursuit and capture of their prey; but their history is limited to a
                    single generation, and embraces none of those interesting relations which exist
                    between individuals composing the gregarious tribes, such as the ant, the wasp,
                    and the bee. Among these we trace a community of wants and desires, and a mutual
                    intelligence and sympathy, which lead to the constant interchange of good
                    offices, and which, by introducing a systematic division of labour, amidst a
                    unity of design, leads to the execution of public works on a scale of
                    astonishing magnitude. The attachment of bees to their hive, which they defend
                    with a courage and self-devotion truly admirable, their jealousy of intruders,
                    their ready cooperation in all the labours required for the welfare of the
                    community, their tender care of their young, the affection and homage which they
                    bestow on their queen, imply qualities such as we could hardly persuade
                    ourselves could animate a mere insect, on which we are in the habit of proudly
                    looking down as placed in one of the lowest orders of created beings</p>
                <p>We shall content ourselves at present with these general observations, as the
                    instances which serve to illustrate their moral and intellectual character
                    belong properly to the history of the different processes they follow in the
                    construction of their combs, the hatching and rearing of their progeny, and the
                    mode of conducting their migrations. To these subjects, therefore, we shall now
                    proceed; and in order to present the most connected and complete account of
                    their economy, we shall begin the history from the period when a new swarm has
                    just occupied a hive, and when all the arrangements for their habitation, and
                    the construction of the cells in which their eggs and provisions are to be
                    deposited, are yet to be effected.</p>
                <p>The first care of the worker bees, on their settlement in their new abode, is to
                    clean it out thoroughly. While one set of bees is thus employed, another is
                    distributed about the country in order to procure the proper materials for
                    blocking up the small holes and chinks of the hive, and for laying a firm
                    foundation for the edifice which is to be constructed within it. The substance
                    which is principally employed in this preliminary stage is <hi rend="italic"
                    >propolis,</hi> a species of glutinous resin, of an agreeable aromatic odour,
                    and reddish-brown colour, in process of time becoming darker, and acquiring a
                    firmer consistence. According to the analysis of Vauquelin (J∕eτn. <hi
                    rend="italic">Soc. Agricult. Deρartem. Seine),</hi> it is composed chiefly of
                    resin, with a small proportion of wax, and of acid and aromatic principles. It
                    is soluble in alcohol, ether, and oils, both fixed and volatile, and tinges the
                    solvent of a beautiful red colour. Cadet has since ascertained in it the
                    presence of benzoic and gallic acids. Reaumur had not been able to discover from
                    what plants the bees collect this substance. Riem asserts that it is chiefly
                    from pines and other trees of the fir kind. The observations of Huber have
                    assisted in the solution of this question. On placing branches of the wild
                    poplar tree before the hive, he found that the bees eagerly seized upon the
                    varnish which exudes from the buds; and examining the chemical properties of
                    this varnish, he identified it with the propolis with which the inside of the
                    hive is lined.</p>
                <p>The propolis adheres so strongly to the legs and feet of the bee which has
                    collected it, that it cannot be detached without the assistance of its
                    fellow-labourers. For this purpose the bee that is loaded presents its legs to
                    the workers in the hive, which carry off with their iaws this adhesive
                    substance, and immediately apply it, while yet ductile, all round the interior
                    of the hive, and particularly over all the projecting parts; hence its name, of
                    Greek derivation, signifying <hi rend="italic">before the city.</hi> In like
                    manner all the foreign bodies that are introduced into the common habitation and
                    are too heavy for removal are covered over with this resinous substance. If a
                    snail, for instance, should happen to introduce itself into the hive, after
                    despatching it with their stings, they encrust it over with propolis.</p>
                <p>The next object of their labours is the construction of the combs, the future
                    receptacles for the eggs with which the queen is pregnant and which are row to
                    be laid. The material employed is wax; and the bees, for the purpose of
                    secreting this, are actively employed in collecting honey. When they have filled
                    their crops with honey they hang together in a thick cluster from the top of the
                    hive, and thus remain in a state of inactivity for a considerable period, during
                    which time the secretion of wax is proceeding. It may be seen collected in
                    laminae under the abdominal scales, whence it is removed by the hind legs of the
                    bee, transferred to the fore legs, and from thence taken up by the jaws. In this
                    operation they are often assisted by their companions, who even sometimes
                    directly seize upon the wax from under the abdomen of those who are before them.
                    When a sufficient quantity of material has thus been collected together, the
                    process of building is commenced; but in order to understand the subsequent
                    operations it is necessary to have a correct idea of the form of the cells which
                    compose the combs. We shall, therefore, proceed to give some account of the
                    structure when it has attained its perfect state.</p>
                <p>The combs of a bee-hive are formed in parallel vertical strata, each of which is
                    about an inch in thickness, the distance between the surfaces of adjoining
                    strata being about half an inch, a space which allows for the passage of the
                    bees over both surfaces. The combs generally extend the whole breadth of the
                    hive, and nearly the whole length from the top to the bottom. They consist of
                    thin partitions which enclose hexagonal cells, opening on both surfaces of the
                    comb and closed by a partition which is common to those on both sides, and
                    occupies the middle distance between the two surfaces. This partition is not,
                    however, a plane, but is composed of a collection of rhombs. Three and sometimes
                    four of these rhombs incline to one another at a certain angle from the bottom
                    of each cell, which thus has the shape of a flattened pyramid, of which the base
                    is towards the mouth of the cell. The geometric form of each individual cell is
                    therefore a hexagonal prism, terminated by a trihedral pyramid, the three sides
                    of which are rhombs which meet at the apex by their obtuse angles, and, forming
                    oblique angles with the sides of the prism, truncate a portion of these, and
                    convert them from rectangles, which they would be in a regular prism, into
                    trapeziums. Of the two angles of these trapeziums adjoining the base of the
                    pyramid one must be acute and the other obtuse, the acute angle of one trapezium
                    being next to the acute angle of the adjoining trapezium, and the obtuse angle
                    being in like manner next to another obtuse angle of the preceding trapezium; so
                    that in going round the base we meet with pairs of acute and of obtuse angles
                    alternately succeeding each other. The two adjoining acute angles of the
                    trapezium are adjoining to two of the terminal rhombs which here present their
                    acute angles, so that at these points a solid angle of four planes is formed,
                    all the angles being acute. Each pair of obtuse angles of the trapezia, on the
                    other hand, are adjacent to the obtuse angle of one of the rhombs only, thus
                    composing a solid angle of three planes of which the angles are all obtuse: and
                    these two kinds of solid angles succeed one another <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit03newyrich/page/n505/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0903-0505-0490"/> alternately all round the base of the pyramid,
                    there being three of each kind and six in all. The axis of each cell coincides
                    not with the axis of the cell on the opposite surface, but with one of its
                    angles; so that each of the three obtuse angles at the base of the terminal
                    pyramid corresponds to the central parts of three of the cells on the opposite
                    side, and each of the sides of the pyramid which closes a cell on one side
                    contributes in part to the enclosing of three of the cells on the opposite side.
                    We may easily satisfy ourselves that such is the case by piercing the centres of
                    each of the three planes which close the bottom of a cell with a pin, when on
                    turning the comb the three pins will be found to have passed into three
                    different cells on the opposite side.</p>
                <p>A structure of this kind is obviously the one of all others calculated to afford
                    the greatest space for each cell with the same quantity of materials. It is easy
                    to perceive, in the first place, that in a plane surface, when a number of small
                    spaces are to be divided by partitions, the hexagonal form is the one which
                    comprehends the largest space compatible with the extent of the lines which
                    enclose them; for the equilateral triangle, the square, and the regular hexagon,
                    are the only regular forms that admit of being joined together in the same plane
                    without leaving interstices; and the proportion of the area to the periphery in
                    every polygon increases as the figure consists of a greater number of sides, and
                    is, therefore, greater in the hexagon than in either of the other two. The truth
                    of this proposition was perceived by Pappus; and even its application to the
                    subject of the honeycomb was made by that ancient geometrician. But the
                    determination of the form and inclination that should be given to the partitions
                    that close the bottom of the cells, and which may, of course, belong equally to
                    those on both sides of the comb, is a problem much more complicated and
                    difficult of solution. It has exercised the skill of several modern
                    mathematicians of great eminence. Reaumur proposed to König, pupil of the
                    celebrated Bernouilli, and an expert analyst, the solution of the problem :—To
                    find the construction of a hexagonal prism terminated by a pyramid composed of
                    three equal and similar rhombs (and the whole of given capacity), such that the
                    solid may be made with the least possible quantity of materials;—which in other
                    words was asking him to determine the angles of the rhombs that should cut the
                    hexagonal prism so as to form with it the figure of the least possible surface,
                    since the hexagon being given, this decided both their dimensions and their
                    intersections with the sides of the cell. Maraldi had previously measured the
                    angles of the rhombus and found them to be 109° 28' and 70 <hi
                    rend="superscript"> n</hi> 32' respectively; but König was not aware of this
                    until after he had solved the problem, and assigned 109° 26' and 70° 34' as the
                    angles, when he had sent him the <hi rend="italic">Memoirs of the Academy of
                    Science for</hi> 1712, containing Maraldi’s paper; and König was equally
                    surprised and pleased to find how nearly the actual measurement agreed with the
                    result of his investigation. The measurement of Maraldi is correct, and the bees
                    have, with rigorous accuracy, solved the problem, for the error turns out to be
                    in König’s solution. The construction of cells, then, is demonstrated to be such
                    that no other that could be conceived would take so little material and labour
                    to afford the s⅛me room.</p>
                <p>Boscovich, who has also given a solution of the same problem, supposes that the
                    equality of inclination of the planes gives greater facility to the construction
                    of the comb, and might, therefore, be a motive of preference, independently Qf
                    the greater economy of wax. Maclaurin has offered a solution of this problem,
                    and has demonstrated by simple geometry, that the most advantageous form is that
                    which results from the supposed equality of the three plane angles forming the
                    solid angles at the base. He estimates the saving of wax by partition so
                    constructed, above what would be required for a flat partition, at onefourth of
                    the wax which would be wanted to complete the truncated sides of the cells, so
                    as to form them into rectangles. LΗuillier, in the <hi rend="italic">Memoirs of
                    the Berlin Academy,</hi> has given a demonstration which is remarkable for its
                    simplicity, and for its involving none but elementary propositions; he values
                    the economy of wax at - <hi rend="subscript"> κ</hi><hi rend="superscript">
                    1</hi><hi rend="subscript"> r</hi> of the whole wax employed. Le Sage, as
                    appears from the life of that philosopher by Professor Prevost, has shown that
                    this celebrated problem reduces itself to the finding of the angle at which two
                    planes with a given inclination (such as 120°) can be cut by a third plane, so
                    as to make all the angles resulting from the section equal to one another.</p>
                <p>But a more essential advantage than even the economy of wax results from this
                    structure, namely, that the whole fabric has much greater strength than if it
                    were composed of planes at right angles to one another; and when we consider the
                    weight they have to support when stored with honey, pollen, and the young brood,
                    besides that of the bees themselves, it is evident that strength is a material
                    requisite in the work.</p>
                <p>It has often been a subject of wonder how such diminutive insects could have
                    adopted and adhered to so regular a plan of architecture, and what principles
                    can actuate so great a multitude to co-operate, by the most effectual and
                    systematic mode, in its completion. Buffon has endeavoured to explain the
                    hexagonal form by the uniform pressure of a great number of bees all working at
                    the same time, exerted equally in all directions in a limited space; and
                    illustrates his theory by supposing a number of similar cylinders compressed
                    together, and taking the form of hexagonal prisms by the uniform expansion of
                    each. The analogy of the forms produced by the law of crystallization,—of the
                    figures assumed by various organs in the animal and vegetable world, such as the
                    skin of the bat, and the inner coat of the second stomach of ruminant
                    quadrupeds,—is also adduced by this captivating but superficial writer in
                    support of his argument. But however plausible this theory may at first sight
                    appear, it will not stand the test of a serious examination. The explanation he
                    has attempted applies no further than to the inclination of the sides of the
                    cells; but he did not take into account, perhaps from not having studied the
                    subject mathematically, the inclinations and forms of the planes which close
                    each cell, and so curiously conspire on both sides to serve a similar office,
                    while they at the same time accurately fulfil a refined geometrical condition.
                    But it is sufficient confutation of the whole theory to show, that it is
                    directly at variance with the actual process employed by the insects in the
                    construction of their combs.</p>
                <p>It might be supposed that bees had been provided by nature with instruments for
                    building of a form somewhat analogous to the angles of the cells; but in no
                    part, either of the teeth, antennae, or feet, can any such correspondence be
                    traced. Their shape in no respect answers to that of the rhombs, which are
                    constructed by their means, any more than the chisel of the sculptor resembles
                    the statue which it has carved. The shape of the head is indeed triangular, but
                    its three angles are acute, and are different from that of the planes of the
                    cells. The form of the plates of wax, as they are moulded in the pouches in
                    which this substance is secreted, is an irregular pentagon, in no respect
                    affording a model for any of the parts which compose the honeycomb. Hunter,
                    observing that the thickness of the partition was nearly equal to that of the
                    scale of wax, thought that the bees apply these scales immediately to the
                    formation of the partition, by merely cementing them together. Reaumur,
                    notwithstanding the use of glass hives, had not been able to discover the
                    mystery of their process <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit03newyrich/page/n506/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0903-0506-0491"/> of architecture, but inferred, from what he saw,
                    that the wax was rejected from the stomach in the form of a white frothy liquor.
                    No naturalist, indeed, prior to Huber, had been able to follow these insects in
                    their labours, on account of their crowding together in a thick mass while they
                    are building; but the expedients resorted to by that philosopher have unfolded
                    the whole process, which he has given with great detail in the second volume of
                    his <hi rend="italic">Observations</hi><hi rend="italic">sur</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">les</hi><hi rend="italic">Abeilles.</hi> Huber witnessed the whole
                    of their actions, and saw that each bee drew out, with its hind feet, one of the
                    plateβ of wax from under the scale where it was lodged, and carrying it to the
                    mouth in a vertical position, turned it round, so that every part of its edge
                    was made to pass in succession under the cutting edge of the jaws; it was thus
                    soon divided into very small fragments, while at the same time a frothy liquor
                    was poured upon it from the tongue, so as to form it into a perfectly plastic
                    mass. This liquor gave the "wax a whiteness and opacity which it did not possess
                    originally, and rendered it at the same time tenacious and ductile. A quantity
                    of wax thus prepared for use is accumulated, and applied to further the work in
                    the manner we are presently to describe.</p>
                <p>But, in considering the process by which the comb is formed, a circumstance
                    should be pointed out, which seems not to have been particularly noticed by any
                    author except Huber, and yet it is one of essential importance in studying this
                    process of architecture, namely, that the cells in the outside row on each side
                    are of a form very different from those of the subsequent rows. As they take
                    their origin from a plane surface, two of the sides necessary to complete the
                    hexagon are cut off by this plane, so that the general fotm of the orifice is
                    pentagonal; and the bottom of the cells on one side is composed of two equal
                    rhombs only, and on the other side of two trapezoidal planes, with one rhomb.
                    Such a modification of shape was necessary, in order to prepare the way for the
                    regularly-formed cells which were to follow.</p>
                <p>The foundations of the combs are laid by the bees raising a solid block or plate
                    of wax of a semicircular form. In this they scoop out a small vertical channel,
                    of the size of an ordinary cell. The sides of this channel are then strengthened
                    by additions of wax. On the opposite side two other channels are formed, one on
                    each side of the plane opposite to the former channel. The extremities of these
                    channels, which at first present a curved outline, are then fashioned into
                    straight walls, forming an angle at each vertex. The bottom of each cell being
                    thus sketched out, the design is completed by raising walls round the sides.
                    Different bees generally work on the opposite sides at the same time, and appear
                    to have some perception of the thickness of the partitions, and of the situation
                    of the opposite walls, in which they are perhaps guided by slight prominences,
                    occasioned by the depressions which correspond to them on the other side; and
                    they scrape off the wax in those places where its thickness is greatest, that
                    is, where the bees on the other side had accumulated materials. In this way,
                    then, in constructing the successive rows, the axis of each cell will be found
                    to occupy the most retiring parts of the partition, and will be opposite to the
                    junction of three of the opposite cells.</p>
                <p>Soon after the bees have completed the foundations, and constructed a few of the
                    cells of the central comb, they begin two others, one on each side, at the
                    proper distance, and in this manner continue to form others in succession, in
                    proportion as the former are advanced. Their object at first seems to be to
                    extend the surface of the work so as to admit of the greatest possible number of
                    workers being employed at one and the same time. In this way, then, the work
                    proceeds from all points at once, new cells being begun before the former are
                    completed, so that the whole comb, while it is in progress of construction, has
                    a semi-lenticular shape, broader at the top, and tapering below and towards the
                    sides. It extends downwards, however, more rapidly than in any other direction,
                    and its surfaces do not become parallel to each other till the last stage of the
                    building process. When this is completed, the whole is further strengthened by
                    an additional coating of propolis round the margin of all the cells; and the
                    junctions of every plane, both of the sides and bottoms of the cells, are also
                    soldered together by a lining of the same substance. The edges of the combs are
                    also secured in their situations by being glued to the side of the hive and
                    supported by fresh abutments of propolis. Sometimes a mixture of wax and
                    propolis, manufactured by the bees themselves, is employed as the cementing
                    material. The first coating of this compound substance is denominated <hi
                    rend="italic">Commosis</hi> by Pliny, and described as having a bitter taste;
                    the second, or the <hi rend="italic">Pissoceros</hi> of the same author, is
                    stated to be of a thinner consistence, and more adhesive than the former, while
                    the third substance, or <hi rend="italic">Propolis,</hi> is completely
                    solid.</p>
                <p>The cells recently constructed are white, but become gradually darker, and, when
                    very ancient, are almost black. It is therefore easy to distinguish in a hive
                    the successive periods of formation of different portions of the combs. From the
                    researches of Huber, it appears that these varia tions of colour are not owing
                    to any changes in the wax itself, but to additional coatings of a peculiar
                    varnish, consisting of propolis and a colouring matter. The latter differs
                    materially from propolis, being wholly insoluble in alcohol. It loses its colour
                    by the action of nitric acid or the light of the sun. Its origin has not yet
                    been discovered, nor has the mode in which it is applied been clearly made out,
                    although Huber presumes, from his observation, that the bees spread it by means
                    of their mandibles, since he has seen them rub these against the sides of the
                    cells, and noticed that they acquired a yellow colour from the operation.</p>
                <p>Royal cells are only formed when it is necessary that queens should be reared,
                    either from their being required to lead off swarms, or from the fact of the
                    colony being queenless through accidental circumstances.</p>
                <p>The comb of the hive may be said to be the furniture and storehouse of the bees,
                    which by use must wear out; but, independently of this, it will in time become
                    unfit for use, by the accumulation of cocoons, which are never removed. These
                    line the whole cell, sides, and bottom. Hunter counted above twenty different
                    linings in one cell, and found the cell about one-quarter or one-third filled
                    up.</p>
                <p>Lord Brougham made some interesting observations on the cells of bees. By boiling
                    the comb in alcohol after it had been bred in, he succeeded in dissolving the
                    wax, leaving the lining only, which was found to be an extremely thin
                    transparent or semi-transparent film, resembling goldbeaters’ skin, without a
                    wrinkle. The linings from old celle with thick walls kept the shape of the cells
                    most distinctly. They had angles and planes as well defined as those of wax in
                    the new comb, but they did not consist of a single film like the cells where one
                    brood only had been raised. They had one film within another, and could be
                    separated, so that as many as five or six could be extricated from the same
                    cell; each of these had the hexagon form, and the first two, and sometimes
                    three, had the rhomboidal form of the base also, but the innermost ones had the
                    rhombuses less and less distinctly marked, till the last one or two of all had
                    spherical instead of pyramidal bases. The film adhered so closely to the wax as
                    to defend it from the action of the solvent and even from that of heat,
                    preventing it from melting for a considerable time. The film fitted the wax
                    cells so completely that there never was found the least wrinkle or laxity, each
                    being tensely <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit03newyrich/page/n507/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0903-0507-0492"/> stretched in all its parts without any interval
                    in any part. The whole of each cell was one entire piece of film going all round
                    the prism and all through the pyramid without any breach, section, or joining;
                    neither maceration nor even boiling in turpentine, ether, or caustic potash had
                    any effect on the film. *</p>
                <p>A film of the same substance, transparent but considerably thicker, was found to
                    line the queen-cells, assuming the pear or flask-like shape of the wax, and a
                    very remarkable fact was observed. The film was not always in the inside; it
                    sometimes lay imbedded in the wax, at least a layer of wax was laid over it of
                    sensible thickness, indeed considerably thicker than some plates of the common
                    cell, and sometimes much thicker. As a queen-cell is never used but once, never
                    more than a single film can be found iu it. How this lining is formed has never
                    been satisfactorily determined, but it must be in one of two ways, —either by
                    the larva forming a cocoon round itself and of an oblong figure inside,
                    sufficient to contain it when it changes its position from a coil perpendicular
                    to the axis of the cell into an oblong worm placed in the axis, or by the larva
                    lining the walls of the cell. In the former case the cocoon, originally made
                    somewhat of the shape of the larva, must afterwards be applied by it or by the
                    chrysalis so as to line and adhere to the walls; in the latter case the walls
                    are lined at first by the act of weaving or spinning. But there are difficulties
                    attending both these hypotheses and the inferences to w hich they
                    lead—inferences in either case as extraordinary, to say the least, as anything
                    observed in the economy of the bee. If the cocoon is formed loose and round,
                    then, when the transformation takes place, the pupa must press against every
                    part of the cell, so as to apply the film all round and equally in every part.
                    The extraordinary part is the perfect adaptation of the cocoon to the cell.
                    There is no wrinkle whatever. It fits exactly in every part, both the planes and
                    the dihedral angles and the trihedral angles. The extreme fineness of the
                    texture may facilitate its fitting so many different shapes. But how is the size
                    sufficient and not more than sufficient in any one place? If w e only consider
                    what extreme complexity and difficulty there would be in forming a cocoon—which
                    should increase at every hair’s breadth, and increase in a ratio varying at
                    different points, and should, on reaching its maximum size, continue afterwards
                    stationary in dimensions—we shall be convinced how insuperable the difficulties
                    of the workmanship would be to any artist ever so expert or careful. But even
                    this is not all, for as the web is to be afterwards by the supposition applied
                    to the circumscribed walls, the extent of the curved surface of the cocoon
                    inscribed must be less than that of the surface which it is afterwards to line
                    if that curve is wholly concave to the axis, in other words, if it have no
                    points of contrary flexure. In order, therefore, that it may be exactly equal to
                    the walls which it is to fit exactly, the cocoon must be of a form wholly
                    different from that of the larva that made it. It must be convex at some points
                    and concave at others to the larva; it must be loose and baggy, and the progress
                    of its bagging or being loose must vary at every point in order that when
                    applied to the walls it may exactly fit them at every part. The performance of
                    such a work by the larva appears scarcely conceivable. Astonishing as the known
                    and ascertained works of the perfect insect are, this would surpass them in a
                    proportion that might almost be called infinite. If we adopt the second
                    inference, we get rid entirely of the former difficulty; for the operation of
                    forming the film upon the walls is certainly much more easy. With the utmost
                    nicety and precision, there is never a break to be found, and there is no part
                    thicker than the rest, so that but one layer is applied everywhere; and the
                    larva knows so accurately where it has begun as always to leave off on coming
                    round to that point without ever going again over the same ground for half a
                    hair’s breadth. The material is also very remarkable. A very high magnifying
                    power shows no threads or separate pieces of any kind; in the great bulk of the
                    texture, it is for the most part solid and perfectly transparent. There are
                    interspersed irregularly a few fibres, but it should seem as if the whole was a
                    mucilage spread over the walls rather than any webs of woven threads. But though
                    the difficulties attending the other theory are not found in this, it has
                    difficulties of a different kind and equally startling. The first that strikes
                    us immediately is the use of the cocoon formed on the waxen walls. The cell was
                    already made, and of the required form and dimensions, in which the larva could
                    be lodged and grow and undergo its transformations. How was the lining it with
                    the film to assist the process <hi rend="italic">1 If</hi> the cocoon had been
                    of another form and wrapt round the larva, it might have served some such
                    purpose of covering or support; but here the cocoon exactly fits the cell and in
                    nowise alters its form, and only by an exceedingly small portion its capacity.
                    And how are the second and subsequent cocoons to be accounted for? The cell had
                    been already completely lined with the film, and the additional lining could add
                    nothing to the advantage, whatever it was, which the first lining gave the larva
                    and chrysalis. (See Brougham’s <hi rend="italic">Works,</hi> vol. vi. pp.
                    312-364.)</p>
                <p>Such is the general outline of the architectural labours of the bee. A number of
                    modifications are, however, met with, adapting them to various purposes and to
                    new circumstances. The cells are required to be of different sizes for the
                    nurture of different sorts of larvae. The smallest, which are also the most
                    numerous, are appropriated to the larvae of the working bees; a larger sort
                    receive those of the males; and a small number of very large cells are destined
                    for the education of the young queens, and are therefore called royal cells. The
                    first set are generally five and one-third lines in depth, and two and a half in
                    diameter; the second are from seven to seven and a half lines in depth, and
                    three and three-fourths in diameter; while the royal cells are above one inch
                    deep, one-third of an inch wide, and their walls are much thicker than those of
                    any other cells. Other cells, again, are set apart as magazines of honey or of
                    pollen; they are made deeper than the common cells, sometimes as deep as two
                    inches, and their axes are inclined to the horizon, so that their mouths are in
                    the highest part, that their liquid contents may be more easily retained. When
                    these are filled they are closed up by the bee3 with a wall of wax, and opened
                    only when necessity requires.</p>
                <p>The regularity of the cells is often disturbed in consequence of the admixture of
                    rows of larger cells with those of smaller dimensions; but the pyramidal
                    partitions are adapted by successive gradations to these changes, so that in
                    many rows of what may be called cells of transition, the bottom presents four
                    planes instead of three, two being trapeziums, and the other two irregular
                    hexagons. These irregularities are met with chiefly in the combs most distant
                    from the central one. When an abundant supply of honey induces the bees to lay
                    up a large quantity in store, they build up for this purpose the walls of common
                    cells, so as to give them a greater depth. The royal cells are often raised from
                    the ruins of a number of other cells, which are destroyed to make room for them;
                    they are usually built on the edge of some of the shorter combs, and often in
                    the very centre of the hive. Sometimes there is but one; at other times as many
                    as sixteen have been counted in the same hive. They are formed of a mixture of
                    propolis and wax; their form is oblong, resembling that of a pear; their
                    position is always vertical, so that <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit03newyrich/page/n508/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0903-0508-0493"/> when they rise from the midst of other cells,
                    they are placed against the mouths of those cells, and project beyond the common
                    surface of the comb. They are perfectly smooth on the inner surface, while their
                    outer side is covered with a kind of hexagonal fret-w ork, as if intended for
                    the foundation of regular cells.</p>
                <p>The impregnation of the queen-bee was formerly involved in the deepest obscurity,
                    and has given rise to a multitude of very fanciful opinions. Some have denied
                    that any intercourse with the male was necessary for the fecundation of the
                    eggs. Swammerdam supposed that the mere effluvia proceeding from the males w
                    here they were collected in clusters was sufficiently active to produce thiβ
                    effect by penetrating the body of the female. Huber proved by decisive
                    experiment that no such consequence resulted from these effluvia. Maraldi
                    imagined that the eggs were fecundated by the drones after being deposited in
                    the cells in the same way that the spawn of fishes is rendered prolific by the
                    milt. Mr Debraw of Cambridge gave an account, in a paper published in the <hi
                    rend="italic">Philosophical Transactions,</hi> of a milk-like fluid he had seen
                    in the cells. But this appearance Huber show ed to be a mere optical illusion
                    arising from the reflection of light at the bottom of the cells. When the males
                    are excluded from the hive the queen is as fertile and the eggs as prolific as
                    when they are present. Hattorff supposed that the queen is capable of
                    impregnating herself, an opinion which was supported by Schirach and Wilhelmi,
                    and w as even favourably received by Bonnet, as it in some measure accorded with
                    his discoveries respecting the aphis. Linnaeus was of opinion that an actual
                    union between the sexes took place, and Reaumur fancied he had seen this happen
                    within the hive. There is, however, great reason to think he was mistaken. It
                    has since been clearly proved that copulation takes place in the air during
                    flight, and if the queen is confined to the hive either by bad weather, or
                    malformation or mutilation of her wings, although she may be surrounded by
                    drones, she never becomes impregnated; and if she does not find a mate within
                    three weeks of her birth, the power of sexual intercourse seems to become lost.
                    If a hive containing a virgin queen be attentively watched on fine days the
                    queen will be observed preparing for her matrimonial flight, and after having
                    attentively surveyed her home so as to be able to recognize it again she flies
                    to a considerable height in the air; and if her errand is successful, in half an
                    hour she returns to the hive with unequivocal proofs of the intercourse that has
                    taken place, for she has in fact robbed the drone of the organs concerned in
                    this operation; and the drone, thus mutilated, is left to perish on the ground.
                    From its being necessary that the queen should fly to a distance in order to be
                    impregnated, Huber infers the necessity of a great number of drones being
                    attached to the hive, that there may be a sufficient chance of her meeting one
                    of them during her aerial excursion.</p>
                <p>The phenomenon that sometimes occurred in a bee-hive, of the queen laying eggs
                    that produced males only, had for ages puzzled philosophers without any
                    satisfactory solution, and it was reserved for Dzierzon to promulgate a new and
                    startling theory of reproduction, which, in the -words of its distinguished
                    author, is said to have “explained all the phenomena of the bee-hive as
                    perfectly as the Copernican hypothesis the phenomena of the heavens.” Dzierzon
                    first expressed his views upon the reproduction of bees in the year 1845. The
                    principal points of this theory may be shortly expressed thus :—l∙s√, That the
                    queen (female bee), to become good for anything (ι.e., to breed <hi
                    rend="italic">workers},</hi> must be fertilized by a drone (the male), and that
                    the copulation takes place only in the air; that drone eggs do not require
                    fecundation, but that the co-operation of the drone is absolutely necessary when
                    worker bees are to be produced; that in copulation the ovaries are not
                    fecundated, but the seminal receptacle (or spermatheca), a little vesicle or sac
                    opening into the oviduct, which in the young queen is filled with a limpid
                    fluid, is saturated with semen, after which it is more clearly distinguishable
                    from its white colour; and that the supply of semen received during copulation
                    is sufficient for her whole lifetime. The copulation takes place once for all,
                    and (as already stated) only in the open air; therefore no queen -which has been
                    lame in her -wings from birth can ever be perfectly fertile, that is, capable of
                    producing both sexes, as copulation never takes place in the interior of the
                    hive. <hi rend="italic">2d,</hi> All eggs which come to maturity in the ovaries
                    of a queen-bee are only of one and the same kind, and when they are laid without
                    coming in contact with the male semen, become developed into male bees. This
                    theory of Dzierzon’s has since been amply confirmed by numberless experiments,
                    although what power the queen possesses (or how she exercises it) of determining
                    what eggβ shall receive fecundation and what not, is yet a mystery. Certain it
                    is that when the queen lays an egg in a drone cell, a drone is produced; and Von
                    Siebold, who made many most skilful microscopical examinations of eggs, affirms
                    that among fifty-two eggs taken from worker cells, examined by him w ith the
                    greatest care and conscientiousness, thirty-four furnished a positive result,
                    namely, the existence of seminal filaments, in which movements could even be
                    detected in three eggs; and among twenty-seven eggs from drone cells, examined
                    with the same care and by the same method, he did not find one seminal filament
                    in any single egg either externally or internally. On the passage of the eggs
                    from the ovary through the oviduct they pass the opening of the spermatheca,
                    from which some egg3 receive a portion of the seminal fluid,—these produce
                    workers; other eggs pass without receiving the fluid,—these produce drones. What
                    it is that governs the deposition or non-deposition of the seminal fluid on the
                    egg is unknown. It has been suggested that the smaller diameter of the worker
                    cells exerts some mechanical pressure on the queen’s organs, which may cause the
                    seminal fluid to be extruded as the egg passes, while the drone cells being
                    larger this pressure Î3 not by them exerted, and the <hi rend="italic">egg</hi>
                    passes unfecundated. If the spermatheca of an impregnated queen be examined
                    under the microscope its contents will be found to contain many thousands of
                    spermatozoa, the characteristic movements of which are very visible. The
                    contents of the spermatheca of a virgin or drone-breeding queen, similarly
                    examined, will be found a limpid fluid only without a trace of spermatozoa.</p>
                <p>The fact that the eggs of an unimpregnated queen will hatch and produce drones
                    may be easily verified, and is now undisputed. By depriving a colony of its
                    queen late in the year, a young queen will be reared; and the drones having been
                    killed long before, no impregnation can take place, yet the queen -will
                    infallibly lay eggs which hatch into drones; these eggs are laid
                    indiscriminately in drone and worker cells, the bees bred in the latter being
                    stunted in their growth. If now the spermatheca be examined, no spermatozoa will
                    be found present. The same result wi l be found if, in the summer, the virgin
                    queen be deprived of her wings and so made unable to fly.</p>
                <p>If the impregnation of the queen be delayed beyond, as elsewhere stated, the
                    twenty-first day of her life, she becomes Incapable of receiving impregnation,
                    and begins soon after to lay the eggs of drones, and produces no other kind of
                    eggs during her life. This very curious and unexpected fact was discovered by
                    Huber; and has been satisfactorily established by his very numerous and varied
                    experiments, although its explanation is perhaps <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit03newyrich/page/n509/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0903-0509-0494"/> attended with insuperable difficulties. The
                    abdomen of a queen that is unimpregnated is much more slender than that of one
                    which is completely fertile; but, on dissection, the ovaries are found expanded
                    and full of ova.</p>
                <p>One of the most remarkable facts concerning the generation of bees, is the
                    existence occasionally of prolific workers, the discovery of which we owe to
                    Keims. Although it was doubted by Bonnet, its reality has been fully confirmed
                    &lt;jy the researches of Huber and subsequent observers, and it explains what
                    was before inexplicable—the production of eggs in hives absolutely destitute of
                    a queen. It is also remarkable that the eggs thus produced are always those of
                    drones, but this is explained by the fact that these fertile workers have not
                    received, and, in fact, are unable to receive, impregnation from the drone. The
                    origin of these abnormal egg-layers is accounted for from their having passed
                    the larva state in cells contiguous to the royal ones, and from their having at
                    an early period devoured some portion of the stimulating jelly which was
                    destined for the nourishment of the royal brood, their ovaries thus receiving a
                    partial development; or when a colony is deprived of its queen late in the
                    autumn, and an attempt to raise a queen from some unknown cause has failed, a
                    larva has sufficiently advanced to develop into a fertile worker.</p>
                <p>As soon as a sufficient number of cells have been constructed, the queen begins
                    to deposit her eggs. Unlike most insects the queen-bee deposits eggs ten or
                    eleven months in the year in temperate climates, although it is probable this is
                    not the case when the winter is much more severe than in Britain. Young queens
                    ordinarily commence ovipositing thirty-six hours after impregnation. What power,
                    if any, the queen has in determining the sex of her eggs is unknown, but, as
                    already noticed, eggs that will produce workers or queens will always be found
                    laid in worker cells, and those that will produce drones will also be found in
                    their appropriate cells. A queen of a new swarm will rarely produce drones the
                    first year; instinct, seemingly, teaching her they will not be required. In the
                    early spring, if a clean empty piece of drone comb be put into the centre of the
                    brood nest, the queen will usually fill it with drone eggs, and this
                    circumstance is taken advantage of by scientific apiarians to secure a supply of
                    drones for the impregnation of early hatched queens. When the eggs are about to
                    hatch, the bees eagerly seek for that species of nourishment on which the larvae
                    are to be fed. This consists of pollen with a proportion of honey and water,
                    which is partly digested in the stomach of the bees, and made to vary in its
                    quality according to the age of the young. The egg of a bee is of a lengthened
                    oval shape with a slight curvature and of a bluish white colour. It is hatched
                    without requiring any particular attention on the part of the bees, except that
                    a proper temperature be kept up, in which case three days are sufficient for the
                    exclusion of the larva. This has the appearance of a small white worm without
                    feet, which remains generally coiled up at the bottom of the cell. The bees feed
                    it with great assiduity with the kind of chyle above described, and in every
                    respect exhibit towards it the greatest care and attention. Hunter says a young
                    bee might easily be brought up by any person who would be attentive to feed it.
                    As it grows up it casts its cuticle like the larvae of other insects. In the
                    course of five or six days it has attained its full size, and nearly fills the
                    cell in which it is lodged. - It now ceases to eat, and the bees close up its
                    cell with a covering of wax, or rather an admixture of wax and propolis, which
                    they possess the art of amalgamat-mg. During the next thirty-six hours the larva
                    is engaged in spinning its cocoon, and in three days more it assumes the pupa
                    state. It is now’ perfectly white, and every part of the future bee may be
                    distinguished through its transparent covering. In the course of a week it tears
                    asunder its investing membrane, and makes its way through the outer wall of its
                    prison in its perfect form. Beckoning from the time that the egg is laid, it is
                    only on the twenty-first day of its existence that this last metamorphosis is
                    completed. No sooner has it thus emancipated itself than its guardians assemble
                    round it, caress it with their tongues, and supply it plentifully with food.
                    They clean out the cell which it had been occupying, leaving untouched, however,
                    the greater part of the web, which thus serves to bind together still more
                    firmly the sides of the comb. The colour of the bee when it quits the cell is a
                    light grey. For several days, sometimes a week or two after birth, the worker
                    bees occupy themselves within the hive, not flying abroad during that time,
                    their principal employment then being that of nurses; and many old observers
                    thought them a different class altogether from the honey-gatherers and
                    wax-makers. The metamorphosis of the male bee follows the same course, but
                    requires four days longer for its completion, occupying tw enty-five days from
                    the time of the egg being laid to the attainment of the perfect state.</p>
                <p>When from the egg or young larva it is the intention of the bees to raise a
                    queen, their attention is more incessantly bestowed upon it, the cell being
                    enlarged as elsewhere described. It is supplied with a peculiar kind of food,
                    which appears to be more stimulating than that of ordinary bees. It has not the
                    same mawkish taste, and is evidently acid. It is furnished to the royal larva in
                    greater quantities than can be consumed, so that a portion always remains behind
                    in the cell after the transformation. As a proof that any worker egg or young
                    larva not more than three days old may be made to produce a queen, the
                    experimenter has only to supply to such an one a portion of royal jelly, and the
                    nurses will enlarge its cell and continue so to feed it, when in due time a
                    queen will be produced. The growth of the larva and the development of all its
                    organs are very much accelerated by this treatment, so that in five days it is
                    prepared to spin its web, and the bees enclose it by building up a wall at the
                    mouth of its cell. The web is completed in twenty-four hours; two days and a
                    half are spent in a state of inaction, and then the larva transforms itself into
                    a pupa. It remains between four and five days in this state, and thus on the
                    sixteenth day after the egg has been laid, the perfect insect is produced. When
                    this change is about to take place, the bees gnaw away part of the wax covering
                    of the cell till at last it becomes pellucid from its extreme thinness. This not
                    only must facilitate the exit of the bee, but may possibly be useful in
                    permitting the evaporation of the superabundant fluids.</p>
                <p>But the queen bee, although perfectly formed, is not always at liberty to come
                    out of her prison, for if the queen-mother be still in the hive waiting a
                    favourable state of the weather to lead forth another swarm, the bees do not
                    suffer the young queens to stir out; they even strengthen the covering of the
                    cell by an additional coating of wax, perforating it with a small hole through
                    which the prisoner can thrust out her tongue in order to be fed by those who
                    guard her. The royal prisoners continually utter a kind of plaintive cry, called
                    by bee-keepers “piping,” and this appears to be answered by the mother queen.
                    The modulatione of this piping are said to vary. The motive of this proceeding
                    on the part of the bees who guard them is to be found in the implacable hatred
                    which the old queen bears against all those of her own sex, and which impels her
                    to destroy without mercy all the young queens that come within her reach. The
                    workers are on this account very solicitous to prevent her even approaching the
                    royal cells while there is any prospect of a swarm being about <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit03newyrich/page/n510/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0903-0510-0495"/> to issue. They establish themselves as a guard
                    around these cells; and, forgetting their allegiance on this occasion, actually
                    beat her off as often as she endeavours to come near them. If, on the other
                    hand, the swarming season is over, or circumstances prevent any further swarms
                    from being sent off, the bees do not interpose any obstacle to the fury of the
                    old queen, which immediately begins the work of destruction, transfixing with
                    her sting one after the other the whole of the royal brood, while they are yet
                    confined in their cells. It is observed by Huber, that the royal larvae
                    construct only imperfect cocoons, open behind, and enveloping only the head,
                    thorax, and first ring of the abdomen; and he conceives that the intention of
                    Nature in this apparent imperfection is, that they may be exposed to the mortal
                    sting of the queen, to whom they may be given up as a sacrifice.</p>
                <p>When the old queen has taken her departure along with the first swarm, the young
                    queens are liberated in succession, at intervals of a few days, in order to
                    prevent their attacking and destroying one another, which would be the
                    infallible consequence of their meeting. This exterminating warfare is prevented
                    by the vigilance of the bees which guard them, so long as new swarms are
                    expected to go off. When a young queen is liberated, she is, like others of her
                    sex, anxious to get rid of her rivals, and even at that early age seeks to
                    destroy her sisters, which are still confined in the other royal cells; but as
                    often as she approaches them she is bit, pulled, and chased without ceremony by
                    the sentinels. But when the season is too far advanced for swarming, or if two
                    or more queens should happen to emerge at the same moment, they mutually seek
                    each other and fight till one is killed, and the survivor is immediately
                    received as the sovereign of the hive. The bees, far from seeking to prevent
                    these battles, appear to excite the combatants against each other, surrounding
                    and bringing them back to the charge when they are disposed to recede from each
                    other, and when either of the queens shows a disposition to approach her
                    antagonist, all the bees forming the cluster instantly give way to allow her
                    full liberty for the attack. The first use which the conquering queen makes of
                    her victory is to secure herself against fresh dangers by destroying all her
                    future rivals in the royal cells; while the other bees, which are spectators of
                    the carnage, share in the spoil, greedily devouring any food which may be found
                    at the bottom of the cells, and even sucking the fluid from the abdomen of the
                    pupae before they toss out the carcasses.</p>
                <p>We are now to direct our attention to the migrations of bees, by w hich new
                    colonies similar to that which had originally peopled the parent hive are
                    founded. The final causes of this phenomenon are sufficiently obvious, but it
                    does not so clearly appear to what circumstances it is immediately owing. The
                    increasing population of a hive probably occasions inconvenience from want of
                    room; the increase of heat and the greater vitiation of the air become still
                    more serious as the summer advances. The spring is, accordingly, the
                    commencement of the swarming season. No swarming, indeed, will ever take place
                    while the weather is cold, or until the hive is well stocked with eggs. The
                    queen-bee, in consequence of the great number of eggs she has been laying, is
                    now reduced to a more slender shape, and is well fitted for flight; her aversion
                    for the royal brood, which she seems to foresee will in a short time become able
                    to dispute the throne with her, and the vain attempts she makes to destroy them
                    in the cradle, in which attempts she is invariably repelled by the bees who
                    guard them, produce in her a constant restlessness and agitation which, as Huber
                    represents it, rises to a degree of delirium. This frenzy, from whatever cause
                    it may originate, is communicated to the workers: they may be seen hurrying to
                    and fro in the combs with evident marks of impatience. The heat of the hive is
                    increased by their tumultuous movements; it sometimes rises suddenly on these
                    occasions from 92° to above 10∙l <hi rend="superscript"> o</hi>. A general buzz
                    is heard throughout the hive. This state of things occurs from time to time for
                    some days before the swarm is actually on the wing; <hi rend="italic">and</hi>
                    the interval is occupied in making preparations for the approaching expedition;
                    provisions are collected in greater quantity by the workers. Hunter killed
                    several of those that came aw ay, and found their crops full, while those that
                    remained in the hive had their crops not nearly so.</p>
                <p>On the day on which the swarm quits the hive, few of the workers roam to any
                    distance, but several are seen performing circles in the air round the hive. The
                    noise is on a sudden hushed, and all the bees enter the hive; this silence
                    announces their immediate departure. A few workers appear at the door, turn
                    towards the hive, and striking with their wings, give, as it were, the signal
                    for flight. All those which are to accompany the expedition rush towards the
                    door, and issue forth with wonderful rapidity, rising in the air and hovering
                    for some time, as if in order to wait for the assemblage of the w hole troop;
                    then, having selected a rallying point, generally on some tree or bush, some
                    alight, being joined immediately by others until the whole number is collected
                    in one mass of bees. It does not ahvays happen that the queen is the first to
                    alight or is with the cluster at all; but if she be not there the bees soon
                    discover it and disperse in search of her—if they fail to find her they return
                    to the parent hive. Thither the queen sometimes, from weakness or other causes,
                    returns, and is immediately attended by the rest. But if the weather be fine,
                    the expedition is only deferred for one or two days, and they again take
                    then-departure. If their return be owing to the loss of their queen, they remain
                    a fortnight or longer before the attempt to migrate is renewed, and then the
                    swarm is much larger than before, which renders it probable that they have
                    "waited for the queen that was to go off with the next swarm. Sometimes, when
                    everything indicates an approaching emigration, the passage of a cloud across
                    the sun will suspend all their operations, and the previous bustle gives place
                    to a state of perfect calm. But, if the day be not far advanced, the breaking
                    out of sunshine will renew the commotion, and determine the moment of actual
                    flight.</p>
                <p>The swarm having rested for some time on the first landing-place, and collected
                    the whole of its numbers, soars again in the air, keeping in a close phalanx,
                    and directing its course with great velocity to the spot which their guides had
                    selected,—giving out, at the same time, a loud and acute-toned hum by the action
                    of their wings.</p>
                <p>The parent hive, thus deserted by its queen and a large proportion of its
                    inhabitants, is busily occupied in repairing its loss. The bees which remain
                    quietly pursue their labours; the young brood, soon arriving at maturity,
                    quickly fill up every deficiency; and young queens, being allowed their liberty,
                    one after the other, conduct in their turns new swarms, in the same manner as
                    the first. The second swarm is not sent off till after the space of from five to
                    ten days after the first. The following swarms succeed quicker to each other,
                    but consist of smaller numbers than the earlier ones. If it happen that two
                    queens are found in a swarm, either the swarm divides itself into two, and have
                    separate destinations, or a single combat between the queens decides on which of
                    them the empire is to devolve. Sometimes, indeed, they appear not to perceive
                    each other, and the parties belonging to each construct separate combs within
                    the same hive; but no sooner do these combs come in contact, and thus give
                    occasion to the queens meeting each other, than a contest begins which
                    terminates only by the death of one of the rival queens.</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit03newyrich/page/n511/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0903-0511-0496"/>
                <p>Successive swarms are sent off as long as the increase of population permits; and
                    the number thus produced in a season depends on a variety of circumstances, such
                    as the abundance of flowers, the warmth of the climite, and capacity of the
                    hive. Bose, while he was French consul in Carolina, found a stock of bees in the
                    woods which had been robbed of its wax and honey by the negroes; he contrived to
                    convey the bees in his hat to a hive in his garden. He obtained from this hive
                    eleven swarms before the end of autumn; and these, again, gave him the same
                    number of secondary swarms, so that by the end of the year he had twenty-two
                    hives stocked from the one he had thus saved from destruction. In Britain a hive
                    commonly sends off only two and sometimes three swarms in the course of the
                    summer; and prudent apiarians will be satisfied with one swarm only, returning
                    all subsequent ones to the parent hive, which would otherwise become very weak.
                    When bar-frame hives are used, the issue of after-swarms is easily and surely
                    prevented by destroying all queen-cells but one after the issue of the first
                    swarm.</p>
                <p>Very few drones accompany the new colonies, so that almost all those produced in
                    the spring remain in the hive. But when the queens are impregnated, and no new
                    swarms are about to take place, the workers, who had till then suffered them to
                    live unmolested in the hive, are on a sudden seized with a deadly fury towards
                    them, and a scene of carnage ensues. This usually happens in June, July, or
                    August. They chase their unhappy victims in every quarter, till they seek a
                    refuge at the bottom of the hive, where they collect in crowds, and are
                    indiscriminately, and without a single exception, massacred by the working bees,
                    who, with implacable fury, bite, maim, and throw them out of the hive. So great
                    is their antipathy to all the race of drones, that they destroy, at the same
                    time, the male eggs and larvae, and tear open the cocoons of their pupae, in
                    order to devote them to one common destruction. This sacrifice of the males is
                    not, however, the effect of a blind and indiscriminating instinct; for if a hive
                    be deprived of its queen, the massacre does not take place, while the hottest
                    persecution rages in all the surrounding hives. In this case the males are
                    allowed to survive the winter.</p>
                <p>Having thus got rid of the useless mouths which consumed, without any advantage
                    to the public, a large portion of their provisions, the bees spend the remainder
                    of the summer in collocting stores of honey and of pollen for the ensuing
                    winter. Their gleanings are now less abundant than in the spring, and require
                    more labour in the search and collection. But at this season the leaves of many
                    kinds of trees, which are covered in the morning with a saccharine fluid that
                    exudes from them, furnish them with a species of nourishment, which, though of
                    very inferior quality to the nectarial fluid, still contributes to their
                    support. Fruit is also attacked by bees, after the cuticular covering has been
                    broken through by birds or snails. They also find nutriment in the <hi
                    rend="italic">honey-dev),</hi> which is an excrementitious fluid deposited on
                    the leaves of plants by certain species of aphides. Often, however, these
                    resources fail, and the hive is threatened with famine. On these occasions the
                    distressed bees frequently betake themselves to plunder; and if a weak or
                    queenless hive can be discovered they begin a furious onset, which costs great

                    if they succeed in making good the assault, the war continues to rage in the
                    interior of the hive until one side finds itself beaten, in which case, should
                    the conquerors be the invaders, the invaded will generally join their forces,
                    and help their late enemies to carry of their plunder, and at once become
                    members of the lately hostile hive,</p>
                <p>The life of a queen-bee will sometimes exteud to three or four years, but her
                    fertility decreases after her second breeding season. When absent from the hive
                    on her matrimonial excursions she very often becomes a prey to a bird, and not
                    seldom on her return mistakes her hive, when she is probably killed by the
                    stranger bees, or by the queen on whose territory she has intruded. Dr0ne3
                    seldom die a natural death; there is no evidence of the duration of the lives of
                    individuals, but normally they are hatched about May and slaughtered by the
                    workers in June, July, or August; should the hive be queenless, however, the
                    workers do not harm the drones, and some will then live far into the winter or
                    even to the following spring. The life of a worker is greatly dependent on the
                    season of the year and the amount of labour performed. The modern method of
                    introducing a fertile Ligurian queen <hi rend="italic">(Apis</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">ligustica)</hi> into a queenless stock of the common black bee <hi
                    rend="italic">(Apis</hi><hi rend="italic">mellifica),</hi> in order to obtain
                    pure stocks of the former variety, has plainly demonstrated the short life of
                    the worker bee. If the Ligurian queen be introduced in May, when bees are busy
                    and work abundant, in from six to eight weeks thereafter scarcely a black bee
                    will be found in the hive, although at the time of the introduction multitudes
                    of young larvae were present, which probably would not all be fully developed
                    for nearly three weeks; therefore, in the season of hardest work, the
                    inhabitants of the hive would seldom attain the age of six weeks. But if the
                    experiment of the queen’s introduction be deferred until October, then not until
                    the following May will the black bees have become extinct. And it is a curious
                    fact that if a hive be deprived of its queen in October (and none other
                    supplied), then the workers, having no labour to perform either in replenishing
                    stores or attending on the larvae, will possibly in May be found still living,
                    although somewhat reduced in numbers. Such a colony, however, generally becomes
                    a victim to robbers when the activity of spring arrives, for a queenless stock
                    rarely makes much defence of its stores. In fine winter days, when the sun
                    shines brightly, numbers of bees are tempted abroad, which easily become
                    benumbed by cold, fall to the ground, and die. Insectivorous birde also make
                    victims of great numbers at such times, other insect food being scarce; so that,
                    probably, in winter and early spring, more workers die from accident than by
                    natural decay. The fecundity of the queen-bee is, however, adequate not only to
                    repair these losses, but to multiply the population in a very high progression.
                    <hi rend="italic">Apis ligτιstica</hi> has the reputation of being more prolific
                    than <hi rend="italic">A. mellifica</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> and a young and
                    vigorous queen will, in the fine weather of a warm May and June, deposit as many
                    as 2000 eggs per day for several weeks in succession, and this fertility is of
                    much longer continuance in America and other warm climates than in England. In
                    England, eggs are deposited and young reared ten or eleven months in the year,
                    when the colony is strong in numbers and well supplied with stores; but the
                    increase in the cold months seldom equals the decrease by deaths.</p>
                <p>The loss of the queen is an event which has the most marked influence on the
                    conduct of the workers. Although the queen is constantly an object of attention
                    and of affection to the whole community, they are not immediately sensible of
                    her absence when she is removed from the hive. The ordinary labours axe
                    continued without interruption, and it is not till a whole hour has elapsed that
                    symptoms of uneasiness are manifested, and it is even then only partially
                    displayed. The inquietude begins in one part of the hive, the workers become
                    restless, abandon the young which they were feeding, run to and fro, and, by
                    striking each other with their antennae, communicate the alarming intelligence
                    very quickly to their companions. The ferment soon extends to the whole
                    community: the bees rush <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0903-0512-0497"/> precipitately out of the hive, and seek for their
                    lost queen in every direction This state of confusion continues for a day or
                    two, after which tranquillity is again established; they return to their
                    labours; and, selecting an egg, or one of the larvae that is not more than three
                    days old, they break down two of the contiguous cells, sacrificing the larvae
                    contained in them, and proceed to build up one royal cell from their ruins. They
                    then supply the worm with the food necessary to promote its quick growth, and
                    leaving' untouched the rhomboidal bottom they raise around it a cylindrical
                    enclosure In three days the larva has grown to such a size as to require an
                    extension of its lodging, and must inhabit a cell nearly of a pyramidal figure,
                    and hanging perpendicularly. A new pyramidal tube is therefore constructed with
                    the wax of the surrounding cells, which is soldered at right angles to the
                    first, and the bees, working downwards, gradually contract its diameter from the
                    base, which is very wide, to the point. In proportion as the worm grows, the
                    bees labour in extending the cell, and bring food, which they place before its
                    mouth and round its body, forming a kind of coiled zone around it. The worm,
                    which can move only in a spiral direction, turns incessantly to take its food
                    before its head; it insensibly descends, and at length arrives at the orifice of
                    the cell. It then transforms itself into a pupa, is enclosed with a covering of
                    wax, as before described, and, in the space of ten to sixteen days the original
                    loss is thus repaired by the birth of a new queen. Schirach found that, if a
                    number of bees be confined with even a single larva, which in the natural course
                    would have become a worker bee, they immediately set about giving it the royal
                    education above described, and thus raise it to the dignity of queen.</p>
                <p>The discovery that queens may be reared at will has been confirmed by recent
                    experiment, and is now largely taken advantage of by apiarians both in Europe
                    and America, to facilitate the making of artificial swarms and otherwise
                    increase the production of bees. By the aid of small frame hives called nucleus
                    boxes, which only materially differ from the larger or mother hive by containing
                    frames less in number and in size (generally three), a stock of fertile queens
                    is kept on hand ready to supply any colony requiring a sovereign, or to exchange
                    an old queen for a young one, or a Ligurian queen for an ordinary English one.
                    An example of the method of rearing these queens is as follows :—A full comb
                    containing young worker larvae and eggs is taken, with all its attendant bees,
                    and placed in the centre of the nucleus box, flanked on both sides by other
                    combs containing honey. Sufficient young bees, which have not flown, are now
                    added to cover well the brood comb, in order that proper heat may be kept up to
                    mature the brood. As soon as the members of this small community find themselves
                    without a queen, a dreadful uproar ensuee; and, probably, should there be bees
                    among them who know their way home, they will desert, but enough will usually
                    remain to carry on the desired work; if not, more young bees must be added.
                    These may be known by their fresher and greyer appearance. After a few hours the
                    commotion will subside, and the bees will proceed to the construction of royal
                    cells, and take proper care for the feeding and hatching of the larvae selected
                    for royal honours. Generally on the second day, the foundations of royal cells
                    are perceptible, the number of these vary from one or two to as many as sixteen.
                    In from ten to sixteen days, according to the age of selected eggs or larvae,
                    the young queens will arrive at maturity; and as the first at liberty will
                    destroy the others if allowed, the apiarian in good time cuts out the sealed
                    royal cells, which are distributed by grafting on other combs into newly-formed
                    nuclei, or into such hives as require a queen. The young queens, on their
                    emergence from the pupa state, are now each at the head of a colony, where they
                    remain until they become fertile in the natural way, and are then ready for such
                    purposes as they are required for.</p>
                <p>In Switzerland, Italy, and Germany a large business is done in Ligurian
                    queen-raising for export. Great numbers of those queens come to England and
                    America in little wooden boxes, accompanied by sufficient workers to develop
                    enough heat. The price in Italy varies, according to the season, from five
                    francs in October to twelve francs in March; but few are raised until May, owing
                    to the difficulty of their obtaining impregnation. To overcome this difficulty
                    in the autumn some colonies are purposely kept queenless, whose drones remain in
                    existence. The advantage of having fertile queens at the bee-master’s disposal
                    is very great. When a swarm issues the young queen is not usually mature, and
                    has to become impregnated. Should unfavourable weather ensue, a still further
                    delay occurs; and the virgin queen, on her excursion, is liable to be lost or
                    killed. Should no such accident occur, it may still be two or three weeks before
                    ovipositing again commences, and this in the very height of the breeding season;
                    while if the skilful bee-master, first taking the precaution to destroy any
                    existing queen cells, can immediately, on the issue of the swarm, introduce the
                    queen and her retinue from a nucleus hive, no time is lost, and probably 20,000
                    to 40,000 eggs will be deposited in the time that would otherwise have been
                    lost. By this system of nucleus queen-rearing, it may be fairly calculated that
                    the increase of population may be doubled. While the hive remains without a
                    queen swarming can never take place, be the hive ever so crowded.</p>
                <p>Huber has made the singular observation that two queens, however inveterate may
                    be their mutual hostility, neve; actually destroy each other, and that when in
                    the course of their contest they are placed in such a relative position that
                    each has it in her power to strike a mortal blow on the other with its sting,
                    they suddenly separate, and part with every appearance of being panic-struck.
                    The final cause of the instinct that prompts this conduct is sufficiently
                    obvious, as, without it, the hive would be altogether deprived of a queen.</p>
                <p>Bees recognise the person of their own queen. If a stranger enter the hive, they
                    seize and surround her until a ball of bees is formed one or two inches in
                    diameter; in which imprisonment the unfortunate monarch is kept until death puts
                    an end to her misery, for it is very remarkable the bees seldom sting a queen. A
                    hive that has lost its queen may, however, by certain precautions be induced to
                    accept a substitute. The most common way of attaining success in this operation
                    is to imprison the stranger queen in a small cage of wire gauze or perforated
                    zinc; this being suspended between two central combs or fixed upon one, the bees
                    become accustomed to the odour and appearance of their new sovereign, and after
                    the lapse of one or two days will readily accept her. If a supernumerary queen
                    be introduced into the hive, she is laid hold of by the bees and presented to
                    the reigning queen, while a ring is formed by the bees, who continue to be
                    spectators, and even promoters of the combat, in which one or other of the
                    queens is destined to perish. Schirach and Reims had imagined that, in these
                    circumstances, the stranger met her death from the hands of the working bees,
                    but this mistake has been corrected by Huber, who gives the account above
                    stated.</p>
                <p>We have next to relate the results of experiments of a more cruel kind, which
                    illustrate several points in the physiology of these insects. The amputation of
                    the four wings of the queen did not interfere with her laying eggs, and the
                    workers did not show her the less attention on account of her being thus
                    mutilated. Of course, if the <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit03newyrich/page/n513/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0903-0513-0498"/> operation be performed before she is impregnated,
                    she remains barren, since it is necessary for the sexual congress that she
                    should fly out of the hive. The amputation of a single antenna appeared to be
                    productive of no bad consequence of any kind; but the removal of both the
                    antennae v/as followed by singular effects. The queen which had suffered this
                    operation ran about in apparent confusion, dropping her eggs at random, and was
                    incapable of directing her tongue with precision to the food that was offered
                    her. At times she appeared desirous of escaping from the hive; and when this was
                    prevented, she returned in a state of delirium, was indifferent to the caresses
                    of the workers, and received another similarly mutilated queen that was
                    presented to her without the least symptom of dislike. The λvorkers, on the
                    other hand, received the stranger queen with great respect, although the first
                    still remained in the hive. A third queen, notmutilated, was next introduced;
                    she was very ill received and immediately detained and kept a close prisoner,
                    being evidently regarded as an intruder. When the queen deprived of her antennae
                    was allowed to quit the hive, she was followed by none of the workers, and was
                    abandoned to her fate.</p>
                <p>The wasp and the hornet have long been known as the determined enemies of the
                    bee, committing great ravages among these weaker insects; they attack them
                    individually, but offener commit their aggressions in large armies, on which
                    occasions numbers perish on both sides. In some parte of America wasps have
                    multiplied to so great a degree as to render it impossible to rear bees. Among
                    quadrupeds the ant-eater occasionally devours them. The bear and the badger
                    overturn the hives, and plunder their contents. Rats and mice are very
                    formidable enemies, as they attack the bees at all seasons, and especially
                    during the torpid state of the insects, when they are incapable of revenging the
                    aggression. The woodpecker may succeed in breaking through the hive, and then
                    speedily destroys all its inhabitants; the swallow, the sparrow, the titmouse,
                    the cuckoo, the <hi rend="italic">Merops</hi><hi rend="italic">apiaster,</hi> or
                    bee-eater, and poultry of every kind, prey upon them separately. According to
                    Bose, they are also food for the shrikes and for the <hi rend="italic">Falco
                    apivorus.</hi> Lizards watch for them, and seize them as they alight near the
                    hive. Toads occasionally devour them. They are in some danger from the larger
                    kinds of spiders, and of <hi rend="italic">Libellulce,</hi> as also from the <hi
                    rend="italic">Philardhus apivorus</hi> of Fabricius. But the most insidious and
                    destructive enemies of these insects are moths, two species of which, <hi
                    rend="italic">Galleria mellonella</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Achroia
                    grisella,</hi> insinuate themselves into the hive, and deposit their eggs on the
                    combs in such numbers, that the hive is soon overrun with the larvae, the combs
                    destroyed, and the bees eventually forced to vacate the hive. In America and in
                    Italy these moths are much more troublesome than in England. On the Continent of
                    Europe bees are also troubled with a parasite called the bee-louse <hi
                    rend="italic">(Braula</hi><hi rend="italic">caeca),</hi> sometimes as many as 50
                    or 100 being found on a single bee, and as they live by suction they are great
                    pests. This insect is not frequently found in England except accompanying
                    imported Ligurian bees.</p>
                <p>Bees are subject to few diseases, but these few are sometimes veryfatal.
                    Dysentery occasionally commits great havoc in a hive, and is usually caused by
                    the neglect of sanitary measures, by close confinement, want of ventilation, and
                    damp. Dysentery is indicated by the appearance of the excrement within the hive,
                    which the bees in a healthy state are particularly careful to exclude. It is
                    often induced by the bees being forced into undue excitement in cold, ungenial
                    weather. The disease known generally by the name of “foul brood” is the most
                    fatal of all; it is highly contagious,—the infection from its presence remaining
                    in the hives, combs, and honey long after the bees are exterminated. Dysentery
                    is a diseme of the perfect insects only. Foul brood is confined to the larvae,
                    which, having grown to near maturity, die and putrefy after being sealed over by
                    the bees. The workers seem totally unable to remove the foul mass which thus
                    remains to spread infection all around. The seed of the disease is believed to
                    lie in the presence of the sp0re3 of a microscopical fungus <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Micrococcus),</hi> and long scientific discussions and experiments have been
                    made on the Continent to demonstrate this, particularly by Drs Preusz and
                    Schönfeld. The devastation caused in apiaries by this disease is sometimes
                    fearful. Dzierzon relates that, in 1848, he had nearly the whole of his colonies
                    destroyed by it, more than 500 being destroyed, and only 10 escaping. Quinby
                    also, in America, has lost as many as 100 stocks in a single year by this
                    pestilence. And when once fully developed a total destruction of all hives and
                    combs infected appears to be the only way of eradicating it. Honey from a foul
                    brood hive will carry the germs of the disease to any bees which may consume it.
                    The presence of this disease may be detected by the foul smell emanating from
                    the hive, and from the circumstance of many cells remaining covered longer than
                    naturally occurs when there are living pupae within them.</p>
                <p>In the management of bees a great deal must, of course, depend on supplying them
                    with an abundant pasture. A rich corn country is well known to be to them as a
                    barren desert during a great portion of the year. Hence the judicious practice
                    of shifting them from place to place according to the circumstances of the
                    season. It was the advice of Celsus that, after the vernal pastures were
                    consumed, bees should be transported to places abounding with autumnal flowers;
                    and in accordance with that advice they were in ancient times annually carried
                    from Achaia to Attica, and from Euboea and the islands of the Cyclades to
                    Scyrus. In Sicily, also, they w ere brought to Hybla from other parts of the
                    island. So also in Scotland, so soon as the “bright consummate flowers” of
                    summer are on the wane, the people of the Lowlands despatch their hives in
                    cart-loads to the blooming heather of the mountain pastures, where a
                    never-ending paradise of sweets is spread before them. It is, indeed, to be
                    regretted that our moorlands are not more utilized for this object than they
                    are. The very air of the Highland hills is often redolent with rich perfume,
                    giving earnest of a bountiful harvest; only a solitary bee is seen here and
                    there, labouring with wearied wing among the inexhaustible stores of nature, and
                    scarcely able to regain with its burden its lonely shieling in the distant vale.
                    Considering the poverty of the peasantry, and their frequent want of occupation,
                    it is to be lamented that so easy and pleasant a source of emolument should be
                    so much neglected by them. In consequence of this neglect a large sum is paid
                    every year to foreign nations for articles that could be raised at home, in
                    every respect superior, with very little outlay either of labour or of
                    capital.</p>
                <p>We learn from Pliny that the practice of removing bees from place to place was
                    frequent in the Roman territories. “As soon,” he says, “as the spring food for
                    bees has failed in the valleys near our towns, the hives of bees are put into
                    boats, and carried up against the stream of the river in the night, in search of
                    better pasture. The bees go out in the morning in quest of provisions, and
                    return regularly to their, hives in the boats, with the stores they have
                    collected. This method is continued till the sinking of the boats to a certain
                    depth in the water shows that the hives are sufficiently full; and they are then
                    carried back to their former homes, where their honey is taken out of them.” And
                    this is still the practice of the Italians who live near the banks of the Po,
                    the river which Pliny instanced particularly in the passage above quoted.</p>

                <p>Ai. Maillet relates, in ins description of Egypt, that, “in spite of the
                    ignorance and rusticity which have got possession of that country, there yet
                    remain in it several footprints of the industry and skill of the ancient
                    Egyptians. One of their most admirable contrivances is sending their bees
                    annually into distant countries, in order to procure sustenance, at a time when
                    they could not find any at home, and afterwards bringing them back,—like
                    shepherds who should travel with their flock, and make them feed as they go. It
                    was observed by the ancient inhabitants of Lower Egypt, that all plants
                    blossomed, and the fruits of the earth ripened, above six weeks earlier in Upper
                    Egypt than with them. They found that the same law applied to their bees; and
                    the means they then made use of to enable these usefully industrious insects to
                    reap advantage from the mnre forward state of nature there, were exactly the
                    same as are now practised for the like purpose in that country. About the end of
                    October, all such inhabitants of Lower Egypt as have hives of bees, embark them
                    on the Nile, and convey them up that river into Upper Egypt, observing to time
                    the journey so that they arrive there just when the inundation is withdrawn, the
                    lands have been sown, and the flowers begin to bud. The hives thus sent are
                    marked and numbered by their respective owners, and placed pyramidally in boats
                    prepared for the purpose. After they have remained some days at their furthest
                    station, and are supposed to have gathered all the wax and honey they could find
                    in the fields within two or three leagues around, their conductors convey them
                    in the same boats two or three leagues lower down, and there leave the laborious
                    insects as long time as is necessary for them to collect all the riches of this
                    spot. Thus the nearer they come to the place of their more permanent abode, they
                    find the productions of the earth, and the plants which afford them food,
                    forward in proportion. In fine, about the beginning of February, after having
                    travelled through the whole length of Egypt, gathering all the rich produce of
                    the delightful banks of the Nile, they arrive at the mouth of that river,
                    towards the ocean, from whence they originally set out. They are now returned to
                    their several homes, great care being taken to keep an exact register of every
                    district from which the hives were sent in the beginning of the season, their
                    numbers, the names of the persons who sent them, and likewise of the mark or
                    number of the boat in which they were placed. ’ ’</p>
                <p>In many parts of France floating bee-houses are also common; there are on board
                    one barge three to five score of bee-hives, well defended from the inclemency of
                    an accidental storm. The owners allow their barges to float gently down the
                    river, the bees continually choosing their flowery pasture along the banks of
                    the stream, and thus a single floating bee-house yields the proprietor a
                    considerable income. They have also a method of transporting their bees by land
                    which is well worth imitation. Those hives being selected whose combs are firm
                    and not likely to be broken by jolting, thirty to forty of them are carefully
                    packed in tiers in a cart, which proceeds slowly on its travels. If the season
                    be sultry, they journey only at night, the hives being covered up with a cloth.
                    On arriving in a suitable locality the hives are taken out of the cart, set upon
                    the ground, and the bees go forth in search of food. In the evening, as soon as
                    they are all returned, the hives are shut up, and being placed again in the cart
                    they proceed on their journey. When the caravan has arrived at its destination,
                    the colonies are distributed in the gardens or fields adjacent to the houses of
                    the different peasants, who, for a very small remuneration, undertake to look
                    after them.</p>
                <p>On the continents of Europe and America bee-keeping is carried on in a much
                    larger and more scientific manner than in the United Kingdom, where the
                    cottagers still, in the greater majority of instances, use only the ancient
                    straw skep or hive, and know no other method of depriving the colonies of their
                    stores than the barbarous and wasteful practice of smothering them with
                    brimstone. In Russia the province of Pultowa boasts of 500,000, and
                    Ekater-inoslaw has 400,000 hives. In Western Russia the industry chiefly
                    flourishes in the province of Kowno, where the Tchmude tribe are almost wholly
                    engaged in bee-keeping; and in Eastern Russia the Finnic tribe are enthusiastic
                    apiarians. In Siberia bee-keeping is mostly carried on about the Altai
                    mountains, and in Caucasia by the Meretinzes and Grusinians. In Southern Russia
                    artificial hives are used, while in North Russia the bees are kept in a natural
                    manner in the forests. The principal reasons why bee-culture is so industriously
                    carried on in Russia are, first, because the peasants use honey instead of
                    sugar, and, secondly, because wax tapers, to the value of 1,200,000 roubles are
                    required for the churches. Mr Buschen states that the quantity of honey annually
                    produced in European Russia is 600,000 to 700,000 lb. In Hungary and Germany
                    apiaries of 2000 to 5000 colonies are said to be not infrequent; and great
                    numbers are in the autumn often found congregated together on the heaths. In
                    1873 the aggregate number of stocks in Germany, including Hanover and Hesse
                    Cassel, was found to be 1,453,764 stocks; Bavaria alonehad 338,897. The German
                    Government encourages bee culture in every possible manner; teachers, paid by
                    the state, travel through the rural districts teaching the best methods of
                    cultivation; and all schoolmasters, before receiving their diplomas, have to
                    pass an examination in this subject. Beeclubs in the villages are common, money
                    for prizes and expenses being in part supplied by the Government. The result of
                    this fostering care is that Germany produces many skilful apiarians, who
                    contribute greatly to our knowledge of the science. In the United States
                    bee-farming is largely carried on as a distinct trade, every scientific
                    appliance being eagerly brought into use. The country also seems to be
                    particularly productive of honey-secreting flowers, and consequently large
                    harvests are gathered. In 1874 one beefarm alone, that of Mr Harbison, situated
                    in San Diego county, California, produced 150,000 lb of honey, of a market value
                    of $30,000, from 2000 stocks of bees. The honey-bee of both varieties <hi

                    >and</hi><hi rend="italic">A. ligustica)</hi> has also been introduced into
                    South Africa and New Zealand, where it flourishes amazingly.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Apiaries and Hives.</hi></p>
                <p>Having thus given at considerable length the natural history of the hive-bee, we
                    proceed to describe the most approved hives, &amp;c., in use in a well-managed
                    apiary. Greater attention to this useful appendage to the cottage would not only
                    be productive of commercial advantage, but would tend to improve the condition
                    of the peasantry. It is not generally known, indeed, what profitable results may
                    be obtained, at a trifling expense of time and labour, from bee-keeping. Even
                    supposing the first cost of a swarm to be one guinea, which is a high price, the
                    cottager, with proper care and management, will clear, in five years, a net
                    profit of nearly .£60, and have besides, at the end of that period, ten good
                    stocks of bees in his garden.</p>
                <p>The principal objects to be considered in the construction and management of an
                    apiary, are, first, to secure the prosperity and multiplication of the colonies,
                    and then to increase the amount of their productive labour, and to obtain their
                    products with facility and with the least possible detriment to the stock. The
                    apiary should afford to the bees shelter against moisture and the extremes of
                    heat and of cold, and especially against sudden vicissitudes of temperature. The
                    hives should render every facility for constructing the combs and rearing the
                    young; they should allow of every part of the combs being occasionally
                    inspected, and of their being removed when necessary; and, while due attention
                    is paid to economy, they should be made of materials that will insure
                    durability. Much ingenuity has been displayed by different apiarians in the
                    construction of hives to unite in the greatest possible degree all these
                    advantages; but there is still great room for improvement on the hives that are
                    in common use.</p>
                <p>While some cultivators of bees have been chiefly anxious to promote their
                    multiplication, and prevent the escape of the swarms in the natural way by
                    procuring what are termed “artificial swarms,” which is effected by various
                    means, others have taken into consideration only the <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit03newyrich/page/n515/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0903-0515-0500"/> abundance of the products which they yield, and
                    the best way of extracting them from the hive, without showing any particular
                    solicitude as to the preservation of the bees themselves; still another class of
                    apiarians have had more particularly in view the prosecution of researches in
                    the natural history and economy of bees. The hive invented by Hubei was in his
                    time a great advance for the purpose last named He gave it the name of “ruche en
                    livre ou en feuillets” from its opening and shutting somewhat in the manner of
                    the leaves of a book. It had, however, many inconveniences which are remedied in
                    some hives of more modern construction, and Huber’s leaf-hive is now rarely
                    used, although it may claim the distinction of having been the first of the
                    frame hives which are now, with many modifications, generally acknowledged to be
                    the only ones capable of giving the maximum of prosperity to the bees and
                    producing a large honey harvest, combined with affording facilities for
                    observation and manipulation. The old cylindrical straw skep or hive is still
                    generally used among the cottagers of England, although abandoned in many other
                    countries. While very excellent for warmth and ventilation, it has the
                    disadvantage that its interior is inaccessible for information; and the fixity
                    of its combs precludes many manipulations which the skilful apiarian is called
                    upon to perform. This was well known to the ancients, who, to remedy it, fitted
                    the crowns of their hives with movable wooden bars, from which the bees built
                    their combs, but still they were attached by their sides to the hive and
                    required to be cut away before they could be removed,—these operations greatly
                    disturbing the bees. In 1851, Dzierzon in Germany, and Langstroth in America,
                    two of the most skilful apiarians of the present day, simultaneously designed or
                    invented the bar-frame hive, the principle of which, with many varieties of
                    detail, is found in all the best hives now in use. A well-known English example
                    of this kind of hive is the “Woodbury” (fig. 4), named after its designer, Mr
                    Woodbury of Exeter. This consists of a square wooden box, 14⅜ inches in diameter
                    (inside measure), and 9 inches deep, covered by a top or crown-board either
                    loose or lightly screwed down. This board has a circular hole in the centre, 2∣
                    inches in diameter, for feeding purposes, and when not in use is covered with
                    perforated zinc or a block of wood. The floor-board is 18 inches square, with an
                    entrance cut in it forming a channel about 4 inches wide and ∣ths of an inch
                    deep. At the part where the front of the hive crosses it gradually slopes
                    upwards inside tne hive. An alightingboard for the bees is fixed to the front of
                    the floor-board opposite the entrance, and projects 3 or 4 inches; a wooden
                    ridge-roof covers all. The interior of the hive is fitted with ten frames; they
                    are made of light lath, about ⅛ths of an inch wide, the top bars being ∣ths and
                    the sides and bottom rails ∙⅛ths of an inch in thickness respectively. The top
                    bars are 15∣ inches in length, and project into notches cut into rabbets at the
                    back and front of the hive to receive them. The rabbets are ∙∣ths of an inch
                    deep, and the notches in them are of the same depth, so that the projections in
                    the bars rest flush in them, leaving a space of ⅞ths clear above the frames,
                    over w hich the bees can travel. The ten frames occupy equal portions of the
                    interior space; if this be divided into ten equal divisions, the centre of each
                    will be exactly the point at which the centre of each bar-frame should rest;
                    these points will be 1∙ <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> ¾∙ inches apart. In these
                    frames it is intended that the bees shall build their combs; and when they have
                    done so, any frame may be quietly lifted out of the hive with all the bees upon
                    it, whether for examination or for division of the stock for an artificial
                    swarm. To induce the bees to build straight in the frames a thin strip of comb
                    is usually attached to the underside of the top bar, or a thin line of molten
                    wax poured down the centre of the bar will ans wer the purpose, as the bees will
                    follow the guide thus laid. For the purpose of providing storage-room for honey
                    an upper storey, called a “super,” is added to the hive, of the same diameter
                    but of less height, 3 to 5 inches usually sufficing, as when filled it may be
                    taken off and an empty one substituted. Before a super be placed in position,
                    the crown-board should be removed, and a thin board, called an “adapter,”
                    substituted; this, in place of the round central hole, has near each side a long
                    aperture, <hi rend="subscript"> τ</hi> ⅞-ths of an inch wide, which gives
                    passage to the workers, but not to the queen and drones—the latter being useless
                    there, and it being desirable the queen should not oviposit in the super.</p>
                <p>Elegant supers are made of glass globes, or propagating glasses, which the bees
                    will readily use if enticed into them by a few pieces of clean white comb.</p>
                <p>Many improvements have been made on the Woodbury hive, tending still further to
                    the comfort and well-being of the bees, as well as to the furtherance of
                    scientific study; and, perhaps, the hive that may be said to combine most of
                    these advantages is one designed by Mr Frank Cheshire, and known as the
                    “Cheshire Hive” (figs. 5 and 6).</p>
                <p>To afford the bees the maximum of comfort and to economize their heat, the walls
                    of this hive are made double, enclosing an air space. The Woodbury frames are
                    used, but rest on the thin edge of a strip of zinc within the hive at the back
                    and front, which prevents the bees fixing them with propolis. The floor-board is
                    constructed to slide in a groove beneath the hive, and the entrance can be
                    enlarged or diminished at pleasure by a pair of sliding-shutters; the hive is
                    complete with stand and roof, and altogether leaves little to be desired.</p>
                <p>The adoption of frame hives has greatly facilitated the scientific study of the
                    insects’ habits, the artificial multiplication of colonies, and the
                    appropriation of their surplus stores without injury to the bees. It is quite a
                    secondary consideration what size or pattern of frame is used, or how the frames
                    are suspended in the hive, provided the principle of movable frames be adopted;
                    and although much ingenuity has been exercised by scientific men to design a
                    hive embracing every possible advantage regardless of cost, the roughest timber
                    and coarsest workmanship will give as good results as the most elaborate. Frame
                    hives are exceedingly well calculated for procuring artificial <pb break="no"

                    whether the population be sufficient to admit of division, if the brood be of
                    the proper age, if drones exist or are ready to be produced for impregnating the
                    young queens,—all of which circumstances are material to the success of the
                    operation. Wooden hives are generally made square, but not invariably so. The
                    “Sfewarton hive” (fig. 7), largely and successfully used in Scotland, is
                    octagonal, and the “Quinby hive” of America is much deeper from back to front
                    than it is wide. The Stewarton is not properly a frame, but a bar-hive, although
                    frames are sometimes fitted to it. It usually consists of three octagon
                    breedingboxes, 14 inches in diameter by 6 inches deep, each furnished with nine
                    bars placed equidistant, the spaces between being occupied by movable slides of
                    wood working in grooves in the bars. The hive has shuttered windows back and
                    front, handles to lift, and hooks to weigh with, as well as little buttons to
                    prevent displacement; each breeding-box has an entrance-way 4 inches wide and
                    half an inch high, with a sliding-door to close it wholly or partially. There
                    are also two supers or honey boxes, the same diameter as the stock boxes, but
                    only 4 inches deep; these are furnished with wider bars, seven in number, and a
                    floorboard completes the whole, which, being made of but ⅜ inch wood, requires
                    protection from the weather.</p>
                <p>For those persons who are unable to handle bees with impunity, but are yet
                    desirous of studying their economy, a glass covered observatory hive has been
                    deemed a necessity. Several have been designed for this purpose, but none of
                    them have been found to be a healthy abode for the bees,—glass being a cold and
                    ungenial material, on -which the moisture of the hive condenses during the
                    winter to the detriment of health of the inhabitants. In the summer, however,
                    bees may be kept in a glass hive without great loss, although with no gain; such
                    a hive may be constructed of a double sash, thickly glazed back and front, of
                    just sufficient width for one comb only and space to allow the bees free passage
                    over both sides of the comb. A very excellent hive in English use is that known
                    as the “Woodbury unicomb,” which is so constructed that six frames may be taken
                    out of an ordinary hive, and hung up in a double perpendicular row between the
                    two sashes, permitting their return in the autumn to their original hive, Egress
                    and ingress is given to the bees by a tunnelled channel to the centre of the
                    hive on the floor line; and by means of a turn-table the hive may be revolved to
                    bring both sides under alternate observation, together with all its inhabitants
                    and their works. The common straw hive, or skep, of the cottagers is too well
                    known to require description, and although it is greatly inferior to frame
                    hives, it will doubtless long retain a place from its easy make and little cost.
                    A great improvement now generally in use is the adoption of a round hole in the
                    centre of the crown, about 2⅜ inches in diameter, which will permit the bees
                    access to the super, and afford facilities to the bee-master for feeding his
                    stock. The capacity of these hives should be about a bushel, when the apiary is
                    situated in a good honey locality.</p>
                <p>To a German apiarian we are indebted for the invention of a machine called the
                    honey-extractor, which, with some subsequent improvements, forms a most
                    important aid in large apiaries to increase the yield of honey. By this
                    appliance the frames of full honeycomb are in a few seconds emptied of their
                    contents without injury to the combs, which are ready at once to be returned to
                    the hive to be refilled, thus saving to the bees great labour in combbuilding,
                    and enabling them to take the utmost advantage of a favourable honey-time, which
                    usually is but short. Honey is saved too, which the bees eat in comb-building;
                    for it has been calculated that bees consume 20 lb of honey in producing 1 lb of
                    wax. There are various patterns of the machine, but the principle of all may be
                    said to be the same, that of centrifugal force. The apparatus consists of a
                    cylindrical metal reservoir, with a tap at the bottom; and within is contained a
                    perpendicular quadrangular frame, two sides of which are covered with
                    wire-netting, and against these the full honeycombs, with their cells previously
                    uncapped, are placed. This framework is then set revolving by means of a handle
                    and cog-wheels, or other motive power, when the honey is flung out against the
                    sides of the cylinder, and the combs completely emptied to be returned to the
                    bees to clean and refill. The loss of this honey, and the excitement caused by
                    the cleaning the wet combs, seem to induce the bees to work their hardest to
                    replace their stores; and -with a strong colony an enormous amount of honey is
                    obtainable in a good locality and season. It has been recorded that one stock in
                    America gathered 600 lb in a single season, and harvests of 200 lb and 300 lb
                    are not uncommon there.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Bee-Keeping.</hi></p>
                <p>We sha]l now give a short exposition of the modern, humane, and scientific system
                    of bee-keeping, which is probably destined at no distant day to supersede the
                    ignorance and cruelty of past ages.</p>
                <p>A description has already been given of examples of the best movable bar and
                    frame hives, and the system they represent should alone be adopted, <hi
                    rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> every comb in the hives should be movable and
                    interchangeable. In stocking these it is usual, first, to hive the swarm in an
                    old-fashioned straw skep; and in the evening, after all the bees are quietly
                    settled, suddenly to shake them down against the entrance of the hive or on the
                    top of the frames, when the astonished insects will immediatly take refuge in
                    their future home. Should continuous bad weather occur after hiving a swarm, the
                    bees must be fed, for, as they have as yet no stores, they will otherwise
                    starve.</p>
                <p>For feeding bees a multitude of appliances have been invented, but they may all
                    give place to a common wide mouth pickle bottle; this is filled with syrup, the
                    mouth tied over with a double fold of net, or placed inverted on a piece of
                    perforated zinc or vulcanite over the feeding-hole of the crown-board of the
                    hive. The supply can be regulated to the bees by the number and size of the
                    holes through which they are allowed to suck. In cold weather when much moisture
                    would be hurtful in the hive, barley-sugar may be advantageously used as a
                    substitute for syrup. The former is made by boiling, for ten minutes, 2 of
                    loaf-sugar in a pint of water, a little vinegar being added to prevent
                    crystallization. The prosperity and profit of an apiary in a great measure
                    depend on judicious feeding. It is bad economy to stint the bees in food. In the
                    early spring slow and continuous feeding (a few ounces of syrup each day) will
                    stimulate the queen to oviposit, by which means the stocks are rapidly
                    strengthened and throw ofl early swarms. Upon the emergence of these, if a young
                    fertile queen be immediately supplied, the hive is ready again to swarm in a
                    remarkably short time. It is a singular fact that if stimulating feeding has
                    been for some time pursued, and the supply be intermitted and nothing coming in
                    from the fields, the bees will destroy all the young larvae and eggs, instinct
                    seeming to teach the wise insects that the calls on the resources of the colony
                    in the way of food for the young will be more than it can bear.</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit03newyrich/page/n517/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0903-0517-0502"/>
                <p>An abundant supply of water is essential to the healthy condition of bees. They
                    consume a large quantity, and often stop to drink at the edge of stagnant pools,
                    and seem even to prefer putrid and urinous waters to purer streams, as if their
                    saline and pungent qualities were grateful to them.</p>
                <p>Where the bee-keeper has the use of a honey-extractor, and a large produce of
                    honey is his desideratum, the combs can be emptied as fast as they are filled;
                    and at the close of the season the bees may be deprived of the whole of their
                    honey if syrup be supplied to them in its place. This is of much less value, and
                    answers every purpose for winter stores. No hive should be trusted to the
                    exigencies of winter with a less weight of sealed comb than 15 lb. Honey may
                    also be gathered into supers; and the bees in good seasons will readily build
                    their combs there, but should be enticed to do so with a few pieces of nice
                    white decoy-comb placed within. <hi rend="superscript"> &gt;</hi> The management
                    of the Stewarton hives may be described as follows :—Two of the breeding-boxes
                    having had their bars furnished with guide-comb, are lashed together, the
                    sliding-door of the upper one run in and the slides of the lower withdrawn, when
                    the two boxes become virtually one; a prime swarm of bees is introduced, and
                    eight or ten days thereafter, another prime swarm being hived in the third
                    breeding-box, it is placed under the other two. The lower of the two first
                    boxes, now the central, has its door run in and the slides of the lower
                    withdrawn. The second swarm of bees will soon run up and fraternise with the
                    others; and the next morning the lowermost box may be removed, and the entrance
                    opened of the one above. The space provided by the two boxes will be found ample
                    for breeding; and when full, the strong stock formed by the double swarm will
                    soon be glad to occupy the super then to be added, to which communication should
                    be afforded by withdrawing the outer slide on each side only. Should the season
                    prove favourable the super will soon be filled, and when nearly so another
                    should be placed on the top, and the first may be removed as soon as the honey
                    cells are sealed over. All supers must be warmly wrapped up or padded, or the
                    bees will be found reluctant to occupy them.</p>
                <p>By the judicious management of supers, and the use of the honey-extractor,
                    swarming may be in a great measure controlled; for if many swarms issue, the
                    result must be that little honey will be gathered; all the energies of the
                    reduced population being exerted to procure food for and attend to the young A
                    super put on the hive before the bees have made preparations for swarming by the
                    construction of queen cells, &amp;c., will generally prevent swarming, but not
                    invariably. The bee-keeper must, therefore, decide whether he prefers an
                    increase of his stocks or a large honey harvest, and manage his bees
                    accordingly.</p>
                <p>It often happens that bees give every indication of an intention to swarm, and
                    cluster idly outside the hive in large numbers for days or even weeks before
                    they really emigrate,— all this time keeping their owner in suspense; and
                    possibly the swarm comes oft at last without being observed. This is very
                    tantalising, but may all be prevented by means of artificial swarming, the mode
                    of proceeding for which varies according to the kind of hive in use.
                    Considering, first, straw skeps, the common hive of the country, the operation
                    to be pursued is known as “driving.” This is not new, having been described by
                    Dr Warder in the last century. The mode usually adopted is as follows :—Towards
                    noon, on a fine day, when many of the bees are abroad, inject at the hive’s
                    entrance a puff or two of tobacco smoke, and with the hands give a smart smack
                    on each side. The effect is that the whole of the inhabitants are struck with
                    extreme terror; and after, perhaps, an alarmed sally to the entrance, every bee
                    rushes to the cells to fill itself with honey. Allowing two or three minutes for
                    them to effect their purpose, the hive is boldly inverted and an empty hive of
                    the same size placed on it mouth to mouth. A long towel is now bound round the
                    junction to confine the bees, and the operator, with two sticks or the palms of
                    his hands, keeps up a continuous smart rapping on the sides of the full hive,
                    and after a few minutes the bees will all stream up into the empty hive,
                    generally not more than fifteen minutes having elapsed before the first hive is
                    denuded of its inhabitants. It should now be placed on the stand of some other
                    strong stock (previously removed), whose returning bees will form a population
                    to nurse the young and rear a queen if one be not supplied by the apiarian. If
                    the swarm is to be at once sent away to a distance exceeding 1 ⅜ miles, the hive
                    may be returned to its old stand, and so be peopled by the remainder of its old
                    inhabitants who were at work. But if the swarm is to remain near, it should be
                    placed on the old stand, as the bees, on their next flight, will return to the
                    locality they know so well. “Driving” should also be pursued in the autumn, when
                    it is desired to appropriate the honey of the hive. The driven bees should then
                    be added to another stock, which they will advantageously strengthen. Where
                    frame hives are in use, the following method may be adopted :—First, lift out
                    the frames and search until the queen be found, when she, with the frame she is
                    on, must be placed in the centre of a new hive, and be flanked on both sides by
                    another comb as full of sealed brood as can be obtained. Fill up both hives with
                    new frames furnished with empty combs, or guide-combs only if the former be not
                    available, and shake into (or before the entrance of) the hive where the queen
                    is sufficient bees to form a large swarm. Many will fly back to their old home,
                    but all the young bees will remain. This hive should then be removed to some
                    distance and the old one replaced. If the swarm is to be sent to a distance, the
                    bees may be simply shaken off the combs into (or in front of) a new hive (taking
                    care the queen is with them), which should be temporarily placed on the spot
                    where the old one has just stood. The bees will enter it, and when all is quiet
                    it should be removed and the old one reinstated. The bees that return from the
                    fields will form a population for the domicile which they will find in the
                    familiar place. Before in any manner operating on bees, it is advisable to puff
                    a little smoke into the hive. This alarms them and causes them to fill their
                    honey-pouches, and a bee in this state never volunteers an attack; but it is
                    always prudent to cover one’s face and hands, as home-returning bees are
                    sometimes inclined to resent the disturbance to their family. India-rubber
                    gloves, with gauntlets and veil of leno, will afford ample protection; the
                    latter should be a simple bag, open at top and bottom, but with half a yard of
                    elastic sewn in the top, through which should be passed the crown of a
                    broad-brimmed hat; the coat should be buttoned over the lower part. Bee-keepeι⅛
                    who meddle much with their bees soon become accustomed to stinging and do not
                    suffer much. Experiments have been made to ascertain the number of stings
                    required to inoculate the blood, aυd it has been stated that about thirty, at
                    the rate of three or four a day, will suffice, after which the effect of the
                    bee-poison is trivial. Persons unaccustomed to the poison, however, often suffer
                    severely.</p>
                <p>We conclude by observing that the honey-bee (√fp⅛ <hi rend="italic"
                    >mellificet)</hi> is supposed to be of Asiatic origin. It was imported from
                    Europe to America, where it is now found wild in great numbers, and at a vast
                    distance from human habitations. An excellent treatise, <hi rend="italic">The
                    Honey-Bee, its Natural History, Physiology, and Management,</hi> was published
                    in 1827 by Dr Edward Bevan. It contains some of the best practical remarks on
                    the subject that are anywhere to be met with, and gives a fair account of the
                    labours of the author’s predecessors, Reaumur, Hunter, <pb break="no"

                    Langstroth, of New York, has also written a very excellent volume on <hi

                    Berlepsch, and Von Siebold of Germany, we are indebted for many accurate and
                    valuable observations on physiology and hive management; and a <hi rend="italic"
                    >Manual of Bee-keeping,</hi> written in 1875 by Mr John Hunter, secretary of the
                    British Beekeepers’ Association, contains much practical information on
                    scientific and profitable beekeeping. We may add that the above association,
                    established in 1874 under the presidency of Sir John Lubbock, is the first
                    vigorous effort made in England to extend and improve this neglected although
                    valuable branch of rural economy. (J∙ ∏∙)</p>
