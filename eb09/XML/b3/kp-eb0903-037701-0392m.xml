                <p><label type="entry">BARLOW, <hi rend="smallcaps">Joel</hi></label>, an Amercian
                    poet and politician, born in 1755 at Reading in Connecticut. In 1774, some years
                    after his father’s death, he was entered at Yale College, New Haven, where he
                    soon began to manifest considerable taste for poetry and power of composition. A
                    few small pieces published by him were received with some degree of public
                    favour. During his vacations he had taken part with the colonists in several
                    engagements against the British, and immediately after completing his course, he
                    qualified himself for the church, and was appointed chaplain to a regiment. This
                    post he held till the conclusion of peace between Britain and America, when he
                    settled in the village of Hartford, and began to practise as a lawyer. He also
                    conducted a newspaper, and about the same time published his best poem, the <hi
                    rend="italic">Vision of Columbus,</hi> a vigorous and spirited piece of writing.
                    About the year 1788 he gave up his newspaper and his legal practice, and came to
                    Europe as the agent for a land company. Having discovered that this company was
                    merely a swindling concern, he severed his connection with it, but did not
                    return to America. In London he became acquainted with some of the most advanced
                    liberal thinkers, and published several political tracts of a decidedly
                    revolutionary character. In 1793, after having been some time in France, he
                    accompanied the Commission of the National Convention, which was sent to
                    organize the newly-acquired territory in Savoy. During hi3 residence in Paris he
                    engaged in commercial transactions, by which he acquired considerable fortune
                    and importance. In 1795 he was appointed American consul at Algiers, and
                    efficiently discharged the duties of that office. In 1805 he returned to America
                    and began to interest himself in the politice of his own country. A pamphlet of
                    his, sketching a plan of national education, was received with great favour. In
                    1808 he published an enlarged edition of his great poem, under the title <hi
                    rend="italic">Colum-biad.</hi> It was magnificently illustrated, but did not
                    achieve the popularity of its predecessor. In 1811 he was appointed minister
                    plenipotentiary to France, with the object mainly of negotiating a commercial
                    treaty and of obtaining compensation for some American property that had been
                    unjustly confiscated. To accomplish this he required a personal interview with
                    Napoleon, and set out to meet the emperor, who was at Wilna. On his way he was
                    attacked with inflammation of the lungs, and died at a Polish village near
                    Cracow, on the 22d December 1812.</p>
