                    version of the Indian legendary history of the Buddha, Sakya Muni.</p>
                <p>The remarkable parallel between Buddhistic ritual, costume, and discipline, and
                    those which especially claim the title of Catholic in the Christian church, has
                    often been recognized, even by the most faithful sons of Rome; <hi
                    rend="superscript"> 1</hi> and though the parallel has perhaps never been
                    elaborated as it might be, some of its more salient points are familiar. Still,
                    many readers may be unaware that Sakya ΛIuni himself, or, as he was by birth,
                    Siddharta, the son of Suddodhana, prince of Kapilavastu (in the north of modern
                    Oudh), has found his way into the Roman calendar as a saint of the church.</p>
                <p>The Christian story first appears in Greek among the works of St John of
                    Damascus, an eminent divine, and an opponent of the Emperor Leo the Isaurian in
                    the Iconoclastic movement, who flourished in the early part of the 8th century,
                    and who, before he adopted the monastic life and devoted himself to theology,
                    had held high office at the court of the caliph Abu Jâfar Almansûr, as his
                    father Sergius is said to have done before him. <hi rend="superscript">
                    2</hi></p>
                <p>The outline of the Greek story is as follows :—St Thomas had converted the people
                    of India, and after the eremitic life originated in Egypt, many Indians adopted
                    it. But a powerful pagan king arose who hated and persecuted the Christians,
                    especially the ascetics. After this king, Abenncr by name, had long been
                    childless, a boy greatly desired, and matchless in beauty, was born to him, and
                    received the name of Josaphat. The king, in his joy, summons astrologers to
                    predict the child’s destiny. They foretell glory and prosperity beyond those of
                    all his predecessors. One sage, most learned of all, assents, but intimates that
                    the scene of this glory will be, not the paternal kingdom, but another
                    infinitely more exalted, and that the child will adopt the faith which his
                    father persecutes.</p>
                <p>The boy shows a thoughtful and devout turn. King Abenner, troubled by this and by
                    the remembrance of the prediction, selects a secluded city, in which he causes a
                    splendid palace to be built, where his son should abide, attended only by tutors
                    and servants in the flower of youth and health. No stranger was to have access,
                    and the boy was to be cognizant of none of the sorrows of humanity, such as
                    poverty, disease, old age, or death, but only of what was pleasant, so that he
                    should have no inducement to think of the future life; nor was he ever to hear a
                    word of Christ and his religion.</p>
                <p>Prince Josaphat grows up in this seclusion, acquires all kinds of knowledge, and
                    exhibits singular endowments. At length, on his urgent prayer, the king
                    reluctantly permits him to pass the limits of the palace, after having taken all
                    precautions to keep painful objects out of sight. But through some neglect of
                    orders, the prince one day encounters a leper and a blind man, and asks of his
                    attendants with pain and astonishment what such a spectacle should mean. These,
                    they tell him, are ills to which man is liable. Shall all men have such ills? he
                    asks. And in the end he returns home in deep depression. Another day he falls in
                    with a decrepit old man, and, stricken with dismay at the sight, renews his
                    questions, and hears for the first time of death. And in how many years,
                    continues the prince, does this fate befall man? and must he expect death as
                    inevitable? Is there <hi rend="italic">no</hi> way of escape? No means of
                    eschewing this wretched state of decay? The attendants reply as may be imagined;
                    and Josaphat goes home more pensive than ever, dwelling on the certainty of
                    death, and on what shall be thereafter.</p>
                <p>At this time Barlaam, an eremite of great sanctity and knowledge, dwelling in the
                    wilderness of Sennaritis, divinely warned, <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi> It has
                    been alleged that Père Huc, on returning to Europe, was astonished to find his
                    celebrated journey to Lhasa in the <hi rend="italic">Index,</hi> on the ground
                    of such recognition. But this seems to be untrue.</p>
                <p><hi rend="superscript"> 2</hi> St John’s authorship of the story has been
                    disputed. Prof. Max Müller, in the paper quoted below, seems to dispose
                    sufficiently of the objections. None of the old editions of St John’s works
                    contain the <hi rend="italic">Greek</hi> of the story. This, Prof. Müller
                    states, was first published in 1832 bv Boissonade, in his <hi rend="italic"
                    >Analecta Gr&lt;xca,</hi> vol. iv.</p>

                <p>travels to India in the disguise of a merchant, and gains access to Prince
                    Josaphat, to whom he imparts the Christian doctrine and commends the monastic
                    life. Suspicion arises and Barlaam departs. But all attempts to shake the
                    prince’s convictions fail. As a last resource the king sends for Theudas, a
                    magician, who removes the prince’s attendants and substitutes seductive girls;
                    but all their blandishments are resisted through prayer. The king abandons these
                    efforts and associates his son in the government. The prince uses his power to
                    promote religion, and everything prospers in his hands. At last Abenner himself
                    yields to the faith, and after some years of penitence dies. Josaphat surrenders
                    the kingdom to a friend called Barachias, and departs for the wilderness. After
                    two years of painful search, and much buffeting by demons, he finds Barlaam. The
                    latter dies, and Josaphat survives as a hermit many years. King Barachias
                    afterwards arrives, and transfers the bodies of the two saints to India, where
                    they are the source of many miracles.</p>
                <p>Now this story is, in all essentials and in many details, <hi rend="italic"
                    >mutatis</hi><hi rend="italic">mutandis,</hi> the story of Buddha. For
                    particulars we must refer to the papers of Μ. Müller and F. Liebrecht cited
                    below; we can indicate but one example in the prominent episode of Sakya’s
                    youth, his education in a secluded palace, his encounter successively with a
                    decrepit old man, with a man in mortal disease and poverty, with a dead body,
                    and, lastly, with a religious recluse radiant with peace and dignity, and his
                    consequent abandonment of his princely state for the ascetic life in the jungle.
                    Some of the correspondences in the two stories are most minute, and Prof. Müller
                    has pointed out that even the phraseology, in which some of the details of
                    Josaphat’s history are described, almost literally renders the Sanskrit of the
                    <hi rend="italic">Lalita Vistara.</hi></p>
                <p>We have given but the skeleton of the history of Barlaam and Josaphat. It is
                    filled out with episodes and apologues, several of which also have been traced
                    to Buddhist sources. These stories no doubt promoted the vast mediaeval
                    popularity of the legend in both the Greek and the Latin Churches. Its first
                    favour in the former seems to have been due to its embodiment in the <hi
                    rend="italic">Lives of the Saints,</hi> as compiled anew by Simeon the
                    Metaphrast, a person of disputed age, but not of later date than 1150 <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">a.d.</hi> Selections from his work, in which this legend takes
                    the lead, continue to be issued in Romaic as works of popular edification.</p>
                <p>At what time the two saints first found their place in the Roman martyrology we
                    have not been able to ascertain, but their story figures at length in the <hi
                    rend="italic">Speculum</hi><hi rend="italic">Historiale</hi> of Vincent of
                    Beauvais, and more briefly in the <hi rend="italic">Golden Legend</hi> of
                    Jacobus de Voragine, both of the 13th century. There is a church bearing the
                    dedication <hi rend="italic">Divo Iosaphat</hi> in Palermo, and probably others
                    in other Catholic cities.</p>
                <p>The story continued for centuries to be one of the most popular works in
                    Christendom. It was translated into most European tongues, including Bohemian,
                    Polish, and Icelandic. A version in the last, executed by a Norwegian king,
                    dates from 120-4; in the East there were versions in (at least) Arabic,
                    Ethiopie, Armenian, and Hebrew; whilst a translation into the Tagala language of
                    the Philippines was printed at Manilla in 1712. The story was rendered into
                    poems and miracle plays. Moreover, its episodes and apologues.have furnished
                    material to poets and story-writers of very diverse ages and characters, <hi
                    rend="italic">e.g.,</hi> to Boccaccio, to Gow er, to the compiler of the <hi
                    rend="italic">Gesta Romanorum,</hi> to Shakespeare himself, and to the late W.
                    Adams, author of the <hi rend="italic">King's Messengers. '</hi></p>
                <p>The identity of the stories of Buddha and St Josaphat was recognized by the
                    historian of Portuguese India, Diogo de Couto, as may be seen in his history
                    (Dec. v. liv. vi. cap. 2). In modern times it was first noticed (according to
                    Prof. If. Müller) by Μ. Laboulaye, in the <hi rend="italic">Journal</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">des Débats</hi> (21-26 July, 1859) · but it was more elaborately
