                <p><label type="entry">BALKH</label>, the ancient <hi rend="italic">Bactra</hi> or
                        <hi rend="italic">Zariaspa,</hi> was formerly a great city, but is now for
                    the most part a mass of ruins, situated on the right bank of the Adirsiah or
                    Balkh river, in a large and fertile plain 1800 feet above the sea. The modern
                    name is, according to Vambéry, the Turkish <hi rend="italic">batik,</hi> or <hi
                        rend="italic">balikh,</hi> a city. The ruins, which occupy a space of about
                    twenty miles in circuit, consist chiefly of fallen mosques and decayed buildings
                    of sun-burnt brick. No monuments of pre-Mahometan date have been pointed out, if
                    we except the bricks with cuneiform inscriptions which Ferrier asserts he
                    observed; but nothing like a proper investigation of the site has yet been
                    effected. The antiquity and greatness of the place are recognised by the native
                    populations, who speak of it as the <hi rend="italic">Mother of Cities.</hi> Its
                    foundation is mythically ascribed to Kaiomurs, the Persian Romulus; and it is at
                    least certain that, at a very early date, it was the rival of Ecbatana, Nineveh,
                    and Babylon. For a long time the city and country was the central seat of the
                    Zoroastrian religion, the founder of which is said to have died within the
                    walls. From the <hi rend="italic">Memoirs of Hwm Thsang,</hi> a Chinese
                    traveller, we learn that, at the time of his visit in the 7th century, there
                    were in the city, or its vicinity, about a hundred Buddhist convents, with 3000
                    devotees, and that there was a large number of <hi rend="italic">stupas,</hi>
                    and other religious monuments. The most remarkable was the <hi rend="italic">Nau
                        Behar, Nava Bihara,</hi> or New Convent, which possessed a very costly
                    statue of Buddha. A curious notice of this building is found in the Arabian
                    geographer Yâkût. Ibn-Haukal, an Arabian traveller of the 10th century,
                    describes Balkh as built of clay, with ramparts and six gates, and extending
                    half a parasang. He also mentions a castle and a mosque. El Edrisi, in the 12th
                    century, speaks of its possessing a variety of educational establishments, and
                    carrying on an active trade. There were several important commercial routes from
                    the city, stretching as far east as India and China. In 1220 Genghis Khan sacked
                    Balkh, butchered its inhabitants, and levelled all the buildings capable of
                    defence,—treatment to which it was again subjected in the 14th century by Timur.
                    Notwithstanding this, however, Marco Polo can still, in the following century,
                    describe it as “a noble city and a great.” Balkh formed the government of
                    Λurungzebe in his youth. In 1736 it was conquered by Nadir Shah. Under the
                    Durani monarchy it fell into the hands of the Afghans; it was conquered by Shah
                    Murad of Kunduz in 1820, and for some time has been subject to the Khan of
                    Bokhara.</p>
