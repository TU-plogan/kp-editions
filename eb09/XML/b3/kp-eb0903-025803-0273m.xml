                    the son of Beor, belonging to Pethor, by the River Euphrates in Aram, is
                    represented in Scripture as a seer who possessed the power of blessing and
                    cursing effectually. According to the narrative in Numbers xxii.-xxiv., he was
                    invited by Balak, king of Moab, to come and curse Israel, in order to ensure the
                    latter’s defeat. Jehovah, however, forbade him to go as he was requested, and
                    therefore he refused to accompany the deputation of elders, who had been sent to
                    invite him, “with the rewards of divination in their hand.” After the arrival of
                    a second embassy more imposing than the first, he received divine permission to
                    go, but only on condition that he should adhere strictly to what Jehovah should
                    tell him. He set out accordingly, and in his journey experienced the anger of
                    the Lord, an angel being sent to stop his progress, who was perceived only by
                    the ass on which the prophet was riding. After Balaam’s eyes had been opened he
                    saw the angel, and declared his willingness to go back, but received permission
                    to continue his journey on condition of saying nothing but what was suggested to
                    him by God. His reception by Balak was honourable and imposing, yet he continued
                    faithful to Jehovah, and told the king he would only announce what Jehovah
                    revealed. Standing on the height of Baal-Bamoth, and surveying the tents of
                    Israel, he declared his inability to curse a people so peculiar and righteous.
                    Brought next to the top of Pisgah, and beholding thence a part of the Israelite
                    camp, he announced that Jehovah saw no iniquity or perverseness in Jacob; that
                    He was with them; that they were therefore strong and <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit03newyrich/page/n274/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0903-0274-0259"/> victorious. Conducted afterwards to the top of
                    Peor, he surveyed the army of Israel, and predicted their future, their goodly
                    dwellings in Canaan, and their successful wars against the nations down to
                    Saul's time. Though Balak was angry and interrupted him, Balaam continued his
                    prophecy, announcing Israel’s valiant deeds, from David down to Hezekiah. Upon
                    this he returned to his home.</p>
                <p>Another account of Balaam appears in Numbers xxxi. 8-16, Joshua xiii. 22, where
                    we learn that he advised the Midianite women to seduce the Israehtes to the
                    licentious worship of Baal, and that he was slain in a war with the
                    Midianites.</p>
                <p>The character given to Balaam in the first account is a favourable one. He is a
                    worshipper of Jehovah the true God, reced es divine revelations, and repeatedly
                    declares that he will not go beyond or against them. Faithful to his calling, he
                    steadfastly resists temptations sufficiently powerful, and therefore God
                    communicates His Spirit to him, enabling him to predict the future of
                    Israel.</p>
                <p>The second account is unfavourable. In it he appears as a diviner, Dpiρ, a
                    heathen seer, who tempted the worshippers of the true God to idolatry. Instead
                    of being a prophet of Jehovah, receiving visions and revelations, a man to whom
                    the Almighty came by night, giving him instructions what to do, he is an immoral
                    soothsayer. Of the two accounts, the latter, brief as it is, seems entitled to
                    greater consideration. The former is elaborate and artificial, the theme being
                    the glorification of the chosen people by the mouth of one of their enemies. An
                    inspired seer from the far distant land of Aram is called in to bless the
                    Israelites. He does so reluctantly, but like a true prophet, announcing nothing
                    but what came to pass. The way in which he is taught the high destiny of the
                    chosen people is instructive. Ignorant at first of Israel’s relation to the true
                    God, and thinking they were like others, he was disposed to curse them, but is
                    enlightened, and forcibly impelled to follow the divine revelations. From a
                    heathen <hi rend="italic">mantis</hi> he is converted into a true prophet by
                    revelations and visions which he cannot resist. The seer is taken to three
                    places in succession, whence he surveys Israel, and utters oracular sayings
                    concerning them. Three times the angel of the Lord stands in the way, and three
                    times the ass is smitten by Balaam. There are four prophetic
                    announcements—xxiii. 7-10, 18-24; xxiv. 3-9, 15-24. The first refers to the
                    separate condition of Israel, their numbers, and their worship of the true God
                    amid the idolatry of the surrounding nations. The second declares that God
                    blesses Israel because there is no iniquity or perverseness in them, that He
                    dwells among them, reveals himself to them, and makes them powerful and
                    victorious. Both these refer to Mosaic times, or at least to times not later
                    than Joshua. But the third announcement has the character of prediction, and
                    refers to future events. Hence Balaam is introduced as a man whose eyes are
                    opened, who hears the words of God, and sees visions of the Almighty. The
                    condition of the people down to the time of Saul is glanced at, their secure
                    settlement in Canaan, and victorious wars with the native races. The fourth
                    prophecy apparently carries down the history to the time of Hezekiah; and a
                    future ruler is distinguished as the star out of Jacob, the sceptre out of
                    Israel, the conqueror of the Moabites and Edomites. The mention of the Kenites
                    and Assyria in ver. 22, the former of whom were allies of Edom, shows, in the
                    opinion of some recent critics, that the writer was acquainted with the Edomite
                    wars under Amaziah and Uzziah, and hoped that the latter power would permanently
                    subjugate the restless Edomites. This would bring the composition down to the
                    first half of the 8th century. Verses 23 and 24 are obscure, but probably refer
                    to no event later than</p>
                <p>Hezekiah. A fleet from the Phoenician Cyprians seems to have attacked the
                    Canaanitish and Phoenician coasts, threatening the Syrians farther north.</p>
                <p>The writer of Num. xxxi. 8, 16, Joshua xiii. 22, is the Elohist, whose account is
                    very brief. Meagre, however, as it is, it is probably historical. A heathen
                    soothsayer, connected with the Midianites, perished in one of their battles with
                    Israel. The writer of Numbers xxii,-xxiv. is, in this view, the Jehovist, who,
                    under the name of Balaam, gives expression to his ideas and hopes in the
                    elevated diction of an inspired prophet. As Jacob and Moses had pronounced
                    blessings on Israel under the immediate inspiration of the Almighty, so Balaam
                    is summoned from a distant land to eulogise the same people.</p>
                <p>The character of Balaam has been apprehended very variously. Such diversity must
                    exist according as the Elohist or Jehovist is followed. The Old Testament
                    writers who mentioned him afterwards were influenced by the Jehovistic notice,
                    and pronounce no judgment upon the seer (Deut, xxiii. 5, 6; Joshua xxiv. 9, 10;
                    Micah vi. 5; Nehemiah xiii. 2); but the New Testament authors followed the
                    Elohistic account, and speak of him disparagingly, attributing to him love of
                    “the wages of unrighteousness,” madness, idolatrousness, and impiety (2 Peter
                    ii. 15, 16; Jude 11; Rev. ii. 14). Josephus calls him μ⅛ιs αpιστos <hi
                    rend="italic">των τότε,</hi> “the best prophet of his time,” supposing him to be
                    a prophet of the true God, but with a disposition ill-adapted to resist
                    temptation. Philo describes his character more critically: “There was a man at
                    that time celebrated for divination, who lived in Mesopotamia, and was an adept
                    in all the forms of the divining art; but in no branch was he more admired than
                    in augury; to many persons, and on many occasions, he gave great and astounding
                    proofs of his skill. For to some he foretold storms in the height of summer; to
                    others drought and heat in the depth of winter <hi rend="italic">; to</hi> some
                    scarcity succeeding a fruitful year, and then again abundance after scarcity; to
                    others the overflowing and drying up of rivers, and the remedies of pestilential
                    diseases, and a vast multitude of other things, each of which he acquired great
                    fame for predicting.” The unfavourable character drawn of him by Philo is that
                    which is generally taken by the later Jews. The later Targumists call him a
                    sinner and an accursed man, while the Talmudists make him the representative of
                    the godless, in contrast with Abraham, the representative of the pious. Yet they
                    do not ignore his prophetic gift. The Midrashim about him are hardly worth
                    mentioning, such as that he was one of Pharaoh’s counsellors, that he was
                    governor of a city in Ethiopia which he excited to rebellion, but was unable to
                    defend against Moses at the head of an army who stormed the place and put Balaam
                    to flight. In Yalkut (§ Shemoth) he is said to have been identified by some with
                    Laban, Jacob’s father-in-law; by others with Elihu, Job’s friend; while others
                    say that Jannes and Jambres were his sons. In Sanhedrin (§ Chelek) he is said to
                    have been blind of an eye. These, and other rabbinical fables, are entirely
                    worthless; and Origen’s belief that the Magi from Persia, who came to worship
                    the infant King of the Jews, learnt the meaning of the star from Balaam’s
                    prophecies, is of the same character.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                <p>Most of the Fathers, including Augustine and Ambrose, judged him to be a
                    soothsayer or magician, a prophet inspired by the devil. A few, as Tertullian
                    and Jerome, took a more favourable view of his character. The Mahometans have
                    various fables concerning Balaam. They say that he was of the race of Anakim, or
                    giants of Palestine, and that he read the books of Abraham, where he got the
                    name Jehovah, by virtue of which he predicted the <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0903-0275-0260"/> future, and got from God whatever he asked. This
                    procured him great renown. In consequence, however, of his prevarication, God
                    was offended with him, and left him to himself, so that he fell into infidelity.
                    It is generally supposed that the words in the Koran (§ Al-Araf) refer to him
                    :—“The history of him unto whom we brought our signs and he departed from them;
                    wherefore Satan followed him, and he became one of those who were seduced. And
                    if we had pleased, we had surely raised him thereby unto wisdom; but he inclined
                    unto the earth, and followed his own desire. Wherefore his likeness is as the
                    likeness of a dog, which, if thou drive him away, putteth forth his tongue; or
                    if thou let him alone, putteth forth his tongue also.”</p>
                <p>It has been conjectured with much probability that the Arabic wise man, commonly
                    called Lokman, is identical with Balaam. The two names coincide in meaning, <hi

                    typical designation of Israel’s enemy; and this is reflected in the Greek word
                    N&lt;κoλαfrηs (Rev. ii. 6), from <hi rend="italic">νικάν</hi> and λαJr, as if
                    the Nicolaitanes were essentially Balaamites, or seducers. But this etymology of
                    the name Balaam is improbable.</p></note> and the names of their fathers are
                    also alike. The Jews suppose Balaam to have been a Nahorite, and so Lokman is
                    regarded by many Arabic authors, though the more general opinion is that he was
                    an Abyssinian slave who lived in the time of David, and was renowned as a Hakim.
                    The proverbs or fables attributed to him are of Greek origin.</p>
                <p>Modem critics are divided in opinion respecting him. Three leading views embrace
                    the varieties of belief as to his true position, viz., that he was an idolater
                    and soothsayer, whose soul was uninfluenced by true religion—a sorcerer who had
                    acquired reputation by his insight into the force of nature and his
                    incantations; that he was a true prophet of God, a pious man who fell through
                    covetousness; and that he was a heathen soothsayer and a prophet of Jehovah at
                    the same time, occupying an intermediate position, with an incipient knowledge
                    and fear of God, needing but to be developed, though checked by the love of
                    gain. It appears impossible to arrive at a definite or comprehensive view of one
                    who is described in different sources inconsistently. Bishop Butler, not
                    recognising that the history of Balaam has poetical elements, and that different
                    traditions are given respecting him, considers him a very wicked man under a
                    deep sense of God and religion, persisting still in his wickedness, and
                    preferring the wages of unrighteousness even when he had before him a lively
                    view of death. His mind was distracted by contradictory principles of action.
                    All we know about him amounts to very little. After admitting that a heathen
                    soothsayer of this name existed in Mesopotamia, and had acquired some renown in
                    the regions adjoining, and that he was employed in some way as a medium for
                    uttering eulogiums upon Israel, of whose pre-eminence and permanence he is fully
                    conscious, nothing else can be affirmed with certainty. (Davidson’s <hi
