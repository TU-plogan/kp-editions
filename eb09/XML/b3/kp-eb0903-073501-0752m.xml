                <p>From Birds which have recently become altogether extinct we naturally turn to
                    those that have of late been extirpated, in certain countries though still
                    surviving elsewhere. Several such instances are furnished by the British
                    Islands. First there is the Crane <hi rend="italic">(Grus communis}</hi> which
                    in Turner’s time (1555) was described as breeding in our fens. Then the
                    Spoonbill <hi rend="italic">(Platalea</hi><hi rend="italic">leucorodia},</hi>
                    said by Sir Thomas Browne <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit03newyrich/page/n753/mode/1up"

                    done in Norfolk. The Capercally <hi rend="italic">(Tetrao</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >urogallus)</hi> we know to have frequented the indigenous pine-forests of
                    Ireland and Scotland. In the former it had most likely become extinct soon after
                    1760, and in the latter not much later. Not a single specimen of the British
                    stock of this bird is known to exist in any museum, but the species has been
                    successfully introduced from Sweden into Scotland during the last forty years,
                    and is now certainly increasing in numbers. The Bustard <hi rend="italic">(Otis
                    tarda),</hi> which once tenanted the downs and open country of England from
                    Dorset to the East Riding of Yorkshire, vanished from Norfolk, its last
                    stronghold as a British Bird, in 1838. From other counties it had before
                    disappeared. It is well worthy of note that all the four species just mentioned
                    were protected to a certain degree by Acts of Parliament, but these laws only
                    gave immunity to their eggs and none to the parent-birds during the breeding
                    season, thus shewing how futile is the former when compared with the latter,
                    since there are very many species whose nests from time out of mind have been
                    and are yearly pillaged without any disastrous consequences arising from the
                    practice.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>The singular
                    wisdom of the old command (Deut, xxii. 6)—the most ancient “game-law” (using the

                    exemplification.</p></note></p>
                <p>It would be impossible here to name the many Birds which, once numerous in the
                    British Islands, have now so much diminished as to be rightly considered scarce,
                    or to recount the various causes to which their diminution is due. The
                    persecution of Birds-of-prey seems to have begun with the keepers of poultry, to
                    whom the Kite <hi rend="italic">(Milvus</hi><hi rend="italic">ictinus)</hi> and
                    the Hen-Harrier <hi rend="italic">(Circus</hi><hi rend="italic">cyaneus)</hi>
                    were a sore trouble,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>The
                    Bohemian Schaschek, who visited England about 1461, says he had nowhere seen so
                    many Kites as around London Bridge (BιδZ. <hi rend="italic">Lit. Ver.
                    Stuttgart,</hi> vii. p. 40). And the statement is confirmed by Belon (Oδs. <hi
                    rend="italic">ad. fin.</hi><hi rend="italic">Clus. Exot.</hi> p. 108), who says
                    that they were scarcely more numerous in Cairo than in London, feeding on the
                    garbage of the streets and even of the Thames. From the same writer <hi
                    rend="italic">(Hist. Nat. Oyseaux,</hi> p. 131) it would seem that at that time
                    (1555) they, and Ravens also, were protected by law in the City! The
                    Hen-Harrier’s name is enough to shew what was thought of it in days when it
                    abounded.</p></note> but it has been actively followed up by game-preservers,

                    be attributed the extermination or Tarification of far more species than the

                    fate, and preserve to our posterity the most pleasing features of many a
                    landscape and the grateful opportunities of studying many a curious and
                    interesting species. Thanks, perhaps, to the stronger constitution of most
                    Palaearctic Birds, the votaries of what is called “acclimatization” have
                    obtained little success in these islands, for the exotic specieswhich it has
                    been attempting to introduce have, almost without exception, failed to establish
                    themselves. The efforts made in some British colonies—particularly in
                    Australasia—are unfortunately too likely not to be successful; and, when their
                    own peculiar fauna has been half extirpated, our fellow-subjects at the
                    antipodes will probably have good reason to lament the extraordinary sentiment
                    that has led them to introduce from other countries birds which, in the absence
                    of their natural checks, will be nothing else than a positive nuisance; for so
                    reckless is the manner in which they have been imported, that species possessing
                    few or exceedingly doubtful recommendations to begin with have been carried over
                    in abundance, and some of these cannot fail to become permanent settlers equally
                    with those for the transportation of which the would-be “acclimatizers” might
                    find themselves excused. All, however, in the battle of life will contribute
                    first to the subdual and by degrees to the disappearance of the original
                    inhabitants, which had hitherto constituted a fauna, from a scientific point of
                    view, perhaps the most interesting on the face of the globe.</p>
                <p>GEOGRAPHICAL DISTRIBUTION OF BIRDS.</p>
                <p>It is admitted by nearly all naturalists that the study of the extinct organisms
                    of any country leads the investigator of them to a proper appreciation of its
                    existing flora or fauna; while, on the other hand, a due consideration of the
                    plants or animals which may predominate within its bounds cannot fail to throw
                    more or less light on the changes it has in the course of ages undergone. That
                    is to say that the Distribution of forms in Time is a subject so much connected
                    with the Distribution of forms in Space, that the one can hardly be separated
                    from the other. Granting this as a general truth, it must yet be acknowledged as
                    a special fact, which some of the preceding paragraphs will perhaps have
                    foreshadowed, that in fossil Ornithology we have as yet but scanty means of
                    arriving at any precise results which will justify bold generalization in the
                    matter of aviarian distribution. Remains of extinct forms of Birds are, compared
                    with those of other classes of Vertebrates, exceedingly scarce, and in
                    accordance, therefore, with the prevalent practice of naturalists they have been
                    but little investigated. If we except France and New Zealand—and in the latter
                    no fossil ornithic relics can be assigned to any very ancient epochs—little has
                    been done. The discovery in the former of somewhat early remains of Birds,
                    allied to those which we at present only know as denizens of a tropical region,
                    and the recognition of far later remains of species identical with those that
                    now flourish in arctic lands, merely corroborates what is from numerous sources
                    within the knowledge of every geologist—the vicissitudes, namely, of which that
                    part of Europe has had experience. Though in this quarter of the globe we now
                    have no indigenous Struthious Birds, the former existence of Struthious Birds
                    even in England provee very little, because we know that some of such birds (the
                    species of South-American <hi rend="italic">Rhea,</hi> for instance) can
                    maintain themselves in lands which are subject to a climate as fitful, if not as
                    severe, as our own. All that can be justly inferred thence is that Struthious
                    Birds were not formerly confined to their present limits, and possibly that such
                    birds once pervaded the greater part of the earth’s surface. The <hi
                    rend="italic">Archaeopteryx</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Odontopteryx</hi> from
                    their singularity prove nothing in respect of Geographical Distribution. Perhaps
                    in the whole range of zoology there is no class from the fossil remains of which
                    we learn less as regards the physical history of our planet than we do from the
                    Birds. We, therefore, have to turn to the other side of the question of
                    Distribution, and try to find out whether the <pb break="no"

                    evidently deficient, may not be supplied by inquiry into existing <hi
                    rend="italic">avifauna</hi>. and this, in other words, signifies that a
                    knowledge of the Geographical Distribution of living Birds becomes a matter of
                    prime necessity to every one who would intelligently exercise the calling of an
                    ornithologist.</p>
                <p>Thus driven to a kind of extremity, the student of Birds, however, cannot but
                    regard with the most lively satisfaction the circumstance that to one of his
                    brethren is due the merit of having first truly pointed out the great
                    Zoogeographical Regions of the globe—a fact not a little surprising w hen w e
                    reflect that the outlines of Distribution laid down in 1857 by Mr Sclater<note

                    much to be regretted that the author of this most valuable essay has never
                    sanctioned its republication in another and improved form. Many of its details,
                    and some of its principles even, are now known to be incorrect, but for the time
                    at which it appeared it was a marvellous production.</p></note> had reference
                    only to the most vagrant Class of animals in creation; yet these outlines have,
                    not merely in the main, but to a very great extent in detail, met with the
                    approval of nearly all those zoologists who have since studied the subject in
                    its bearing upon the particular Classes in the knowledge of which they
                    themselves stand pre-eminent.</p>
                <p>Without infringing upon what must be deemed the generalities of biological
                    Distribution, it is proper to observe that Mr Sclater’s success is to be
                    attributed to the method in which his investigations were carried on—a method in
                    which he had but few predecessors. Instead of looking at the earth’s surface
                    from the point of view which the geographer would take of it (a point of view
                    which had hitherto been adopted by most writers), mapping out the world
                    according to degrees of latitude and longitude, determining its respective
                    portions of land and water entirely regardless of the products of either
                    element, or adhering to its political divisions—time-honoured as they were,—he
                    endeavoured to solve the question simply as a zoologist should, by taking up the
                    branch of the subject with which he was best acquainted, and by pointing out and
                    defining the several Regions of the globe in conformity with the various aspects
                    of ornithic life which they present. But herein there was at once a grave
                    difficulty to be encountered. Birds being of all animals most particularly
                    adapted for extended and rapid locomotion, it became necessary for him to
                    eliminate from his consideration those groups, be they large or small, which are
                    of more or less universal occurrence,<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    contained others—sub-families, genera, or species strictly limited to certain
                    localities. . Some of these will be noticed further on.</p></note> and to ground
                    his results on what was at that time commonly known as the order <hi
                    rend="italic">Insessores</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Passeres,</hi> comprehending
                    the orders now generally differentiated as <hi rend="italic">Passeres</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">(veroe), Picarioe,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Psittaci.</hi></p>
                <p>On this basis then Mr Sclater was enabled to set forth that the surface of the
                    globe exhibited <hi rend="italic">six</hi> great Regions, each in a marked
                    manner differing from all the rest, though the difference was not always equally
                    important. These Regions he termed respectively the Palaearctic, Ethiopian,
                    Indian, Australian, Nearctic, and Neotropical; and though it is on all accounts
                    better to preserve the names he bestowed on them, it does not seem convenient to
                    follow the order in which he placed them. Thus the Australian Region appears not
                    only to differ more from the others than they do among themselves, but its
                    differences are of a kind which, when its fauna is considered as a whole,
                    suggest a striking peculiarity, namely, that many of the forms of animal life
                    therein found are the direct and not very much modified descendants of types
                    which may very likely at an early period of our planet’s history have
                    predominated over every land, but of types which have since been elsewhere in
                    great part replaced by more highly developed structures. The lower rank in the
                    scale of its most characteristic animals seems to be indisputable, and,
                    therefore, with the Australian Region it appears most proper to begin.<note

                    with hearty thanks the very singular mark of confidence conferred on him by his

                    from the Indian, which, from a geographical and possibly from a geological point

                    separates the small islands of Bali and Lombok, and will be found to determine
                    the boundary between two entirely distinct portions of the earth’s surface.
                    Midway along this channel we may draw a line in our imagination, and continue it

                    in the two islands last named is indeed to be observed, and even a slight
                    intermingling of the productions of the two former seems now to be going on; but
                    the inosculation is so much less in degree than that which obtains between any
                    other two Regions, while the characteristic, not to say peculiar, zoological
                    types which occupy either side of this line are so divergent, that it may be
                    fairly considered a harder and faster line than any that can elsewhere be found.
                    Between Bali and Lombok, as above stated, it has been shewn by Mr Wallace to be
                    all but perfect, and in his honour this boundary, as real in the abstract as
                    though it existed in the concrete, has been most justly named after the
                    naturalist and traveller who first saw and recognized its importance—“Wallace’s
                    Line.”<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>This name was
                    first given by Professor Huxley <hi rend="italic">{Proc. Zool. Soc.</hi> 1868,
                    p. 313), but as it is hardly a geographical term, it will accordingly make no
                    appearance on any save a so-called “physical” map. The value of the discovery
                    above mentioned, of which no one had ever dreamt till it was made by Mr Wallace,
                    seems to justify proper notice from chartographers, and it might be well,
                    therefore, to dignify the channel between Bali and Lombok—named on some maps
                    Lombok Strait—by the appellation of “Wallace’s Strait.”</p></note> As above
                    indicated, this line becomes less definitive as it proceeds further northward';
                    and though we know it to pass between the Philippine Islands and Sanguir, and
                    again between the former and the Palau group, its further progress in that
                    direction cannot as yet be set down with precision, though it probably runs to
                    the westward of the Ladrones. But hereabouts we lose sight of it, until we
                    arrive at the Sandwich Islands, to the northward of which it must pass, since
                    for reasons presently to be given at greater length that archipelago must be
                    confined within the Australian Region. Southward from Lombok the boundary of the
                    Region rounds the western coast of Australia, and then strikes off in a
                    south-easterly direction to encompass New Zealand and its dependencies. Arrived
                    here it must be drawn so as to include all of what is commonly known as
                    Polynesia, though the characters of the intermittent chain of islets lying
                    parallel to and just to the southward of the Tropic of Capricorn, and a few
                    scattered reefs to the northward of the equator (between long. 108° and 115°
                    W.), are at present insufficiently determined. After encircling, however, the
                    Low Archipelago and the Marquesas, the boundary trends to the north-west, and
                    includes, as before stated, the Sandwich Islands; but thence its precise
                    direction cannot now be traced, owing to the obscurity which veils the numerous
                    islets of the North Pacific Ocean, which <pb break="no"

                    that can be said for certain is, that it does not comprise the Aleutian Islands,
                    the empire of Japan, or the Loochoos.</p>
                <p>Though the characteristic Mammals of the Australian Region are in every way
                    highly remarkable, entirely comprehending as they do one of the three Subclasses
                    <hi rend="italic">(Omitho-delphia)</hi> and nearly all of a second <hi
                    rend="italic">(Didelphia'),</hi> by far the largest portion of the area it
                    covers is weak if not absolutely wanting in Mammalian life, and the zoological
                    features which mark the Region as a whole are perhaps better exhibited by its
                    Birds than by any other Class of its fauna. This being the case, it may be
                    excusable in this place to dwell longer upon this Region than upon the rest.
                    True it is that we have no Subclass of birds, like the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Ornithodelphia</hi> among Mammals, which is restricted to the Region; but, on
                    the other hand, the instance of the <hi rend="italic">Didelphia,</hi> to which
                    allusion has just now been made, is here almost exactly paralleled by that of
                    the Struthious Birds—the <hi rend="italic">Ratitoe,</hi> to call them by the
                    name now very generally applied to them by the zoologists who recognize them as
                    forming one of the two primary divisions or Subclasses, we may term them, of the
                    Class <hi rend="italic">Aves.</hi> All the existing <hi rend="italic"
                    >Ratitoe</hi> (with the exception of the species of two forms, the Ostriches of
                    Africa and South America, belonging to the genera <hi rend="italic"
                    >Struthio</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Rhea,</hi> and comprising at most but five
                    species) are found within the Australian Region and nowhere else. But further,
                    the <hi rend="italic">Ratitoe</hi> of the Region are more •widely distributed
                    throughout its area than are the <hi rend="italic">Didelphia,</hi> since the
                    former extend from Ceram, in lat. 4° S. and long. 130° E., to New Zealand in
                    lat. 45° S. and long. 175° E., if not a little further, while the <hi
                    rend="italic">Didelphia</hi> stop short at lat. 44° S. and long. 155° E.<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Of course, as regards
                    polymorphism, no comparison can be made between the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Ratitas</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">Didelphia,</hi> the latter presenting a
                    very great variety and the former a very great sameness of structure and habit,
                    though if it be true, as seems to be most likely the case, that <hi
                    rend="italic">Dinornis</hi> and its allies were absolutely devoid of wings, we
                    should in them have a divergence from the normal ornithic type which is
                    altogether unique in the whole Class, and for its singularity might well be set
                    off against the multifariousness exhibited by the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Didelphia.</hi></p></note> But if we take the birds alone, and compare the two
                    Subclasses into which the existing or recent members of the Class are divided,
                    we find the Australian Region remarkable for its ornithic singularity. The
                    smaller of these two Subclasses, the <hi rend="italic">Ratitoe,</hi> contains
                    six very natural groups—which might well be called Orders—including, according
                    to the most exaggerated computation of their number, less than 40 species, while
                    the larger Subclass, the <hi rend="italic">Carinatoe,</hi> though perhaps not
                    including more truly natural groups, comprehends some 10,000 species. Now, out
                    of the six groups of this smaller Subclass, four are absolutely restricted to
                    the Australian Region, and these four groups contain all but, at the highest
                    estimate, as above stated, five of the species known to belong to the Subclass;
                    thus we should be able to regard the 35 species of recent <hi rend="italic"
                    >Ratitoe</hi> of the Region (a number which is clearly far too large) as the
                    proportional equivalent of an avifauna of more than 8000 species (8750).</p>
                <p>Leaving, however, such a calculation as this, which indeed cannot as yet be more
                    than an approximation to the truth, we must consider first the remaining
                    ornithic features of the Region as a whole, and then those of its parts. With
                    respect to each of those subjects, it will be evident to every one that a
                    further division is at once incumbent upon us. The prevalent zoological features
                    of any Region are of two kinds—negative and positive. It is therefore just as
                    much the business of the zoogeographer, who wishes to arrive at the truth, to
                    ascertain what groups of animals are wanting in any particular locality
                    (altogether independently of its extent) as to determine those which are
                    forthcoming there.</p>
                <p>Of course, in the former case it would be absurd to regard as a physical feature
                    of any great value the absence from a district of groups which do not occur
                    except in its immediate neighbourhood; but when we find that certain groups,
                    though abounding in some part of the vicinity, either suddenly cease from
                    appearing or appear only in very reduced numbers, and occasionally in abnormal
                    forms, the fact obviously has an important bearing. Now, as has been above
                    stated, mere geographical considerations, taken from the situation and
                    configuration of the islands of the so-called Indian or Malay Archipelago, would
                    indicate that they extended in an unbroken series from the shores of the Strait
                    of Malacca to the southern coast of New Guinea, which confronts that of North
                    Australia in Torres Strait, or even further to the eastward. Indeed, the very
                    name Australasia, often applied to this part of the world, would induce the
                    belief that all the countless islands, be they large or small—and some of them
                    are among the largest on the globe—were but a southern prolongation of the
                    mainland of Asia. But. it has been already stated that so far from this being
                    the case a very definite barrier is interposed. A strait, some 15 miles or so in
                    width, and separating the two fertile but otherwise insignificant islands of
                    Bali and Lombok, makes such a frontier as can hardly be shewn to exist
                    elsewhere. The former of these two islands belongs to the Indian Region, the
                    latter to the Australian, and between them there is absolutely no true
                    transition— that is, no species are common to both which cannot be easily
                    accounted for by the various accidents and migrations that in the course of time
                    must have tended to mingle the productions of islands so close to one another.
                    The faunas of the two are as absolutely distinct as those of South America and
                    Africa, and it is only because they are separated by a narrow strait instead of
                    the broad Atlantic that they have become so slightly connected by the
                    interchange of a few species and genera.</p>
                <p>Now, first, of the forms of Birds which are prevalent throughout the Indian
                    Region, but are entirely wanting in the Australian, we have at once the Bulbuls
                    <hi rend="italic">(Ixidoe),</hi> very characteristic of most parts of Africa and
                    Asia, with the allied group of <hi rend="italic">Phyllomithidoe,</hi> which is
                    peculiar to the Indian Region; the widely-spread families of Barbets <hi
                    rend="italic">(Megaloemidoe)</hi> and Vultures (<hi rend="italic"
                    >Vulturidoe)</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> and the Pheasants <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Phasianidoe),</hi> which attain so great a development in various parts of the
                    Asiatic continent and islands that there must their home be regarded as fixed,
                    though some species are found very far removed from the <hi rend="italic"

                    is one that can only be maintained by structural characters, which though patent
                    in their extreme forms, appear to vanish in those which are intermediate <hi

                    that they are the direct descendants of the more generalized group whence sprang
                    both the true <hi rend="italic">Fringillidoe</hi> and the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Ploceidoe,</hi> if, indeed, these can justifiably be kept apart. Then, of forms

                <p>Turning to the families which by their presence characterize the Australian
                    Region, we find those which are peculiar to it to be perhaps, if not more
                    numerous, yet more remarkable than the peculiar families of any other Region.
                    Nearly 20 such might here be enumerated. One, the Honeysuckers <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Meliphagidoe</hi><note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>This

                    by systematists.</p></note><hi rend="italic">),</hi> is most characteristic,
                    and, abounding in genera and species, extends to almost every part of the
                    region, yet only a single species oversteps its limits, crossing the sea from
                    Lombok to Bali.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>This is
                    <hi rend="italic">Ptilotis</hi><hi rend="italic">limbata,</hi> a species which
                    is common from Timor to Lombok.</p></note> Other peculiar families are much more
                    confined, and, since by their means (as will presently appear) the various
                    subdivisions of the Region may be more clearly marked out, further notice of
                    them may be for the present deferred. But the positive characteristics of the
                    Region as a whole are not its peculiar forms alone; there are at least 4
                    families which, being feebly represented elsewhere, here attain the maximum of
                    development. Such are the Thickheaded Shrikes <hi rend="italic"
                    >{Pachycephalidoe),</hi> the Caterpillareaters <hi rend="italic"
                    >lflamρephagidae</hi><hi rend="italic">∖</hi> the Flowerpeckers <hi

                    Art amid</hi><hi rend="italic">oe).</hi> Besides these, 3 or perhaps 4 groups,
                    though widely distributed throughout the world, arrive in the Australian Region
                    at their culmination, presenting an abundance of most varied forms. These are
                    theWeaver-birds (2‰α√cε),and theM0rep0rks(P0dαr7i√ce). if they can be properly
                    separated from the <hi rend="italic">Fringillidae</hi> and the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Caprimulgidae</hi> respectively, but especially the Kingfishers <hi

                    Region a degree of prominence and beauty which is elsewhere unequalled.</p>
                <p>Without going into greater detail, the Australian Region may be roughly said to
                    be composed of <hi rend="italic">four</hi> Subregions, to which the names of
                    Papua (or New Guinea), Australia proper, New Zealand, and Polynesia may perhaps
                    be attached. The boundaries of some of these Subregions are, as may be expected,
                    not well defined; and, indeed, it is obvious that much must be done in the way
                    of geographical exploration before the investigation of zoologists will mark out
                    their limits with positive accuracy. Especially is this true in respect of the
                    first of these Subregions, which in certain parts shows a complication of
                    characters that for want of space could hardly here be explained, if, indeed,
                    according to our present information, they can be explained at all.</p>
                <p>(1.) <hi rend="italic">The Papuan Subregion,</hi> the chief province of which is
                    formed by New Guinea and its dependencies, comprises, besides the large and
                    imperfectly-known island whence its name is derived, three other provinces,
                    which may be named the Timorese, the Celebesian, and the Moluccan. The fauna of
                    the Timor group seems to be made up of contributions from Java, belonging to the
                    Indian region, the Moluccas, and Australia. Of nearly 100 genera and 160 species
                    of Land-birds only, which are here found, an equal proportion appears to be
                    related to the Birds of the Indian Region and to those of Australia proper—some
                    30 genera being distinctly traceable to each. The Indian influence is made
                    evident by the presence of about 27 genera which have crossed the strait from
                    Bali into Lombok. Of these, 12 are known to stop short at Flores, but the inter
                    vening island of Sumbawa has not yet been ornithologically explored, and 13 of
                    them reach Timor. In all there may be, disregarding birds of wide distribution,
                    some 30 species of Indian origin, with nearly· 20 thereto allied, but, on the
                    other hand, more than 60 which are derived from Australia, thus indicating a
                    greater affinity to the latter country. There is one genus of Kingfishers <hi
                    rend="italic">(Caridonax)</hi> known only from Lombok and Flores, but no doubt
                    represented in Sumbawa, and a genus of Pigeons <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Leucotreron)</hi> is almost limited to this group.</p>
                <p>The Celebesian province is known to be inhabited by more than 200 species,
                    belonging to about 150 genera. Of the Land-birds, 9 genera and nearly 70 species
                    are absolutely confined to the principal island, but 20 more are found also in
                    the Sula and Sanguir islands, making nearly 90 species peculiar to this
                    Subregion. Of those which are not peculiar, Lord Walden<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi rend="italic">Transactions of the
                    Zoological Society,</hi> viii. pp. 23-118.</p></note> estimates that about 55
                    are of Indian and 22 of Australian origin, the remainder being common to both
                    Regions, and thus the Indian influence is very strong in this quarter, pointing
                    to an immigration from the north and west. Of the less wide genera of Celebes,
                    more than 20 are common to Borneo and Java, and nearly as many to Timor or the
                    Moluccas—again showing a preponderance of Indian over Australian types; but,
                    since the Bornean and Javan species consist of only about one-quarter of those
                    which are characteristic of those islands, while the Moluccan and Timorese
                    genera form nearly one-half, the proportion which has been drawn from the rest
                    of the Australian Region is clearly greater than that which has flowed in from
                    the Indian. The most important family of <hi rend="italic">Meliphagidoe,</hi>
                    however, which, as before remarked, is so highly characteristic of the
                    Australian Region, is here represented by a single species only <hi
                    rend="italic">(Mgzomela chlor</hi><hi rend="italic">opterai),</hi> and the fact
                    requires due acknowledgment. On the other hand, some 8 Indian families which are
                    very important in Borneo and Java are altogether absent, and the non-appearance
                    of a still greater number of Moluccan forms is also worthy of note. The
                    conclusion at which Mr Wallace arrives from these and some other circumstances
                    is that Celebes, during the existing epoch, has never been united by extensive
                    land with either side, but has received an influx of immigrants from each. Of
                    the genera found in Celebes itself 9 are peculiar, 3 more occur in one other
                    island only, and 1 (which is likely to be eventually discovered in Celebes) is
                    as yet known but in the Sula group-Of these 13 genera peculiar to the Subregion,
                    about one-third are modifications of Australian forms. The Sula Islands show a
                    considerable blending of faunas; out of nearly 40 species of Land-birds, more
                    than one-half are identical with or allied to those of Celebes; but 3 Moluccan
                    genera, unknown to Celebes, occur here.</p>
                <p>We have now to consider the Papuan province. The island of New Guinea, which is
                    the centre of the whole Papuan Subregion, has been until lately almost entirely
                    unexplored, and even at the present day its interior has been but scarcely and
                    cursorily visited by civilized foreigners. Yet out of nearly 350 species of
                    Land-birds, belonging to 125 genera, which are known to us from this country,
                    300 species are exclusively peculiar to it, and 36 genera are either peculiar or
                    only just extending to North Australia. Of the remaining genera, 38 are peculiar
                    to the province, 45 are characteristically Australian, 9 more especially belong
                    to the Malay Archipelago generally, being as much Australian as Indian.’ Only 7
                    are typically Indian, ¾ut with a discontinuous distribution, while 25 have a
                    wide range. The chief features of the province to be noted are the extraordinary
                    development therein of the Cassowaries <pb break="no"

                    more have apparently the same origin, but, curiously enough, are not found in
                    the intervening Moluccan province. Thus it will be seen that the avifauna of New
                    Guinea is pre-eminently that of the Austral·ian Region, and that it has many
                    peculiar devel·opments of Australian types; but that there has also been an
                    infusion of Malayan forms, of which one group is spread pretty uniformly over
                    the whole Archipe1ago, if not beyond it; while another group presents a rare
                    instance of discontinuous distribution—not appearing in an intervening space of
                    1000 miles across, though that space is full of islands to all appearance
                    habitable by such forms. The birds of Papua are, as a whole, remarkable for
                    their brilliancy of plumage, one-half of the species occurring there being so
                    distinguished, and no 1ess than 12 genera are decorated by the metallic
                    colouring of their feathers. The Birds-of-Paradise, the Racquet-tailed
                    Kingfishers, the 1argest and small·est of the Parrot tribe, namely, <hi
                    rend="italic">Calyptorhynchus</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Nasiterna,</hi> and the

                    among its productions.</p>
                <p>The chief dependencies of New Guinea require some little notice. These are the
                    Aru Islands in the west, and New Britain and New Ireland in the east, with the
                    Solomon Islands as still more distant outliers in the same direction, and the
                    Louisiade group in the south. The first, separated by 150 miles of sea from
                    Papua, has over 100 species of Land-birds, of which, however, about four-fifths
                    have been found also on the mainland; but among those which are peculiar are two
                    of the finest <hi rend="italic">Paradiseidae</hi> —one of them belonging to a
                    distinct genus <hi rend="italic">(Cicinnurus)—</hi> and there is the very
                    suggestive fact, as asserted, of two species of <hi rend="italic">Casuarius</hi>
                    occurring in the group. Of the ornithological features of New Britain and New
                    Ireland not much is known, save that the former is inhabited by a species of
                    Cassowary, and that both are intimately connected with New Guinea. The avifauna
                    of the Solomon Islands is in some degree better understood, and 30<note

                    3 more probably are so: 5 species occur in New Ireland as well; 1 is common also
                    to New Caledonia and the New Hebrides, 1 to the Louisiade Archipelago, and the
                    remaining 4 have a wider distribution in the Papuan Subregion, to which
                    unquestionably the group belongs.</p>
                <p>The Moluccan province, completing this Subregion and consisting of many rather
                    widely detached islands, which lie for the most part between those forming the
                    provinces already described, extends probably from Timor-leat in the south to
                    the Sanguir group in the north, and includes the considerable islands of Ceram,
                    Bouru, Gilolo, and Morty. About 200 species of Land-birds are new known from
                    this province, and they may be assigned to over 80 genera. Of the species about
                    15 are common to the Indian region, but more than twice as many to the Papuan
                    province, and some 140 are peculiar, of which the most significant are the <hi

                    peculiar; but there is also in Gi1olo a brevipennate genus of Rails <hi
                    rend="italic">(Habroptila)</hi> to which the same epithet will apply. One genus
                    is common to Ceram and Celebes, and another is found in Australia, whence
                    possibly it is a migrant, while 30 genera are characteristic of the Papuan
                    Subregion, and nearly 40 more, of more or less wide range, are found in and
                    probably derived from New Guinea. Finally, there are some 12 genera which do not
                    occur in New Guinea, and belong wholly or mainly to the Indian Region, but there
                    are only 3 characteristically Indian types met with in the Moluccas, and all of
                    them are there represented by distinct and well-marked species. The avifauna of
                    the Moluccan province is therefore thoroughly that of the Papuan Subregion, and
                    is no less clearly derivative from that of New Guinea, but not fewer than 11
                    forms of Birds-of-Paradise <hi rend="italic">(Paradiseidae),</hi> with more than
                    12 other characteristically Papuan genera, are wanting, and therefore, in Mr
                    Wallace’s opinion, it would seem as though the province is not a fragment of any
                    old Papuan territory, a supposition supported by the fact that most Moluccan
                    birds are very distinct from their representatives in New Guinea. Amongst the
                    most characteristic forms are the scarlet Brush-tongued Parrots <hi

                    believed, in every island of the group, but not in the Celebesian or Timorese
                    provinces. One species of <hi rend="italic">Eos</hi> from Siau and Sanguir
                    intimates that those islands belong to the province. <hi rend="italic"
                    >Eclectus,</hi> another scarlet Parrot, but belonging to a different family,
                    also is equall·y characteristic with the Parrots j ust mentioned. As a rule, the
                    birds of the Moluccan province are larger and more conspicuous than the allied
                    species from neighbouring parts.</p>
                <p>On the whole, the avifauna of the Papuan Subregion presents some very remarkable
                    features, but most of them must be here briefly treated by way of summary.
                    Unquestionably its most distinctive characteristic is to be found in the
                    presence of the Birds-of-Paradise <hi rend="italic">(Paradiseidae),</hi> which
                    are almost peculiar to it; for, granting that the Bower-birds <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Chlamydera</hi> and others) of Australia should be classed in this family, it
                    must be admitted that they are very abnormal, or perhaps, to take firmer ground,
                    that they are far less highly specialized than the beautiful and extraordinary
                    forms which are found, and found only within very restricted limits, in the
                    various islands of the Subregion. It would be easy, if space allowed, to dwell
                    at length on the many points of interest with respect to those wonderful birds,
                    though in truth we know but little of them.</p>

                <p>(2.) <hi rend="italic">The Australian Subregion</hi> is limited to the great
                    insulated continent which bears that name, with its appendage Tasmania or Van
                    Diemen’s Land, and possesses, on the whole, a very homogeneous fauna—so much so,
                    indeed, that at present it would be almost impossible to subdivide it into
                    provinces. Influenced in the north by its proximity to the rich and varied
                    Papuan Subregion,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>The
                    Peninsula of Cape York possesses a <hi rend="italic">Casuanus,</hi> as already
                    noticed, and other grounds are not -wanting for the supposition that has been
                    entertained that zoologically it belongs to the Papuan Subregion.</p></note> its
                    <hi rend="italic">ornis</hi> rapidly becomes modified towards the south. Out of
                    some 630 species or more, nearly 490 are Land-birds, and not more than
                    one-twentieth of them are found elsewhere, so that its peculiar species bear a
                    greater proportion to the rest than is the case in the Papuan Subregion. Though
                    the western, and especially the north-western, parts of the country, which have
                    been as yet but imperfectly investigated, will no doubt yield more results on
                    further examination, it is already evident that the greatest animal wealth of
                    Australia lies towards the east. The western portion seems to have but 2
                    peculiar genera (one of questionable value)—a nocturnal Parrakeet <hi
                    rend="italic">(Geopsittacus),</hi> and a Weaver-bird <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Emblema),</hi> which is apparently not very far removed from others of the
                    same group. In the north, as already stated, there is a considerable admixture
                    of genera from the Papuan Subregion, which do not proceed beyond the tropic, and
                    of these <hi rend="italic">Casuarius</hi> is a striking example. The genus <hi
                    rend="italic">Xerophila,</hi> of uncertain affinity, is confined to South
                    Australia; and the extreme limits of the Subregion, that is Tasmania, possess in
                    addition only 1 genus, <hi rend="italic">Eudyptes,</hi> belonging to the marine
                    family of the Penguins <hi rend="italic">(Spheniscidoe),</hi> which inhabit
                    generally the sub-antarctic seas; but the Land-birds, which are few in number,
                    are specifically identical with those of Australia proper. This is even the case
                    with the Emeu <hi rend="italic">(Dromoeus),</hi> and the import of this fact is
                    as significant<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Its
                    significance is increased by the fact that the Emeu of West Australia is
                    distinct from that of the east. The Emeu is extinct in Tasmania.</p></note> as
                    would be a corresponding example drawn from the class <hi rend="italic"
                    >Mammalia,</hi> since, in regard to means of locomotion, birds incapable of
                    flight are on a par with terrestrial mammals. As a whole, Australia is rich in
                    Parrots <hi rend="italic">(Psittaci),</hi> having several very peculiar forms;
                    but Picarians <hi rend="italic">(Picariae)</hi> of all sorts— certain

                    comparatively scarce. Australia, however, possesses two extraordinary families

                    including the Society Islands and the whole of the Low Archipelago, which may
                    perhaps form a fourth province; and lastly, the Sandwich or Hawaiian Islands.
                    The first of these provinces (so to call them) possesses in the Palau Islands a

                    the Australian Subregion. Out of 30 genera of Land-birds, 18 are typically

                    these we have little precise information—two meagre lists of birds from

                    those of the Marquesas, appearing to furnish nearly all our available material.
                    The latter group possesses a rather remarkable Pigeon, said to be peculiar to

                    thoroughly worked out, seem to present some conspicuous differences from any
                    other; and it is almost a matter of opinion whether, small as is the known
                    avifauna of the group, it should not be regarded as constituting a separate
                    Subregion rather than as a province of Polynesia. The ascertained Land-birds are

                    to occur elsewhere. The remainder are restricted to the Hawaiian Islands, and
                    may be referred to 2 families—one the almost universally distributed Flycatchers

                    characteristic of the whole Australian Region; but it is to be observed that the
                    most of the species are remarkable for the extraordinary form of their bill, so
                    tlιat they may ultimately be found to constitute a special section of the

                    Sandwich-Island Goose <hi rend="italic">(Bernicla sandνicensis),</hi> which has
                    been very commonly domesticated in Europe. The Hawaiian Archipelago has thus a
                    larger proportion of peculiar genera and species than any other group in the
                    Subregion, from which fact Mr Wallace infers, and no one can doubt the truth of
                    the observation, the great antiquity of its isolation.</p>
                <p>(4.) <hi rend="italic">The New-Zealand Subregion,</hi> however, is, and to all
                    appearance long has been, more isolated still, probably, indeed, longer isolated
                    than any other portion of the globe. Beside the three larger islands, known in
                    the aggregate as New Zealand, numerous satellites belong to the Subregion, as
                    Lord Howe’s, Norfolk, and Kermadoc Islands, with the Chatham, Auckland, and
                    Macquarrie groups. At the highest estimate the Subregion contains about 150
                    existing species of ’ birds, of which more than 60 are Landbirds, belonging to
                    about 34 genera, 16 of the latter being peculiar, and there may be some 5 genera
                    of Water-birds, making 21 in all. Of the others 4 are widely spread, but the
                    rest (9 in number) are characteristically those of the Region. Most of the
                    genera occurring elsewhere are here represented by peculiar species, but then 5
                    are common to Australia. Some 7 or 8 are also allied to Australian species, and
                    there are 4 Australian and l Polynesian species. Therefore every degree of
                    similarity to Australia is to be found. Of peculiar genera it will suffice to

                    there is a wonderful amount of specialization, though perhaps in a very straight
                    line from generalized forms; but the affinity to Australian or Polynesian types
                    is in many cases clearly traceable, and it cannot be supposed but that these
                    last are of cognate origin with those of New Zealand. A very long period of
                    isolation must have been required to produce the differences so manifestly to be
                    observed, but a few forms seem at rare intervals to have immigrated, and tlιis
                    immigration would appear to be kept up to our own day, as shewn by the instance
                    of <hi rend="italic">Zosterops lateralis,</hi> which is said to have lately made
                    its first appearance, and to have established itself in the country, as well as
                    by the fact of two Cuckows, the widely-ranging <hi rend="italic">Endynami·s
                    taitensis</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Chrysococcyx</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >lucidus,</hi> which are annual visitors.</p>
                <p>The most extraordinary ornithic feature of New Zealand, however, is
                    unquestionably the former existence of the gigantic birds of the families <hi
                    rend="italic">Dinomithidae</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Palaptery-gidae,</hi> with
                    a few other contemporary forms. These,however, having been already mentioned
                    there is no need to dwelí further upon them. As a whole, the avifauna of New
                    Zealand must be regarded as one of the most interesting and instructive in the
                    world, and the inevitable doom which is awaiting its surviving members cannot
                    but excite a lively regret in the minds of all ornithologists. This regret is
                    quite apart from any question of sentiment; if it were otherwise, it could not
                    be defended against that sentiment which prompts our colonial fellow-subjects
                    indiscriminately to stock their fields and forests, not only with the species of
                    their mother-country, but with all the fowls of heaven, whencesoever they can be
                    procured. The regret we express arises from the thought that just as we lament
                    our ignorance of the species which in various lands have been extirpated by our
                    forefathers, so our posterity will want to know much more of the present ornis
                    of New Zealand than we can possibly record; for no one nowadays can pretend to
                    predict the scope of investigation which will be required, and required in vain,
                    by naturalists in that future when New Zealand may be one of the great nations
                    of the earth.</p>
                <p>II. The Neotropical Region, though presenting certain affinities to the
                    Australian, and the only one which can be said to be zoologically allied to it,
                    is yet almost as distinct in its character therefrom as it is geographically
                    distant Excepting towards its northern limits, where it meets and inosculates
                    with the Nearctic Region, the boundary of the Neotropical Region is simple
                    enough to trace, comprehending as it does the whole of South America from Cape
                    Hom to the Isthmus of Panama and all Central America, and reaching in North
                    America to somewhere about the twenty-second parallel of north latitude; besides
                    including the Falkland Islands to the south-east,<note anchored="true"

                    species of Land-birds are known to occur, all of which are peculiar —two of them
                    even generically. One is <hi rend="italic">a</hi> Finch <hi rend="italic"

                    as the whole of the Antilles or West-India Islands up to the Florida Channel,
                    which separates them from the peninsula of that name. Though over none but the
                    remotest corners of this sufficiently large area is the supreme Class of animals
                    formed (as we have found it to be the case throughout by far the greater portion
                    of the Australian Region) by the Birds, yet they here play a part of very great
                    importance, owing to the comparatively scanty number of Mammalian types. Among
                    these last, however, there are two remarkable groups—the <hi rend="italic"

                    rend="italic">Edentata,</hi> an Order which, though found also in Africa and
                    India, attains in South America the summit of its development in variety and
                    number of forms; and we cannot adduce any examples of Orders or Suborders from
                    the Class <hi rend="italic">Aves,</hi> the circumstances of which will exactly
                    match those of these three groups of <hi rend="italic">Mammalia.</hi> The
                    nearest approach, perhaps, is made in one way by the South-American Ratite
                    birds, of which one entire group, consisting of at most three species <hi
                    rend="italic">(Rheidoe),</hi> is peculiar to the region, and thus to some extent
                    parallels the case of the <hi rend="italic">Pedimana;</hi> but while these last
                    also invade the Nearctic Region, the formerare not even spread over the whole of
                    continental South America, being limited to its colder portion. Moreover, so far
                    as Orders have been generally understood and accepted by ornithologists among
                    Carinate Birds, there is no one of wide range which can compare with the
                    overwhelming development of the Edentates in the Neotropical Region. On the
                    other hand, it must be observed that the Region claims all the Tinamous <hi

                    the <hi rend="italic">Dromoeognathoe</hi> of Professor Huxley—which, if we were
                    to follow his arrangement established on palatal characters, it would seem
                    necessary to regard as the equivalent of an Order; and also a single very
                    remarkable form <hi rend="italic">(Oρisthocomus),</hi> which he has
                    satisfactorily shown to be so unlike every other that it can only be

                    most ornithologists have been usually willing to admit, a proceeding which
                    naturally lowers the differential standard, and renders a comparison between
                    “Orders” of √lres and “Orders* of <hi rend="italic">Mammalia</hi> or <hi

                    the avifaunas of the two Regions seems to be further borne out by the same fact
                    being observable of other South-American families, forming what may be called
                    the lower Suborders<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>The
                    term “Suborder” should very possibly not be used here, at least in a technical

                    altogether originating in the Neotropical Region, are without doubt therein most
                    abundantly produced. The significance of this fact is enhanced when we remember
                    that, as has been said before, to consider rightly the problem of the
                    distribution of birds, we must in the main rely on the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Passeres,</hi> as affording on the whole the surest ground for our

                    Neotropical birds—that published by Messrs Sclater and Salvin<note

                    shall see that there are 8 Passerine families peculiar to the Region, of which 3

                    in that work as inhabiting the Region, we find it to be 3565. Of these, 1997, or
                    a good deal more than half, belong to the Order <hi rend="italic"

                    (from other causes not germane to our present investigation, and therefore to be
                    just now disregarded) need not especially excite our wonder. But the
                    characteristic nature of the avifauna of the Region is more clearly brought out
                    when we learn that of the 1997 species just mentioned, 1070 only belong to the
                    higher Suborder <hi rend="italic">(Polymyodae),</hi> leaving 927 to the two
                    lower Suborders <hi rend="italic">(Oligomyodoe</hi> and <hi rend="italic"

                    of 2000 species of the highest Order of birds, a <hi rend="italic">little more

                    one-half</hi> belong to its two lower sections. This is a state of things which
                    exists nowhere else on the globe; for, except in Australia, where a few but
                    uncertain number of purely indigenous and peculiar non-polymyodous <hi
                    rend="italic">Passeres</hi> are found, and in the Nearctic Region whither one
                    family of <hi rend="italic">Oligomyodoe</hi> has evidently been led by the
                    geographical continuity of its soil with that of the Neotropical Region, such
                    forms do not occur elsewhere. Accordingly their disproportionate prevalence in
                    South America and its neighbouring lands points unerringly to the lower rank of
                    the ornis of the region as a whole, and therefore to the propriety of taking it
                    next in order to that of the Australian Region, the general fauna of which is
                    admittedly the lowest in the world. It is believed that much the same result
                    would follow from a similar examination of other Orders, especially the <hi

                    perspicuity the alliance of the two Regions just named, basing his opinion in
                    great measure on the evidence afforded by the two sections into which the true
                    <hi rend="italic">Gallinoe</hi> are divisible, the <hi rend="italic"

                <p>Leaving, however, this matter as in some degree hypothetical, though its
                    probability can hardly be denied, we have as genera, families, or perhaps even
                    larger groups a great many very remarkable forms which are characteristic of or
                    peculiar to the Neotropical Region in part, if not as a whole. Of families we
                    find 23, or maybe more, absolutely restricted thereto, besides at least 8 which,
                    being peculiar to the New World, extend their range into the Nearctic Region,
                    but are there so feebly developed that their origin may be safely ascribed to
                    the southern portion of America. First in point of importance comes the
                    extraordinarily beautiful family of Humming-birds <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Trochilidoe)</hi><hi rend="italic">,</hi> with nearly 120 genera (of which
                    only 5 occur in the Nearctic Region), and more than 400 species. Then the

                    which range into the northern Region), and over 300 species. To these follow the
                    Tanagers <hi rend="italic">(Tanagridoe),</hi> with upwards of 40 genera (only 1
                    of which crosses the border), and about 300 species; the Piculules <hi

                    species; the Ant-Thrushes <hi rend="italic">(Formicariidoe),</hi> with more than
                    30 genera, and nearly 200 species; together with other groups which, if not so
                    large as those just named, are yet just as well defined, and possibly more
                    significant, namely, the Tapaculos <hi rend="italic">(Ptero-</hi><hi

                    >(Eurypyga).</hi></p>
                <p>Having thus briefly indicated some of the chief characteristic and for the most
                    part generally distributed forms of the Neotropical avifauna, we have next to
                    consider the separation of the Region into Subregions and provinces. Herein we
                    find far greater difficulty than we had to encounter in treating of the
                    preceding (the Australian) Region, the geographical peculiarities of which
                    marvellously lend themselves to its comparatively easy partition, while the

                    remaining Regions of the globe, the Neotropical, as it will be essayed to show
                    in the sequel, presents, perhaps, no greater difficulty in this respect than
                    others do. The Subregions (one excepted), however, cannot be said to be well
                    defined, for no natural boundaries are to be found for them, and we must trust
                    solely to the presence or absence of certain forms of Bird-life in marking out
                    their limits. This is, of course, the most proper zoological method of
                    proceeding, but in some cases it tends to make the divisions rather more than
                    less arbitrary, and in all cases dependent upon the amount of investigation
                    which has been bestowed on the several districts. The physical features of the
                    continent of South America are very varied, and cannot be said to assist us much
                    or at all in our task. The proximity of its southern extremity to an ocean
                    wherein at one season of the year floating ice abounds, gives that portion a
                    rigorous climate, and the presence of the grand chain of the Andes, the highest
                    save one in the world, prolongs beyond the equator those characteristics of a
                    mountainous or even an alpine tract, which override any that are commonly
                    associated with degrees of latitude. This range, the great Cordillera, has also
                    a remarkable effect first on the climatological properties of the whole country,
                    and then on its vegetation, which, of course, acts directly on its animal
                    inhabitants. Running as the Andes do pretty nearly longitudinally, and lying
                    near the western coast of the continent, the warm, moist winds from the Atlantic
                    sweep across its eastern and wider portion, unimpeded in their course by any
                    considerable high land, till they are attracted by the summits of the giant
                    range, and, precipitating their fertilizing showers on its lofty slopes, supply
                    the brimming floods of some of the largest rivers of the world. Westward of the
                    chain is in great part a desert, at least down to lat. 10° S., though much of
                    this was, prior to the conquest of Peru by the Spaniards, carefully irrigated
                    and highly luxuriant. A few other arid tracts are found, but compared with most
                    other continents the proportion of desert-land is small, and the valleys of the
                    majestic rivers which roll their course to the Atlantic are clothed with the
                    most extensive virgin forests in the world. To these varied physical conditions
                    seem due the chief differences which are observable in the avifauna of the
                    component parts of the South-American continent, which, rich as it is beyond
                    that of all other countries in genera and species, displays yet a considerable
                    uniformity in its larger groups of Birds.</p>
                <p>The Subregions into which that portion of the earth at present under
                    consideration can be most conveniently separated seem to be <hi rend="italic"
                    >six</hi> in number—four of them included within the continent of South America,
                    and two lying beyond its limits.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>In arriving at this conclusion the author wishes to
                    acknowledge the kind assistance he has received from his old friend Mr Salvin,
                    F.R.S., whose long-continued study of American, and especially Neotropical,
                    forms of birds has placed him in the front rank of authorities on the
                    ornithology of the New World.</p></note> But the confines of these continental
                    Subregions, as has been above hinted, are of the vaguest. It is doubtful whether
                    any amount of local knowledge will ever justify the zoogeographer in drawing an
                    absolute line of demarcation between any two of them. At present our information
                    certainly does not permit us to do more than indicate the general direction of
                    such boundaries; not that we believe that their existence may not be
                    legitimately assumed. Beginning with the apex of the continent, we have a
                    Subregion, extending from Cape Horn to somewhere north of Bahia Blanca on its
                    eastern coast, whence its boundary runs in a north-westerly direction, passing
                    to the eastward of Mendoza, and then northward along the eastern and higher
                    slopes of the Andes until it crosses the equator, and, after trifurcating on
                    either side of the valleys of the Magdalena and its confluent the Cauca, returns
                    along the western slopes of the lofty Cordillera, until it trends seaward and
                    reaches the Pacific coast of South America somewhere about Truxillo, in lat. 7°
                    S. This Subregion, for a reason presently to be given, may be called the
                    Patagonian, though its northern extremity lies so far removed from its eponymic
                    territory. Next we have what may be called the Brazilian Subregion, marching
                    with the foregoing until somewhere near Potosi in Bolivia, whence it turns to
                    the north-east, and, avoiding the watershed of the Amazons, strikes, perhaps,
                    the Paranahyba, through or along which it makes its way to the Atlantic. Then
                    comes the enormous basin of the Amazons—the Mediterranean of South America, as
                    the dwellers on its banks fondly call it—which, though forming an important part
                    of the Brazilian Empire, seems undoubtedly to be a distinct Subregion from that
                    to which this last name has been applied, and may justly be denominated the
                    Amazonian. Yet, be it remembered, that, its peculiarities not being observable
                    on the higher tributaries of the mighty river, its upper waters must be regarded
                    as draining land which belongs to the fourth Subregion—of which more
                    immediately. Continuous to the south-ward with the Brazilian boundary the
                    western frontier of the Amazonian Subregion seems to turn off before the eastern
                    confines of the Patagonian Subregion are reached, and, leaving a space
                    intervening, it pursues a generally northward course, at a lower level, on the
                    western bank of the Huallaga, and crossing the great stream whence it derives
                    its name, in somewhere about long. 77° W. and lat. 5° S., it pursues its way
                    towards the mouth of the Orinoco. The fourth and last Subregion of South America
                    includes all that is left of the continent, and perhaps may be most fitly named
                    the Subandean.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>In some
                    respects it corresponds with what has been commonly called the “Columbian”
                    Subregion; but that name, having been used in a special and more restricted
                    sense, might give rise to some misunderstanding. As will be seen, it comprehends
                    far more than the former United States of Columbia.</p></note> This begins in
                    the south with the narrow slip of land before mentioned as intervening between
                    the comparatively low-lying Amazonian Subregion and that portion of the
                    Patagonian which runs along the lofty Peruvian ' Andes, and is believed to
                    extend from the frontiers of Bolivia to the table-land of Ecuador, rounding, on
                    the one hand, the forked extremity of the Patagonian Subregion to the westward
                    until it meets the Pacific at Truxillo, stretching over 500 miles of sea to the
                    Galapagos Islands, under the equator, and, on the other hand, following the
                    Amazonian boundary to the Atlantic, while it comprehends the islands of Trinidad
                    and Tobago, as well as those which lie on the northern coast of South America.
                    Besides portions of the states already named, it includes Nueva Granada and
                    Venezuela till it reaches the Central-American Subregion in the Isthmus of
                    Panama. This fifth Subregion stretches on the west northward about as far as
                    Guaymas on the east coast of the Gulf of California, and on the east to the Rio
                    Grande, which forms the boundary of Mexico and Texas, but the Nearctic Region
                    dips down along the central table-land till near Queretaro, a little to the
                    northward of the city of Mexico, and thence southward along the higher ridges to
                    an almost indefinite extent. The sixth Subregion is composed of the Antilles,
                    with the important exception of Trinidad and Tobago, and its limits being
                    capable of easy geographical circumscription, further consideration of them may
                    be for the present deferred.</p>
                <p>The difficulty of distinguishing these several Subregions is indeed very great;
                    and it is not only possible, but highly probable that even in a few years
                    further exploration will enjoin a large amount of rectification of their
                    frontiers. It <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0903-0762-0745"/> must be remembered too that where, in the
                    preceding paragraphs, “lines” of demarcation have been spoken of, such lines are
                    in truth tracts of country often from one to two hundred miles in breadth, and
                    in most cases there is no hope that the boundaries will ever attain any great
                    degree of precision. Some advance of knowledge in this direction will no doubt
                    accrue as the elevation and contour of hills and table-lands become more
                    accurately laid down; but at first the effect of this increase to our
                    information will certainly be to complicate matters, by shewing the existence
                    within one Subregion of spurs, isolated spots, or enclosed areas belonging to
                    another, and as yet unsuspected. Still the amount of light thrown on the
                    Neotropical Region by the persevering labours of the eminent ornithologists
                    before named, seems to deserve being brought to a focus; and accordingly the
                    following summary is now offered in the hope that some of the characteristics of
                    the avifauna of the Region may thereby be more readily comprehended.</p>

                    rend="italic">Ratitoe,</hi> which wander over its solitudes, and the Penguins
                    <hi rend="italic">(Spheniscidoe),</hi> which haunt its shores; but by the low,
                    generalized, and peculiar forms like <hi rend="italic">Thinocorus</hi> and <hi

                    >Limicoloe,</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">Pteroptochidoe</hi> (though some few
                    species of this family occur elsewhere in South America) among the <hi

                    >{Phytotomidoe)</hi> is almost peculiar, only just intruding upon Southern
                    Brazil. Of the more characteristic families of Birds of the New World, some 3
                    only <hi rend="italic">(Dendroco-</hi><hi rend="italic">laptidoe,
                    Formicariidoe,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Trochilidoe)</hi> shew themselves in
                    any great abundance, while but 2 other3, which are feebly represented, occur
                    within the ill-defined limits of its southern province, Patagonia,—the rest of
                    its terrestrial, and still more of its littoral or maritime, avifauna consisting
                    of families, or groups of families, which are nearly cosmopolitan. On the pampas
                    of La Plata we find the number of characteristic Neotropical forms much
                    increased, but still the poverty of the Argentine ornis is of the most marked
                    kind when compared with the wealth of the more fertile tracts which lie on its
                    northern and eastern frontiers. In La Plata we have but 2 other familes <hi
                    rend="italic">(fTyrannidoe</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Palamedeidoe)</hi> coming
                    under this category that are at all well developed. <hi rend="italic"
                    >Mniotiltidoe, Vireonidoe,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Coerebidoe</hi> do not
                    appear at all, and <hi rend="italic">Tanagridoe</hi> but in small numbers. As
                    has been said already, the Subregion extends northward along the chain of the
                    Andes, and with this extension it seems proper to take in their arid and barren
                    western slopes as well as a portion of the tract lying between that range and
                    the sea, so as to include Chile and a considerable slice of Peru. But even by so
                    doing we gain but little. No more of the characteristically Neotropical forms
                    mount these lofty ascents in any multitude, nor are we able to add any forms of
                    very wide distribution. However, throughout the whole Subregion many genera, and
                    species without number, which are absolutely peculiar, occur, and thus aid in
                    stamping the quality of the tract. Indeed, the very presence of the Struthious
                    family <hi rend="italic">Rheidoe,</hi> with its two or three species, would
                    serve alone to do this; and as its headquarters are in Patagonia, that country
                    becomes of sufficient importance to give its name to the Subregion of which it
                    forms at most but a moiety.</p>
                <p>Entering more into details, we find the Patagonian Subregion possessing about 46
                    genera of birds not found elsewhere in South America. Of these 30 are strictly

                    family limited to the Antarctic or Subantarctic Ocean. But further into
                    particulars want of space forbids our going, save to remark on a very peculiar
                    and instructive case offered by <hi rend="italic">Eustephanus,</hi> a genus of
                    <hi rend="italic">Trochilidoe.</hi> Of this section of Humming-birds there are
                    three known species— one, <hi rend="italic">E. galeritus,</hi> found in Chile,
                    evidently its mothercountry, but also occurring from 400 to 600 miles from the
                    mainland on both of the chief islets of the little Juan Fernandez
                    group—Masatierra and Masafuera; but each of these limited spots has besides its
                    own peculiar species of the genus—the former <hi rend="italic">E.
                    femandensis</hi> and the latter <hi rend="italic">E. leyboldi.</hi> This alone
                    would present nothing at all unparalleled elsewhere; but it is curious that
                    while both sexes of the more widely-ranging <hi rend="italic">E. galeritus</hi>
                    have a green plumage, the males of the other two have a brilliant red colour,
                    and generally resemble each other, though the females of each differ more
                    decidedly. Supposing, as we may justly do, that all these species have descended
                    from a common ancestor, Mr Sclater has shewn<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    the probability that <hi rend="italic">E. galeritus</hi> represents the
                    appearance of the parental stock that in bygone times colonized the
                    Juan-Fernandez cluster, of which <hi rend="italic">E. femandensis,</hi> now
                    peculiar to Masatierra, and the most aberrant from the original form, is the
                    progeny of the earliest settlers, and <hi rend="italic">E. leyboldi,</hi>
                    confined to Masafuera, is the descendant of a later immigration, while, still
                    more recently, <hi rend="italic">E. galeritus</hi> has found its way to both
                    islets, and in each yet possesses its normal characters.</p>
                <p>Passing over, as not affording anything especially remarkable, the chain of
                    islands, from Chiloe to Cape Horn, in which the range of the Andes plunges into
                    the Southern Ocean, though alongside of it lie Tierra del Fuego and its
                    satellites, which form an important adjunct to the South-American continent, our
                    attention is turned to the Falklands, an interesting and considerable group of
                    islands situated over 200 miles to the north-east of the historic Strait of

                    the Neotropical Region it possesses 3 in common with the Patagonian,— <hi

                    but on whichever ground we proceed we may be pretty sure that its separation is

                <p>families peculiar— <hi rend="italic">Opisthocomidoe</hi> —already mentioned as
                    forming almost a distinct Order, but composed of a single species, the Hoactzin,
                    and <hi rend="italic">ÙidPsophiidoe</hi> or Trumpeters, now a-days regarded as
                    distant allies of the Cranes <hi rend="italic">(Gruidoe),</hi> but presenting
                    many remarkable and unique features. This family also contains but one single
                    genus, including some half-dozen species, the respective range of each
                    appearing, singularly enough, to be separated by rivers. Amazonia possesses no
                    family in common with but one other Neotropical Subregion, but it shares 3 with
                    the Central-American and Subandean. These are <hi rend="italic">Capitonidoe,
                    Eurypygidoe,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Oedicnemidoe,</hi> of which the second
                    only is peculiar to the Region, the first and last being widely distributed. The
                    families which it shares with three other Subregions have been already
                    enumerated, as well as those which by their presence or absence distinguish it
                    from the Brazilian Subregion. The peculiar genera remain to be pointed out.
                    These are but 27 in number: 2 belong to <hi rend="italic">Icteridoe,</hi><hi

                    and <hi rend="italic">Psophia</hi> before mentioned. There is another genus also
                    which is worthy of remark, <hi rend="italic">Chenalopex,</hi> belonging to the

                    common to the Ethiopian Region. Space will not admit of our entering further
                    upon the consideration of the ornithic peculiarities of Amazonia, but perhaps it
                    may be said to form the most self-contained Subregion of the whole continental
                    area of which we are now treating, and we may expect that with the progress of
                    zoological exploration its boundaries may be laid down with tolerable precision.
                    There are no islands which can bo attached to Amazonia.</p>

                    shall not therefore be surprised to find its ornis at once rich and remarkable.
                    It might perhaps now, and some day probably will, be broken up into two or more
                    provinces, not to say separated into distinct Subregions, but the means for such
                    partition are at present wanting. Yet there is only one family of Birds peculiar
                    to it, the <hi rend="italic">Steatomithidoe,</hi> composed of a single species,
                    the Guacharo or Oil-bird <hi rend="italic">(Steatomis caripensis),</hi> confined
                    to a very few localities in its eastern portion. In common with Central America,
                    but not elsewhere met with in the Region, it has of Neotropical families <hi
                    rend="italic">Cinclidoe</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Alaudidoe,</hi> though the
                    latter of these two widely-ranging families is but poorly represented by a
                    single species <hi rend="italic">(Otocorys</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >chrysoloema),</hi> apparently the survivor of an old population (all, or nearly
                    all, of which has perished), stranded, as it were, on the high lands of
                    Columbia. Those families which it possesses that are common to but two other
                    Neotropical Subregions have already been named, and it will be enough to repeat
                    that 1 of them extends to the Patagonian and Brazilian, and the remaining 3 to
                    the Amazonian and Central-American. In like manner have been enumerated the
                    families which are also found in but three other Subregions—1 it has in common
                    with the Amazonian, Brazilian, and Patagonian; 8 with the Central-American,
                    Amazonian, and Brazilian; while 1 of these <hi rend="italic">(Parridoe)</hi> is
                    also found in very distant parts of the world, and 1, also a family of extremely
                    wide range, with the Brazilian, Central American, and Antillean Subregions.</p>
                <p>The genera peculiar to the Subandean Subregion are exceedingly numerous,

                    presently be seen) by that which has occurred in Central America. The habitat of
                    some of these forms of Humming-birds, whether genera or species— and the latter
                    are wonderfully numerous—is extremely restricted. That of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Loddigesia</hi><hi rend="italic">mirabilis,</hi> long since described from a
                    still unique specimen in the Loddiges collection, is Chachapoyas in northern
                    Peru, and though possibly more pains has been taken to discover it and compass
                    the capture of other examples than has been the case with any other Bird, it has
                    not been again met with. Its haunts may, therefore, be safely presumed to be
                    especially confined. Two species of <hi rend="italic">Oreotrochilus (0.
                    chimborazo</hi> and <hi rend="italic">0. pichin-chce)</hi> have their abode
                    almost limited to the slopes of the lofty mountains whence they take their name,
                    and nearly as much may be said of others. The Tanagers <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Tana-gridβe)</hi> —birds of varied form, and generally of exquisite
                    plumage—also frequent this Subregion in great force, and among them there is
                    here found, perhaps, the greatest amount of differentiation, both generic and
                    specific.</p>
                <p>Of the hundreds of other curious ornithological characteristics of the Subregion
                    which might easily be cited, no more can here be given, but a brief notice of
                    the avifauna of its extreme points seems to be required. It has now been for
                    some time fully admitted by all competent authorities that the islands of
                    Trinidad and Tobago, which the geographer might be inclined to class with the
                    Antillean chain, must be regarded as being truly portions of the South-American
                    continent, detached in comparatively recent times, and even now only separated
                    from Venezuela by a comparatively shallow sea. Neither of these islands has a
                    single peculiar species,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"

                    that it has lately been procured in Guiana. The nearest approach, perhaps, to
                    peculiarity is in a Thrush, which was originally described as being specifically
                    distinct, under the name of <hi rend="italic">Turdus</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >xanthoscelus,</hi> but its claims to that consideration are now

                    one which is not also found on the nearest mainland, though, of course, many
                    inhabitants of the neighbouring continent do not pass either the Dragon’s or the
                    Serpent’s Mouth, as the two narrow channels which cut off Trinidad from South
                    America are called. We may presume that the various islands, Margarita, Curaçao,
                    and Oruba, which He off the northern coast of Venezuela, also belong to this
                    Subregion, though scarcely anything is known of their animal products.</p>
                <p>Very different from this state of things is that which obtains at the opposite
                    extremity of the Subregion. The interesting group of volcanic islands known as
                    the Galapagos present not merely a large number of peculiar species, but 4
                    peculiar genera of Land-birds; 1 of these, <hi rend="italic">Certhidea,</hi>

                    established, since it seems to rest on good osteological characters; but the
                    American genera have not yet been sufficiently examined to allow of many of them
                    being allotted without much doubt. This uncertainty will most likely in time be
                    removed, unless—and such a probability cannot be denied—some of the New-World
                    forms turn out to be so much generalized as to fill up the gap which now
                    presents itself between the two groups as observed in the Old World. Meanwhile,
                    the consequent inconvenience is unavoidable.</p></note> It was Mr Darwin who
                    first drew attention to the remarkable ornis of this archipelago, and here it
                    was, as he has told us, that there dawned upon him from its consideration that
                    theory of “Natural Selection” which has transformed the whole aspect of biology,
                    and, whether wholly or partially accepted, has placed the science upon a new and
                    higher pedestal. Later researches, indeed, have shown the nonexistence of some
                    of the peculiarities which this eminent observer believed, on what was then good
                    evidence, he had determined; but these refer to the restricted distribution of
                    several of the species among the different islands, and are not of any such
                    importance as to affect his general results, while doubtless, had his visit to
                    this “little world within itself,” as he appropriately calls it, been of longer
                    duration, he would have become aware of these minor facts. The strictly-speaking
                    Land-birds of the Galapagos seem to be some 30 in number, of which about 26 are
                    <hi rend="italic">Passeres.</hi> Among these, 1 only, <hi rend="italic"
                    >Oolichonyx oryzivorus</hi> (belonging to the family <hi rend="italic"
                    >Icteridoe),</hi> and obviously a straggler, is identical with a species of the
                    mainland, while 2, a <hi rend="italic">Dendroeca</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >(Λfniotiltidce),</hi> and a <hi rend="italic">Progne</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >(Hirundinidoe),</hi> have been by some considered to be distinct species, by
                    others but local races,—which means, of course, that from one cause or another
                    isolation has not yet modified them so as to depart greatly from their
                    congeneric continental forms,—but the remaining 23 (?) are peculiar, and, what
                    is especially worthy of notice, no fewer than 18 (Î), or nearly three-fourths of
                    the whole number, belong to the four peculiar genera. There is also a peculiar
                    species of Buzzard, agreeing closely in every habit and even in tone of voice
                    with the carrion-eating <hi rend="italic">Polybori,</hi> and originally
                    described as the type of a distinct genus under the name of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Cracirex galapagoensis.</hi> Apparently, too, there is a distinct and peculiar
                    Barn-Owl <hi rend="italic">{Aluco punctatissimus),</hi> but alongside of it we
                    have the widely-spread Short-eared Owl <hi rend="italic">{Asio
                    accipitrinus),</hi> though examples of this last are said to present in these
                    islands sufficient difference to justify the bestowal upon them of a distinct
                    specific name. Among Water-birds, the <hi rend="italic">Rallidoe</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">Ardeidoe</hi> furnish, the former one and the latter two, species
                    not known elsewhere. A remarkable fact, also, is the asserted existence of a
                    peculiar species of Flamingo <hi rend="italic">(Phoenicopterus</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">glyphorhynchus),</hi> seeing that most of the birds of this genus
                    have a very extended distribution. A Penguin also <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Spheniscus</hi><hi rend="italic">mendiculus)</hi> is at present only known
                    from the Galapagos; but considering the range of other forms of this family <hi
                    rend="italic">(Spheniscidoe),</hi> we should, perhaps, be premature in as yet
                    pronouncing it a peculiar species, though the existence of a Penguin at all
                    under the equator raises a presumption that such may be the case. There is,
                    however, one feature in the avifauna of these islands which should not be
                    overlooked. Notwithstanding that the Galapagos are here placed as forming an
                    outlying portion of the Subandean Subregion, the fact must not be concealed that
                    their omis seems to have no very special or intn⅛ate relation thereto. All that
                    can be averred of it is that it is American. In the subregion just named, as has
                    been above shown, the <hi rend="italic">Trochilidoe</hi> attain their maximum of
                    development, yet no Humming-birds are found in this archipelago. So also with
                    the <hi rend="italic">Tanagridoe,</hi> of which there are abundant Subandean
                    representatives, the <hi rend="italic">Dendrocolaptidoe, Formicariidoe,</hi> and
                    other characteristic Neotropical families. In the Galapagos none of them are
                    found. It is true that the presence of a species of the South-American genus <hi
                    rend="italic">Pyrocephalus,</hi> and of a genus of the Neotropical family <hi
                    rend="italic">Coerebidoe,</hi><hi rend="italic">m&amp;y</hi> be a set off on the
                    other side; but on the whole, it seems quite likely that the relations of this
                    isolated, equatorial province (for so it is entitled to be deemed) are as near
                    to the north as to the south, if not nearer, and it is quite possible that,
                    having its ornithological characters only in view, future zoogeographers may
                    think fit to ally it to the former rather <pb break="no"

                    Reptilian fauna point to a connection, however remote in point of time, with
                    South America, and accordingly the Galapagos are here left in that Region to
                    which they have been commonly assigned.</p>
                <p>(5.) <hi rend="italic">The Central-American Subregion</hi> is the next to be
                    considered, and in treating of it we become aware of a disturbing force which
                    renders impossible the laying down for it of anything like a definite frontier.
                    This disturbing force is the entrance, as before intimated, of a Nearctic fauna
                    which runs along the backbone, so to speak, of the Subregion to an unknown but
                    variable extent; for part of this Nearctic fauna ebbs and flows according to the
                    season of the year, in winter possibly creeping down the mountainsides, and
                    being strongly reinforced by immigrants from the north, but in summer retiring
                    northward and perhaps upward, so as to occupy only the most lofty ridges. Yet
                    that two Subregions here unite and inosculate is certain; but in considering the
                    Central-American avifauna, we have to guard ourselves against this periodic
                    stream of northern immigrants, and cannot deal with it precisely in the same way
                    as we have done those Subregions further removed from the influence which is
                    here so strongly manifested. In Centι⅛J America, though its ornis is of the
                    richest, we find not a single peculiar family of Birds, and those which it, to a
                    more or less limited extent, shows with the other Subregions of the Neotropical

                    small but widely-ranging family of the northern hemisphere, which it has in
                    common with the Antillean Subregion. 5 other families, however, <hi
                    rend="italic">Paridoe, Sittidoe,</hi><hi rend="italic">Certhiidce,</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Laniidoe,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Meleagridae,</hi> belonging
                    also to the Nearctic Region, occur here. Of genera which are not found elsewhere
                    in the Region, it seems to have 93, but 47, of just more than half, of them are
                    also found in the Nearctic Region; and therefore to obtain anything like a true
                    notion of the Central-American ornis, it will be necessary to keep the two
                    categories apart. Taking first those which are absolutely peculiar, we have 2

                <p>Nicely balanced as these numbers are, they shew a result which might well have
                    been expected from the physical and geographical configuration of the country,
                    while the numbers of other families peculiar to the Neotropical Region, though
                    shared by some of its Subregions, as already given, prove incontestably the
                    propriety of including Central America with that Region; and this would come out
                    even more plainly did our limits permit of the investigation being extended to
                    species, though so many northern forms here find their winter-quarters. It
                    remains to remark that almost the only island of any importance belonging to the
                    Subregion is Socorro, the largest of a small group lying to the westward of
                    Mexico in lat. 18° 30' N., and long. 1 ll <hi rend="superscript"> 0</hi> W. Here
                    out of 9 species of Land-birds, 4 have been described as peculiar, 2 others are
                    elsewhere known as occurring only on the Très Marias, a little group some 250
                    miles nearer the mainland, and 1 is regarded as a local race of a continental
                    species, leaving but 2 (both Birds-of-prey) which cannot be deemed
                    autochthonous. The still more remote Cocos Island, lying in lat. 5° 33' N., and
                    long. 87° W., from which one peculiar species of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Coccyzus</hi><hi rend="italic">(Cuculidae)</hi> is known, may belong just as
                    likely to the Subandean as to the Central-American Subregion.</p>
                <p>(6.) <hi rend="italic">The Antillean</hi> is the only one of the Neotropical
                    Subregions the precise boundaries of which can be definitely laid down; and it
                    is in many respects one of the most suggestive and interesting, comparatively
                    small though it be. Extending from Cape San Antonio de Cuba in the west to
                    Barbadoes in the east, its greatest length is only about 1700 miles, and from
                    Abaco, one of the Bahamas, in the north to Grenada in the south, it does not
                    cover 15 degrees of latitude, while within these limits the proportion of land
                    to water, being less than 98,000 square miles, is very inconsiderable. The
                    unbroken chain of islands which are commonly known as the “West Indies ”—though
                    that term rightly includes not only all of the “Spanish Main,” but an indefinite
                    extent of coast lying both north and south of the ancient dominions of the
                    Catholic King in the New World—forms, geographically, a second line of
                    connection between the two halves of the American continent, separated from the
                    great western isthmus by the deep waters of the Caribbean Sea and the Gulf of
                    Mexico, and at once suggests a former communication by land with Yucatan at the
                    one extremity and with Venezuela at the other, to say nothing of a possible
                    junction with Florida. Yet, as will presently be shewn from a consideration of
                    the peculiar forms of Bird-life which have grown up along the chain, any such
                    communication, if it ever existed, must have been exceedingly remote in point of
                    time; for narrow as are the channels between Cuba and the opposite coast of
                    Central America, between the Bahamas and the south-western peninsula of North
                    America, and between Grenada and Tobago (the last belonging zoologically, as has
                    been already demonstrated, to South America), the fauna of the Antillean chain,
                    instead of being a mixture of that of the almost contiguous countries, differs
                    much from all, and exhibits in some groups a degree of speciality which may be
                    not unfitly compared with that of oceanic islands. Except such as are of coral
                    formation, the Antilles are hilly, not to say mountainous, their summits rising
                    in places to an elevation of 8000 feet, and nearly all, prior to their
                    occupation by Europeans, were covered with luxuriant forest, which, assisting in
                    the collection and condensation of the clouds brought by the trade winds,
                    ensured its own vitality by precipitating frequent and long-continued rains upon
                    the fertile soil Under such conditions we might expect to find an extremely
                    plentiful animal population, one as rich as that which inhabits the same
                    latitudes in Central America, not many degrees further to the west; but no
                    instance perhaps can be cited which shows more strikingly the difference between
                    a continental and an insular fauna, since, making every allowance for the
                    ravages of cultivation by civilized man, the contrary is the case, and possibly
                    no area of land so highly favoured by nature is so poorly furnished with the
                    higher forms of animal life. Here, as over so large a portion of the Australian
                    Region, we find Birds constituting the supreme class—the scarcity of Mammals
                    being accounted for in some measure as a normal effect of insularity.</p>
                <p>Glancing at the entire chain, we may first set aside the Bahamas, a succession of
                    emerged coral-reefs founded on, and to the south and east surrounded by, shoals
                    or banks, broken only here and there by deeper channels; and then by drawing a
                    line to the south of the islands of St Croix <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit03newyrich/page/n766/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0903-0766-0749"/> and St Bartholomew, we find that this line
                    divides the chain into two groups of distinct character—that lying to the
                    southward and eastward, almost identical with the “Windward Islands” of some
                    geographers,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>In the
                    language of others, the “Windward Islands” begin'with Martinique and so continue
                    to Trinidad, while the remainder of the Lesser Antilles, lying eastward of Porto
                    Rico, are called the “Leeward Islands.” Other authorities name all the smaller
                    islands so far as St Thomas “Windward Islands,” and those further westward the
                    “Leeward.” Creoles appear to apply these terms relatively to then-own
                    habitation, just as the dweller on the bank of a river speaks of “up stream” and
                    “down stream” with sole reference to the position he occupies on the margin; and
                    it might be wished, though that were vain, that the use of terms so little
                    definite should be abandoned.</p></note> which, excepting Antigua and Barbadoes,
                    are almost entirely volcanic, while no direct trace of recent volcanic action is
                    known in the group lying to the northward and westward. These three divisions,
                    however natural in appearance, can hardly be affirmed to form as many zoological
                    provinces, owing to the absolute dearth of information respecting many of them,
                    and the insufficient amount which has been received of the remainder. Taking the
                    whole of the Antillean Subregion, the Bahamas, Cuba, Jamaica, St Croix, St
                    Thomas, Sombrero, St Bartholomew, Guadeloupe, Dominica, Martinique, and St Lucia
                    are the only islands of the ornithology of which we have anything more than what
                    may be called a casual account; and hence, though valuable observations
                    respecting some of the rest have been placed on record by travelling
                    naturalists, any attempt to separate the Subregion into proper provinces would
                    necessarily be of the crudest kind, and here cannot be made, though doubtless
                    such provinces will eventually be defined with precision.</p>
                <p>Still enough is known of the Birds of this Subregion to enable us to draw some
                    conclusions, though certain of them seem especially likely to be overset by
                    further investigation. It is inhabited by some 41 families, 1 of which <hi
                    rend="italic">(Todidoe)</hi> is not found elsewhere, 2 more <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Coerébidoe</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Cotingidoe)</hi> are confined to the
                    Neotropical Region, 8 <hi rend="italic">(Mniotiltidoe, Vireonidoe, Tanagridae,
                    Icteridoe, Tyrannidoe, Trochilidoe, Cathartidoe,</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >Aramidae)</hi> are common to that and the Nearctic Region, but are peculiar to
                    the New World, and 30 are of much more general distribution, but 2 of these <hi
                    rend="italic">(Trogonidae</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Fregatidoe)</hi> are not
                    found in the Nearctic Region, and, as the above numbers show, there is no family
                    common to that Region and the Antillean Subregion without also occurring in
                    other parts of the Neotropical Region. On the whole, therefore, the affinity of
                    the Subregion to the Neotropical rather than to the Nearctic Region is fully
                    made out. About 140 genera are found in the Antilles, of which 30 are peculiar
                    to it, being a considerably larger proportion than is elsewhere found in the
                    Neotropical Region. Of these 30 genera, which are all Land-birds, 4 belong to

                    particularize, do not exceed the limits of the Neotropical region, while 5
                    others, belonging respectively to the families <hi rend="italic"
                    >Cypselidae,</hi><hi rend="italic">Fregatidoe, Anatidoe, Columbidoe,</hi> and
                    <hi rend="italic">Rallidoe,</hi> occur both here and elsewhere in that Region
                    without reaching the Nearctic except as stragglers. <hi rend="italic"
                    >Perissoglossa,</hi> belonging to the family <hi rend="italic"
                    >Mniotiltidoe,</hi> is the only genus common to the Nearctic Region and the
                    Antillean Subregion without occurring elsewhere in the Neotropical Region, all
                    the remaining Antillean genera inhabiting both North and South America. The
                    distribution of some of the peculiar genera merits a little attention, for 19
                    out of the 30 are confined to a single island, or nearly-connected group of
                    islands. Thus, Cuba has 6 believed to be restricted to its soil; Jamaica, 7;
                    Hispaniola, 2; and the so-called “Windward Islands,” probably 4; while none are
                    known to be absolutely limited to the Bahamas, to Porto Rico, or the Virgin
                    Islands. It is possible, indeed, that Hispaniola and Porto Rico, if as well
                    explored a3 Cuba and Jamaica have been, might tell a very different story.</p>
                <p>Pursuing the subject further, and entering, so far as space will allow, upon a
                    consideration of details, we find that there are of Land-birds about 200
                    resident species, and nearly 90 which are not resident, but migratory. These
                    last belong to about <hi rend="italic">55</hi> genera, of which some 40 have no
                    resident insular representatives, while those migrants pertaining to genera
                    which possess permanent residents are nearly all as much Neotropical as Nearctic
                    in character. Most of these, so far as is known, visit Cuba only, where over 80
                    are recorded as occurring, while but 30 reach Jamaica. The number, however, in
                    the island last named, and in others, would most likely be not inconsiderably
                    increased did competent observers but exist, though the fact that a well-known
                    species like the Humming-bird of eastern North America <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Trochilus colubris)</hi> does not seek its winter-abode in any of the islands
                    except the Bahamas and Cuba, tends to lessen the force of such a supposition,
                    and points to our actual knowledge being not very far wrong. Among the more
                    interesting of peculiar forms is one genus of <hi rend="italic">Turdidoe</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">(Mimocichla),</hi> which is represented by 4 distinct species,
                    found in the Bahamas, Cuba, Jamaica, and Hispaniola respectively. Another genus
                    of the same family <hi rend="italic">(Margarops)</hi> has a species ranging from
                    Hispaniola to the Virgin Islands, and a second species inhabiting Martinique and
                    St Lucia only, these two islands possessing at the same time a third and
                    peculiar genus <hi rend="italic">(Rham-phodnclus),</hi> containing but a single
                    species, common to both, while they also have another genus <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Cinclocerihia),</hi> a distinct species of which inhabits either island,
                    though a third species of the same is found in Guadaloupe and Nevis. The genus
                    <hi rend="italic">Certhiola,</hi> belonging to the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Coerébidoe,</hi> is remarkable in that it occurs in nearly every island except
                    Cuba; but what seems to be still more extraordinary is that the species found in
                    the Bahamas <hi rend="italic">(C. bahamensis),</hi> and there alone in the whole
                    Subregion, also occurs in Cozumel, an island off the coast of Yucatan, though
                    Cuba intervenes. The distribution of <hi rend="italic">Spindalis,</hi> one of
                    the <hi rend="italic">Tanagridae,</hi> resembles that of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Mimocichla,</hi> above noticed, only that here Porto Rico also has its distinct
                    representative species. Of the peculiar genera of Humming-birds, <hi
                    rend="italic">Eulampis</hi> has 2 species—one ranging from St Lucia t» Nevis,
                    but the second extending northward to St Thomas. <hi rend="italic"
                    >Aithurus,</hi> a very remarkable form, is restricted to Jamaica, while <hi
                    rend="italic">Mellisuga</hi> is common to that island and Hispaniola— each of
                    these genera consisting of but one species only, and the last is the smallest
                    known bird. <hi rend="italic">Orthorhynchus</hi> seems to have 3 species, one
                    extending from St Thomas to Dominica, a second (perhaps barely separable) common
                    to Martinique and St Lucia, and a third to St Vincent and Barbadoes; and,
                    finally, <hi rend="italic">Sporadinus</hi> has one species in Cuba and at least
                    one of the Bahamas, a second species in Hispaniola, and a third in Porto Rico.
                    Of genera of Humming-birds, which are not confined to the Antilles, <hi
                    rend="italic">Lampomis,</hi> a widely-ranging genus, has two species peculiar to
                    Jamaica and Porto Rico respectively; while a third extends from Hispaniola to St
                    Thomas. <hi rend="italic">Calypte,</hi> which has two species in Mexico, has a
                    third peculiar to Cuba, while <hi rend="italic">Doricha</hi> is represented in
                    two of the Bahamas (New Providence and Inagua) by as many distinct species; the
                    other three described species of the form inhabiting Central America, and none,
                    so far as known, occurring in <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit03newyrich/page/n767/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0903-0767-0750"/> Cuba; and thus we have afforded us another case
                    of interrupted generic distribution somewhat like though not quite so
                    extraordinary as that of <hi rend="italic">Certhiola</hi> already noticed. In
                    all, about 17 species of <hi rend="italic">Trochilidoe</hi> are found in the
                    Antilles, of which only one, and that of exceptionally developed migratory
                    habits, occurs elsewhere. The peculiar family <hi rend="italic">Todidoe</hi> has
                    been already mentioned; and it is only necessary here to remark that the single
                    genus <hi rend="italic">Todus</hi> which it contains seems to have 5 species,
                    one limited to each of the large islands, Cuba, Jamaica, Hispaniola, and Porto
                    Rico, the fifth being from an unknown locality.<note anchored="true"

                    asserted by Ledru to have formerly occurred in St Thomas (page 734).</p></note>
                    Much the same has to be said of <hi rend="italic">Saurothera,</hi> a genus of
                    <hi rend="italic">Cuculidoe,</hi> which is represented by a distinct species in

                    rend="italic">Trogonidoe</hi> have two genera, <hi rend="italic"
                    >Prionoteles</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Temnotrogon,</hi> each with a single
                    species, the former peculiar to Cuba, and the latter, which exhibits a
                    remarkable affinity to the African genus <hi rend="italic">HapaLoderma,</hi> to
                    Hispaniola. <hi rend="italic">Pseudoscops,</hi> a genus of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Strigidoe,</hi> is peculiar to Jamaica, but <hi rend="italic">Gymnoglaux,</hi>
                    belonging to the same family, has one species limited to Cuba, while a second
                    extends from Porto Rico to some of the Virgin Islands. Cuba also, besides a
                    widely-ranging species of Kestrel <hi rend="italic">(Tinnunculus),</hi> has a
                    second species which is peculiar to the island. Jamaica, on the other hand,
                    seems to have no Kestrel at all.</p>
                <p>Any speculations as to the former history of the Antilles derived from our
                    imperfect knowledge of their existing ornis would be vain. It is enough to
                    perceive, as the preceding facts will show, that there must here have been no
                    ordinary amount of upheaval and subsidence, of turning land into water and water
                    into land, to account for the present distribution of their avifauna. More
                    wonderful than any evidence given by the Birds, is that which is afforded by
                    other Classes. It is asserted that <hi rend="italic">Solenodon,</hi> an
                    Antillean genus of Insectivorous Mammals, has its nearest ally in a Malagasy
                    form; and a splendid Butterfly, found only in Jamaica <hi rend="italic">(Urania
                    sloanii),</hi> belongs to a genus of which while two other species are known
                    from Central and South America respectively, the only other genus resembling it
                    is one that inhabits Madagascar.</p>
                <p>III. <hi rend="smallcaps">The</hi><hi rend="smallcaps">Ne</hi><hi
                    rend="smallcaps">arctic Region</hi> comprises all that is left of the American
                    continent, after the Neotropical Region has been taken off, and certain outlying
                    groups of islands, such as the Aleutian chain, with its immediate dependencies,
                    and the Bermudas—none of them, however, being of any great importance,—as well
                    as the circumpolar lands lying westward of long. 60 <hi rend="superscript">
                    c</hi> W., and Greenland. The confines of these two Regions, as before stated
                    (page 748), are as yet but vaguely traced. All that is known for certain is that
                    the more northern runs considerably southward along the highlands of Central
                    America, and that its influence, as determined by the presence of resident
                    genera of northern extraction, is perceptibly felt on the summits or slopes of
                    the mountains, at least so far southward as lat. 20° N. In the lowlands the
                    boundary lies much further towards the north, and, perhaps, in general terms,
                    may be placed somewhere about lat. 25° N., while both in lowlands and highlands,
                    as above explained, the northern influence varies with the seasons of the year,
                    being greatest in winter, when the migratory birds, which breed in the Nearctic
                    Region, have turned their flight southward, and least in summer, when they have
                    retired to their northern homes. If the avifauna of the Neotropical Region
                    could, in a wide sense, be truly termed homogeneous, much more is this the state
                    of the case with the Nearctic. Of the 63 families<note anchored="true"

                    Birds, which is the highest number that it seems possible to count for this
                    region, only 1, <hi rend="italic">Chamoeidoe,</hi> is peculiar, and the validity
                    of the grounds on which this has been established as such may be open to
                    question; 44 of them are also Pahsarctic; and the remaining 18 are common to the
                    Neotropical Region, of which last number at least 4 <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Trogonidoe, Plotidoe, Fregatidoe,</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >Phaetontidoe)</hi> have a much more extended range. Thus there are 14
                    peculiarly American families left. These are <hi rend="italic">Mniotiltidoe,
                    Coerebidoe, Tanagridoe, Vireonidae, Icteridae, Tyrannidoe, Trochilidoe,
                    Momotidoe, Aridoe, Cathartidoe, Graddoe, Meleagridae, Tantalidae,</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">Aramidae.</hi> But the propriety of here admitting <hi
                    rend="italic">Trogonidoe</hi> (mentioned above) aud <hi rend="italic"
                    >Momotidoe</hi> is very doubtful; for, though included by Dr Coues, they are
                    omitted by Professor Baird from his <hi rend="italic">North American Birds,</hi>
                    the most recent work on the subject. The claim of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Coerebidoe</hi> to be considered Nearctic is also slender, resting on the fact
                    that a small colony of the Sugar-bird which inhabits the Bahamas <hi
                    rend="italic">(Certhiola bahamensis)</hi> has established itself on one of the
                    Florida Cays. The <hi rend="italic">Aridoe</hi> are represented in the Region by
                    a single species only—the long-known Carolina Parrakeet <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Conurus carolinensis);</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">Tanagridoe,</hi> a
                    family containing upwards of forty genera, have but one genus <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Pyranga),</hi> exemplified by four or five species, out of about a dozen,
                    which occur within its limits.</p>
                <p>On the other hand, the peculiarly American families best represented in the
                    Nearctic Region seem to be four in number,— <hi rend="italic">Mniotiltidoe,</hi>
                    by 13 genera and about 50 species, <hi rend="italic">Vireonidoe</hi> by 1 genus
                    and 14 species, <hi rend="italic">Icteridae</hi> by 8 genera and 21 species, and
                    <hi rend="italic">Tyrannidoe</hi> by 8 genera and 26 species. The first of
                    these, however, can alone be regarded as eminently characteristic of the Region,
                    since that affords a home to all but 3 of the genera, but at the same time, only
                    about one-half of the described species occur there. None of the rest can
                    compare with it in this respect, <hi rend="italic">Vireonidoe</hi> having 5
                    genera and 50 species, <hi rend="italic">Icteridae</hi> 24 genera and 105
                    species, and <hi rend="italic">Tyrannidoe</hi> 71 genera and 324 species in the
                    Neotropical Region.</p>
                <p>Coming now to the genera of Nearctic birds, we may put the number perhaps at 330,
                    of which 24 seem to be peculiar to the Region; 2 of them belong to <hi
                    rend="italic">Turdidoe,</hi> 1 to <hi rend="italic">Chamoeidoe, Paridoe,
                    Troglodytidoe,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Motacillidoe</hi> respectively, 5 to
                    <hi rend="italic">Ember</hi><hi rend="italic">izidoe,</hi> 2 to <hi
                    rend="italic">Corvidoe,</hi> 1 to each of <hi rend="italic">Picidoe,
                    Falconidoe,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Columbidoe,</hi> 5 to <hi rend="italic"
                    >Tetraonidoe,</hi> and 1 to <hi rend="italic">Scolopacidoe, Anatidoe,</hi> and
                    <hi rend="italic">Larxdoe</hi> respectively. But it is perhaps worth remarking
                    that the families <hi rend="italic">Emberizidoe</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >Tetraonidoe,</hi> here most abundantly represented by genera, are still more
                    abundantly represented in like manner elsewhere. In the Neotropical Region we
                    have some 30 and in the Old World some 15 genera of the former, which are not
                    found in the Nearctic Region; and the Old World has some 30 genera of the latter
                    which are not found in the New. On the other hand it must be admitted that if we
                    subdivide the American <hi rend="italic">Tetraonidoe</hi> into sections or sub
                    families, we find that while one of those sections, the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Odon</hi><hi rend="italic">tophorinoe,</hi> is peculiar to America, the balance
                    as regards the other, <hi rend="italic">Tetraoninae,</hi> is clearly in favour
                    of its greater development in North America, where we have 3 genera absolutely
                    peculiar, as well as 3 others which are also found in the Palaearctic Region.
                    With this Region, indeed, the Nearctic has about 128 generain common, having 178
                    which are also Neotropical. Returning to these last presently, it may be
                    advisable here to give some particulars of those which are common to both sides
                    of the North Atlantic. 1 belongs to each of the families <hi rend="italic"

                <p>The genera which occur both in the Nearctic and Neotropical Regions, without
                    appearing in the Palaearctic, must be divided into two categories in order to
                    arrive at a just estimate of the relations of the avifaunas of the first two.
                    These categories consist of those genera which, being only winter visitants to
                    the southern Region, do not breed there, and those which may fairly be called
                    common to both. The latter need perhaps no further attention, after what has
                    been previously said of the Central-American Subregion (p. 748), but the former
                    require some notice. Of those in this category 1 genus belongs to each of the
                    families <hi rend="italic">Sylviidoe</hi> and <hi rend="italic"

                    be considered characteristic of the Nearctic Region, and might, indeed, be not
                    inappropriately added to the 24 genera which are, as already said, peculiar
                    thereto; but even if this be done, we find the number of peculiar and
                    characteristic genera (taken together) of the Nearctic Region to be only 51—a
                    smaller number than that of the genera of Land-birds alone (57) which are common
                    to the Palaearctic, and considerably less than half the number of all genera
                    which are found on both sides of the Atlantic (128), while the remaining genera
                    which are strictly common to the Neotropical (151) is much larger again. Thus,
                    regarded simply from an ornithologist’s point of view, what we call the Nearctic
                    “Region” seems to have no right to be considered one of the primary Regions of
                    the earth’s surface, and to be of less importance than some of the Subregions of
                    the Neotropical Region, as may be shewn more plainly by the following table

                <p>It is not, however, intended here to question the validity of the Nearctic Region
                    in a zoogeographical sense. If that position could be successfully disputed, it
                    must be done on more than ornithological grounds, and a consideration of them
                    would be out of place in this article. It is enough to mention that though the
                    Mammals would possibly lead to much the same conclusion as the Birds do, yet the
                    lower Classes of Vertebrates—Reptiles, Amphibians, and Fishes —would most likely
                    have a contrary tendency, while the present writer is quite unable to guess at
                    the result which would be afforded by the Invertebrates. Now, as in map ping out
                    the W(θrld into zoological Regions all animais have to be regarded, he has no
                    wish to disturb the scheme which has been so generally approved, but contents
                    himself with pointing out that the case for its adoption is not in this
                    particular instance strengthened by the evidence given by the Class <hi
                    rend="italic">Aves.</hi></p>
                <p>A great majority of the Nearctic families and genera of Birds appear to be
                    generally distributed throughout all the “Subregions,” or perhaps it would be
                    better to call them “provinces,” into which ingenuity can separate the Region.
                    And on this account, as well as from what has been urged in the preceding
                    paragraph, it seems unnecessary to treat of each “Subregion” or “province” so
                    fully as has hitherto been done in the present article. Indeed such districts
                    are not easily defined, and their definition rests rather on differences of
                    species than of higher groups, as we have found to be the case in discussing the
                    several component parts of the other Regions we have considered. Professor
                    Baird, in a masterly treatise on this and another subject,<note anchored="true"

                    constitutes the Nearctic Region into <hi rend="italic">two</hi> principal
                    sections, the Eastern extending from the Atlantic sea-board westward across the
                    Alleghany Mountains and over the valley of the Mississippi and its fertile
                    prairies to about long. 100° W., where the sterile plains begin. The western
                    boundary of this division, however, is not sharply defined, nor does it coincide
                    with any meridian line, but lies somewhat obliquely and interdigitates with the
                    eastern confines of the next division by extending westward along the
                    riverbottoms. Marching with this irregular frontier we have the second, or
                    Western, great division reaching thence to the shores of the Pacific, and though
                    the character of its avifauna is much the same through and beyond the Rocky
                    Mountains to the eastern slope of the Sierra Nevada and Cascade Mountains of
                    California and Oregon, it changes somewhat on their western slope and thence to
                    the sea, exhibiting modifications which may warrant further separation into a
                    truly Western and a Central subdivision—thus making in all <hi rend="italic"
                    >three</hi> provinces for the whole of the more southern part of the Nearctic
                    Region, while each of them shews, as might be expected, indicatione of
                    additional change, subject in great measure to the degree of latitude under
                    which any particular locality in them may lie.</p>
                <p>Having thus pointed out the three provinces into which this portion of the Region
                    can be separated, it may be well to cull from Professor Baird’s investigations
                    of the subject some further details. The boundary of the Eastern province,
                    which, taking up an old name, we may perhaps term the “Alleghanian”—from the
                    principal mountain range within its limits,—starts from the Gulf of Mexico, near
                    the eastern border of Texas, perhaps between the rivers Brazos and Sabinè, and
                    following the course of the former to the great American Desert, in about long.
                    100° W., runs northward, forced sometimes more or less westward, especially
                    along the Platte, and sometimes eastward. It crosses the Platte between Forts
                    Kearney and Laramie, and apparently intersects the Missouri about Fort Lookout.
                    Reaching the southern frontier of the Dominion of Canada, it rapidly inclines to
                    the westward, and including the valleys of the Saskatchewan and the Athabasca,
                    it crosses the Rocky Mountains, and, cutting the river Yukon below the junction
                    of the Pelly and the Porcupine, loses itself in the wilds which border the
                    Arctic Ocean. Since the Middle province—on which as yet no more precise name has
                    been bestowed—lies for the most part between the Alleghanian and the Western or
                    “Californian,” as it has been entitled, the boundaries of this last had best, so
                    far <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit03newyrich/page/n769/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0903-0769-0752"/> as is possible, be j,iven. Its extent both
                    southward and northward is somewhat indefinite. The avifauna of Cape San Lucas,
                    at the extremity of the peninsula of Old or Lower California, is said to be
                    thoroughly that of the “Middle” province, but whether the whole of that
                    promontory is to be reckoned as belonging thereto, or only its eastern border,
                    is not known. It appears, however, that some of the most characteristic forms of
                    the Middle province find their way to the Pacific coast through a break in the
                    mountains opposite to San Diego, and it is to be remarked that the difference
                    between the species of birds found at Cape San Lucas (of which about a score are
                    absolutely peculiar) and of Mazatlan, though separated only by the breadth of
                    the Gulf of California, is very great. Northward the boundary of the Californian
                    province probably runs along the Sierra Nevada and the Cascade Mountains before
                    named, so that its extent is contracted to a mere strip along the coast, while
                    still further to the north, in British Columbia, no precise details of its
                    limits have as yet reached this country. But it would seem that in Alaska, as
                    will presently be stated at greater length, an avifauna presenting many very
                    different characters from any found elsewhere in America is reached, for here we
                    encounter a number of genuine Palaearctic forms.</p>
                <p>But these are not all the zoological provinces into which this part of North
                    America can be separated. A <hi rend="italic">fourth,</hi> of especially Arctic
                    type, occupies the northern portion of the continent, and gradually melts away
                    into the rest, extending far to the southward along the highest ranges, even to
                    Fort Burgwyn, in lat. 37° N., if not beyond. This province may be called the
                    “Canadian,” from the ancient colony of that name constituting so large a portion
                    of it, but its limits must be confessed to be indefinite in a high degree. The
                    eastern half, at least, of the British possessions in North America are herein
                    included, and the province may be deemed to extend across Davis’s Strait to
                    Greenland.</p>
                <p>In noticing these provinces, the results of Professor Baird’s researches have
                    been, with little deviation, mainly adopted, but his enquiries have been largely
                    supplemented by the more recent investigations of Mr J. A. Allen, who has
                    admirably carried out the further subdivision of the Eastern, or, as it has been
                    termed, the Alleghanian province, together with part of what has just been
                    denominated the Canadian. Regarding the whole eastern half of the continent as
                    one province, he recognises in it the existence of seven distinct ornithological
                    faunas, namely, the Floridan, the Louisianian, the Carolinan, the Alleghanian,
                    the Canadian, the Hudsonian, and the American-Arctic, comparing them also with
                    the distribution therein of Mammals and Reptiles.<note anchored="true"

                    limited scope, has, in truth, a very general bearing.</p>
                <p>The provinces above named (and naturally the districts which they comprise)
                    appear to be characterized rather by the presence or absence of certain species
                    of widely-spread genera than by the presence or absence of the genera
                    themselves, and much less of families, but it seems expedient to notice some of
                    the chief exceptions to general distribution in the latter of these groups.
                    First we have the peculiar family of <hi rend="italic">Chamoeidoe,</hi>
                    restricted so far as is known to the coast-district of California, where it is
                    represented by a single genus and a single species; and then among families of
                    greater range, the <hi rend="italic">Coerébidoe,</hi> already introduced to us
                    as a Neotropical group, but in the Nearctic Region existing only in the case of
                    the colony of a species of <hi rend="italic">Certhiola</hi> before noticed; the
                    <hi rend="italic">Aridoe,</hi> nowadays almost limited to Western Louisiania,
                    Arkansas, and Florida, but formerly known along the whole valley of the
                    Mississippi to the verge of the Great Lakes, and even occasionally penetrating
                    to Pennsylvania and the State of New York; the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Cathartidoe,</hi> of which one genus <hi rend="italic">{Pseudogryphus),</hi>
                    having for its sole species one of the largest birds of flight, the Californian

                    coast from a little north of the Columbia River to the Colorado, extending

                    >(Cathartes)</hi> one species ranges from the Strait of Magellan to the
                    Saskatchewan, but a second hardly strays further northward than North Carolina,
                    and does not occur on the Pacific coast of the United States; the Turkeys <hi
                    rend="italic">(Meleagridae),</hi> found only to the eastward of the Rocky
                    Mountains, and now extinct in most of the settled districts of Pennsylvania, New
                    England, and Canada; the Wood-Ibises <hi rend="italic">(Tantalidae),</hi>
                    belonging to the southern country from the Colorado eastward, and so far to the
                    north as the State of Ohio and the Carolinas; the Spoonbills <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Plataleιdce),</hi> with apparently much the same range as the last, but more
                    limited towards the north, being of only accidental occurrence on the Lower
                    Mississippi and in the Carolinas; the Courlans <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Aramidoe),</hi> frequenting in this region only the shores of the Gulf of
                    Mexico and the coast of Florida; the Flamingoes <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Phoenicopteridoe),</hi> with haunts nearly as much confined, though
                    occasionally reaching South Carolina; the Pelicans <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Pelecanidoe),</hi> having one species abundant in the Western and only by
                    chance occurring in the Middle and Eastern states, while a second is of strictly
                    marine habit, and is found on the coast of California, and in the Gulf of Mexico
                    and the shoals of Florida. The single representative of the Darters <hi
                    rend="italic">(Plotidoe)</hi> in summer reaches North Carolina and Illinois, but
                    that of the Frigate-birds <hi rend="italic">(Fregatidoe)</hi> is confined to the
                    shores of the great Gulf, while that of the Tropic-birds <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Phaetontidoe)</hi> not only haunts the same waters but also finds a nursery in
                    the Bermudas; the species of Divers <hi rend="italic">(Colymbidoe)</hi> breed
                    only in the north—Halifax, in lat. 45° N., being perhaps their most southern
                    limit of reproduction; while, finally; the Auks <hi rend="italic"

                    are Land-birds, belonging to 63 genera, whereof 20 at the outside are peculiarly

                    not having been found elsewhere in the New World, while the home of 5 seems
                    doubtful. These numbers will show the great influence of Palaearctic forms on
                    Alaska, and it only remains to be said that some of the ordinary summer-migrants
                    thither would seem to arrive there from Asia, as the Wagtail and Willow-Wren
                    just mentioned, to which should possibly be added the Wheatear <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Saxicola</hi><hi rend="italic">aenanthe),</hi> for though that species is
                    known as a regular annual visitant to Greenland and Labrador (where it breeds),
                    and almost annually appears as a straggler on the eastern coast of the United
                    States, the flocks which throng the stony hill-tops of Alaska in spring are not
                    likely to have performed a north-west passage from Europe, and indeed it is
                    stated that specimens from Norton Sound differ considerably in dimensions from
                    those obtained in Greenland. All these Birds are unseen in British Columbia, and
                    as all are migratory, the inference that they make some part of Asia their
                    winter-quarters is almost irresistible.</p>
                <p>After all, perhaps there is nothing very surprising in this, when we consider the

                    which in these longitudes the New World is divided from the Old, and it would
                    seem that it is almost within the confines of the Arctic circle that, apart from
                    circumpolar species, the connection of the faunas of the two continents is
                    closest. At any rate, the Aleutian Islands, though they look like
                    stepping-stones from the one to the other, do not appear to be used as a route
                    of communication; for Mr Dall calls especial attention to the fact that no
                    intrusion of Asiatic forms occurs towards the western end of the chain, while
                    observing that its avifauna beyond Oonalaska is reinforced by several Arctic
                    species not possessed by more eastern islands.<note anchored="true"

                <p>Northward of the Aleutians lies a little volcanic group known as the Prybilov
                    Islands, whose coasts are frequently encumbered by ice, and there only 40
                    species of Birds have as yet been found, while those which breed are about 12 in
                    number, and among them a Sandpiper <hi rend="italic">(Tringa ptilocnemis),</hi>
                    apparently peculiar to St Paul’s Island, the largest of the group. Only one of

                    in Alaska, seems there to occur—a fact which points yet again to the more
                    northern connection of the two continents by way of Cape Prince-of-Wales and the
                    East Cape (Vostochni) of Asia.</p>
                <p>We have next to turn to another group of islands, situated in a different ocean,
                    and in formation very unlike that last considered. These are the Bermudas, a
                    cluster of low coral-reefs rising from the Atlantic, about 600 miles from Cape
                    Hatteras, the nearest point on the eastern coast of North America. They possess
                    but few Land-birds, and not a single peculiar species, yet they play by no means
                    an unimportant part as a resting-station to the flocks of migrants as they
                    retreat southward from their northern homes in Labrador and Greenland, and,
                    though less often, on their northward journey in spring. Only about 6 Landbirds
                    are resident, and about as many Water-birds are known to breed there; but the
                    number of stragglers is large, and includes two or three of undoubtedly European
                    extraction.</p>
                <p>Greenland is the last portion of the Nearctic Region to which we shall especially
                    invite attention, and there though the character of the avifauna is certainly
                    that of the New World, yet that of the Old is very influential. Out of the 45
                    genera to which the feathered inhabitants of Greenland belong, none are peculiar
                    to the Palaearctic Region, while 2— <hi rend="italic">Zonotrichia,</hi> one of

                    to the Nearctic. If we take the species, we find that of the 63 inhabitants,
                    those peculiar to the New World amount to 11, while those not elsewhere dwelling
                    out of the Old are only 5. &lt; But, on the other hand, the Sea-Eagle <hi

                    Iceland; and a large portion of the country though undoubtedly exposed in the

                    which have not been known to occur, and only about 5 which have not been known
                    to breed, in the Old World.</p>
                <p>It has been already stated that 128 out of the 330 Nearctic genera, or more than
                    one-third, are common also to the Palaearctic Region. This will serve to shew
                    the great similarity of the two; and if we investigate the species, the
                    similarity is still to a great extent borne out. Taking the number of Nearctic
                    species at 700 (which is perhaps an exaggeration), and that of the Palaearctic
                    at 850 (which is certainly under the mark), we find that, exclusive of
                    stragglers, there are about 100 common to the two Regions. Nearly 20 more are
                    Palaearctic but occasionally occur in America, and about 50 are Nearctic which
                    from time to time stray to Europe or Asia.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>Professor Baird, in the essaybefore cited, has reasonably
                    accounted for this disproportionate reciprocity between Europe and America; but
                    perhaps something more than he has allowed must be set down to the comparative
                    want of records in the new country, where observers and amateur collectors have
                    until lately been scarce. This want is, however, being speedily supplied by the

                    throughout the United States.</p></note> But this is not the only ground of the
                    resemblance. Of many genera the species found in the New World are represented
                    in the Old by species which often no one but an expert can distinguish. Of such
                    representative or parallel species, somewhere about 80 might be enumerated; and
                    thus the relation of the two regions may be concisely stated :—</p>

                    Zoological Region was first shown by Mr Sclater, in the paper to which reference
                    has before been made,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"

                    most classes of animals there have been few to doubt that it is an extremely
                    natural one. Not indeed altogether so homogeneous as the Nearctic Region, it
                    presents however even at its extreme points no very striking difference between
                    the bulk of its Birds. Though Japan is far removed from Western Europe, and
                    though a few generic forms and still fewer families inhabit the one without also
                    frequenting the other, yet there is a most astonishing similarity in a large
                    portion of their respective Birds, ς∖In some cases the closest examination has
                    failed to detect any distinction that may be called specific between the members
                    of their avifauna; but in most it is possible to discover just sufficient
                    difference to warrant a separation of the subjects. Nevertheless it is clear
                    that in Japan we have as it were a repetition of some of our most familiar
                    species—the Redbreast and the Hedge-Sparrow for example—slightly modified in
                    plumage or otherwise so as to furnish instances of the most accurate
                    representation.</p>
                <p>The limits of the western portion of the Region are definite enough, for except
                    in its African province it is girt by the sea, but even there we find a boundary
                    hardly inferior to a coast-line in the precision with which it may be recognized
                    and in the influence it exerts. This is the Great Desert, commonly known as the
                    Sahara, which, though yearly crossed by innumerable multitudes of many of the
                    more migratory species, just as the sea itself is traversed by them, acts as a
                    complete barrier to the less migratory and to the residents, cutting off the
                    denizens of Morocco, Algeria, and Tunis from the rest of the continent to which
                    they are geographically attached. Further to the eastward, however, the limits
                    of the Region are if in any way marked at least but little known, though
                    indications are not wanting to show that the avifauna of Tripoli is rather
                    Ethiopian than Palaearctic in its character. When we reach Egypt we have a state
                    of things which may be compared to that debatable land in Central America
                    wherein the Neotropical and Nearctic avifaunas meet but hardly mingle. During
                    winter the bird-population of the Nile-valley is formed almost exclusively of
                    the hordes of European migrants of nearly all Orders and families which there
                    seek refuge. When spring returns these begin to troop across the Mediterranean,
                    and their place is taken by the indigenous Birds of Egypt which had been either
                    reduced to comparative insignificance by, or actually thrust out before, the
                    northern invaders. The seaboard of Palestine, and even its interior, until the
                    western limits of the Jordan-basin are touched, are on the contrary almost
                    purely Palaearctic, but the depressed valley of the Ghor, part of which is sunk
                    about 1300 feet below the level of the Mediterranean, seems to be an outlier of
                    the Ethiopian Region, and though the scanty avifauna of the Mountains of Moab
                    may possess a northern phase, the desert, with its characteristic, and in the
                    main Ethiopian, forms of animallife almost immediately succeeds, and it is not
                    until the fertile plains of Mesopotamia are approached or attained that we can
                    feel assured we have again entered the Palaearctic area, which may be considered
                    to reach the head of the Persian Gulf. Coasting this inlet on its eastern side
                    we have a fauna the character of which it is as yet impossible to declare, and
                    this difficulty becomes greater still when we emerge into the Indian Ocean. It
                    seems most probable that Beloochistan belongs to the Palaeartic Region, but if
                    not then the line of demarcation must run inland and so continue between that
                    land and Afghanistan till, ascending the right bank of the valley of the Indus,
                    it turns the shoulder of the Great Snowy Range and thence proceeds in the
                    direction already traced parallel to the southern frontier of Thibet, and across
                    the intervening portion of the Chinese Empire, once more to the ocean. Arrived
                    here the remaining limits of the Region are as well marked by the coastdine as
                    they were in Europe. They extend to Kamchatka, and rounding the furthest verge
                    of Asia, within the Arctic Circle, they return by the north coast of Siberia
                    till the confines of Europe are again reached.</p>
                <p>To separate this vast area into subsidiary districts according to the zoological
                    properties of each is perhaps a less easy task than is the same operation with
                    regard to the Nearctic Region, and, as in that case, the mapping-out of the
                    whole into Subregions is almost impossible except it be done arbitrarily.
                    Nevertheless the attempt must be made, and, though in the Asiatic half
                    considerable assistance is to be derived from a careful essay by Mr Elwes,<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi rend="italic">Proceedings
                    of the Zoological Society,</hi> 1873, p, 615.</p></note> respecting the European
                    moiety much doubt may be reasonably entertained.</p>
                <p>The very fulness of the information which we possess as to the ornis of some
                    countries of Europe makes the scarcity of it in respect to others all the more
                    conspicuous, and renders any really comprehensive view of the whole all the more
                    difficult. Grounds are not wanting at first sight in favour of a longitudinal or
                    approximately longitudinal division of this quarter of the globe, in which case
                    the line of demarcation might be taken to run up the Adriatic Sea, and starting
                    from the neighbourhood of Trieste, to cross the Camic Alps, descend the valley
                    of the Inn till it falls into the Danube, and thence follow the angular mountain
                    frontier of Bohemia as far as the head-waters of the Niesse, along which it
                    would proceed to their junction with the Oder, and so to the Baltic a little to
                    the westward of Stettin. Thence it might be continued northward between (Eland
                    and Gottland up the Gulf of Bothnia to the confines of Sweden and Finland, where
                    cutting the Scandinavian peninsula to the westward of the Lower Torneâ and its
                    affluent the Muonio it would strike the shores of the Arctic Ocean perhaps on
                    the Lyngen Fjord. Though undoubtedly most species of Birds are common to both
                    sides of this imaginary line, yet it would be found to divide the breeding-range
                    of a few which are very characteristic of the east and west of Europe
                    respectively. But on further consideration it would seem that though such a
                    division as has just been suggested may be convenient if not natural for the
                    countries lying north of the Mediterranean basin, those, such as the three
                    principal peninsulas which project into the great inland sea, together with the
                    portion of North Africa which was at one time known as Mauritania, form a group
                    which have much in common, and collectively differ more from the countries lying
                    further to the north than the two (Eastern and Western) divisions of Central and
                    Northern Europe, just suggested, do from one another. Accordingly it seems best
                    to adopt primarily a latitudinal division of the Western part of the Palaearctic
                    Region. This done we should have as our first Subregion all Europe north of the
                    Pyrenees, the Alps, the Balkan, the Black Sea, and the Caucasus, and since it
                    would thus comprehend by far the greater portion of this quarter of the globe,
                    we may not inappropriately call it the “European” Subregion, further subdividing
                    it if we think fit into a Western and an Eastern Province, according to the
                    boundary above traced—the eastern boundary of the last being indeed very
                    uncertain, though perhaps to <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit03newyrich/page/n772/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0903-0772-0755"/> be limited by the Ural Mountains and the River of
                    the same name. Next we should have the Subregion to which we may most properly
                    affix the name of “Mediterranean,” comprehending the portion of North Africa
                    already indicated, the Iberian and Italian peninsulas, as well as Turkey in
                    Europe and the Peloponnesus, but we must extend it far to the eastward through
                    Asia Minor and Persia until it touches the Indian Region. The lofty range of the
                    Caucasus would divide it from the European Subregion between the Black Sea and
                    the Caspian; beyond the latter, however, we cannot do more than guess that the
                    desert of the Tekko Turcomans and the mountains of Cabool would form its
                    northern boundary. Then stretching from the eastern shores of the Caspian in a
                    wide belt, but how wide is a matter of the greatest uncertainty, comes the third
                    Subregion, which we may call the “Mongolian ”—marching with the Mediterranean
                    Subregion till the Hindoo Koosh is reached, and thence coincident with the
                    southern borders of the Region towards the Yellow Sea—possibly following the
                    course of the Yangstzekiang. To this Subregion also would belong the greater
                    part if not the whole of Japan. Northward again we have the great “Siberian”
                    Subregion, but materials for any attempt to shew whether its southern boundary
                    is capable of being laid down are absolutely wanting. Even on the seaboard it is
                    at present impossible to say whether it is in Manchuria that one Subregion
                    passes into the other, or whether first the Stannovoi and further inland the
                    Altai Mountains mark their respective limits.</p>
                <p>Having thus indicated the component parts of the whole area, it is time to say
                    somewhat of its avifaunal characters. Like the Nearctic the Palaearctic Region
                    seems to produce but a single peculiar family of Birds—the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Panuridae,</hi> the type of which is the beautiful species known to Englishmen
                    as the Bearded Titmouse <hi rend="italic">(Panurus biarmicus)</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">—</hi> and this is a family which has not been long or very
                    generally recognized. Its members, however, are found stationed at intervals
                    from the western to the eastern extremity, and every attempt to refer them to
                    other groups of Birds has proved unsatisfactory—for the different genera (about
                    the number of which there is much doubt) have often been widely scattered by
                    systematists, one being placed at times with the Titmouse-family <hi
                    rend="italic">(Parùke),</hi> at times with the Buntings <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Ernberizidae),</hi> another relegated to the Finches <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Fringillidae),</hi> and a third or even more to the so-called “Babblers” <hi
                    rend="italic">(Timeliidae).</hi> The entire number of Palaearctic families,
                    computing them as we have already done those of other Regions, is about 67, not
                    counting 1 other <hi rend="italic">(Nectar iniidae)</hi> of which a single
                    species is peculiar to the valley of the Ghor, and that of the genera 323, about
                    which there can be little doubt, or if any exist it may be that the number is
                    understated. Of these as we have above mentioned 128 are common to the Nearctic
                    Region. Species of 5l more seem to occur as true natives both in the Ethiopian
                    and Indian Regions, of which 4 genera belong to <hi rend="italic"

                    the Australian and Neotropical Regions would be simply a waste of time, for the
                    points of resemblance are extremely few, and such as they are they lead to
                    nothing. It will therefore be seen from the above that next to the Nearctic
                    Region, the Palaearctic has a much greater affinity to the Indian than to any
                    other, a fact which need not surprise us when we consider the great extent of
                    their contact.</p>
                <p>Having shewn this much we have next to deal with the peculiarities of the Region
                    under our view. At the lowest computation 37 genera seem to be peculiar to it,
                    though it is certain that species of several are regularly wont to wander beyond
                    its limits in winter seeking a southern climate there to avoid the distress they
                    would suffer in that of their birth. Of these genera 3 are to be apportioned to
                    the Warblers, <hi rend="italic">Sylviidoe;</hi> probably 2 to the Babblers, <hi
                    rend="italic">Timeliidae</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> at least 3 or perhaps 4 to

                <p>The European Subregion does not seem to possess a single genus which can be

                    peculiarities too remarkable to be here left unnoticed. First we have the
                    Azores, the subject of an excellent monograph by Mr Frederick Godman,<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi rend="italic">Natural

                    which is contained the result of his own investigations in that group, as well
                    as those of his predecessors. There is a general tendency among Azorean Birds to
                    vary more or less from their continental representatives, and this is especially
                    shown by the former having always darker plumage and stronger bills and legs. In
                    one instance the variation is so excessive that it fully justifies the
                    establishment of a specific distinction. This is the case of the Bullfincjι of
                    the more eastern of these islands <hi rend="italic">(Pyrrhula</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">murina),</hi> the male of which, instead of the ruddy breast of
                    its well-known congener (P. <hi rend="italic">vulgaris),</hi> has that part of a
                    sober mouse-colour. A similar sombre hue distinguishes the peculiar Chaffinch of
                    the Canary Islands <hi rend="italic">(Fringilla</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >teydea),</hi> but to these islands as well as the Azores and Madeiras there
                    belongs in common another Chaffinch <hi rend="italic">(F. tintiUon),</hi> which,
                    though very nearly allied to that of Mauritania (<hi rend="italic">F.
                    spodiogenia),</hi> is perfectly recognizable, and not found elsewhere. Madeira
                    has also its peculiar Golden-crested Wren <hi rend="italic">(Regulus
                    maderensis),</hi> and its peculiar Pigeon <hi rend="italic">(Columba

                    Canaries. Further on this subject we must not go; we can only state that Mr
                    Godman has shown good reason for declaring that the avifauna of all these
                    islands is the effect of colonization extending over a long period of years, and
                    going on now.</p>

                    >Scolopacidoe;</hi> but as its breeding-quarters have never yet been discovered
                    the matter must remain in doubt. One genus of <hi rend="italic">Laridoe</hi> and
                    6 of <hi rend="italic">Alcidoe</hi> are also common to the Nearctic Region, but

                <p>It would extend the present article far beyond all reasonable bounds were we to
                    dwell upon more than a few of the curiosities of distribution which have been
                    revealed by the continuous observations of European ornithologists. There is no
                    need to travel out of our own island to meet with some of the most remarkable
                    among them, and we may take that of the Nightingale <hi rend="italic">(Daulias
                    luscinia)</hi> as an example. In England the western limit of the range of this
                    incomparable songster seems to be formed by the valley of the Exe, which is only
                    overstepped on rare occasions—Montagu having once heard it near Kingsbridge,
                    while it is said to have been observed at Teignmouth and Barnstaple. But even in
                    the east of Devonshire it is local and rare, as it also is in the north of
                    Somersetshire, though plentiful in other parts of that county. Crossing the
                    Bristol Channel it is said to be not uncommon at times near Cowbridge in
                    Glamorganshire; but this seems to be an isolated spot, or at any rate there is
                    no evidence of its being found elsewhere in Wales, or between that place and
                    Tintern on the Wye, where it has been reported to be plentiful. Thence there is
                    more or less good testimony of its occurrence in Herefordshire, Shropshire,
                    Staffordshire, Derbyshire, and so on, to about 5 miles north of York, but not
                    further. Along the line thus sketched out and immediately to the east and south
                    of it, the appearance of the nightingale, even if regular, which may be doubted,
                    is rare, and the bird exceedingly local; but in many parts of the midland,
                    eastern, and southern counties it is abundant, and the woods, coppices, and
                    gardens ring with that thrilling song which has been the theme of writers in all
                    ages. There are many assertions of its occurrence in England further to the
                    northward, but some of them rest on anonymous authority only, and all must be
                    regarded with the greatest suspicion. Still more open to doubt are the
                    statements which have been made as to its visits to Scotland, while in Ireland
                    there is no pretence even of its appearance. No reasonable mode of accounting
                    for the partial distribution of the Nightingale has hitherto been propounded:
                    there is no peculiar kind of soil which it especially affects, or none, so far
                    as we know, that it especially avoids; and the same may be said of its relations
                    to the flora of this country. It is not so entirely <hi rend="italic"
                    >adscriptus</hi><hi rend="italic">gleboe</hi> that it will not readily betake
                    itself to new localities suited to its wants, when these have been formed within
                    its natural limits, though they may be miles away from its ancient haunts. On
                    the contrary, it is often one of the first birds to establish itself when a
                    heath has been broken up, and plantations of trees thereon made have grown
                    sufficiently to afford it the sheltering covert that it loves. This instance,
                    taken from a bird whose habits have been so closely studied both in captivity
                    and at large, and one which is so familiar, and in many places so numerous, that
                    abundant opportunities are given for observing all that can be observed about
                    it, shews how futile would be the expectation that in most cases we could at
                    present, even if ever, satisfactorily account for the existing causes which
                    limit the distribution of species. A vast majority of them, we know, have each
                    its bounds, which virtually it cannot pass, and the case of the Nightingale in
                    England, beyond the fact that its distribution is extremely well marked, and
                    therefore has long attracted especial attention, has really nothing out of the
                    common way in it.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>When
                    the history of the earth shall be really well and minutely understood, it seems
                    quite possible that as much light will be shed on this and other particular
                    cases of the same kind by a knowledge of the various changes and displacements
                    which sea and land have undergone as has already been done by the same means in
                    regard to many of the general facts of distribution. The results of the labour
                    of the geologist are doubtless just as necessary to, and closely connected with,
                    the work of the biologist, as those of the investigation of the historian are to
                    and with the efficiency of the statesman; while, in return, the researches of
                    the biologist are, or ought to be, of the greatest service to the geologist. The
                    history of the earth is for a long period of time that of its
                    inhabitants.</p></note> In Europe, the neighbourhood of Copenhagen is the most
                    northern point which our Nightingale is asserted to reach; but on the continent
                    its range is less extended, and though abundant in Mecklenburg, it is not found

                    does it stretch so far to the eastward as Danzig. It occurs, however, sparingly
                    on the Polish frontier, near Thom, and is observed in Austria, Upper Hungary,
                    and Gallizia. In Russia its distribution cannot be laid down with any degree of
                    accuracy, but it does not reach the Governments near the Ural, though it is said
                    to be plentiful in that of Kharkov, and it is known to visit the Crimea. Still
                    further to the eastward it can be traced through Circassia, and as far as Kasbin
                    in Persia. Southward of this imperfectly-drawn line it may be found as a
                    winter-visitant even in Arabia, Nubia, and Abyssinia, as well as in Algeria,
                    where it is reported as breeding, and it would seem to migrate thence so far as
                    the Gold Coast. It is abundant in Spain and Portugal; but it is a stranger to
                    Britanny, the western peninsula of France, just as it is to the western
                    peninsula of England.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"

                <p>One other example we may take, and this, though much less familiar, is equally
                    instructive, as exhibiting some of the as yet unexplained peculiarities of
                    distribution. It shall be from a Bird belonging to a very different Order from
                    the last, having habits entirely dissimilar, and presenting in most ways a great
                    contrast. The Kentish Plover <hi rend="italic">{Aegialitis</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >cantiana),</hi> first determined from specimens obtained on the coast of that
                    English county whence it takes its specific name, has its breeding-place in
                    Britain limited to the pebbly beach between Sandwich and Hastings, and in other
                    parts of the British Islands only occurs as a chance straggler. Yet this bird
                    has as wide a range elsewhere as almost any that could be named—breeding not
                    only abundantly along the greater part of the coasts of the temperate and warmer
                    portions of the Old World north of the Equator, but also occasionally in the
                    interior, as at the base of the Caucasus and in the <hi rend="italic"
                    >chotts</hi> of the North African plains; while during its migrations it wanders
                    to the Malay Archipelago and South Africa, or even seems most likely to be
                    specifically identical with a Plover which is found on the west coast of
                    America, from California southward—though this last has been described as
                    distinct under the name of <hi rend="italic">Ae.</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >nivosa.</hi></p>
                <p>Islands must always be a matter of the greatest interest to the student of
                    Geographical Distribution, and we have already mentioned some peculiarities of
                    those groups which belong to the Mediterranean Subregion of Europe. There are
                    not many more here to be cited. Spitsbergen is supposed to have its peculiar
                    species of Ptarmigan <hi rend="italic">{Lagopus hemileucurus),</hi> though it is
                    confessedly very nearly allied to the Rock-Ptarmigan (Z. <hi rend="italic"
                    >rupestris)</hi> which inhabits the Arctic portion of the American continent and
                    islands, Greenland, and Iceland, but, except in the last-named country, does not
                    occur in the Palaearctic Region. Iceland is also remarkable for being the
                    headquarters of the noble Falcon <hi rend="italic">{Falco islandus)</hi> which
                    takes its name therefrom, though this bird also inhabits the southern districts
                    of Greenland, to say nothing of other countries; and in Iceland alone of the
                    western portion of the Region does the beautiful Harlequin-Duck <hi
                    rend="italic">{Histrionicus torquatus)</hi> breed. It is, however, known to
                    inhabit North America and the eastern half of Siberia.</p>
                <p>Coming nearer home, we have a remarkable case of restricted distribution in the
                    Red Grouse <hi rend="italic">{Lagσρus scoticus),</hi> found (and in certain
                    districts, as every one knows, numerously), in each of the three kingdoms
                    composing the British Islands as well as in the principality of Wales. The
                    details of its local distribution, as of that of all other birds which breed in
                    Great Britain, have been ∙carefully and concisely given by Mr More,<note

                    1865, pp. 1-27, 119-142, 425-458.</p></note> and we do not propose to con sider
                    them here, but what is worthy of remark is that this particular species differs
                    in no essential character save coloration from the Willow-Grouse <hi
                    rend="italic">{L.</hi><hi rend="italic">albus),</hi> which is an abundant bird
                    throughout the whole of the northern parts of the Palaearctic Region from Norway
                    to Kamchatka, and again throughout the same or even lower latitudes of the
                    Nearctic Region from Alaska to Newfoundland. Its remains, as has before been
                    said (page 731), have also been found in the south of France, associated with
                    those of the Reindeer and Snowy Owl. It is not for us now to enter into any
                    hypothetical discussion, but it is hard to resist drawing an inference that at a
                    time, geologically speaking, not very recent, both these species of Grouse had a
                    common ancestor, and that the severe winters to which it has for a long period
                    been exposed have caused the Willow-Grouse to don the snowy garb that is
                    characteristic of it and other species of the genus, the more so since we find
                    it in its first plumage possessed of the coloured quills, which are precisely
                    similar to those of the Red Grouse at the same age.</p>
                <p>Other instances there are in which British-born examples of species common to the
                    continent are in a less degree distinguishable from those of neighbouring
                    countries. The Coal-Titmouse of England is to be recognized from that of
                    continental Europe <hi rend="italic">{Parus ater),</hi> and accordingly by some
                    ornithologists it is regarded as a distinct species <hi rend="italic">{P.

                    Scotland are inhabited by birds between which and European examples no
                    difference can be established. The home-bred Bottle-Titmouse of Britain, too,
                    has, from its darker coloration, been accorded specific rank, but then we
                    occasionally find continental birds of this species <hi rend="italic">{Acredula

                    form <hi rend="italic">(A. rosea)</hi> can hardly be with consistency
                    maintained. Indeed, as a matter of fact, nearly all our smaller birds can be
                    distinguished by an expert from their continental brethren, and this mainly
                    through their duller or darker plumage. The difference is not so great by any
                    means as obtains in the case of the birds of the Atlantic Islands above
                    mentioned, but it most unquestionably exists to a greater or less degree; and it
                    is curious that an analogous state of things is observable in regard to many of
                    the birds of Japan, a country which is subject to many of the same climatic
                    conditions as the British Islands. It will be for future investigators to
                    ascertain the cause of this similarity, we here only record the fact; but
                    another remarkable instance of the forms of the western portion of the region
                    being repeated in the far east, is fouħd in the range of the two kindred species

                    in a geographical point of view. The Ghor, or valley of the Jordan and the
                    depressed basin of the Dead Sea, has been before mentioned as an outlier of this

                    extend its limits further to the eastward, through Beloochistan and even beyond

                    with, the denizens of similar districts in Africa, yet it must be remarked that
                    such forms should be regarded in much the same light as those which frequent
                    wide seas, and that the determination of a desert-tract must therefore depend
                    rather on the fauna which inhabits its islands—as we may term the oases which,
                    whether plentifully or rarely, stud its surface—rather than on the fauna of the
                    desolate space which surrounds these fertile and more favoured spots. Still, it
                    is hardly to be denied that the influence of Ethiopian types is to be discovered
                    in Sindh, Gujerat, and even further in the Indian peninsula. In the Ethiopian

                    some of the most remarkable, however, especially of those peculiar to one of its

                    extraordinary, will presently be mentioned.</p>
                <p>The subdivision of the Ethiopian Region is perhaps accomplished with less
                    difficulty than in the case of the more temperate tracts with which we have
                    lately had to do. Bounded on the north by the Mediterranean Subregion of the
                    Palaearctic Region, we have a Subregion extending from the Cape-Verd Islands on
                    the one side of the continent to Socotra on the other; and with this we must
                    comprehend all the Asiatic territory, whatever be its limits, which is, for
                    zoogeographical purposes, to be annexed to the Ethiopian Region. On the West

                    seems to lie a little to the northward of lat 10° N.; but, owing to the
                    unexplored state of the country, we quickly lose trace of its confines. We may
                    perhaps presume that they more or less follow that parallel to somewhere about
                    long. 15° E., and then trend in a southeasterly direction. On the East Coast the
                    frontier of the Libyan Subregion extends from near Cape Guardafui in a
                    south-westerly direction towards the system of the Great Lakes, all the waters
                    flowing to which it may be held to include; and is then succeeded by the
                    “Mosambican” Subregion, which continues perhaps to Sofala. Beginning on the West
                    Coast, where the Libyan Subregion stops, we have another Subregion, the
                    “Guinean,” comprising the seaboard from Sierra Leone to somewhere about Angola;
                    but as to how far inland, this penetrates we are absolutely without information.
                    The rest of continental Africa forms what may be called the “Caffrarian”<note

                    Comoros, and the widely-scattered Mascarene Islands, constitute a fifth
                    Subregion, the most distinct and remarkable of all, and for this we may most
                    reasonably use the name “Madagascarian.”</p>

                    may perhaps be broken up into four provinces—the Arabian, Egyptian, Abyssinian,
                    and the Gambian; but it must not be expected that all their respective
                    boundaries can be distinctly drawn—those of the first excepted, which, however,
                    seems to be the one that has precisely the fewest positive characteristics, and
                    the propriety of its recognition, except on purely geographical grounds, is most
                    questionable. We may doubt whether it has more than half-adozen peculiar
                    species; but then we know next to nothing of the zoology of any part of Arabia,
                    save the Peninsula of Sinai and the desert of the Tih. As before mentioned the
                    Ostrich occurs here, but its present northern or eastern limits are
                    indeterminate; we know, however, that within recent years it has been killed in
                    the desert of Belka, just on the other side of the Dead Sea. The species which
                    seem to be peculiar to the Jordan basin are— <hi rend="italic"

                <p>The Egyptian province, so far as regards the valley of the Lower Nile, is
                    remarkable for being, as already stated, overrun by migrants from Europe during

                    season that most of our knowledge is derived, it is perhaps not very wonderful
                    that many zoogeographers are inclined to iιrclude this district within the
                    Palaearctic Region. The number of species which occur in Egypt and Nubia, as

                    these more than 230 are natives of the Palaearctic Region; but only between 50
                    and 60, or about one quarter of them, remain to breed in Egypt, and of this
                    number a considerable proportion do not breed in Europe, but only in the Barbary
                    States. The extra-Palaearctic character of the Egyptian ornis seems to be thus

                    any definite notion of its character; and we are only able to confirm the

                    mentioned, for without lists carefully drawn up by those who have a special
                    knowledge of the avifauna of a country, or the power to compile such for
                    oneself, which in this case the present writer does not possess, any attempt at
                    a critical examination of its details would be rather misleading than otherwise.
                    The province probably lies between lat. 18° and lat. 10° N., but whether it
                    preserves those limits in the interior, whether it passes directly into the
                    Abyssinian, or whether another province intervenes, are questions that cannot be

                    acquainted with African ornithology; and we must therefore, perforce, leave the
                    continental portion of this Subregion without trying to exhibit its particular
                    characteristics. Respecting the islands belonging to it, however, somewhat may
                    be advanced with more confidence. The chief of these are four in number—Fernando
                    Po, Prince’s Island, that of St Thomas, and Annobon, The first, lying in the
                    Bight of Biafra, was once believed to possess a very peculiar avifauna; but one
                    by one, all, or nearly all, of the supposed peculiar species have been found on
                    the mainland, until it seems likely to have none whatever. Prince’s Island,
                    situated outside the Bight, but still lying within the Gulf of Guinea, has been
                    said to possess 1 peculiar genus, <hi rend="italic">Cuphopterus</hi> (of perhaps
                    uncertain affinity, though it has been referred to the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Timeliidoe),</hi> comprising a single species, (but this has since been sent
                    from the Gaboon) and 6 other species—1 each of <hi rend="italic">Dicoeidoe</hi>
                    and <hi rend="italic">Hirundinidoe,</hi> and 2 of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Ploceidoe</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Columbid&lt;x</hi> respectively. A curious
                    assertion has been made with regard to this island, namely, that it is not
                    inhabited by any Diurnal Bird-of-prey, all such being, it is said, driven off by
                    the Grey Parrots <hi rend="italic">(Psittacus</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >erithacus)</hi> which there abound. The island of St Thomas, lying nearly or
                    just under the equator, also has 6 peculiar species, belonging respectively to
                    the <hi rend="italic">Turdidoe, Dicaeidoe, Oriolidoe, Ploceidoe,
                    Columbidoe,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Strigidoe;</hi> while another species of
                    the family last mentioned is common to this and Prince’s Island, but seems to be
                    found nowhere else. Of Annobon we know nothing.</p>
                <p>(3.) <hi rend="italic">The Caffrarian Subregion</hi> has its inland boundaries as
                    ill-defined as either of the preceding, yet its distinctive features are much
                    more marked—a fact which is doubtless to some extent explained by so great a
                    portion of it lying without the tropic. Though this part of Africa has perhaps
                    received the closest attention from ornithologists, the several labours in
                    various districts of the Subregion of Levaillant and Jules Verreaux, Audersson
                    and Andrew Smith, Mr Layard and Mr· Ayres, assisted at home by Sundevall and Mr
                    Gurney, all require digesting before their bearings upon the subject of
                    geographical distribution can be fully comprehended; and, as in the cases
                    previously mentioned, the careful collation and comparison of different lists
                    can only be usefully accomplished by one who has a special knowledge of the
                    objects treated of by those writers, and any attempt to attain this end by an
                    inexpert would be dangerous. Only one island can be with certainty affiliated to
                    this Subregion, and that is St Helena, where the indigenous Land-birds, if any
                    there were, have probably been extirpated with most of its original and peculiar
                    flora. Yet, curious as it may be, it seems to be a fact that this isolated spot
                    possesses a peculiar Water-bird, albeit it is of a group which greatly affects
                    dry places. This is a small Ringed Plover <hi rend="italic">(Aeguüitis
                    sanctoe-helenoe),</hi> and, though belonging to a genus the members of which are
                    remarkable for very wide distribution, it is not known to have occurred off the
                    island. Tristan da Cunha, commonly assigned to the Ethiopian Region, and
                    therefore to this Subregion, seems, from reasons before stated, to have at least
                    as much affinity to the Neotropical, and Ascension appears to have no indigenous
                    Land-birds whatever, so that its appropriation must remain in doubt.</p>
                <p>(4.) <hi rend="italic">The Mosambican Subregion</hi> next follows, and its
                    relations to the Abyssinian the numbers already quoted from Dr von Heuglin will
                    have shewn, but these must be taken with caution, since the limits of the
                    Subregion are so indefinite. Whether we should comprehend in it the whole of the
                    country drained by the Zambesi and its tributaries seems to be very uncertain;
                    but, judging from the collections he has received, Mr Sharpe is now inclined to
                    think that this part has more affinity to South Africa. The general uniformity
                    of distribution which obtains among the Birds of all the tropical portion of the
                    Region, especially noticed by Dr Kirk in writing on thosς,pf Zambesia <hi
                    rend="italic">(Ibis,</hi> 1864, p. 307), requires much fuller" geographical
                    details than are at present available to entitle us to form any very decided
                    opinion, though the in most respects ex cellent monograph of Drs Finsch and
                    Hartlaub (see note at page 758) gives ample information as to the literature and
                    descriptions of the 448 species which, according to those learned authors,
                    constitute its avifauna, and no attempt can possibly be made to subdivide the
                    Subregion into provinces. Lying off its coast are three considerable islands,
                    Pemba, Zanzibar, and Monfia, but as yet there is no reason <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit03newyrich/page/n777/mode/1up"

                    bearing from a zoogeographical point of view. Zanzibar is the best known, and
                    that seems to have a few species peculiar to it— for instance, <hi rend="italic"
                    >Laniarius</hi><hi rend="italic">salimoe,</hi><hi rend="italic">L.</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">orientalis,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Francolinus kirki,—</hi>
                    but further investigation may prove that some of them also occur on the
                    mainland.</p>
                <p>(5.) <hi rend="italic">The Afadagascarian Subregion</hi> remains for
                    consideration, and this from its insularity is obviously well defined, while a
                    good deal of attention has been paid to its remarkable peculiarities.' Indeed,
                    except New Zealand, it may be safely deemed the most peculiar Subregion on the
                    earth’s surface, while from ' <hi rend="subscript"> ι</hi> the richness and
                    multifariousness of its animal and especially of its ornithic population, New
                    Zealand cannot for a moment be compared with it. Its principal subdivision,
                    Madagascar itself, once possessed in the extinct gigantic bird <hi rend="italic"
                    >Aepyomis</hi> a form of <hi rend="italic">JRatitoe,</hi> not less singular than
                    the Ostrich or the Moa, and though some writers would fain see in the remains of
                    this marvellous creature a realization of Oriental fables respecting the Roc,
                    not a vestige has been recovered which can be declared to belong to any period
                    to which history or even legend can reach, and Arabian tales are not
                    corroborated by the hypothesis of Professor Bianconi, while they are virtually
                    contradicted by the researches at home of Μ. Alphonse Milne-JJdwards, and Herr
                    von Nathttsius, and of Μ. Grandidier abroad. Three also of the satellite
                    islands—Mauritius, Réunion (Bourbon), and Rodriguez—possessed brevipennate Birds
                    totally dissimilar from but hardly less singular than the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Aepyomis,</hi> and here the Dodo and its kindred, together with other Birds now
                    extirpated, flourished peacefully till they felt the power of man and his
                    agencies. But brief particulars of these extinct forms have already been given
                    (pp. 732, 733), and we must now restrict ourselves to the consideration of those
                    which survive.</p>
                <p>This Subregion is easily divided into two provinces— Madagascar and the Mascarene
                    Islands; but then it becomes a question whether the Comoros should not be
                    considered to form a third, and also how the Seychelles should be treated. Not
                    without scruples we propose to refer the latter to the Mascarene province as an
                    outlying group, and to regard the former in the same light in reference to the
                    Malagash province or Madagascar proper.</p>
                <p>Long studied as the Birds of Madagascar have been, hardly a year now passes
                    without some new form being added to its list; and what is especially remarkable
                    is that a very large proportion of the additions are not merely new species of
                    genera previously known, but are the types of undeniably good and new genera,
                    while it would seem also as if many of these had a very limited range in the
                    island, for every fresh district visited by a collector is almost sure to
                    produce something which neither he nor his predecessors have met with in other
                    parts, though the actual distance between the localities may be inconsiderable.
                    The number of genera of Land-birds amounts to nearly 100, and of them almost
                    one-half are peculiar to the Subregion; by far the greatest number of them
                    belonging to the Order <hi rend="italic">Passeres,</hi> though the <hi
                    rend="italic">Picarioe</hi> are also well represented by peculiar genera, and
                    the <hi rend="italic">Psittaci</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Columbae</hi> possess
                    to a certain extent the same characteristics. Many of the genera belonging to
                    the two Orders first named can be but with difficulty referred to any family
                    existing elsewhere, but for fear of exaggerating the singular character of the
                    Subregion we prefer regarding two only of these families as absolutely peculiar.
                    These are <hi rend="italic">Lepto-</hi><hi rend="italic">somidoe</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">Eurycerotidae,</hi> the single genus and species constituting each
                    of which it seems impossible to place with any other family. <hi
                    rend="subscript"> z</hi> Almost the same may be said of the genera <hi
                    rend="italic">Brachypter</hi><hi rend="italic">acias,</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Geobiastes,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Atelornis,</hi> which may perhaps be
                    linked in one group, though to what family it should be attached seems very
                    doubtful; and there is <hi rend="italic">Philepitta</hi> so isolated that by one
                    author it is referred to the <hi rend="italic">Turdidoe,</hi> by another to the
                    <hi rend="italic">Paradiseidoe,</hi> and by a third to the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Pittidoe,</hi> the probability being that each assignation is wide of the mark.
                    But the avifauna of Madagascar is not entirely composed of such singularities as
                    these. We have homely genera, even among the <hi rend="italic">Passeres,</hi>
                    occurring there, such as <hi rend="italic">Acrocephalus,</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Motacilla,</hi><hi rend="italic">Pratincola,</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >Alauda,</hi> while a <hi rend="italic">Cisticola,</hi> which, though it has
                    received a distinct trivial name, is undistinguishable from the well-known
                    Fantail-Warbler (C <hi rend="superscript"> r</hi>. <hi rend="italic"
                    >schoenicola)</hi> of southern Europe, Africa, and India, has long been known as
                    an inhabitant of Madagascar. But there are also species, though not Passerine,
                    which are absolutely identical with those of Britain— <hi rend="italic"
                    >Aluco</hi><hi rend="italic">flammeus, Coturnix</hi><hi rend="italic">communis,
                    Porzana</hi><hi rend="italic">pygmoea,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Podiceps
                    minor</hi> —all of them common in the island. The number of species of Birds
                    hitherto found in Madagascar cannot be safely put at less than 200, of which 120
                    are Land-birds, and of these latter fully 100 are peculiar. The Comoros, so far
                    as they have been explored, have yielded more than 20 Land-birds, of which 12 at
                    least are peculiar, the remainder being common to Madagascar; but, no doubt,
                    throughout every part of the Malagash province there is room for further
                    discoveries.</p>
                <p>The principal islands of the Mascarene province have had their original fauna so
                    largely destroyed by colonization, as has just been stated, that we are hardly
                    in a condition to judge its peculiarities accurately. Mauritius and Réunion,
                    lying within sight of each other, and possessing about the same number of
                    existing species, seem not to have more than 3 in common. There is 1 genus <hi
                    rend="italic">(Oxynotus)</hi> belonging to the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Campephagidoe</hi> which is peculiar to these two islands, and represented in
                    each by a distinct species. Réunion also had within the memory of men yet living
                    a peculiar genus of <hi rend="italic">Stumidoe</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >—Fregilupus.</hi> Rodriguez is now known to possess only <hi rend="italic"
                    >4</hi> species of Land-birds natural to it; and of these 3 are peculiar, 1
                    being the Parrakeet before mentioned as on the verge of extinction, and another
                    an aberrant form of <hi rend="italic">Drymoeca,</hi> pointing possibly to a
                    common origin with certain Indian species.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>Tlιis same leaning towards India is also indicated by the

                    and these four are peculiar respectively to Madagascar, Réunion, Mauritius, and
                    the Seychelles, and it would be easy to cite similar cases of isolated Birds of
                    either the Indian or Ethiopian Region which have their nearest relatives natives
                    of the other.</p></note> The Landbirds of the Seychelles which have not been
                    introduced are 14 in number, and of these 12, according to Mr Edward Newton <hi
                    rend="italic">(Ibis,</hi> 1867, p. ff59), are peculiar; but there is no good
                    genus which can be so termed. Finally, we may mention that the small island of
                    Aldabra has a Dove which has been described as a distinct species, and that of
                    St Denis a Water-hen which probably merits the same remark. Taken as a whole, we
                    cannot but be struck with the force of the evidence as to the land-connection
                    which must once have existed—though not necessarily all at once—between the
                    various units forming the whole Subregion. Even the scanty remnant that is left
                    enables one to see how the denizens of its most distant quarters represent one
                    another, a clear token of their long-continued isolation and the working of a
                    differentiating power. But this is no place to pursue theories.</p>

                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>It must be mentioned that objection has
                    frequently, and not without show of reason, been taken to the name “Indian”

                    admit that “Indo-Malayan” would have most likely been found a more expressive

                    defined, have been already sketched out when treating of the adjoining areas.
                    Large as is its extent, and greatly varied as are its physical features, it
                    would seem to have but 2 peculiar families of Birds <hi rend="italic"

                    of 70 which occur within its limits. There is peculiar difficulty in determining
                    the zoological Subregions and provinces into which this Region should be
                    separated. While the fauna of some districts, or even larger portions, has been
                    studied so that we possess a knowledge of them almost as full as of any country
                    in the world, Europe and the tracts of other Regions settled by Europeans alone
                    excepted, the greater part is not much better known zoologically than is the
                    centre of Africa. Yet we cannot treat the Indian Region with the same audacity
                    of ignorance that we did the Ethiopian, drawing our boundaries here and there in
                    a manner which the experience of a few more years will very likely prove to be
                    exceedingly wide of the mark, for our acquaintance with the Region now under
                    consideration is such as to convince us that throughout its whole extent there
                    are districts, large or small, which have an unmistakable affinity to one
                    another, and yet appear to be cut off from all communication with their
                    neighbours. True it is that we may readily account for this on the ground that
                    the similarity to be observed is due to corresponding elevation above the
                    sea-level, and that throughout the whole Region the hill-countries are, as a
                    rule, disconnected; but such an explanation does not make our task the easier,
                    and we are filled with the consciousness that we cannot map out the Indian
                    Region according to the method we have hitherto followed. We find the
                    characteristics of the Himalayan avifauna shewing themselves not only on the
                    highlands of Southern India and Ceylon, but far away to the eastward also, as in
                    Formosa, Hainan, and Cochin China, and again repeated in a lesser but still
                    perceptible degree to the southward in the mountain ranges of Malacca and
                    Sumatra. This then being the case, we think it better to follow in the main the
                    scheme adopted by Mr Elwes, to whose essay on the geographical distribution of
                    Asiatic Birds we have before referred (page 754). Right or wrong in his results,
                    he has the merit of having arrived at them, as he tells us, contrary to a
                    certain bias which he had entertained at the beginning of his investigations,
                    and these are marked by uncommon care and a diligent study of all the means of
                    information at that time available to him. Mr Elwes would establish three
                    Subregions— the “Himalayan” “or Himalo-Chinese,” the “Indian” (proper), and the
                    “Malayan.”</p>
                <p>(1.) <hi rend="italic">The Himalo-Chinese Subregion,</hi> according to his view,
                    includes all the middle slopes of the Himalayan range, from an elevation of
                    about 3000 to 12,000 feet, and, beginning with Cashmere, extends through Nepal,
                    Bhotan, the highlands of Assam, and thence, marching with the as yet
                    undetermined frontier of the Palaearctic Region, to the sea-coast of China. To
                    this Subregion belong the islands of Formosa and Hainan, and it not only
                    includes a great part of China proper, but probably the whole of Cochin China
                    and Siam, with the hill-country of Tennasserim and Burmah, merging into the
                    Malayan Subregion somewhere about lat. 12° N. In its western part, he observes,
                    it is merely a narrow border-land, in which the members of two very different
                    faunas meet, and, being inhabited during some part of the year by nearly all the
                    principal Palaearctic genera, and those of the proper Indian Subregion, probably
                    includes some of the richest portions of the world. Besides this, as already
                    remarked, its influence is felt far to the southward, even in the islands of
                    Ceylon and Sumatra.</p>
                <p>From what has been said above as to the way in which some of the Subregions of
                    the Indian Region are broken up, and this Subregion especially, it is useless to
                    attempt any partitioning of them into true zoological provinces. We can only
                    follow Mr Elwes in taking the various countries in succession, and stating what
                    is known of them. Cashmere is the first. Here there seems to be 171 Landbirds,
                    referable to 116 genera; of the latter, 34 have a wide range, 32 are
                    characteristic of the Palaearctic Region, 29 of the Indian, and 21 peβuliar to
                    or characteristic of the Himalo-Chinese Subregion. There is only 1 species
                    peculiar to the country—a very normal Bullfinch <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Pyrrhula)</hi> belonging to <hi rend="italic">Fringillidoe.</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Cephalopyrus,</hi> an aberrant Titmouse <hi rend="italic"
                    >(ParidcE),</hi> and once thought to be a peculiar genus, extends eastward so
                    far as Simla. Of the species 70 seem to be peculiar to the Himalayan district,
                    and 30 are common to the Palaearctic Region.</p>
                <p>Nepal is the next country of which we know enough to give any satisfactory
                    account; and, indeed, thanks to Mr Hodgson’s labours in years gone by, our
                    knowledge of its zoology is very tolerably complete, though of late years little
                    has been added to it. Its rich avifauna is said to consist of 553 species of
                    Land-birds, belonging to 294 genera; of the latter, 62 are of wide range, 30
                    characteristic of the Palaearctic, and 122 of the Indian Region, while 80 are
                    peculiar to, or characteristic of, the Himalaya. Of the species there are 330
                    peculiar to the Himalayan district, and 60 common to the Palaearctic Region.</p>
                <p>The small state of Sikkim seems to be richer stilL Excluding the <hi
                    rend="italic">Accipitres</hi> there are here found 423 species of Land-birds, of
                    which 270 do not occur out of the Himalaya, except as migrants or stragglers. Of
                    these, 63 belong to genera of wide range, 60 more are of Palaearctic
                    distribution, and 154 are nearly peculiar to the Indian Region, while 146 are
                    peculiar to, or characteristic of, the Himalo-Chinese Subregion. Passing to
                    Assam, the hills to the north and east of which, however, are very little known,
                    its ornithic character seems greatly to resemble that of Sikkim; but we have
                    from its southern boundary a few genera which are not actually found in the
                    Himalaya, such as <hi rend="italic">Anthreptes, Turdinus,</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">Ehytoceros,</hi> belonging respectively to <hi rend="italic"
                    >Nectar-</hi><hi rend="italic">iniidoe, Timeliidoe,</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >Bucerotidoe,</hi> while we are acquainted with only 16 species which are not
                    found also in Sikkim, and of these one-half are Burmese.</p>
                <p>Burmah must be taken next, though a district intervenes of which we are quite
                    ignorant, and this country, its highlands especially, requires much more
                    exploration, but the valley of the Irrawadi, Aracan, and Pegu are very fairly
                    known. Of 373 species of Land-birds, 97 are common to India, and the rest to the
                    Malay peninsula. 193 more are found in India, and 27 in the peninsula alone,
                    while 46 are peculiar to Burmah or to Burmah and Tennasserim. In Tennasserim,
                    taking it to extend from Martaban to the isthmus of Krau, we have 313 species of
                    Land-birds, 93 being common to India and the rest of the peninsula, 117 more
                    being found in India, and 56 in the peninsula alone, while 47 are peculiar to
                    Tennasserim or to Tennasserim and Burmah. This country is especially rich in
                    species of the peculiarly Indian family <hi rend="italic">Euryloemidae,</hi>
                    possessing a majority of the known forms.</p>
                <p>Lying in the Bay of Bengal are two remarkable groups of islands—the Andamans and
                    the Nicobars—which the authority we are following would, from the similarity of
                    their avifauna to that of Pegu, include in this Subregion. Lord Walden, however,
                    thinks <hi rend="italic">(Ibis,</hi> 1873, p. 297) the former have a greater
                    affinity to the highlands of India south of the Himalaya and west of the
                    Brahmapootra, and Mr Hume <hi rend="italic">(Stray Feathers,</hi> ii. p. 136)
                    considers both groups to form an outlying bit of the proper Indian Subregion on
                    which many foreign intruders have established <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit03newyrich/page/n779/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0903-0779-0762"/> themselves. It is certain that many genera, or
                    even families, which are common in Burmah are wanting in the Andamans, such as
                    the <hi rend="italic">Timeliidoe, Pittidoe, Eurylaemidoe,</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">Bucerotidoe,</hi> though a peculiar form of the last occurs on
                    Narcondam, an island between the Andamans and Burmah, and there is an extreme
                    paucity of several other families. Still the Andamans possess an avifauna of
                    some 155 species, 17 of which (all Land-birds) are peculiar. The precise number
                    of species found in the Nicobars is not explicitly stated by Mr Hume, but he
                    gives 10 as peculiar to that group, which is inhabited by two very noteworthy
                    forms— <hi rend="italic">Caloenas,</hi> a very remarkable genus of <hi
                    rend="italic">Columbidoe,</hi> widely spread throughout the Malayan archipelago,
                    and a species of <hi rend="italic">Megapodius,</hi> belonging to one of the most
                    characteristic families of the Australian Region. The presence of these two
                    forms would almost incline one to remove the Nicobars from the Subregion to
                    which they have generally been assigned, and refer them rather to the Malayan
                    Subregion.</p>
                <p>It is now necessary to retrace our steps northward and notice China;<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Of China proper Mr Elwes says
                    little, but he includes Eastern Thibet in this Subregion. The present writer,
                    however, is disposed to refer that, or at any rate the scene of Père David’s
                    discoveries, to the Palaearctic Region.</p></note> but this is a branch of the
                    subject on which it is as yet impossible to form an opinion. The chief authority
                    on Chinese ornithology is unquestionably Mr Swinhoe, who has for so long a time
                    laboured in various parts of that country equally as a public servant and a
                    naturalist; but the results of his multitudinous contributions to our knowledge
                    of its avifauna have never yet been tabulated, and probably their author is
                    alone competent to perform this task -without running into errors that would be
                    disastrous in their consequences. In his latest catalogue of the Birds of
                    China,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi rend="italic"
                    >Proc. Zool. Soc.</hi> 1871, pp. 337-343.</p></note> he enumerates 675 species
                    as found in that country and its islands; but valuable and carefully-drawn up as
                    this list is, it is impossible to eliminate therefrom the species not strictly
                    belonging to that part of the Celestial Empire which lies within our present
                    bounds; or even were this possible, an intimate acquaintance with its ornis
                    would be required to separate the birds-of-passage from the residents, and still
                    more to classify them according to their several Orders and families. Add to
                    this, that assiduously as Mr Swinhoe has himself worked in the field, and
                    diligently as he has availed himself of such information as he could obtain from
                    other trustworthy observers, only the outskirts of this great territory have,
                    with few exceptions, been examined. Much is it to be hoped that he will be able
                    in due time to bring forth the ripe fruit of his labours, but meanwhile the
                    attempt to elucidate the peculiarities of the avifauna of China proper, that is,
                    south at least of the Yangstzekiang and of Cochin China, would be vain if not
                    misleading.</p>
                <p>The two principal islands lying off the Chinese coast, however, are in a
                    different condition. One of them has been extremely and the other tolerably well
                    ransacked by Mr Swinhoe. In Formosa he has found 144 species, referable to 102
                    genera, of which 98 are found in the Himalayan Subregion, and 70 in the Malayan.
                    The species may be thus assorted :—74 belong to wide-ranging genera, 47 to
                    genera common to the Himalayan and Malayan Subregions, 18 are peculiar to, or
                    characteristic of, the former Subregion, and 5 to China itself; 18 are not found
                    in the Malayan Subregion, and no less than 34 are peculiar to the island. For
                    Hainan Mr Swinhoe has enumerated 130 species belonging to 96 genera, of which
                    latter 86 are common to the Malayan Subregion, and 93 to the Himalayan. Of the
                    species 54 belong to wide-ranging genera, 59 to genera characteristic of the
                    Indian and 16 of the Palaearctic Region, while 16 are believed to be peculiar to
                    the island.</p>
                <p>(2.) <hi rend="italic">The Indian Subregion,</hi> still following Mr Elwes, is
                    the next to be considered. This consists of the remainder of the peninsula of
                    India lying to the south and west of the last, as well as of the island of
                    Ceylon. Its partition into provinces has been several times attempted, and
                    doubtless the method proposed by Mr Blanford, when treating of the geographical
                    distribution of Indian Reptiles,<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p><hi rend="italic">Journal of the Asiatic Society of

                    doing more than consider, so far as materials are available, the avifauna of the
                    various districts of which it is composed— the more so since the extraordinary
                    impulse given to the study of ornithology in India by the publication of the
                    late Dr Jerdon’s work<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"
                    ><p><hi rend="italic">The Birds of India.</hi> Calcutta: 1S62-64.</p></note>
                    will doubtless in a few years place the whole subject in a very different light,
                    for the number of Indian ornithologists is grown so considerable that that
                    country has now a journal especially devoted to the record of their
                    observations.</p>
                <p>Beginning in the north-west with the Punjab, we have as yet no complete list of
                    the Birds of this most important district, and we can only infer that we shall
                    here find the Malayan influence at its least, and the Palaearctic at its
                    greatest; but descending the Indus to Sindh we have a discursive account of its
                    ornithology by Mr Hume,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"
                    ><p><hi rend="italic">Stray Feathers,</hi> i. pp. 44-49, 91-239,
                    419-421.</p></note> from which Mr Elwes gives the following results :—of 150
                    species observed, 41 are peculiarly desert-forms, and as such either very nearly
                    allied to or identical with the like forms of the Palaearctic and Ethiopian
                    Regions; 40 are peculiar to the Indian Subregion, 8 are common to the Malayan, 4
                    to the non-desert portions of the Ethiopian, and 12 to the similar parts of the
                    Palaearctic Region, while 45 do not come under any of these heads. Omitting the
                    desert-forms as not leading to any just conclusion, it would appear that Sindh
                    has less affinity to the Ethiopian Region than to the Palaearctic, that is to
                    say, to its Mediterranean Subregion. The very remarkable district of Cutch
                    yielded 115 Land-birds to Stoliczka,<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p><hi rend="italic">Journal of the Asiatic Society of

                    common Indian species of wide range.</p>
                <p>Of Rajpootana and Central India we know very little, but near Goona, about 200
                    miles to the south of Agra, Dr King some years since observed 116 species of
                    Landbirds;<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi

                    Adam has noticed 171 species of Land-birds around the Sambhur Lake in its

                <p>We must next turn eastward to Oudh, wherein Col. Irby <hi rend="italic"
                    >{Ibis,</hi> 1861, p. 217) obtained 108 species of Land-birds, but of these 23
                    were found only on the hills of Kumaon. There seems to be a remarkable absence
                    of many of the most widely-spread genera of the Region, and many forms generally
                    common to Africa are also wanting; but no doubt Mr Brooks, who has of late

                <p>The avifauna of Southern India seems to be small relatively to the extent and
                    variety of the country, and most of its peculiar species are said to have a
                    considerable range of latitude, though some, which are restricted to the highest
                    hills, are only found to the southward of lat. 12° N., where several
                    mountain-ranges reach the height of 8000 feet. No single comprehensive listof
                    the Birds of this part of India seems lately to have been put together, and Mr
                    Elwes gives us no statistics as the result of his investigations whereby we may
                    compare its ornithic products with those of other districts.</p>
                <p>Ceylon has profited by the residence of several competent naturalists—especially
                    Mr Layard and Mr Holdsworth, and taking also its isolation into account, we are
                    in a position to speak of this island with greater certainty than of the
                    preceding portions of the Subregion. The latter of these gentlemen gives a

                    are Land-birds, and an analysis shews that, though 37 species are peculiar, only
                    4 belong to genera not found in Southern India, 22 belong to genera inhabiting
                    the Himalaya but not the Malayan Subregion, and only 6 to Malayan but not
                    Himalayan genera, while 14 are members of genera only found in India.</p>

                    treat, and we have already hinted that it possibly has a connection with the
                    Indian through the Nicobar Islands, but of course the most intimate
                    communication between the two exists on the mainland. The birds of its
                    continental portion, the Malay Peninsula, have never formed the subject of a
                    separate memoir, and to compile a complete list of them at present is a task
                    which a more competent author has found impossible. Stoliczka has given us a

                    constantly described by various authors as coming from Malacca or Singapore,
                    which in most cases probably means that the specimens have been purchased at one
                    of those places. To enter into any details with respect to the Malay Peninsula,
                    therefore, would here be impossible, but the case is different as regards the
                    islands which form the greater part of the Subregion.</p>
                <p>The Philippines, for more than a century, have supplied European ornithologists
                    with materials of study, yet it is little more than ten years ago that any

                    ably set forth. He enumerates 219 species, of which 150 are Land-birds; but in
                    consequence of the caution he has exercised, it is most probable that this
                    number is really too small. Of these, 106 species are peculiar to the
                    archipelago—96 of them being Land-birds. There is no species, he remarks, which
                    is common to the Philippines and the neighbouring island of Celebes which does
                    not also possess a more extended range, and there is only one genus— <hi

                    >Amaurornis</hi> to <hi rend="italic">Rallidoe.</hi> There is also only 1
                    species common to one of the Philippines—the island of Negros—and to one other
                    island. This is <hi rend="italic">Xantholoema</hi><hi rend="italic">rosea,</hi>
                    which is also found in Java, and seems to be the representative of the
                    widely-spread <hi rend="italic">X.</hi><hi rend="italic">hoematocephala,</hi>
                    which ranges over India, Malacca, and Sumatra, but is not found either in Java
                    or Negros. It will thus be seen that the amount of peculiarity exhibited by the
                    avifauna of the Philippines is very great, but it must be observed that hardly
                    anything is as yet known of Palawan or the Sooloo cluster—islands which connect
                    the Philippines with Borneo.</p>
                <p>Borneo is the next island to which our attention should be directed, and this
                    magnificent country, large enough as Mr Wallace has remarked for the whole of
                    the United Kingdom to be set down in its midst and hidden, has lately had its
                    avifauna carefully investigated by Dr Salvador!, the result of whose labours was

                    representatives elsewhere. Of Land-birds Borneo has, in common with Malacca and
                    Sumatra, 226 species; in common with Java, 149; with the Philippines, 25; with
                    the Indian Subregion, 53; with China, 72; and with Celebes, 28. A species of <hi

                    produces 2 peculiar species of <hi rend="italic">Pittidae,</hi> the one

                    and Siam, the other allied to two species, the first ranging from Nepal to
                    Malacca, and the second inhabiting the Philippines, Borneo, and Sumatra.<note

                <p>Sumatra must be considered next, or perhaps it ought to have been taken after
                    Malacca, from which it is divided by so narrow a channel. The greater part of
                    this island, its northern half especially, is unknown, and not more than 240
                    species can be assigned to it, of which about 20 appear to be peculiar. Its
                    avifauna is much allied to that <pb break="no"

                    have much less peculiarity than the latter’s.</p>
                <p>We then have Java, the best-explored, the most thickly-peopled, and,
                    proportionately to its fauna, the most peculiar, perhaps, of the Indo-Malay
                    Islands. Here we find about 270 species of Land-birds, of which about 45 are
                    peculiar—most of them being from the mountains in the western part of the
                    island. The reappearance in Java of several Burmese species, as <hi

                    rend="italic">Pavo</hi><hi rend="italic">muticus,</hi> and others, which do not
                    occur in the Malay Peninsula south of Penang, is very remarkable.</p>
                <p>Of Bali, so interesting as the southern outpost of the Region, we only know from
                    Mr Wallace that he saw there several Birds highly characteristic of Javan
                    ornithology, and whether the island has any peculiar species nowhere appears. We
                    are then brought to the brink of that remarkable strait through which runs
                    “Wallace’s Line,” and crossing it find ourselves at once in the Australian
                    Region, with which we began this protracted dissertation.</p>
                <p>It is, of course, much to be regretted that at present our information does not
                    allow of our treating all the Six Zoological Regions of the globe on a uniform
                    plan, or of dealing equally with their several component portions. That this
                    will be possible in a few years, as materials are accumulated, none can doubt;
                    but as yet we are far from the attainment of so desirable an end, and must be
                    content to make the most of what we have. Want of space, also, has hindered the
                    proper consideration here of many points that fully deserve notice, and
                    especially the negative characteristics of the different Regions—often quite as
                    important as those which are positive. Of the imperfections of the preceding
                    sketch no one can be more painfully aware than its author, but its very
                    imperfections may serve a useful purpose in drawing attention to the districts
                    about which least is known. Yet it would be affectation for him not to believe
                    that it has some actual merit, but that merit is greatly if not chiefly due to
                    the kindness of Mr Wallace, who, in the manner already stated, has allowed his
                    forthcoming work to be laid under contribution, though in several respects its
                    conclusions are not here adopted. That work, when published, will unquestionably
                    form a foundation on which a noble superstructure will ultimately be erected,
                    but it were vain to anticipate the ends which such a building will one day
                    serve, and it would be beyond our scope to enter into any theoretical
                    disquisition on the deductions which follow from the facts here advanced.</p>
                <p>MIGRATION.</p>
                <p>Most strangely and unaccountably confounded by many writers with the subject of
                    Distribution is that of Migration. True it is that owing to the vast powers of
                    locomotion possessed by nearly all Birds, we have individuals belonging in the
                    main to certain groups, but by no means always confined to them, straying from
                    their proper quarters and occurring in places far removed, not only from the
                    land of their birth, but from the country whither they are ordinarily bound in
                    their journeys, to reach which is the object wherefore such journeys are
                    undertaken. It may be that in some measure this erraticism is governed by fixed
                    laws, and indeed indication is not wanting that such laws exist, though as yet
                    we know much too Httle to lay them down with any approach to confidence. But it
                    is obvious on reflection that granting the existence of most rigorous laws of
                    this kind—determining the flight of every winged vagabond—they must be very
                    different from those which are obeyed by Birds commonly called “Migratory,” and
                    migrating year after year according to a more or less fixed rule from one
                    locality to another with the seasons as they roll. The former laws would seem to
                    be created or controlled by purely external circumstances, which if they possess
                    any periodicity at all possess a periodicity of cycles, and are most likely
                    dependent in the main on cycles of the weather, but on this point observation
                    has not yet supplied us with the means of avoiding speculation. We may indeed
                    say almost without much risk of error that so many individuals of a foreign
                    species—whether North-American or Asiatic—will occur in Great Britain so many
                    times in the course of a term of years; but, though we may safely predict that
                    if they appear at all they will do so at a certain season, it is impossible to
                    make a forecast as to the year in which an example will turn up, or whether in
                    one year some half-dozen may or may not occur. The matter thus becomes a matter
                    of averages, and like all such is open to the influence of many perturbants, not
                    that such may not well be subject to some law of which we are ignorant. Besides
                    this, the average is hard to strike, depending as it must on the existence of
                    favourably-placed and watchful observers. Moreover if we consider that the
                    number of competent observers, though possibly greater in England than anywhere
                    else in the world, has been at all times small, it is not surprising that little
                    has been effected towards the compassing of any definite notion on this head. At
                    present we can but attribute the appearance of foreign stragglers on our shores,
                    and no doubt the same may be said of other countries, to the influence of storms
                    which have driven the wanderers from their course, and though other more remote
                    causes may possibly be assigned, there seems to be none but this on which we can
                    safely rely. Consequently until the periodicity of storms is brought within our
                    knowledge we must be content to abide in our ignorance of the laws which govern
                    the appearance of the strangers. Still confining our remarks to the British
                    Islands, the effect of these laws is in some degree constant. Singular as it may
                    appear, the greatest number of North-American Birds—and especially of the <hi
                    rend="italic">Limicoloe.</hi> or Shorebirds, which are recorded as having
                    occurred in this country have been met with in the eastern part of England or
                    Scotland. There are two ways of accounting for this fact, the first of which is
                    the unfortunate scarcity of observing naturalists in Ireland and on its western
                    coast especially, and this is by no means to be overlooked; but it may be
                    remarked that in no part of the United Kingdom is the profession of the gunner
                    more enthusiastically followed than in the sister island, and the men who pursue
                    that vocation are all alive to the mercantile value of any strange bird which
                    may fall in their way. Of course they have no means of knowing what it is, yet
                    as their spoils are sent for sale to the nearest market, it cannot but happen
                    that if many examples of North-American species were procured by them, some
                    proportion of these would find their way to the notice of the amateur naturalist
                    and by him be recorded in the public prints.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>It seems also not unlikely that the very scarcity of rare
                    birds in Ireland is one reason why there are so few ornithologists in that
                    country, for here it is not uncommon for a man to have his attention first
                    called to zoology by meeting with some strange animal—be it beast, bird, beetle,
                    or butterfly, and for such a man afterwards to become no mean
                    field-naturalist.</p></note> Now, as compared with Great Britain, this so rarely
                    occurs in Ireland that it is by no means unfair to draw the inference that
                    Transatlantic Birds are there far less frequently met with. The second mode of
                    accounting for the fact above stated is that the majority of North-American
                    Birds which occasionally visit Europe are of species which breed in somewhat
                    high northern latitudes. On their way thence to their winterquarters, some are
                    driven out to sea by violent westerly gales—the strongest winds, be it
                    remembered, that prevail <pb break="no"

                    be said to be practically absent, and fowlers as a rule unknown. Such
                    storm-beaten wanderers there consort with the allied species to be found at that
                    season in abundance on its shores and in their company pursue the same southerly
                    course. With them they cross to the east of Great Britain, and once arrived here
                    are speedily picked out and secured by the practised gunner. But should they
                    even escape his notice, they with their comrades follow the shore-line, where
                    they obtain the best supply of food, until passing round the south coast they
                    find themselves at the western extremity of England—the district of the Land’s
                    End, in which, next to Norfolk and Suffolk, the greatest number of these
                    Transatlantic stragglers have been obtained. This suggestion may serve to shew
                    what most likely goes on in other parts of the world, though the materials for
                    establishing its general truth are not forthcoming.</p>
                <p>I But returning to the subject of Migration proper, distinguished as it ought to
                    be from that of the more or less accidental occurrence of stray visitors from
                    afar, we have here more than enough to excite our wonder, and indeed are brought
                    face to face with perhaps the greatest mystery which the whole animal kingdom
                    presents—a mystery which attracted the attention of the earliest writers, and
                    can in its chief point be no more explained by the modern man of science than by
                    the simple-minded savage or the poet or prophet of antiquity. Some facts are
                    almost universally known and have been the theme of comment in all ages and in
                    all lands. The Hawk that stretches her wings toward the south is as familiar to
                    the latest Nile-boat traveller or dweller on the Bosphorus as of old to the
                    author of the book of Job. The autumnal thronging of myriads of Waterfowl by the
                    rivers of Asia is witnessed by the modern sportsman as it was of old by Homer.
                    Anacreon welcomed the returning Swallow, in numbers which his imitators of the
                    colder north, to whom the associations connected with it are doubly strong, have
                    tried in vain to excel. The Indian of the Fur-Countries in forming his rude
                    calendar names the recurring moons after the Birds-of-passage whose arrival is
                    coincident with their changes. But there is no need to multiply instances. The
                    flow and ebb of the mighty feathered wave has been sung by poets and reasoned of
                    by philosophers, has given rise to proverbs and entered into popular
                    superstitions, and yet we must say of it still that our “ignorance is
                    immense.’’</p>
                <p>On one point and one only in connection with this subject can we boast ourselves
                    to be clearly wiser than our ancestors. Some of them fully believed that the
                    seasonal disappearance of the Swallow, the Nightingale, the Cuckow, and the
                    Corncrake was due to hibernation, while others indeed doubted whether or not
                    this was the true explanation of the fact. It is not so long since this belief
                    and these doubts were in vogue, but now assuredly they have no hold upon the
                    mind of any one capable of appreciating evidence, and this absurd fancy being
                    exploded need not again trouble us.</p>
                <p>In considering the phaenomena of Migration it will be best first to take the
                    facts, and then try to account for their cause or causes. That a very large
                    number of Birds all over the world change their abode according to the season is
                    well known, and we find that in almost all countries there are some species
                    which arrive in spring, remain to breed, and depart in autumn; others which
                    arrive in autumn, stop for the winter, and depart in spring; and others
                    again—and these are strictly speaking the “Birds of Passage ”—which shew
                    themselves but twice a year, passing through the country without staying long in
                    it, and their transient visits take place about spring and autumn. People who
                    have given but little thought to the subject are apt to suppose that these
                    migrants, which may thus easily be classed in three categories, are acted upon
                    by influences of different kinds, whereas very little reflection will show that
                    all are really affected by the same impulse, whatever that may be, and that the
                    at first sight dissimilar nature of their movements is in truth almost uniform.
                    The species which resort to this and to other temperate countries in winter are
                    simply those which have their breeding-quarters much nearer the poles, and in
                    returning to them on the approach of spring are but doing exactly aβ do those
                    species which, having their winter-abode nearer the equator, come to us with the
                    spring. The Birds-of-passage proper, like our winter-visitants have their
                    breeding-quarters nearer the poles, but, like our summer-visitants, they seek
                    their winter-abode nearer the equator, and thus perform a somewhat longer
                    migration. So far there is no difficulty and no hypothesis—the bringing together
                    of these three apparently different categories is the result of simple
                    observation.</p>
                <p>This however is not the only fact which is evident on the most cursory
                    examination. To take the birds of the British Islands as an example (though
                    exactly similar cases are presented in other countries) we find that while there
                    are some species, such as the Swallow or the Fieldfare, of which every
                    individual disappears at one period of the year or another, there are other
                    species, such as the Pied Wagtail or the Woodcock, of which only the majority of
                    individuals vanish—a few being always present<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Whether these few be not migrants from
                    another district is a point that would require further consideration.</p></note>
                    —and these species form the so-called “Partial Migrants.” If we extend our view
                    and look to birds on the continent of Europe, we find that many species are
                    there notoriously migrant which are not generally suspected to be so in this
                    country—such as the Song-Thrush and the Redbreast, both of which species closer
                    observation has proved to be with us subject to the migratory impulse. In
                    respect of the former it is known that towards the end of summer or in autumn
                    our native Song-Thrushes receive a considerable accession in numbers from the
                    birds which arrive from the north, though the immigration is by no means so well
                    marked as it is in Belgium, France, or Germany, where the arrival of the
                    strangers sets all the fowlers to work, and the beginning of the <hi
                    rend="italic">Chasse</hi><hi rend="italic">aux Grives</hi> or <hi rend="italic"
                    >Drosselzug</hi> is regarded in many places nearly as the Twelfth of August or
                    the First of September is with us. In most localities in Britain the new comers
                    depart after a short sojourn, and are accompanied by so many of the home-bred
                    birds that in some parts of the island it may be safely declared that not a
                    single Song-Thrush can be found from the end of November to the end of January,
                    w hile in others examples can always be seen. Much the same may be said of the
                    Redbreast. Undeniably resident as a species, attentive scrutiny will reveal the
                    fact that its numbers are subject to very considerable variation according to
                    the season of the year. At no time do our Redbreasts collect in bands, but
                    towards the end of summer they may be seen in the south of England successively
                    passing onward, the travellers being mostly if not wholly young birds of the
                    year; and so the great majority disappear, departing it may be safely presumed
                    for more southern countries, since a few weeks later the markets of most towns
                    first in France and then in Italy are well supplied with this species. But the
                    migratory influence affects, though in a less degree, many if not most of the
                    Redbreasts that remain with us. Content during the autumn to occupy their usual
                    haunts, <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit03newyrich/page/n783/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0903-0783-0766"/> the first sharp frost has a decided effect upon
                    their distribution, and a heavy fall of snow drives them towards the homesteads
                    for the larger supply of food they find there, while should severe and
                    long-continued hard weather follow even these birds vanish, leaving only the few
                    which have become almost domesticated.</p>
                <p>These two species have been here chosen as illustrative cases because they are at
                    once plentiful and familiar, and want of space only forbids us from citing
                    others, but we shall find on inquiry that there is scarcely a Bird of either the
                    Palaearctic or Nearctic Region, whose habits are at all well known, of which
                    much the same may not be said, and hence we are led to the conclusion that every
                    Bird of the northern hemisphere is to a greater or less degree migratory in some
                    part or other of its range. Such a conclusion brings us to a still more general
                    inference—namely that Migration, instead of being the exceptional characteristic
                    it uβed formerly to be thought, may really be almost universal, and though the
                    lack of observations in other, and especially tropical, countries does not allow
                    us to declare that such is the case, it seems very probable to be so. Before
                    proceeding however to any further conclusions it is necessary to examine another
                    class of facts which may possibly throw some light on the matter.</p>
                <p>It must be within the experience of every one who has ever been a birds’-nesting
                    boy that the most sedentary of Birds year after year occupy the same quarters in
                    the breeding season.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Two
                    remarkable instances of this persistency may be noticed. The nest of a Falcon
                    (<hi rend="italic">Falco</hi><hi rend="italic">peregrinus)</hi> on Avasaxa—à
                    hill in Finland somewhat celebrated as one of the most southern points whence
                    the midnight sun may be seen—is mentioned by the French astronomer Maupertuis as
                    having been observed by him in the year 1736. In 1799 it was rediscovered by
                    Skjöldebrand and Acerbi. In 1833 Wolley found it tenanted, and from enquiries he
                    made of the neighbours it was evident that such had yearly been the case so far
                    as any one could remember, and so it was in 1855 as the writer can testify. In
                    1779 according to one account, in 1785 according to another, a pair of the Blue
                    Titmouse <hi rend="italic">(Parus caeruleus)</hi> built their nest in a large
                    earthenware bottle placed in the branches of a tree in a garden at Oxbridge near
                    Stockton-on-Tees. With two exceptions only, this bottle, or a second which has
                    lately been placed close to it, has been tenanted by a pair of birds of this
                    species from the year in which it was first occupied until 1873, when the writer
                    saw it.—See YarrelΓs <hi rend="italic">British Birds,</hi> 4th ed. i. pp. 58,
                    486.</p></note> In some instances this may be ascribed, it is true, to the old
                    haunt affording the sole or the most convenient site for the nest in the
                    neighbourhood, but in so many instances such is not the case that we are led to
                    believe in the existence of a real partiality, while there are quite enough
                    exceptions to show that a choice is frequently exercised. The same may equally
                    be said of the most migrant of Birds, and perhaps the strongest instance that
                    has ever come to the knowledge of the writer refers to one of the latter. A pair
                    of Stone-Curlews <hi rend="italic">(Oedicnemus</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >crepitans)—</hi> a very migratory species, affecting almost exclusively the
                    most open country—were in the habit of breeding for many years on the same spot
                    though its character had undergone a complete change. It had been part of an
                    extensive and barren rabbit-warren, and was become the centre of a large and
                    flourishing plantation.</p>
                <p>With these two sets of facts before us we may begin to try and account for the
                    cause or causes of Migration. Iu some cases want of food would seem to be
                    enough, as it is undoubtedly the most obvious cause that presents itself to our
                    mind.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Far more so than
                    variation of the temperature, though in popular belief that probably holds the
                    first place. But Birds generally, as compared with other Vertebrates, are but
                    slightly affected by extremes of heat or cold, and indeed (so far as we can
                    judge) by most climatic influences, provided only their supply of food is not
                    affected thereby. <hi rend="italic">—‘Cf.</hi> Max Schmidt, <hi rend="italic"

                    have of finding for themselves proper and sufficient sustenance is all-powerful,
                    and the difficulties they have to encounter in obtaining it are so great that
                    none can wonder that those which possess the power of removing themselves from a
                    place of scarcity should avail themselves of it, while it is unquestionable that

                    species which we commonly speak of as sedentary, it is only the adults which
                    maintain their ground throughout the year. It has long been known that
                    Birds-of-prey customarily drive away their offspring from their own haunts so
                    soon as the young are able to shift for themselves. The reason generally, and no
                    doubt truly, given for this behaviour, which at first sight appears so
                    unnatural, is the impossibility of both parents and progeny getting a livelihood
                    in the same vicinity. The practice, however, is not limited to the Birds-of-prey
                    alone, but is much more universal. We find it to obtain with the Redbreast, and
                    if we watch our feathered neighbours closely we shall perceive that most of them
                    indulge in it. The period of expulsion, it is true, is in some Birds deferred
                    from the end of summer or the autumn, in which it is usually performed, until
                    the following spring, when indeed from the maturity of the young it must be
                    regarded as much in the light of a voluntary secession on their part as in that
                    of an act of parental compulsion, but the effect is ultimately the same. These
                    cases, however, which make certainly the exception rather than the rule, we can
                    account for in another manner. It is to be observed that they are confined to
                    species having a peculiar mode of life, the individuals associating in
                    family-parties to form small bands. The members of the Titmouse-family <hi
                    rend="italic">(Paridae)</hi> offer a good instance of this peculiarity, but it
                    requires no very abstruse reflection to perceive that the adoption of this habit
                    is one eminently conducive to the easy attainment of their food, which is
                    collected, as it were, into particular spots often far apart, but where it does
                    occur occurring plentifully. Thus a single Titmouse searching alone might hunt
                    for a whole day without meeting with a sufficiency, while if a dozen are united
                    by the same motive it is hardly possible for the place in which the food is
                    lodged to escape their detection, and when discovered a few call-notes from the
                    lucky finder are enough to assemble the whole company to share the feast. It is
                    impossible to watch a band of any species of Titmouse, even for a few minutes,
                    without arriving at this conclusion. One tree after another is visited by the
                    active little rovers, and its branches examined: if nothing be forthcoming away
                    goes the explorer to the next that presents itself, merely giving utterance to
                    the usual twitter that serves to keep the body together. But if the object of
                    search be found, another kind of chirp is emitted, and the next moment the
                    several members of the band are flitting in succession to the tree and eagerly
                    engaged with the spoil.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"

                    invitation on his part, and the only particular bond of union not entirely
                    selfish which keeps them together is the cry of alarm with λvhich a stranger is

                <p>The mode in which the want of sustenance produces Migration may best be
                    illustrated by confining ourselves to the unquestionably migrant Birds of our
                    own northern hemisphere. As food grows scarce towards the end of summer in the
                    most northern limits of the range of a species, the individuals affected thereby
                    seek it elsewhere. Thus doing, they press upon the haunt of other individuals:
                    these in like manner upon that of yet others, and so on, <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit03newyrich/page/n784/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0903-0784-0767"/> until the movement which began in the far north
                    is communicated to the individuals occupying the extreme southern range of the
                    species at that season; though, but for such an intrusion, these last might be
                    content to stay some time longer in the enjoyment of their existing
                    quarters.</p>
                <p>This seems satisfactorily to explain the southward movement of all migrating
                    Birds in the northern hemisphere; but when we consider the return movement which
                    takes place some six months later, doubt may be entertained whether scarcity of
                    food can be assigned as its sole or sufficient cause, and perhaps it would be
                    safest not to come to any decision on this point. On one side it may be urged
                    that the more equatorial regions which in winter are crowded with emigrants from
                    the north, though well fitted for the resort of so great a population at that
                    season are deficient in certain necessaries for the nursery. Nor does it seem
                    too violent an assumption to suppose that even if such necessaries are not
                    absolutely wa iting, yet that the regions in question would not supply
                    sufficient food for both parents and offspring—the latter being at the lowest
                    computation, twice as numerous as the former—unless the numbers of both were
                    diminished by the casualties of travel.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>If the relative proportion of land to water in the Southern
                    Hemisphere were at all such as it is in the Northern, we should no doubt find
                    the birds of southern continents beginning to press upon the tropical and
                    equatorial regions of the globe at the season when they were thronged with the
                    emigrants from the north, and in such a case it would be only reasonable that
                    the latter should be acted upon by the force of the former, according to the
                    explanation given of the southward movement of northern migrants. But, though we
                    know almost nothing of the migration of birds of the other hemisphere, yet, when
                    we regard the comparative deficiency of land in southern latitudes all round the
                    world, it is obvious that the feathered population of such as now-a-days exists
                    can exert but little influence, and its effects may be practically
                    disregarded.</p></note> But on the other hand we must remember what has above
                    been advanced in regard to the pertinacity with which Birds return to their
                    accustomed breeding-places, and the force of this passionate fondness for the
                    old home cannot but be taken into account, even if we do not allow that in it
                    lies the whole stimulus to undertake the perilous voyage.</p>
                <p>Mr Wallace in some remarks on the subject <hi rend="italic">(Nature, X.</hi> p.
                    459) ingeniously suggests the manner in which the habit of Migration has come to
                    be adopted:<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>In principle
                    Captain Hutton had already foreshadowed the same theory.— <hi rend="italic"

                <p>“It appears to me probable that here, as in so many other cases, ‘ survival of
                    the fittest’ will be found to have had a powerful influence. Let us suppose that
                    in any species of migratory bird, breeding can as a rule be only safely
                    accomplished in a given area; and further, that during a great part of the rest
                    of the year sufficient food cannot be obtained in that area. It will follow that
                    those birds which do not leave the breeding area at the proper season will
                    suffer, and ultimately become extinct; which will also be the fate of those
                    which do not leave the feeding area at the proper time. Now, if we suppose that
                    the two areas were (for some remote ancestor of the existing species)
                    coincident, but by geological and climatic changes gradually diverged from each
                    other, we can easily understand how the habit of incipient and partial migration
                    at the proper seasons would at last become hereditary, and so fixed as to be
                    what we term an instinct. It will probably be found, that every gradation still
                    exists in various parts of the world, from a complete coincidence to a complete
                    separation of the breeding and the subsistence areas; and when the natural
                    history of a sufficient number of species is thoroughly worked out, we may find
                    every link between species which never leave a restricted area in which they
                    breed and live the whole year round, to those other cases in which the two areas
                    are absolutely separated.”</p>
                <p>A few more particulars respecting Migration are all that can here be given, and
                    it is doubtful whether much can be built upon them. It has now been ascertained
                    by re- <hi rend="superscript"> i</hi> peated observation that in the
                    spring-movement of most species of the northern hemisphere the cock-birds are
                    always in the van of the advancing army, and that they appear some days, or
                    perhaps weeks, before the hens. It is not difficult to imagine that, in the
                    course of a journey prolonged throughout some 50° or 60° of latitude, the
                    stronger individuals should outstrip the weaker by a very perceptible distance,
                    and it can hardly be doubted that in most species the males are stouter, as they
                    are bigger than the females. Some observers assert that the same thing takes
                    place in the return-journey in autumn, but on this point others are not so sure,
                    which is not surprising when we consider that the majority of observations have
                    been made towards what is the northern limit of the range of the <hi
                    rend="italic">Passeres,</hi> to which the remark is especially applicable —in
                    the British Islands, France, North Germany, and the Russian Empire—for it is
                    plain that at the beginning of the journey any inequality in the speed of
                    travelling will not have become so very manifest. There is also another matter
                    to be noticed. It has been suspected that where there is any difference in the
                    size of birds of the same species, particularly in the dimensions of their
                    wings, the individuals that perform the most extensive journeys are naturally
                    those with the longest and broadest <hi rend="italic">remiges,</hi> and in
                    support of this view it certainly appears that in some of the smaller
                    migrants—such as the Wheatear <hi rend="italic">(Saxicola</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >oenanthe)</hi> and Willow-Wren <hi rend="italic">(Phylloscopus</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">trochilus)</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi> the examples which reach
                    the extreme north of Europe and there pass the summer possess greater mechanical
                    powers of flight than those of the same species which stop short on the shores
                    of the Mediterranean. It may perhaps be also inferred, though precise evidence
                    is wanting, that these same individuals push further to the southward in winter
                    than do those which are less favoured in this respect. It is pretty nearly
                    certain that such is the case with some species, and it may well be so with
                    individuals. Canon Tristram has remarked <hi rend="italic">(Ibis,</hi> 1865, p.
                    77) that, in many genera of Birds, “those species which have the most extended
                    northerly have also the most extended southerly range; and that those which
                    resort to the highest latitudes for nidification also pass further than others
                    to the southward in winter,” fortifying his opinion by examples adduced from the
                    genera <hi rend="italic">Turdus, Fringilla, Cypselus,</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >Turtur.</hi> But supposing this to be true for many Birds, it may fairly be
                    doubted whether it is so for all, and whether in some species certain
                    individuals do not always occupy the most northern portion of the range and
                    others always keep to the most southern, no matter what the season of the year
                    may be, or over what countries the range may extend. On this point therefore it
                    will be advisable to await further investigation.</p>
                <p>For many years past a large number of persone in different countries have
                    occupied and amused themselves by carefully registering the dates on which
                    various migratory Birds first make their appearance, and certain publications
                    abound with the records so compiled.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    Still it does not seem that they have been able to determine what connection, if
                    any, exists between the arrival of birds and the state of the weather. This is
                    not very wonderful, for the movements of the migrants, if governed at all by
                    meteorological forces, must be influenced by their action in the places whence
                    the travellers have come, and therefore to establish any direct relation of
                    cause and effect corresponding observations ought equally to be made in such

                <p>As a rule it would seem as though Birds were not dependent on the weather to any
                    great degree. Occasionally the return of the Swallow or the Nightingale may be
                    somewhat delayed, but most Sea-fowls may be trusted, it is said, as the almanack
                    itself. Were they satellites revolving around this earth, their arrival could
                    hardly be more surely calculated by an astronomer. Foul weather or fair, heat or
                    cold, the Puffins <hi rend="italic">(Fratercula</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >arctica)</hi> repair to some of their stations punctually on a given day as if
                    their movements were regulated by clock-work. Whether they have come from far or
                    from near we know not, but other Birds certainly come from a great distance, and
                    yet make their appearance with scarcely less exactness. Nor is the regularity
                    with which certain species disappear much inferior; every observer knows how
                    abundant the Swift <hi rend="italic">(Cypselus</hi><hi rend="italic">apus)</hi>
                    is up to the time of its leaving its summer-home— in most parts of England, the
                    first days of August—and how rarely it is seen after that time is past.</p>
                <p>It must be allowed, however, that, with few exceptions, the mass of statistics
                    above spoken of has never been worked up and digested so as to allow proper
                    inferences to be made from them, and therefore it would be premature to say that
                    little would come of it, but the result of those few exceptions is not very
                    encouraging. Some twenty years ago Dr von Middendorff carefully collated the

                    treatise. The lines are found by taking the average date of arrival of each
                    species at each place in the Russian dominions where observations have been
                    regularly made, and connecting those places where the dates are the same for
                    each species by lines on the map. The curves thus drawn indicate the nequality
                    of progress made by the species in different longitudes, and assuming that the
                    advance is directly across the isepiptesial lines, or rather the belts defined
                    by each pair of them, the whole course of the migration is thus most accurately
                    made known. In the case of his seven sample species the maps show their
                    progressive advance at intervals of a few days, and the issue of the whole
                    investigation, according to him <hi rend="italic">(op. cit.</hi> p. 8) proves
                    that in the middle of Siberia the general direction of the usual migrants is
                    almost due north, in the east of Siberia from south-east to north-west, and in
                    European Russia from south-west to north-east. Thus nearly all the migrants of
                    the Russian Empire tend to converge upon the most northern part of the
                    continent, the Taimyr Peninsula, but it is almost needless to say that few of
                    them reach anything like so far, since the country in those high latitudes is
                    utterly unfit to support the majority. With the exception of some details,
                    which, though possessing a certain special interest, need not here be mentioned,
                    this treatise fails to shew more; for the fact that there are places that
                    notwithstanding their higher latitude are reached by Birds on their
                    spring-migrations sooner than others in a lower latitude was already known.</p>
                <p>The routes followed by migratory Birds, so far as our information at present
                    extends, has been the subject of a very exhaustive memoir by Herr Palmen<note

                    >(Helsingfors'.</hi> 1874). In this and the work of Dr von Middendorff, already
                    cited, reference is made to almost every important publication on the subject of
                    Migration, which renders a notice of its very extensive literature needless
                    here, and a pretty full bibliographical list is given in Prof. GiebeΓs <hi

                    made of Prof. Schlegel’s <hi rend="italic">Over het trekken des Vogel's</hi>
                    (Harlem: 1828), Mr Hodgson’s “On the Migration of the <hi rend="italic"

                    the least satisfactory. Prof. Baird’s excellent treatise <hi rend="italic">On

                    adverted to.</p></note> / but it would be impossible within the limits of the
                    present article to do more than mention his results concisely. He enters very
                    fully into this part of the enquiry and lays down with much apparent probability
                    the chief roads taken by the most migratory Birds of the Palaearctic Region in
                    their return autumnal journey, further asserting that in the spaces between
                    these lines of flight such birds do not usually occur. These main routes are, he
                    states, <hi rend="italic">nine</hi> in number. The first (A—to use his
                    notation), leaving the Siberian shores of the Polar Sea, Nova Zembla, and the
                    North of Russia, passes down the west coast of Norway to the North Sea and the
                    British Islands. The second (B), proceeding from Spitsbergen and the adjoining
                    islands, follows much the same course, but is prolonged past France, Spain, and
                    Portugal to the west coast of Africa. The third (C) starts from Northern Russia,
                    and, threading the White Sea, and the great Lakes of Onega and Ladoga, skirts
                    the Gulf of Finland and the southern part of the Baltic to Holstein and so to
                    Holland, where it divides—one branch uniting with the second main route (B),
                    while the other, running up the valley of the Rhine and crossing to that of the
                    Rhone, splits up on reaching the Mediterranean, where one path passes down the
                    western coast of Italy and Sicily, a second takes the line by Corsica and
                    Sardinia, and a third follows the south coast of France and eastern coast of
                    Spain —all three paths ending in North Africa. The fourth (D), fifth (E), and
                    sixth (F) main routes depart from the extreme north of Siberia. The fourth (D)
                    ascending the river Ob, branches out near Tobolsk—one track, diverging to the
                    Volga, descends that river and so passes to the Sea of Azov, the Black Sea, and
                    thence, by the Bosphorus and Aegean, to Egypt; another track makes for the
                    Caspian by way of the Ural River and so leads to the Persian Gulf, while two
                    more are lost sight of on the steppes. The fifth (E) mouuts the Jennesei to Lake
                    Baikal and so passes into Mongolia. The sixth (F) ascends the Lena and striking
                    the Upper Amoor reaches the Sea of Japan, where it coalesces with the seventh
                    (G) and eighth (0) which run from the eastern portion of Siberia and Kamchatka.
                    Besides these the ninth (X) starting from Greenland and Iceland passes by the
                    Faeroes to the British Islands and so joining the second (B) and third (C) runs
                    down the French coast. These being the main routes it must be added that, in
                    Herr Palmén’s opinion and that of many others, nearly all river-courses form
                    minor routes.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>In giving

                    and the latter, absent for a still longer period, may have wandered into the

                    by one bird to another.</p></note> The writer cannot offer an approach to the
                    solution of this mystery. There was a time when he had hopes that what is called
                    the “homing” faculty in Pigeons might furnish a clue, but Mr Tegetmeier and all
                    the best authorities on that subject declare that a knowledge of landmarks
                    obtained by sight, and sight only, is the sense which directs these Birds, while
                    sight alone can hardly be regarded as affording much aid to Birds—and there is
                    reason to think that there are several such—which at one stretch transport
                    themselves across the breadth of Europe, or even traverse more than a thousand
                    miles of open ocean, to say nothing of those—and of them there are certainly
                    many—which perform their migrations by night. That particular form of Bluethroat
                    which yearly repairs to breed upon the mosses of the Subalpine and Northern
                    parts of Scandinavia <hi rend="italic">(Cyanecula suecica)</hi> is hardly ever

                    numerous and well-instructed body, have long taken great interest, we are in a
                    position to declare that it is not known to stop in its transit from its winter
                    haunts, which we know to be Egypt and the valley of the Upper Nile, to its
                    breeding-quarters. Other instances, though none so crucial as th13, could be
                    cited from among European Birds were there room here for them. In New Zealand
                    there are two Cuckows which are annual visitors: one, a species of <hi
                    rend="italic">Chrysococcyx,</hi> is supposed to come from Australia, the other,
                    <hi rend="italic">Eudynamis taitensis</hi> is widely spread throughout
                    Polynesia, yet both these birds yearly make two voyages over the enormous waste
                    of waters that surrounds the country to which they resort to breed. But space
                    would utterly fail us were we to attempt to recount all the examples of these
                    wonderful flights. Yet it seems impossible that the sense of sight should be the
                    faculty whereby they are so guided to their destination, any more than in the
                    case of those which travel in the dark.</p>
                <p>Dr von Middendorff <hi rend="italic">(op. cit.</hi> p. 9), from the conclusions
                    he has drawn, as before mentioned, as to the spring-movement of all birds in the
                    Russian Empire being towards the Taimyr Peninsula, the seat of one of the
                    magnetic poles, has suggested that the migrating Bird is always aware (he does
                    not sufficiently explain by what means) of the situation of this point, and thus
                    knows how to steer its course. Not only is this hypothesis unsupported by any
                    considerations known to the writer, but it is not at all borne out by 'the
                    observed facts of Migration in North America, where Birds as has been shewn by
                    Professor Baird <hi rend="italic">(op. cit.</hi> p. 347) do not migrate in the
                    direction of the magnetic pole.</p>
                <p>Other authors there are who rely on what they call “instinct” as an explanation
                    of this wonderful faculty. This with them is simply a way of evading the
                    difficulty before us, if it does not indeed remove the question altogether from
                    the domain of scientific inquiry. Rejecting such a mode of treatment, Herr
                    Palmén meets it in a much fairer spirit. He asserts <hi rend="italic">(op.
                    cit.</hi> p. 195) that migrants are led by the older and stronger individuals
                    among them, and, observing that most of those which stray from their right
                    course are yearlings that have never before taken the journey, he ascribes the
                    due performance of the flight to “experience.” But, granting the undisputed
                    truth of his observation, his assertion seems to be only partially proved. That
                    the birds which lead the flock are the strongest is on all accounts most likely,
                    but what is there to show that these are also the oldest of the concourse?
                    Besides this, there are many Birds which cannot be said to migrate in flocks.
                    While Swallows, to take a sufficiently evident example, conspicuously congregate
                    in vast flocks and so leave our shores in large companies, the majority of our
                    summer-visitors slip away almost unobserved, each apparently without concert
                    with others. It is also pretty nearly certain that the same species of Bird does
                    not migrate in the same manner at all times. When Skylarks arrive on our
                    north-eastern coast in autumn they come flitting over in a constant, straggling
                    stream, not in compact flocks; yet a little later these same birds collect in
                    enormous assemblages which prosecute their voyage in company. It is indeed
                    possible that each bird of the stream intentionally follows that which goes
                    before it, though in a long seapassage it must be hard to keep the precursor in
                    sight, and it may perhaps be granted that the leader of the whole is a bird of
                    experience. But then we must consider not these cases only, but also those of
                    Birds which do not migrate in company, and we must also have regard to what is
                    implied in the word “experience.” Here it can only signify the result of
                    knowledge acquired on former occasions, and obtained by sight. Now it was stated
                    by Temminck<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi
                    rend="italic">Manual</hi><hi rend="italic">à:</hi><hi rend="italic"

                    so far as would appear the statement has not been invalidated, that among
                    migrants the young and the old always journey apart and most generally by
                    different routes. The former can have no “experience,”, and yet the greater
                    number of them safely arrive at the haven where they would be. The sense of
                    sight, essential to a knowledge of landmarks, as we have above attempted to
                    demonstrate, is utterly insufficient to account for th® success that attends
                    Birds which travel by night, or in a single flight span oceans or continents.
                    Yet without it the idea of “experience” cannot be substantiated. We may admit
                    that inherited but unconscious experience, which is really all that can be meant
                    by instinct, is a factor in tho whole matter—certainly, as Mr Wallace seems to
                    have proved, in originating the migratory impulse, but yet every aspect of the
                    question is fraught with difficulty, and we must leave to time the discovery of
                    this mystery of mysteries.</p>
                <p>There yet remain a few words to be said on what may be termed Exceptional
                    Migration, that is when from some cause or other the ordinary practice is broken
                    through. This differs from the chance occurrence of the waifs and strays with
                    which this section of the article began in that the Birds subject to it keep in
                    a great measure their customary habit of migrating, and yet are compelled to
                    indulge it in an irregular, or perhaps an altogether novel, manner, though they
                    are not entirely the sport of circumstances. The erratic movements of the
                    various species of Crossbill <hi rend="italic">(Loxia)</hi> and some allied
                    forms afford perhaps the best-known examples. In England no one can say in what
                    part of the country or at what season of the year he may not fall in with a
                    company of the Common Crossbill (A. <hi rend="italic">curvirostra),</hi> and the
                    like may be said of many other lands. The food of these Birds consists mainly of
                    the seeds of conifers, and as its supply in any one locality is intermittent or
                    precarious, we may not unreasonably guess that <pb break="no"

                    may thus find an easy way of accounting for their uncertain appearance. The
                    great band of Nutcrackers <hi rend="italic">(Numfraga caryocatactes)</hi> which
                    in the autumn of 1844 pervaded Western and Central Europe<note anchored="true"

                    hardly explain the roaming of all other Birds so plausibly. The inroads of the
                    Wax wing <hi rend="italic">(Ampelis garrulus)</hi> have been the subject of
                    interest for more than 300 years, and by persons prone to superstitious auguries
                    were regarded as the forerunners of dire calamity. Sometimes years have passed
                    without its being seen at all in Central, Western, or Southern Europe, and then
                    perhaps for two or three seasons in succession vast flocks have suddenly
                    appeared. Later observation has shown that this species is as inconstant in the
                    choice of its summer-as of its winter-quarters, and though the cause of the
                    irregularity may possibly be of much the same kind as that just suggested in the
                    case of the Crossbill, the truth awaits further investigation.<note

                    ornithologists is the irruption into Europe in 1863 of Pallas’s Sand-Grouse <hi
                    rend="italic">(Syrrhaptes paradoxus).</hi> Of this Bird, hitherto known only as
                    an inhabitant of the Tartar steppes, a single specimen was obtained at Sarepta
                    on the Volga in the winter of 1848. In May 1859 a pair is said to have been
                    killed in the Government of Vilna on the western borders of the Russian Empire,
                    and a few weeks later five examples were procured, and a few others seen, in
                    Western Europe—one in Jutland, one in Holland, two in England, and one in Wales.
                    In 1860 another was obtained at Sarepta; but in May and June 1863 a horde
                    computed to consist of at least 700 individuals overran Europe—reaching Sweden,
                    Nor way, the Faeroes, and Ireland in the north-west, and in the south extending
                    to Sicily and almost to the frontiers of Spain. On the sandhills of Jutland and
                    Holland some of these birds bred, but war was too successfully waged against the
                    nomades to allow of their establishing themselves, and a few survivors only were
                    left to fall to the gun in the course of the following winter and spring.<note

                    the writer are inserted above.</p></note> In the summer of 1872, another
                    visitation to Great Britain was reported, but if it really took place it must
                    have been that of a very small number of birds, and it was not observed on the
                    Continent. Speculation has amused itself by assigning causes to these movements
                    but the real reason remains in doubt.</p>
                <p>We cannot quit the subject of Migration, however, without referring to the
                    wonderful assemblages of Birds which have in various places been time and again
                    noticed by night. Towards the close of summer, in dark, cloudy, and still
                    weather, it not unfrequently happens that a vast and, to judge from their cries,
                    heterogeneous concourse of Birds may be heard hovering over our large towns. The
                    practical ornithologist will recognize the notes of Plover, Sandpiper, Tern, and
                    Gull, now faint with distance and then apparently close overhead, while
                    occasionally the stroke of a wing may catch his ear, but nothing is visible in
                    the surrounding gloom. Sometimes but a few fitful wails are heard, of which only
                    an expert listener will know the meaning. At others the continuous Babel of
                    sounds will ensure the attention of the most incurious. It is supposed that
                    these noises proceed from migrating birds, which, having lost their way, are
                    attracted by the glare of the street-lamps, but far too little has been observed
                    to remove the obscurity that in a double sense surrounds them and to enable us
                    to come to any definite conclusion. It must be added also that such a concourse
                    has been noticed where the fascina tion of light did not exist, for Lord Lilford
                    has recorded<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi
                    rend="italic">Ibis,</hi> 1865, p. 176.</p></note> how that once at Corfu he was
                    startled by an uproar as if all the feathered inhabitants of the great
                    Acherusian Marsh had met in conflict overhead, but he could form no conception
                    of what birds produced the greater part of it.</p>
                <p>SONG.</p>
                <p>Leaving then the subject of Migration, the next important part of the economy of
                    Birds to be considered is perhaps their Song—a word, however, in a treatise of
                    this kind to be used in a general sense, and not limited to the vocal sounds
                    uttered by not more than a moiety of the feathered races which charm us by the
                    strains they pour from their vibrating throat,—strains indeed denied by the
                    scientific musician to come under cognizance as appertaining to his art, but
                    strains which in all countries and in all ages have conveyed a feeling of true
                    pleasure to the human hearer, and strains of which by common consent the
                    Nightingale is the consummate master. It is necessary in a philosophical spirit
                    to regard every sound made by a Bird under the all-powerful influence of love or
                    lust as a “Song.” It seems impossible to draw any but an arbitrary line between
                    the deep booming of the Emeu, the harsh cry of the Guillemot (which, when
                    proceeding from a hundred or a thousand throats, strikes the distant ear in a
                    confused murmur like the roar of a tumultuous crowd), the plaintive wail of the
                    Plover, the melodious whistle of the Widgeon, “the Cock’s shrill clarion,” the
                    scream of the Eagle, the hoot of the Owl, the solemn chime of the Bellbird, the
                    whip-cracking of the Manakin, the Chaffinch’s joyous burst, or the hoarse croak
                    of the Raven, on the one hand, and the bleating of the Snipe<note

                    δ</hi> The true cause of this sound has been much, discussed, but Herr Meves’s

                    experiment, seems to be correct, though it is far from being generally

                    Innumerable are the forms which such utterances take. In many birds the sounds
                    are due to a combination of vocal and instrumental powers, or, as in the cases
                    last mentioned, to the latter only. But, however produced—and of the machinery
                    whereby they are accomplished there is not room here to speak— all have the same
                    cause and the same effect. The former has been already indicated, and the latter
                    is its consummation. Almost coinstantaneously with the hatching of the
                    Nightingale’s brood, the song of the sire is hushed, and the notes to which we
                    have for weeks hearkened with rapt admiration are changed to a guttural croak,
                    expressive of alarm and anxiety, inspiring a sentiment of the most opposite
                    character. No greater contrast can be imagined, and no instance can be cited
                    which more completely points out the purpose which “Song” fulfils in the economy
                    of the bird, for if the Nightingale’s nest at this early time be destroyed or
                    its contents removed, the cock speedily recovers his voice, and his favourite
                    haunts again resound to his bewitching strains. For them his mate is content
                    again to undergo the wearisome round of nest-building and incubation. But should
                    some days elapse before disaster befalls their callow care, his constitution
                    undergoes a change and no second attempt to rear a family is made. It would seem
                    as though a mild temperature, and the abundance of food by which it is generally
                    accompanied, prompt the physiological alteration which inspires the males of
                    most birds to indulge in the “Song” peculiar to them. Thus after the annual
                    moult is accomplished, and this is believed to be the most critical epoch in the
                    life of any bird, cock Thrushes, Skylarks, and others begin to sing, not indeed
                    with the jubilant voice of spring but in an <pb break="no"

                    the supervention of cold weather. Yet some birds we have which, except during
                    the season of moult, hard frost, and time of snow, sing almost all the year
                    round. Of these the Redbreast and the Wren are familiar examples, and the
                    Chiff-chaff repeats its two-noted cry, almost to weariness, during the whole
                    period of its residence in this country.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>A curious question, which has as yet attracted but little
                    attention, is whether the notes of the same species of Bird are in all countries
                    alike. From his own observation the writer is inclined to think that it is not,
                    and that there may exist “dialects,” so to speak, of the song. <hi rend="italic"

                <p>Akin to the “Song” of Birds, and undoubtedly proceeding from the same cause, are
                    the peculiar gestures which the males of many perform under the influence of the
                    approaching season of pairing, but these again are far too numerous here to
                    describe with particularity. It must suffice to mention a few cases. The Ruff on
                    his hillock in a marsh holds a war-dance. The Snipe and some of his allies mount
                    aloft and wildly execute unlooked-for evolutions almost in the clouds. The
                    Woodcock and many of the Goatsuckers beat evening after evening the same aerial
                    path with its sudden and sharp turnings. The Ring-Dove rises above the
                    neighbouring trees and then with motionless wings slides down to the leafy
                    retreat they afford. The Capercally and Blackcock, perched on a commanding
                    eminence, throw themselves into postures that defy the skill of the
                    caricaturist—other species of the Grouse-tribe assume the strangest attitudes
                    and rur in circles till the turf is worn bare. The Peacock in pride spreads his
                    train so as to shew how nearly akin are the majestic and the ludicrous. The
                    Bower-bird, not content with his own splendour, builds an arcade, decked with
                    bright feathers and shining shells, through and around which he paces with his
                    gay companions. The Larks and Pipits never deliver their song so well as when
                    seeking the upper air. Rooks rise one after the other to a great height and,
                    turning on their back, wantonly precipitate themselves many yards towards the
                    ground, while the solemn Raven does not scorn a similar feat, and, with the
                    tenderest of croaks, glides supinely alongside or in front of his mate.<note

                <p>NIDIFICATION.</p>
                <p>Following or coincident with the actions just named, and countless more besides,
                    comes the real work of the breeding-season, to which they are but the prelude or
                    the accompaniment. Nidification is with most birds the beginning of this
                    business; but with many it is a labour that is scamped if not shirked. Some of
                    the Auk tribe place their single egg on a bare ledge of rock, where its peculiar
                    conical shape is but a precarious safeguard when rocked by the wind or stirred
                    by the thronging crowd of its parents’ fellows. The Stone-Curlew and the
                    Goatsucker deposit their eggs without the slightest preparation of the soil on
                    which they rest; yet this is not done at haphazard, for no birds can be more
                    constant in selecting, almost to an inch, the very same spot which year after
                    year they choose for their procreant cradle. In marked contrast to such artless
                    care stand the wonderful structures which others, such as the Tailor-bird, the
                    Bottle-Titmouse, or the Fantail-Warbler build for the comfort or safety of their
                    young. But every variety of disposition may be found in the Class. The Apteryx
                    seems to entrust its abnormally big egg to an excavation among the roots of a
                    tree-fern; while a band of female Ostriches scrape holes in the desert-sand and
                    therein promiscuously dropping their eggs cover them with earth and leave the
                    task of incubation to the male, who discharges the duty thus imposed upon him by
                    night only, and trusts by day to the sun’s rays for keeping up the needful,
                    fostering warmth. The Megapodes raise a huge hotbed of dead leaves wherein they
                    deposit their eggs and the young are hatched without further care on the part of
                    either parent. Some of the Grebes and Rails seem to avail themselves in a less
                    degree of the heat generated by vegetable decay, and dragging from the bottom or
                    sides of the waters they frequent fragments of aquatic plants form of them a
                    rude half-floating mass which is piled on some growing water-weed—but these
                    birds do not spurn the duties of maternity. Many of the Gulls, Sandpipers, and
                    Plovers lay their eggs in a shallow pit which they hollow out in the soil, and
                    then as incubation proceeds add thereto a low breastwork of haulm. The Ringed
                    Plover commonly places its eggs on shingle, which they so much resemble in
                    colour, but when breeding on grassy uplands it paves the nest-hole with small
                    stones. Pigeons mostly make an artless platform of sticks so loosely laid
                    together that their pearly treasures may be perceived from beneath by the
                    inquisitive observer. The Magpie, as though self-conscious that its own thieving
                    habits may be imitated by its neighbours, surrounds its nest with a hedge of
                    thorns. Very many birds of almost every group bore holes in some sandy cliff,
                    and at the end of their tunnel deposit their eggs with or without bedding. Such
                    bedding, too, is very various in character; thus, while the Sheldduck and the
                    Sand-Martin supply the softest of materials, the one of down from her own body,
                    the other of feathers collected by dint of diligent search,—the Kingfisher forms
                    a couch of the undigested spiny fish-bones which she ejects in pellets from her
                    own stomach. Other birds, as the Woodpeckers, hew holes in living trees, even
                    when the timber is of considerable hardness, and therein establish their
                    nursery. Some of the Swifts secrete from their salivary glands a fluid which
                    rapidly hardens as it dries on exposure to the air into a substance resembling
                    isinglass, and thus furnish the “edible birds’ nests” that are the delight of
                    Chinese epicures. In the architecture of nearly all the Passerine birds, too,
                    some salivary secretion seems to play an important part. By its aid they are
                    enabled to moisten and bend the otherwise refractory twigs and straws and glue
                    them to their place. Spiders’ webs also are employed with great advantage for
                    the purpose last mentioned, but perhaps chiefly to attach fragments of moss and
                    lichen so as to render the whole structure less obvious to the eye of the
                    spoiler. The Tailor-bird deliberately spins a thread of cotton and therewith
                    stitches together the edges of a pair of leaves to make a receptacle for its
                    nest. Beautiful too is the felt fabricated of fur or hairs by the various
                    species of Titmouse, while many birds ingeniously weave into a compact mass both
                    animal and vegetable fibres, forming an admirable non-conducting medium which
                    guards the eggs from the extremes of temperature outside. Such a structure may
                    be open and cup-shaped, supported from below as that of the Chaffinch and
                    Goldfinch, domed like that of the Wren and Bottle-Titmouse, slung hammock-wise
                    as in the case of the Golden-crested Wren and the Orioles, or suspended by a
                    single cord as with certain Grosbeaks and Hummingbirds. Under such circumstances
                    it is even sometimes needful to balance the nest lest the weight of the growing
                    young should destroy the equipoise and, precipitating them on the ground, dash
                    the hopes of the parents, and compensation in such cases is applied by loading

                    thereby fear the neighbourhood of a deadly enemy. The clay-built edifices of the
                    Swallow and Martin are known to everybody, and the Nuthatch plasters up the
                    gaping mouth of its nest-hole till only a postern large enough for entrance and
                    exit, but easy of defence, is left. In South America we have a family of birds
                    <hi rend="italic">(Eurnariidoe)</hi> which construct on the branching roots of
                    the mangrove globular ovens, so to speak, of mud, wherein the eggs are laid and
                    the young hatched. The Flamingo erects in the marshes it frequents a mound of
                    earth some two feet in height, with a cavity atop, on which the hen, having
                    oviposited, sits astride with dangling legs, and in that remarkable attitude is
                    said to perform the duty of incubation. The females of the Hornbills, and
                    perhaps of the Hoopoes, submit to incarceration during this interesting period,
                    the males immuring them by a barrier of mud, leaving only a small window to
                    admit air and food, which latter is assiduously brought to the prisoners.</p>
                <p>But though in a general way the dictates of hereditary instinct are rigidly
                    observed by birds, in many species a remarkable degree of elasticity is
                    exhibited or the rule of habit is rudely broken. Thus the noble Falcon, whose
                    ordinary eyry is on the beetling cliff, will for the convenience of procuring
                    prey condescend to lay its eggs on the ground in a marsh, or appropriate the
                    nest of some other bird in a tree. The Golden Eagle, too, remarkably adapts
                    itself to circumstances, now rearing its young on a precipitous ledge, now on
                    the arm of an ancient monarch of the forest and again on a treeless plain,
                    making a humble home amid grass and herbage. Herons also shew the same
                    versatility and will breed according to circumstances in an open fen, on
                    sea-banks or (as is most usual) on lofty trees. Such changes are easy to
                    understand. The instinct of finding food for the family is predominant, and
                    where most food is there will the feeders be gathered together. This explains,
                    in all likelihood, the associated bands of Ospreys or Fish-Hawks, which in North
                    America breed (or used to breed) in large companies where sustenance is
                    plentiful, though in the Old World the same species brooks not the society of
                    aught but its mate. Birds there are of eminently social predilections. In
                    Europe, excepting Sea-fowls—whose congregations are universal and known to
                    all—we have perhaps but the Heron, the Fieldfare, and the Rook, which habitually
                    flock during the breeding-season; but in other parts of the world many birds
                    unite in company at that time, and in none possibly is this habit so strongly
                    developed as in the Anis of the Neotropical Region, the Republican Swallow of
                    North America, and the Sociable Grosbeak of South Africa, which last joins nest
                    to nest until the tree is said to break down under the accumulated weight of the
                    common edifice.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>There

                    hardly been deemed a distinct branch of the science. A good deal of instructive
                    matter (not altogether free from error) will be found in Rennie’s <hi

                <p>In the strongest contrast to these amiable qualities is the parasitic nature of
                    the Cuckows of the Old World and the Cow-birds of the New, but this peculiarity
                    of theirs is so well known that to dwell upon it would be needless. Enough to
                    say that the egg of the parasite is introduced into the nest of the dupe, and
                    after the necessary incubation by the fond fool of a foster-mother the
                    interloper successfully counterfeits the heirs, who perish miserably, victims of
                    his superior strength. The whole process has been often watched, but the
                    reflective naturalist will pause to ask how such a state of things came about,
                    and there is not much to satisfy his enquiry. Certain it is that some birds
                    whether by mistake or stupidity do not unfrequently lay their eggs in the nests
                    of others. It is within the knowledge of many that Pheasants’ eggs and
                    Partridges’ eggs are often laid in the same nest, and it is within the knowledge
                    of the writer that Gulls’ eggs have been found in the nests of Eider-Ducks, and
                    <hi rend="italic">vice versa;</hi> that a Redstart and a Pied Flycatcher will
                    lay their eggs in the same convenient hole —the forest being rather deficient in
                    such accommodation; that an Owl and a Duck will resort to the same nest-box, set
                    up by a scheming woodsman for his own advantage; and that the Starling, which
                    constantly dispossesses the Green Woodpecker, sometimes discovers that the
                    rightful heir of the domicile has to be brought up by the intruding tenant In
                    all such cases it is not possible to say which species is so constituted as to
                    obtain the mastery, but it is not difficult to conceive that in the course of
                    ages that which was driven from its home might thrive through the fostering of
                    its young by the invader, and thus the abandonment of domestic habits and duties
                    might become a direct gain to the evicted householder. This much granted, all
                    the rest will follow easily enough, but it must be confessed that this is only a
                    presumption, though a presumption which seems plausible if not likely.</p>

                <p>The pains bestowed by such Birds (incomparably the most numerous of the Class),
                    as build elaborate nests and the devices employed by those that, not doing so,
                    display no little skill in providing for the preservation of their produce,
                    invite some attention to the eggs which they lay. This attention will perhaps be
                    more cheerfully given when we think how many naturalists, not merely
                    ornithologists, have been first directed to the study of the animal kingdom by
                    the spoils they have won in their early days of birds’ nesting. With some such
                    men the fascination of this boyish pursuit has maintained its full force even in
                    old age—a fact not so much to be wondered at when it is considered that hardly
                    any branch of the practical study of Natural History brings the enquirer so
                    closely in contact with many of its secrets. It is therefore eminently
                    pardonable for the victims of this devotion to dignify their passion by the
                    learned name of <hi rend="smallcaps">“</hi><hi rend="smallcaps">Oologï,”</hi>
                    and to bespeak for it the claims of a science. Yet the present writer—once an
                    ardent follower of the practice of birds’-nesting, and still on occasion warming
                    to its pleasures—must confess to a certain amount of disappointment as to the
                    benefits it was expected to confer on Systematic Ornithology, though he yields
                    to none in his high estimate of its utility in acquainting the learner with the
                    most interesting details of bird-life—without a knowledge of which nearly all
                    systematic study is but work that may as well be done in a library, a museum, or
                    a dissecting-room, and is incapable of conveying information to the learner
                    concerning the why and the wherefore of such or such modifications and
                    adaptations of structure. To some—and especially to those who are only
                    anatomists— this statement may seem preposterous, but it is in truth no such
                    thing. What engineer can be said to understand his business if he knows not the
                    purpose to which the machines he makes are to be applied and is unacquainted
                    with their mode of working <hi rend="italic">1 We</hi> may investigate

                    the economy of the creature we as naturalists have done but half our task and
                    abandon our labour when the fulness of reward is coming upon us. The
                    field-naturalist, properly instructed, crowns the work of the comparative
                    anatomist and the physiologist, though without the necessary education he is
                    little more than an empiric, even should he possess the trained cunning of the
                    savage on whose knowledge of the habits of wild animals depends his chance of
                    procuring a meal.</p>
                <p>Perhaps the greatest scientific triumph of oologists lies in their having fully
                    appreciated the intimate alliance of the <hi rend="italic">Limicoloe</hi> (the
                    great group of Snipes and Plovers) with the <hi rend="italic">Gavioe</hi> (the
                    Gulls, Terns, and other birds more distantly connected with them) before it was
                    recognized by any professed taxonomist,—L’Herminier, whose researches have been
                    much overlooked, excepted; though to such an one was given the privilege of
                    placing that affinity beyond cavil (Huxley, <hi rend="italic">Proc. Zool.
                    Soc.</hi> 1867, pp. 426, 456-458; <hi rend="italic">cf. Ibis,</hi> 1868, p. 92).
                    In like manner it is believed that oologists first saw the need of separating
                    from the true <hi rend="italic">Passeres</hi> several groups of birds that had
                    for many years been unhesitatingly associated with that very uniform assemblage.
                    Diffidence as to their own capacity for meddling with matters of systematic
                    arrangement may possibly have been the cause which deterred the men who were
                    content to brood over birds’ eggs from sooner asserting the validity of the
                    views they held. Following the example furnished by the objects of their study,
                    they seem to have chiefly sought to hide their offspring from the curious
                    eye—and if such was their design it must be allowed to have been admirably
                    successful. In enthusiastic zeal for the prosecution of their favourite
                    researches, however, they have never yielded to, if they have not surpassed, any
                    other class of naturalists. If a storm-swept island, only to be reached at the
                    risk of life, held out the hope of some oological novelty there was the
                    egg-collector (Faber, <hi rend="italic">Isis,</hi> xx. pp. 633-688; Proctor, <hi
                    rend="italic">Naturalist,</hi> 1838, pp. 411, 412). Did another treasure demand
                    his traversing a burning desert (Tristram, <hi rend="italic">Ibis,</hi> 1859, p.
                    79) or sojourning for several winters within the wildest wastes of the Arctic
                    Circle (Wolley, <hi rend="italic">Ibis,</hi> 1859, pp. 69-76; 1861, pp. 92-106;
                    Kennicott, <hi rend="italic">Rep. Smithson. Inst.</hi> 1862, pp. 39, 40), he
                    endured the necessary hardships to accomplish his end, and the possession to him
                    of an empty shell of carbonate of lime,<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>A small proportion of carbonate of magnesia and phosphate of
                    4ime and magnesia also enters into its composition.</p></note> stained or not
                    (as the case might be) by a secretion of the villous membrane of the parent’s
                    uterus, was to him a sufficient reward. Taxonomers, however, have probably been
                    right in not attaching too great an importance to such systematic characters as
                    can be deduced from the eggs of birds, but it would have been better had they
                    not insisted so strongly as they have done on the infallibility of one or
                    another set of characters, chosen by themselves. Oology taken alone proves to be
                    a guide as misleading as any other arbitrary method of classification, but
                    combined with the evidence afforded by due study of other particularities,
                    whether superficial or deep-seated, it can scarcely fail in time to conduct us
                    to an ornithological arrangement as nearly true to Nature as we may expect to
                    achieve.</p>
                <p>The first man of science who seems to have given any special thought to oology,
                    was the celebrated Sir Thomas Browne, of Norwich, who already in 1681, when
                    visited by John Evelyn (from whose diary we learn the fact), had assigned a
                    place in his cabinet of rarities to a collection of birds’ eggs. The next we
                    hear of is that Count of Marsigli who early in the eighteenth century explored,
                    chiefly for this kind of investigation, the valley of the Danube—a region at
                    that time, it is almost unnecessary to remark, utterly unknown to naturalists.
                    But there is no need to catalogue the worthies of this study. As they approach
                    our own day their number becomes far too great to tell, and if very recently it
                    has seemed to dwindle the reason is probably at hand in the reflection that most
                    of the greatest prizes have been won, while those that remain to reward the
                    aspiring appear to be just now from one cause or another almost out of reach.
                    Perhaps at the present time the Birds-of-Paradise and their allies form the only
                    group of any recognized distinctiveness and extent of whose eggs we know
                    absolutely nothing—though there are important isolated forms, such a3 <hi
                    rend="italic">Atrichia, Heterolocha,</hi> and others, concerning the eggs as
                    well as the breeding habits of which our ignorance is absolute, and the species
                    of many families that have hitherto defied the zeal of oologists are very
                    numerous. These last, however, though including some common and some not very
                    uncommon British birds, possess in a general way comparatively little interest,
                    since, the eggs of their nearest allies being well known, we cannot expect much
                    to follow from the discovery of the recluses, and it is only to the impassioned
                    collector that the obtaining of such desiderata will afford much
                    satisfaction.</p>
                <p>The first thing which strikes the eye of one who beholds a large collection of
                    egg-shells is the varied hues of the specimens. Hardly a shade known to the
                    colourist is not exhibited by one or more, and some of these tints have their
                    beauty enhanced by the glossy surface on which they are displayed, by their
                    harmonious blending, or by the pleasing contrast of the pigments which form
                    markings as often of the most irregular as of regular shape. But it would seem
                    as though such markings, which a very small amount of observation will shew to
                    have been deposited on the shell a short time before its exclusion, are
                    primarily and normally circular, for hardly any egg that bears markings at all
                    does not exhibit some spots of that form, but that in the progress of the eggs
                    through that part of the oviduct in which the colouring matter is laid on many
                    of them become smeared, blotched, or protracted in some particular direction.
                    The circular spots thus betoken the deposition of the pigment while the egg is
                    at rest, the blurred markings show its deposition while the egg is in motion,
                    and this motion would seem often to be at once onward and rotatory, as indicated
                    by the spiral markings not uncommonly observable in the eggs of some
                    Birds-of-prey and others—the larger end of the egg (when the ends differ in
                    form) making way for the smaller.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>That the larger end is protruded first was found on actual
                    experiment by Mr Bartlett, Superintendent of the Gardens of the Zoological
                    Society, to be the case commonly, but as an accident the position may be
                    sometimes reversed, and this will most likely account for the occasional
                    deposition of markings on the smaller instead of the larger end as not un
                    frequently shown in eggs of the Sparrow-hawk <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Accipiter</hi><hi rend="italic">ηisus}.</hi> The head of the chick is always
                    formed at the larger end.</p></note> At the same time the eggs of a great number
                    of birds bear, beside these last and superimposed markings, more deeply-seated
                    stains, generally of a paler and often of an altogether different hue, and these
                    are evidently due to some earlier dyeing process. The peculiar tint of the
                    ground-colour, though commonly superficial, if not actually congenital with the
                    formation of the shell, would appear to be suffused soon after. The depth of
                    colouring whether original or supervening is obviously dependent in a great
                    measure on the constitution or bodily condition of the parent. If a bird,
                    bearing in its oviduct a fully-formed egg, be captured, that egg will speedily
                    be laid under any circumstances of inconvenience to which its producer shall be
                    subjected, but such an egg is usually deficient in coloration—fright and <pb

                    In like manner over excitement or debility of the organs, the consequence of ill
                    health, give rise to much and often very curious abnormality. It is commonly
                    believed that the older a bird is the more intensely coloured will be its eggs,
                    and to some extent this belief appears to be true. Certain <hi rend="italic"
                    >Ealconidoe,</hi> which ordinarily lay very brilliantly-tinted eggs, and are
                    therefore good tests, seem when young unable to secrete so much colouring-matter
                    as they do when older, and season after season the dyes become deeper, but there
                    is reason to think that when the bird has attained its full vigour improvement
                    stops, and a few years later the intensity of hue begins to decline. It would be
                    well if we had more evidence, however, in support of this opinion, which is
                    chiefly based on a series of eggs of one species—the Golden Eagle <hi
                    rend="italic">(Aquila chrysaetus),</hi> in the writer’s possession, among which
                    are some believed on good grounds to have been the produce in the course of
                    about twelve years of one and the same female. The amount of colouring-matter
                    secreted and deposited seems notwithstanding to be generally a pretty constant
                    quantity—allowance being made for individual constitution; but it often
                    happens—especially in birds that lay only two eggs—that nearly all the dye will
                    be deposited on one of these, leaving the other colourless; it seems, however,
                    to be a matter of inconstancy which of the two is first developed. Thus of two
                    pairs of Golden Eagles’ eggs also in the possession of the writer, one specimen
                    of each pair is nearly white while the other is deeply coloured, and it is known
                    that in one case the white egg was laid first and in the other the coloured one.
                    When birds lay many mottled, and <hi rend="italic">a fortiori</hi> plain, eggs,
                    there is generally less difference in their colouring, and though no two can
                    hardly ever be said to be really alike, yet the family resemblance between them
                    all is obvious to the practised eye. It would seem however to be a peculiarity
                    with some species—and the Tree-Sparrow <hi rend="italic">(Passer·</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">montanus)</hi> which lays five or six eggs may be taken as a
                    striking example— that one egg should always differ remarkably from the rest of
                    the clutch. In addition to what has been said above as to the deposition of
                    colour in circular spots indicating a pause in the progress of the <hi
                    rend="italic">egg</hi> through one part of the oviduct, it may be observed that
                    the cessation of motion at that time is equally shewn by the clearly defined
                    hair-lines or vermiculations seen in many eggs, and in none more commonly met

                    rend="italic">izidoe).</hi> Such markings must not only have been deposited
                    while the egg was at rest, but it must have remained motionless until the
                    pigment was completely set, or blurred instead of sharp edges would have been
                    the result.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>The

                    subject by the researches of Mr Sorby <hi rend="italic">(Proc. Zool. Soc.</hi>
                    1875, p. 351), who, using the method of spectrum-analysis, has now ascertained
                    the existence of <hi rend="italic">seven</hi> well-marked substances in the
                    colouring-matter of eggs, to the admixture of which in certain proportions all
                    their tints are due. These he names</p>
                <p>Oorhodeine, Oocyan, Banded Oocyan, Yellow Ooxanthine, Rufous Ooxanthine, a
                    substance, giving narrow absorptionbands in the red, the true colour of which he
                    has not yet been able to decide, and lastly Lichenoxanthine. It would be out of
                    place here to particularize their chemical properties, and it is enough to say
                    that they are closely connected either with haemoglobin or bile-pigments, and in
                    many respects resemble the latter more than do any other group of
                    colouring-matters, but do not actually agree with them. The first is perhaps the
                    most important of all the seven, because it occurs more or less in the shells of
                    so great a number of eggs that its entire absence is exceptional, and it is of a
                    very permanent character, its general colour being of a peculiar brown-red. The
                    second and third seem when pure to be of a very fine blue, but the spectrum of
                    the former shows no detached bands, while that of the latter has a well-marked
                    detached absorbent-band near the red end, though the two are closely related
                    since they yield the same product when oxidized. The fourth and fifth substances
                    supply a bright yellow or reddish-yellow hue, and the former is particularly
                    characteristic of eggs of the Emeus <hi rend="italic">(Dromoeus),</hi> giving
                    rise when mixed with oocyan to the fine malachite-green which they possess,
                    while the latter has only been met with in those of the Tinamous <hi
                    rend="italic">(Tinamidoe),</hi> in which it should be mentioned that oorhodeine
                    has not been found, or perhaps in those of a Cassowary <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Casitamus),</hi> and when mixed with oocyan produces a peculiar lead-colour.
                    The sixth substance, as before stated, has not yet been sufficiently determined,
                    but it would seem in combination with others to give them an abnormally browner
                    tint; and the seventh appears to be identical with one which occurs in greater
                    or less amount in almost all classes of plants, but is more especially abundant
                    in and characteristic of lichens and fungi. There is a possibility however of
                    this last being in part if not wholly due to the growth of minute fungi, though
                    Mr Sorby believes that some such substance really is a normal constituent of the
                    shell of eggs having a peculiar brick-red colour. That gentleman is further
                    inclined to think that oorhodeine is in some way or other closely related to
                    cruentine, being probably derived from the red colouring-matter of the blood by
                    some unknown process of secretion, and likewise that there is some chemical
                    relation between the oocyans and the bile.</p>

                    arrived at the conclusion that a well-defined type of shell-structure belongs to
                    certain families of birds, and is easily recognized under the microscope. In
                    some cases, as in the eggs of certain Swans and Geese <hi rend="italic">(Cygnus
                    olor</hi> and <hi rend="italic">C. musicus, Anser cinereus</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">A. segetum)</hi> even specific differences are apparent. The
                    bearing of these researches on classification generally is of considerable
                    importance and must be taken into account by all future taxonomers. Here we
                    cannot enter into details, it must suffice to remark that the grain of the shell
                    is sometimes so fine that the surface is glossy, and this is the case with a
                    large number of <hi rend="italic">Pi-</hi><hi rend="italic">camoe,</hi> where it

                    polished, but it is still very different from the brilliant surface of those
                    just mentioned, and nothing like a definite line can be drawn between their
                    structure and that in which the substance is dull and uniform, as among the <hi

                <p>In form eggs vary very much, and this is sometimes observable in examples not

                    the parents belong. Those of the Owls <hi rend="italic">{Strigidoe)</hi>.and of

                    those which lay the glossy eggs above spoken of—are often apparently spherical,
                    though it is probable that if tested mathematically none would be found truly
                    so—indeed it may be asserted that few eggs are strictly symmetrical, however
                    nearly they may seem so, one side bulging out, though very slightly, more than
                    the other. The really <hi rend="italic">oval</hi> form, with which we are most
                    familiar, needs no remark, but th13 is capable of infinite variety caused by the
                    relative position and proportion of the major and minor axes. In nearly all the
                    <hi rend="italic">Limicoloe</hi> and some of the <hi rend="italic">Alcidoe</hi>
                    the egg attenuates very rapidly towards the smaller end, sometimes in a slightly
                    convex curve, sometimes without perceptible curvature, and occasionally in a
                    sensibly concave curve. The eggs having this pyriform shape are mostly those of
                    birds which invariably lay four in a nest, and therein they lie with their
                    points almost meeting in the centre and thus occupying as little space as
                    possible and more easily covered by the brooding parent. Other eggs as those of
                    the Sand-Grouse <hi rend="italic">{Ptcrocleidoe)</hi> are elongated and almost
                    cylindrical for a considerable part of their length terminating at each end
                    obtusely, while eggs of the Grebes <hi rend="italic">{Podicipedidoe)</hi> which
                    also have both ends nearly alike but pointed, are so wide in the middle as to
                    present a biconical appearance.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                <p>The size of eggs is generally but not at all constantly in proportion to that of

                    hatched, and which are consequently more fully developed at their birth, are

                    some relation to their size, and this offers a further explanation of the fact
                    just mentioned with regard to the Snipe and the Partridge —the former being one
                    of those birds which are constant in producing four, and the latter often laying
                    as many as a dozen—for the chicks of each run as soon as they release themselves
                    from the shell.</p>
                <p>Incubation is performed, as is well known, by the female of nearly all Birds, but
                    with most of the <hi rend="italic">Passeres</hi> and many others the male seems
                    to share her tedious duties, and among the <hi rend="italic">Ratitoe,</hi>
                    apparently without exception, the cock takes that office wholly on himself.
                    There are a few groups or perhaps species in which the same practice is
                    suspected to obtain—certain of the <hi rend="italic">Limicoloe</hi> for
                    instance, the Godwits <hi rend="italic">{Limosa),</hi> the Phalaropes <hi
                    rend="italic">{Phalaroprus),</hi> and the Dotterel <hi rend="italic">{Eudromias
                    morinellus)—</hi> and in these it is to be remarked that the hen is larger and
                    more brightly coloured than her mate. Owing to the unfortunate neglect of those
                    who have the opportunity of making the needful observations the period of
                    Incubation has been ascertained in comparatively few birds, and it is here
                    possible to deal with that subject only in the most vague and general language.
                    It may be asserted that most of the smaller <hi rend="italic">Passeres</hi> of
                    Europe hatch their young in about thirteen days, but in a few species the term
                    is believed to be shortened to ten or eleven days, while in the largest of that
                    Order, the Raven, it is lengthened to some twenty-one days. This also is the
                    period which the Barndoor-fowl ordinarily takes, but the Pheasant, though so
                    very nearly allied, takes about twentyeight. Most Water-birds, so far as is
                    known, and the smaller Birds-of-prey seem to require as long a time, but in the
                    Swan incubation is protracted to six weeks. The temperature of the air is
                    commonly credited with having something to do either in hastening or retarding
                    exclusion from the egg, but to what extent, or even whether justly so or not,
                    seems in the absence of precise experiments to be doubtful. Certain birds
                    occasionally begin brooding as soon as the first egg is laid,<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>This seems to be very often
                    the case with the Owls, but if the writer’s observation is not mistaken the
                    habit is not constant even with the same individual bird.</p></note> and this
                    plan unquestionably has its advantages, since the offspring being of different
                    ages thereby become less of a burthen on the parents which have to minister to
                    their wants, while the fostering warmth of the earlier chicks can hardly fail to
                    aid the development of those which are unhatched, during the absence of father
                    and mother in search of food; but most birds, and it need scarcely be said, all
                    those the young of which run from their birth, await the completion of the
                    clutch before sitting is begun. The care bestowed, by almost every species, on
                    the infant-brood, is proverbial, and there is hardly any extremity of danger
                    which one at least of the anxious parents will not incur to ward off injury from
                    their progeny.</p>
                <p>MOULT.</p>
                <p>The more or less protracted business of reproduction being ended there forthwith
                    follows in the case of nearly all Birds a process of the most vital consequence
                    to them. This is the Moult or shedding of their old and often weather-beaten
                    feathers to be replaced by an entirely new suit. It is probably the severest
                    strain to which bird-life is exposed, and, to judge from its effects on our
                    domesticated pets, produces a greater mortality than an occasional want <pb

                    however as are its bearings on every individual of the whole Class, the subject
                    is one which has been sadly neglected by ornithological writers and, with one
                    exception,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>This is a

                    Moult within the whole range of their literature. The structure and mode of
                    growth of feathers has been very well studied and described by several
                    investigators, and must be especially treated in introducing the subject of
                    Pterylography—or the disposition of the various plumed patches on the bird’s
                    body—which, having been found to be a most useful auxiliary in Classification,
                    is deferred until that comes to be discussed under the article “<hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Ornithology.”</hi> For the present we have briefly to consider
                    the different phases which the process of Moulting offers.</p>
                <p>As a general rule all Birds are subject to an annual Moult, and this as above
                    stated, commonly begins immediately on the close of the breeding-season, but, as
                    will be explained further on, there arc some which undergo in addition a second
                    or even a third partial change of plumage, and it is possible that there may be
                    others still more exceptional, our information respecting these, however, is too
                    meagre to make it worth while saying anything here about them. It must be
                    acknowledged that with regard to the great majority of form3 we can only judge
                    by analogy, and though it may well be that some interesting deviations from the
                    general rule exist of which we are altogether ignorant, yet when we consider
                    that the <hi rend="italic">Ratitoe,</hi> so far as observed, moult exactly in
                    the same manner as other birds,<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>For the knowledge of this fact the write? is indebted to the
                    vast experience of Mr Bartlett.</p></note> the uniformity of the annual change
                    may be almost taken for granted.</p>
                <p>It is not intended here to describe the way in which a feather dies and a new one
                    succeeds it, nor need we compare the process of moulting with the analogous
                    shedding of the hair in Mammals or of the skin in Reptiles. Enough for our
                    present purpose to see that such renovation is required in Birds, which nearly
                    all have to depend upon their quills for the means of locomotion and hence of
                    livelihood. It is easy to understand that durable as are the flight-feathers,
                    they do not last for ever and are besides very subject to accidental breakage,
                    the consequence of which would be the crippling of the bird. It is obviously to
                    provide against what in most cases would be such a disaster as this last that we
                    find the <hi rend="italic">remiges,</hi> or quill-feathers of the wings, to be
                    always shed in pairs. They drop out not indeed absolutely at the same moment,
                    though this sometimes seems to happen, but within a few days of each other, and,
                    equilibrium being thus preserved, the power of flight is but slightly
                    deteriorated by their temporary loss. The same mιy be observed in a less degree,
                    since there is less need of regularity, with the rest of the plumage, as a
                    little attention to any tame bird will show, and the new feathers grow at an
                    almost equal rate. In the young of most species the original quills are not shed
                    during the first year, nor in the young of many does there seem to be an entire
                    moult during that time, but in the typical <hi rend="italic">Gallinoe,</hi>
                    which are able to fly at a very early age, often before they are one-third
                    grown, the original quills, being proportioned to the duties required of them,
                    are shed before the bird has attained its full size and are succeeded by others
                    that serve it when it has reached maturity. In the Duck-tribe <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Anatidoe),</hi> however, we have a very singular exception to what has been
                    above stated. Most of these birds shed their quillfeathers all at once, and
                    become absolutely incapable of flight for a season,<note anchored="true"

                    they generally seek the shelter of thick, aquatic herbage, and it is further to
                    be particularly remarked that the males of most of two sections of the family
                    <hi rend="italic">(Anatinoe</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Fuligulinoe)</hi> at the
                    same period lose the brilliantly-coloured plumage which commonly distinguishes
                    them and “go into eclipse,” as Waterton happily said, putting on for several
                    weeks a dingy garb much resembling that of the other sex, to resume their gay
                    attire only when, their new quills being grown, it can be safely flaunted in the
                    open air. Here we have the first instances of Additional Moult to be mentioned.
                    Another is not less interesting, though ornithologists must confess with shame
                    that they have not sufficiently investigated it. This 13 that of the Ptarmigan

                    then again as autumn passes away into their snowy winter-clothing, but,
                    divesting themselves of this last in spring, then put on each a third and most
                    distinctive dress—these changes, however, do not extend to the quills either of
                    the wings or tail.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"

                <p>The number of Birds which undergo a more or less entire Double Moult is very
                    considerable, and the peculiarity is not always characteristic of families or
                    even, unless in a restricted sense, of genera. Thus while the Garden-Warbler <hi
                    rend="italic">(Sylvia salicaria)</hi> is said to moult twice in the year the
                    Blackcap <hi rend="italic">(S. atricapilla)</hi> does so but once. The same may
                    be said of the <hi rend="italic">Embemzidoe,</hi> in which family both practices
                    seem to obtain, but on the other hand the distinction in this respect between
                    the Larks <hi rend="italic">(Alaudidoe)</hi> and the Pipits <hi rend="italic"

                    appears, so far as our knowledge goes, to be invariable, though the habits and
                    general appearance of both groups are so much alike— the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Alaudidoe</hi> moulting but once and the <hi rend="italic">Anthinoe,</hi>
                    conforming to the practice of the normal <hi rend="italic">Motacillidoe
                    (Motacillinoe),</hi> twice a year—the quills, be it understood, excepted. But it
                    would be impossible here to give more than these few examples, and indeed we
                    scarcely know anything of the subject outside of groups belonging to the
                    Northern hemisphere.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>The

                <p>In a large number of species the Additional Moult is very partial, being often
                    limited to certain portions of the plumage, and it is yet an unsolved problem
                    how far some of the changes to be observed are due to actual Moult and how far
                    to the alteration of colour in the feathers themselves, as also the way by which
                    this alteration of colour is produced, whether, as certainly happens in many
                    instances, by the dropping off of the “barbicels ’’—the fine filaments that
                    fringe the “barbicels” which are arranged on the upper surface of each “barb”
                    composing the web of the feather —or in some other manner. With either of these
                    last considerations we need not now concern ourselves. It is unquestionable that
                    there are innumerable species of birds, the males at least of which put forth in
                    spring decorative plumes unknown at any other season, and it would appear that
                    in the majority of them the feathers which before clothed the parts whence the
                    newly-donned ornaments grow are doffed to make room for these paraphernalia of
                    marriage.</p>

                <p>It remains to be remarked that though the annual Moult commonly takes place so
                    soon as the breeding-season is over, there are plenty of cases where we find the
                    change delayed to a later period of the year. This is so with the Swallow <hi
                    rend="italic">{Hirundo rustica),</hi> which has long been known to moult in
                    midwinter, and it is generally the way with all the Diurnal Birds-of-prey. But
                    unquestionably most birds accomplish the change much earlier, and before they
                    leave their breeding-quarters for their winter-haunts, thereby starting on one
                    of their great annual journeys with all the external machinery of flight renewed
                    and in the best condition for escaping its attendant perils. <hi
