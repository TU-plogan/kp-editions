                    Silesia, and by his enterprise and perseverance in fifteen years he acquired an
                    honourable independence. On the accession of Frederick-William II. he was
                    recalled to military service, and replaced as major in his old regiment, the
                    Black Hussars, where he distinguished himself in six general actions against the
                    French, rose to the rank of colonel and major-general in 1793-4, and gained a
                    high reputation by his energy, promptitude, and foresight. He was in a
                    subordinate command in the disastrous battle of Jena in 1802; but he made a
                    masterly retreat with his column to Lübeck, and extorted the praises of his
                    adversaries, who testified on his capitulation that it was caused by “want of
                    provisions and ammunition.” He was soon exchanged for General Victor, and was
                    actively employed in Pomerania, at Berlin, and at Königsberg, until the
                    conclusion of the war. When Prussia shook off the French yoke in 1813, he first
                    obtained a separate command. At the head of 60,000 troops, chiefly composed of
                    raw militia, he defeated four French marshals at Katsbach, and rapidly crossing
                    the Elbe, materially contributed to the signal victory of Leipsic. In several
                    severe actions he fought his way to Paris, which he entered on 31st March 1814;
                    and there, it has been stated, but for the intervention of the other allied
                    commanders, he was disposed to make a severe retaliation for the calamities that
                    Prussia had suffered from the armies of France. Blowing up the bridge of Jena
                    across the Seine was said to be one of his contemplated acts. When war again
                    broke out in 1815, the veteran was at the head of the Prussian armies in
                    Belgium, and exhibited his wonted enterprise and activity. But partly owing to
                    his own confidence and temerity, partly to the skilful strategy of his
                    celebrated opponent, he was defeated in the severe battle of Ligny on 16th of
                    June; yet, with his characteristic spirit and energy, Blücher rallied his
                    defeated forces, and appeared on the field of Waterloo on the 18th, just as
                    Wellington had repulsed the last attack of Napoleon on the British position. At
                    that critical moment Blücher was seen emerging from the wood of Frichemont on
                    the French right; and the simultaneous irresistible charge of the British forces
                    converted the retreat of the French into a tumultuous flight. The allied
                    commanders met on the Genappes road, near the farm called Maison du Roi, where
                    the British forces were halted. The pursuit was continued through the night by
                    sixteen fresh Prussian regiments with terrible carnage. The allies soon again
                    entered Paris, where Blücher remained for several months; but the health of the
                    aged commander having declined, he retired to his Silesian residence at
                    Kirblowitz, where he died on the 12th September 1819, aged seventy-seven. The
                    life of Blücher has been written by Varnhagen von Ense (1827), Rauschnick
                    (1836), Bieske (1862), and Scherr (1862).</p>
