                    law. At the court of Ferrara, where he enjoyed the favour of Duke Borso d’Este
                    and his successor Hercules,he was entrusted with several honourable employments,
                    and in particular was named governor of Reggio, an appointment which he held in
                    the year 1478. Three years afterwards he was elected captain of Modena, and
                    reappointed governor of the town and citadel of Reggio, where he died in the
                    year 1494, though in what month is uncertain. Almost all his works, and
                    especially his great poem of the <hi rend="italic">Orlando Inamorato,</hi> were
                    composed for the amusement of Duke Hercules and his court, though not written
                    within its precincts. His practice, it is said, was to retire to Scandiano or
                    some other of his estates, and there to devote himself to composition; and
                    Castelvetro, Vallisnieri, Mazzuchelli, and Tiraboschi, all unite in stating that
                    he took care to insert in the descriptions of his poem those of the agreeable
                    environs of his chateau, and that the greater part of the names of his heroes,
                    as Mandricardo, Gradasse, Sacripant, Agramant, and others, were merely the names
                    of some of his peasants, which, from their uncouthness, appeared to him proper
                    to be given to Saracen warriors. Be this as it may, the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Orlando Inamorato</hi> deserves to be considered as one of the most important
                    poems in Italian literature, since it forms the first example of the romantic
                    epic worthy to serve as a model, and, as such, undoubtedly produced the <hi
                    rend="italic">Orlando</hi><hi rend="italic">Furioso.</hi> Gravina and
                    Mazzuchelli have said, and succeeding writers have repeated on their authority,
                    that Boiardo proposed to himself as his model the <hi rend="italic">Iliad</hi>
                    of Homer; that Paris is besieged like the city of Troy; that Angelica holds the
                    place of Helen; and that, in short, the one poem is a sort of reflex image of
                    the other. In point of fact, however, the subject-matter of the poem is derived
                    from the <hi rend="italic">Fabulous Chronicle</hi> of the pseudo-Turpin; though,
                    with the exception of the names of Charlemagne, Roland, Oliver, and some other
                    principal warriors, who necessarily figure as important characters in the
                    various scenes, there is little resemblance between the detailed plot of the one
                    and that of the other. The poem, which Boiardo did not live to finish, was
                    printed at Scandiano the year after his death, under the superintendence of his
                    son Count Camillo The title of the book is without date: but a Latin letter from
                    Antonia Caraffa di Reggio, prefixed to the poem, is dated the kalends of June
                    1495. A second edition, also without date, but which must have been printed
                    before the year 1500, appeared at Venice; and the poem was twice reprinted there
                    during the first twenty years of the 16th century. These editions are the more
                    curious and valuable, that they contain nothing but the text of the author,
                    which is comprised in three books, divided into cantos, the third book being
                    incomplete. But Niccolo degli Agostini, an indifferent poet, had the courage to
                    continue the work commenced by Boiardo, adding to it three books, which were
                    printed at Venice in 1526-1531, in 4to; and since that time no edition of the
                    <hi rend="italic">Orlando</hi> has been printed without the continuation of
                    Agostini, wretched as it unquestionably is. Boiardo’s poem suffers from the
                    incurable defect of a laboured and heavy style. His story is skilfully
                    constructed, the characters are well drawn and sustained throughout; many of the
                    incidents show a power and fertility of imagination not inferior to that of
                    Ariosto, but the perfect workmanship indispensable for a great work of art is
                    wanting. The poem in its original shape was not popular, and has been completely
                    superseded by the <hi rend="italic">Rιfacimento</hi> of Francesco Berni. See <hi
