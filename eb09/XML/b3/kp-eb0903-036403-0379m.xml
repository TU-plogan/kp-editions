                <p><label type="entry">BARBOUR, <hi rend="smallcaps">John</hi></label>, the author
                    of the great Scottish national poem <hi rend="italic">The Bruce,</hi> was born,
                    probably in Aberdeenshire, about the beginning of the 14th century. He was a
                    contemporary of Chaucer and Gower; but so little is known of his life, that the
                    very date of his birth can be only approximately given as about 1316. In 1357,
                    as we learn from a safe-conduct permitting him to visit Oxford for the purpose
                    of study,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi
                    rend="italic">Rotuli Scotice,</hi> i. p. 808.</p></note> he held the position of
                    archdeacon of Aberdeen. In 1364 he was again permitted to enter England for a
                    similar purpose,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi
                    rend="italic">Ibid.,</hi> i. p. 886.</p></note> and in 1368 he received letters
                    of safe-conduct authorizing him to pass through England on his way to
                    France,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi

                    he was proceeding in order to visit the famous university of Paris. From this
                    date to his death, which took place probably in March 1395, notices of him are
                    slightly more numerous. In 1373 he is described as holding the office of clerk
                    of audit of the king’s household.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    busily engaged in the composition of his great work, for, as he himself tells
                    us, his poem was more than half finished in 1375.</p>

                    was in all probability a royal gift on the completion of the work. Barbour seems
                    indeed to have been well treated by his sovereign; he received a perpetual
                    annuity of twenty shillings,<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p><hi rend="italic">Exchequer Rolls,</hi> Nos. 177,

                    payment of a yearly mass to be said for his soul), tithes of the parish of Rayne
                    in the Garioch, and a crown wardship, always a lucrative office in these times.
                    A further bounty of ten pounds a year during life, granted in 1388, was probably
                    a reward on the completion of the poet’s second large work, <hi rend="italic"
                    >The Brute.</hi> The cessation of payment of this annuity enables us to fix with
                    some accuracy the date of Barbour’s death.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">The Bruce,</hi> which is Barbour’s principal poem, although it
                    is almost the sole authority for the events of the period, is not to be
                    considered as merely a rhyming chronicle.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>It contains the earliest notice of the ancient Celtic poetry
                    of Scotland. See Barbour’s <hi rend="italic">Bruce,</hi> p. 43, Jamieson’s
                    ed.</p></note> His theme was freedom and the liberation of his country from the
                    dominion of a foreign people. The age of Bruce was the age of Scottish chivalry,
                    and the king himself presented the most perfect model of a valiant knight. With
                    such a crisis and such a hero, therefore, it is not surprising that Barbour
                    should have achieved a work of lasting fame.</p>
                <p>The poem begins with an account of the succession to the Scottish crown after the
                    death of Alexander III. In this part of his poem Barbour has made a slight
                    anachronism. He makes his hero compete with John Baliol for the crown of
                    Scotland, while it was his grandfather, the Lord of Annandale, who
                    unsuccessfully contested the right. Then follows a lamentable account of the
                    desolation of the country and the oppression of the people by the English.
                    Bruce’s energetic actions to free his country, and his romantic adventures,
                    which form so interesting an episode in Scottish history, are narrated with
                    great minuteness, down to the battle of Bannockburn, which is described with all
                    its interesting details. At this point the national epic properly ends; but
                    Barbour further relates the expedition of Bruce to Ireland, and the exploits of
                    Douglas and Randolph on the borders, and concludes with an account of the deaths
                    of King Robert and his gallant knights.</p>
                <p>The next in order of his writings was that before referred to, called <hi
                    rend="italic">The Brute,</hi> of which it is believed no MS. exists, unless the
                    supposition of Mr Henry Bradshaw, librarian of the university of Cambridge, be
                    correct, that about 2000 lines of two MS. <hi rend="italic">Troy-books,</hi> by
                    Lydgate, preserved in the Cambridge and Bodleian Libraries, form part of this
                    poem. It appears to have comprised a genealogical history of the kings of
                    Scotland, deducing their origin from the great mediaeval hero, Brutus, son of
                    Ascanius, and grandson of Aeneas, supposed to have been the first king of
                    Britain. The existence of such a work is fully established by various passages
                    in Wyntown’s <hi rend="italic">Cronykil.</hi></p>

                <p>The last of the works of Barbour was his <hi rend="italic">Book of Legends of

                <p>The manuscript of this work (which was brought to light a few years ago by Mr
                    Bradshaw) is preserved in the library of the university of Cambridge. The <hi
                    rend="italic">Legends</hi> are contained in a tall, narrow volume of paper,
                    closely written in an unmistakably Scottish hand, containing a great many
                    thousand lines in the usual verse of Barbour. This, taken in connection with
                    certain incidental notices which the writer gives of himself, and certain
                    stories which he tells of what happened in his time, leaves little room for
                    doubt as to the author. The following extract from the account of a cure

                </lg>
                <p>The works of Barbour are interesting in a philological point of view. At one time
                    they were regarded as the first written in what was termed the ancient Scottish,
                    a special language, which was supposed to have been derived directly from the
                    Suio-Gothic, or the Moeso-Gothic of Ulρhilas. The extraordinary circumstance,
                    however, was that Barbour and other early Scottish poets, such as Wyntown, James
                    I., and Lyndsay, speak of the language as “Inglis.” In <hi rend="italic">The
                    Bruce</hi> the following passage occurs :—</p>
                <lg part="N">
                    <l part="N"> “This wes the spek he maid perfay </l>
                    <l part="N"> As is in <hi rend="italic">Ynglis</hi> toung to say.”<note

                </lg>
                <p>It is now generally admitted that these poets wrote in a language founded on the
                    Anglo-Saxon of the northern type, and nearly identical with that spoken in the
                    northern half of England, which was general from the Trent to the Forth, and
                    northwards on the eastern coast as far as Aberdeen. In this extensive district a
                    Doric dialect of English was general, and in the 14th century there was no
                    greater difference between the written language of York and of Eastern Scotland
                    than there is now between the modern speech of Aberdeen and Edinburgh.<note

                    example of the simple, energetic style, which resembled Chaucer's best manner,
                    and wanted little to make it the genuine language of poetry. Simplicity may be
                    said to be the main feature in the plan and conduct of his poems. His story is
                    throughout his first and chief object, and he shows great anxiety lest in any
                    point of the actual adventures he may mislead his reader. He prays that he may
                    say “nought bot suthfast thing,” and he was the first who did so with some of
                    the graces of the fables of romance. He has, however, a heart for every kind of
                    nobleness. His far-famed encomium on political freedom is distinguished by a
                    manly and dignified strain of sentiment :—</p>

                <p>The following passage cannot be passed without particular notice; the annals of
                    heroes furnish but few instances of so pleasing a nature, whether it be that
                    heroes seldom stoop to actions of mere benevolence, or that their historians do
                    not think it of much importance to transmit such actions to posterity :—</p>

                <p>It has been stated that Barbour presents us with but few studiee of natural
                    scenery. His description of spring is, however, worthy of his muse, and
                    contrasts favourably with any of the poetry of the period :—</p>

                    specimen of Barbour’s language is to be found in extracts inserted by Wyntown in
                    his <hi rend="italic">CronyJcil,</hi> which may be set down as belonging to the
                    year 1440.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi

                    valuable manuscript of <hi rend="italic">The Bruce</hi> is preserved in the
                    Advocates’ Library, Edinburgh, which was penned by John Ramsay in 1489. Ramsay
                    is supposed to be the same person that was afterwards prior of the Carthusian
                    monastery at Perth. This transcript is stated to have been executed at the
                    request of Simon Lochmalony, vicar of Moonsie.</p>
                <p>Another manuscript exists in the library of St John’s College, Cambridge, and is
                    dated 1487. The handwriting is very like that of the Advocates’ Library
                    manuscript, and from the initials of the transcriber being J. R., it is supposed
                    that this is another transcript made somewhat earlier by the same scribe. This
                    last manuscript affords perhaps the best readings, but each serves to correct
                    errors and to supply omissions of the other.</p>
                <p>The printed editions are almost a century later. The first known edition of <hi
                    rend="italic">The Bruce</hi> is believed to have been printed at Edinburgh in
                    1570-71, but of this only one imperfect copy is known to exist. The next known
                    edition is that printed at Edinburgh by Andro Hart in 1616, only one copy of
                    which is extant. Another edition was printed by Hart in 1620. Editions were
                    issued by Andrew Anderson, Edinburgh, 1670, 12mo; Robert Saunders, Glasgow,
                    1672; Robert Freebairn, Edinburgh, 1715 or 1716 (issued with a false title page
                    in 1758); Carmichael and Miller, Edinburgh, 1737. John Pinkerton issued an
                    edition in 1790, printed at London, in 3 vols. 8vo, which he styles “the first
                    genuine edition.” It was taken from the Advocates’ Library manuscript, but, as
                    his transcript was executed neither by himself nor under his immediate
                    inspection, many gross inaccuracies were suffered to remain uncorrected. Dr John
                    Jamieson printed an edition at Edinburgh in 1820, in 4to. This was a careful
                    print of the Advocates’ Library manuscript. Mr Cosmo Innes printed an edition
                    for the Spalding Club in 1856. It was made from a collation of the Advocates’
                    Library and the Cambridge manuscripts. The Rev. W. W. Skeat is at present (1875)
                    engaged in editing an edition for the Early English Text Society (extra series),
                    1870-75. This edition is founded on the Cambridge manuscript, carefully collated
                    with the Edinburgh manuscript and with Hart’s edition of 1616, and occasionally
                    with Anderson’s edition of 1670. (j. <hi rend="smallcaps">sm.)</hi></p>
