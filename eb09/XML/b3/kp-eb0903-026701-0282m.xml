                <p><label type="entry">BALANCE OF POWER</label>. The theory of the Balance of Power
                    may be said to have exercised a preponderating influence over the policy of
                    European statesmen for more than two hundred years, that is, from the Treaty of
                    Westphalia until the middle of the present century; and to have been the
                    principal element in the political combinations, negotiations, and wars which
                    marked that long and eventful period of modem history. It deserves, therefore,
                    the attentive consideration of the historical student, and, indeed, the motive
                    cause of many of the greatest occurrences would be unintelligible without a due
                    estimate of its effects. Even down to our own times it has not been without an
                    important influence; for the Crimean War of 1854 was undertaken by England and
                    France for no other object than to maintain the balance of power in Eastern
                    Europe, and to prevent the aggrandisement of Russia by the dismemberment of the
                    Ottoman empire and the conquest of Constantinople. Nevertheless there is,
                    perhaps, no principle of political science, long and universally accepted by the
                    wisest statesmen, on which modem opinion has, within the last twenty years,
                    undergone a greater change; and this change of opinion is not merely
                    speculative, it has regulated and controlled the policy of the most powerful
                    states, and of none more than of Great Britain, in her dealings with the
                    continent of Europe. At the date of the publication of the last edition of this
                    work, the theory of the balance of power was believed to be so firmly
                    established, both by reason and experience, that it was laid down, in the
                    forcible words of Earl Grey, that “the poorest peasant in England is interested
                    in the balance of power, and that this country ought to interfere whenever that
                    balance appeared to be really in danger.” At the present time no English
                    statesman would lay down that proposition categorically; and probably no
                    European statesman would be prepared to act upon it. In proportion as the theory
                    of the balance of power has lost much of its former authority, the doctrine of
                    non-intervention has gained strength and influence, and this has been accepted
                    at the present day both by Whig and Tory ministers, so that no strong difference
                    of opinion can at the present time be said to exist in the British nation on the
                    subject. Within the last fifteen years political changes of extraordinary
                    magnitude have been brought about in Europe by force of arms and by revolutions.
                    In former times such changes would certainly have led to a general war, on the
                    principle that it was essential to maintain the relative strength and
                    independence of states, and to support the fabric of European policy. But, under
                    the policy of non-intervention, the effects of these contests have been confined
                    to the states which were directly engaged in them; and the other powers of
                    Europe have maintained a cautious neutrality, which has probably not lessened
                    their own strength, and which has saved the world from a general
                    conflagration.</p>
                <p>The theory of the balance of power rested on several assumptions. It was held,
                    more especially from the time of Grotius, in the early part of the 17th century,
                    that the states of Europe formed one grand community or federal league, of which
                    the fundamental principle and condition was the preservation of the balance of
                    power; that by this balance (in the words of Vattel) was to be understood such a
                    disposition of things, as that no one potentate or state shall be able
                    absolutely to predominate and prescribe laws to the others; that all were
                    equally interested in maintaining this common settlement, and that it was the
                    interest, the right, and the duty of every power to interfere, even by force of
                    arms, when any of the conditions of this settlement were infringed or assailed
                    by any other member of the community. The principle can hardly be more tersely
                    expressed than in the words of Polybius (lib. i. cap. 83): “Neque enim ejusmodi
                    principia contemnere oportet, neque tanta cuiquam astruenda est potentia, ut cum
                    eo postea de tuo quamvis manifesto jure disceptare ex aequo non queas.” Or, to
                    borrow the language of Fénelon in his <hi rend="italic">Instructions,</hi> drawn
                    up by him for the guidance of the Duc de Bourgogne, “This attention to maintain
                    a sort of equality and equipoise between neighbouring nations is the security of
                    the general tranquillity. In this respect all neighbouring nations, trading with
                    each other, form one great body and a sort of community. Thus, Christendom is a
                    kind of universal republic, which has its interests, its fears, and its
                    precautions to be taken. All the members <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit03newyrich/page/n283/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0903-0283-0268"/> of this great body owe it to one another for the
                    common good, and owe it to themselves for the security of their country, to
                    prevent the progress of any other members who should seek to overthrow this
                    balance, which would turn to the certain ruin of all the other members of the
                    same body. Whatever changes or affects this general system of Europe is too
                    dangerous, and draws after it infinite mischiefs.” Whatever may be the value of
                    these philanthropic principles, history reminds us that when they were most
                    loudly professed they were most frequently violated, and that no cause of war
                    seems to have been so frequent or so fatal as the spurious pretext of restoring
                    peace and defending the general tranquillity of the world. Thus, it was to
                    balance the power of the house of Austria that Cardinal Richelieu flung France
                    into the quarrels of Germany in the Thirty Years’ War, and even lent her aid to
                    the Protestant cause. It was to balance the encroaching and aggressive power of
                    Louis XIV. that numerous combinations were formed between England, Austria, and
                    Holland, which, after nearly half a century of almost uninterrupted contests and
                    bloodshed, ended in the peace of Utrecht. The pretext of Frederick II., when he
                    was meditating some act of rapine, generally was that he believed some hostile
                    combination had been formed against him, which it was wise to anticipate. In
                    short, no cause of war has been more frequently alleged and acted upon, than
                    that a proper consideration for the balance of power rendered it necessary to
                    take forcible measures to avert some remote or hypothetical danger.</p>
                <p>It is obviously a maxim, not only of policy but of common sense and human nature,
                    that the weak should combine to protect themselves against the strong, and that
                    when the independence of minor states is threatened by the ambition or the
                    overwhelming superiority of a power aiming at universal empire, they will do
                    wisely to unite for the purposes of self-defence and resistance. Frederick II.
                    himself says, in his <hi rend="italic">Anti-Machiavel,</hi> where he laid down
                    precepts which he did not practise, “When the excessive aggrandisement of one
                    power threatens to overwhelm all others, it is the part of wisdom to oppose
                    barriers to its encroachments, whilst there is yet time to stay the torrent. The
                    clouds are seen to gather, the lightning announces a coming storm, and the
                    sovereign who is unable to contend against the tempest will, if he is wise,
                    unite himself with all those who are menaced by the same common danger. Had the
                    kings of Egypt, Syria, and Macedonia confederated together against the Roman
                    power, they would not have fallen under its oppressive yoke; an alliance
                    prudently contracted, and a war carried on with energy, would have saved the
                    ancient world from universal despotism.” So too, Hume, in his celebrated <hi
                    rend="italic">Essay on the Balance of Power,</hi> endeavours to show that the
                    ancients were familiar with the principle both as statesmen and historians, and,
                    for example, he avers that whoever will read Demosthenes’s oration for the
                    Megalopolitans, will see the utmost refinements on this principle that ever
                    entered into the head of a Venetian or European speculatist.</p>
                <p>But with great respect to these illustrious authorities, they appear to have
                    discussed, under the name of the balance of power, a principle which might more
                    fitly be termed a theory of warlike alliances. The object of the balance of
                    power, rightly understood, is not to carry on war with success, but to avoid war
                    altogether, by establishing a common interest and obligation in the maintenance
                    of the conditions of peace. When war is declared, public law is suspended, and
                    each state must be guided by what it conceives to be its own interest and duty.
                    If the theory of the balance of power has any value at all, it is not in the
                    hour of violence and bloodshed, when the fate of nations may be decided on a
                    field of battle, but rather in those negotiations which must eventually
                    terminate the contest, which commonly bring together for that purpose the
                    representatives of all the belligerents, and which are designed to provide
                    against the recurrence of these calamities.</p>
                <p>The ablest and most eloquent champion of the system of equipoise in the present
                    century was the Chevalier von Gentz, who published his <hi rend="italic"
                    >Fragments upon the Balance of Power in Europe</hi> in 1806, under the influence
                    of the catastrophe which had subjugated the Continent, and who subsequently took
                    an active part at the Congress of Vienna in the attempts to constitute a new
                    system of European policy. Gentz defines the balance of power as “a constitution
                    subsisting between neighbouring states more or less connected with one another,
                    by virtue of which no one among them can injure the independence or essential
                    rights of another, without meeting with effectual resistance on some side, and
                    consequently exposing itself to danger.” And he rests this constitution on four
                    propositions :—(1.) That no state must ever become so powerful as to coerce all
                    the rest; (2.) That every state which infringes the conditions is liable to be
                    coerced by the others; (3.) That the fear of coercion should keep all within the
                    bounds of moderation; and (4.) That a state having attained a degree of power to
                    defy the union should be treated as a common enemy. He argues that by a strict
                    adherence to these principles wars would be averted, excessive power restrained,
                    and the independent existence of the humblest members of the confederacy
                    secured. But, for the reasons we have previously assigned, it is a fallacy to
                    suppose that even the civilised states of Europe have ever naturally formed a
                    confederacy, or that their relations are governed by common rules of action,
                    recognised alike by all of them. That theory supplies a very insecure basis for
                    the balance of power and the maintenance of peace. The law of nations, not being
                    imposed or sanctioned by any supreme and sovereign authority, is, in fact,
                    reducible to the general laws' of morality, which ought to regulate the dealings
                    of mankind, except when it has been expressed and established in the form of a
                    contract, binding on all the parties to that obligation. To determine the true
                    character and limits of the balance of power, we must have recourse, not to
                    vague general principles, but to positive law, framed in the shape of
                    international contracts, which are termed treaties, and which have been
                    sanctioned at different epochs of modern history by a congress of states. This
                    historical treatment of the subject leads us to more tangible and solid ground;
                    and it will be seen that on these occasions more especially attempts have been
                    made to establish a balance of power in Europe upon the basis of general
                    treaties; and that these attempts have been rewarded by considerable, though not
                    by permanent, success in the 17th, 18th, and 19th centuries.</p>
                <p>The first idea of a general congress, to put an end to the horrors of the Thirty
                    Years’ War, and to adjust the conflicting claims of rival creeds and hostile
                    princes, appears to have originated with the emperor of Germany in 1640. The
                    attempt to restore peace by the authority of the Germanic Diet had failed. It
                    became necessary to have recourse to mediating powers, and after a protracted
                    preliminary negotiation, the Congress of Münster or Westphalia opened on the
                    11th July 1643,—the Catholic and Protestant belligerents being represented on
                    the one hand, and the mediating powers, France, Sweden, Venice, and the Pope, on
                    the other. We do not propose in this place to follow the train of these
                    complicated negotiations. It is enough for our present purpose to remark that
                    the great treaty which resulted from them, and was signed on the 24th October
                    1648, became the basis of the public law of Europe, and the first official
                    recognition, of the existence of a European balance of power. The conditions
                    established <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit03newyrich/page/n284/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0903-0284-0269"/> in Germany left the Catholic, the Lutheran, and
                    the Reformed Churches in possession of their respective independence, whilst
                    they relieved the minor princes from their strict dependence on the empire; but,
                    above all. they conferred on France and Sweden, as mediating powers, the right
                    of intervention for the purpose of upholding the provisions of the treaty. In
                    other words, the balance which had been established between the states of
                    Central Europe was regulated by external weights, which could be brought to bear
                    upon it. The result of this combination, due mainly to Cardinal Mazarin, was
                    certainly injurious to the unity and independence of Germany, and it tended to
                    aid the aggressive and dictatorial power of Louis XIV. Nevertheless, the
                    fundamental principles of the Treaty of Westphalia were recognised and renewed
                    as the conditions of the general peace of Europe down to the French Revolution;
                    they were not wholly absent from the minds of the negotiators at Vienna in 1815;
                    and they only received their death-blow from the hand of the Prussian Government
                    in 1866 and 1870. Whatever might be the merits of the Treaty of Westphalia, it
                    had not that of securing to Europe an unbroken or durable peace; and even the
                    territorial relations of France and Germany were altered within thirty years of
                    that time by the conquest of Franche Comté and Alsace. But the wars of Louis
                    XIV. were not general wars, until he engaged in the fatal attempt to place his
                    grandson on the throne of Spain, and to unite the two crowns in the house of
                    Bourbon. Efforts had been made, in view of the approaching extinction of the
                    Spanish branch of the house of Austria, to preserve the balance of power by a
                    timely partition of the vast dominions of the Spanish empire—a remarkable
                    example of an attempt to prevent a formidable catastrophe by an equitable
                    arrangement. But it may be doubted whether any arrangement in which so little
                    account was taken of the wishes and traditions of nations could possibly have
                    succeeded; and it unquestionably failed, because Louis XIV. did not hesitate to
                    repudiate the treaties he had signed, and to avail himself of the last will and
                    testament of Charles II., which had been extorted from the Spanish court by his
                    intrigues. That event raised again the whole question of the balance of power in
                    Europe. It was received as a doctrine of political faith that the union of the
                    French and Spanish crowns in one family must be fatal to the independence of all
                    other states; that it would replace the Stuarts upon the throne of England, and
                    establish the ascendency of France and the Catholic party over Europe. It was
                    therefore resisted by a coalition, of which England, Austria, and Holland were
                    the principal members. France was at length reduced to the lowest point of
                    humiliation, and in 1709 peace might have been obtained on every point but one.
                    Louis refused to turn his arms against his own grandson, and the war continued
                    till 1715. Philip V. retained the Spanish crown, and the relations of all the
                    European states were once more adjusted with legal nicety at Utrecht. Great
                    pains were taken to provide, by a system of renunciations, against the
                    possibility of the union of the crowns of France and Spain on the same head,
                    because it was held that such a contingency would be fatal to the balance of
                    power in Europe. But these precautions did not prevent the conclusion, at a
                    later period, of the family compact between the two branches of the house of
                    Bourbon, which was regarded as a lasting danger to other countries, and was
                    opposed by the whole strength of Britain and the genius of Chatham. The peace of
                    Utrecht was denounced by Parliament and detested by the nation as an inglorious
                    termination of a glorious war, and its authors were consigned to obloquy and
                    exile; but it secured the peace of Europe for thirty years; it reduced the power
                    of France; and had it not been for the German dominions of the house of Hanover,
                    it might have been still longer before England was drawn into another war.</p>
                <p>Hitherto the political system of Europe had comprised little more than the states
                    of France, Austria, Spain, Sweden, and Holland, with the occasional intervention
                    of Great Britain, more for the defence of the interests of others than of her
                    own. But the 18th century witnessed a total change in the politics of the world.
                    A new empire, Russia, arose in the north, under the genius of Peter and of
                    Catherine; the ambition and military skill of Frederick II. raised Prussia from
                    a secondary member of the German empire to a powerful and independent kingdom;
                    the colonial empires of Spain, France, and Britain had extended their
                    territorial interests to the continents of Asia and America, and to the eastern
                    and the western isles, insomuch that wars, begun in Europe, soon raged on the
                    banks of the Ganges and the St Lawrence; and the declaration of independence of
                    the United States of America called into beiDg a new and powerful people of the
                    future. The partition of Poland, which was commenced in 1772, marked a new era
                    of aggressive revolutionary policy; it was a gross invasion of the principle of
                    the balance of power, effected by three powers, jealous of their respective
                    strength, but indifferent to the rights of an independent nation and to the
                    opinion of Europe.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>It
                    deserves to be noticed that down to the partition of Poland, no state,however
                    small,had been extinguished, annihilated,and “annexed” in the continuous wars of
                    the two previous centuries—down to the republics of Geneva and San Marino all
                    retained their national existence. The wars of the French Revolution, and still
                    more the wars of our own times, have swept a multitude of the minor states and
                    dynasties from the map of Europe, and incorporated them in larger
                    empires.</p></note> That lawless act was the prelude to more violent attacks on
                    the sovereignty and nationality of many countries, for before the century closed
                    the French Revolution, and the wars that followed it, crushed to atoms the
                    ancient fabric of Europe. Whilst events of this magnitude were occurring in the
                    world, it is obvious that the theory of the balance of power was entirely
                    displaced and dislocated. New elements were at work over a far wider area; new
                    sources of power and influence were opened of far more importance than those
                    territorial and dynastic questions which occupied the statesmen of Münster and
                    of Utrecht; ancient land-marks were swept away; minor states were annihilated;
                    and the temporary domination of Napoleon over a great portion of the continent
                    of Europe seemed to have overthrown the balance of power for ever. In those dark
                    and evil days pubhc writers like Gentz and Mackintosh still maintained the
                    principle that peace could only be restored by a due recognition of the rights
                    and independence of every nation, and England adhered inflexibly to the policy
                    of combining the scattered elements of Europe against the common enemy. Half a
                    dozen times over these coalitions failed; but they succeeded at last, and this
                    country had the glory of playing no inconsiderable part in the restoration of
                    the liberties of all other nations against foreign aggression. Great as were the
                    cost and the burden of that tremendous war, we still hold that the prodigious
                    power of France and the boundless ambition of Napoleon left us no honourable
                    alternative but to pursue it; and, as Mr Fox himself discovered when he
                    conducted the negotiations of 1806, it was impossible to conclude peace with
                    France without basely surrendering the whole interests of Europe to universal
                    oppression, and without exposing this country to be at last the victim of a
                    power which had devoured all the rest. The principle of the balance of power, in
                    the sense of mutual defence, was never asserted with greater energy than it was
                    by this country in that struggle, and we do not regret it. “As long,” says
                    Bacon, “as men are men, and as long as reason is reason, a just fear will be a
                    just cause of a preventive war; but <pb break="no"

                <p>Upon the fall of Napoleon in 1814 it became the common interest, and the
                    universal desire, of all the sovereigns and nations of Europe to restore peace
                    upon a settled basis, to re-establish the authority of public law, to reinstate
                    the rightful owners in the possessions and dominions they had been forcibly
                    deprived of, to reduce the military establishments which weighed so heavily on
                    the finances and on the population of Europe, and to create anew a balance of
                    power between the states of Europe, by which the greatest of them might be
                    restrained and the least of them protected. A secret article had been annexed to
                    the Treaty of Paris, declaring that “the allied powers had agreed among
                    themselves on the bases which were to be given to the future system of
                    equilibrium;” though what the nature of that agreement and of those bases was,
                    has never been made clearly apparent. But the matter was unquestionably referred
                    to the congress then about to open at Vienna, where the most powerful sovereigns
                    and the most distinguished ministers of all the European states met for the
                    first time in council. That congress was certainly the most complete, and in its
                    action the most important, assemblage of independent political powers and their
                    representatives which ever took place in the world. Its decisions were not all
                    of them just, or wise, or disinterested. The broad general principles of
                    pacification which had been laid down were more than once traversed and thwarted
                    by particular interests and ambitions. The theory of the rights of legitimate
                    sovereigns over their subjects was carried to an extravagant point, pregnant
                    with danger for the future. Genoa was transferred to Sardinia, Venice to
                    Austria, Norway to Sweden, Poland to Russia, part of Saxony to Prussia, and the
                    sacred hopes and pledges of freedom which had animated the nations in the
                    contest were forgotten by the leading courts of Europe in the division of the
                    spoil. But in spite of these shortcomings and abuses, we cannot concur with
                    writers who, like Hardenberg, denounce the Congress of Vienna as an auction of
                    nations and an orgy of kings. It was said that every one withdrew from the
                    Congress of Vienna disappointed, no one having obtained as much as he expected;
                    but if so, that would suggest the inference that the general interest of Europe
                    prevailed over the pretensions of each particular state. From the point of view
                    we are now considering, which is the restoration of the balance of power, it
                    cannot be denied that the Treaties of Vienna secured forty years of peace to
                    Europe. They stood the brunt of two fresh convulsions in France in 1830 and in
                    1848, and their main provisions, though modified with respect to the Low
                    Countries in 1832, and abrogated in Italy by the campaign of 1859, were not
                    seriously impaired until the dissolution of the Germanic body in 1866, and the
                    Franco-German War of 1870. During the whole of this period the warlike ambition
                    of France, and the disposition of Russia to overawe Central Europe, were
                    successfully held in check. At Vienna itself, and during the congress, the
                    struggle was close and sometimes doubtful. Russia was resolved to retain the
                    whole of Poland, which she occupied with her armies, and Prussia claimed the
                    whole of Saxony as a compensation for her share of the Polish provinces. To
                    counteract this combination of Russia and Prussia, an alliance was signed on the
                    3d January 1815 between Austria, England, and France, which might have led to
                    hostilities between those powers and their recent allies. Perhaps it was
                    fortunate that the return of Napoleon from Elba broke up the congress, and
                    reminded all the powers that union and mutual concessions were the first duties
                    of those who had devoted themselves to the cause of law, order, and peace. It
                    was a sign of the wisdom of the congress, and of its respect for sound
                    principles, that although France was the vanquished power and the author of the
                    calamities of Europe, she was treated at Vienna with as much consideration as
                    any other state. Her ambassador, Μ. de Talleyrand, had his full weight in the
                    congress; and no attempt was made in 1814 to curtail her ancient territorial
                    possessions or to lower her rank in Europe. On the contrary, the just influence
                    of France was recognised as an essential condition of the balance of power.</p>
                <p>For the first time, then, by this general act of the Congress of Vienna, the
                    territorial possessions and frontiers of the Continental states were defined in
                    one document, to which all the Governments of Europe were parties; the
                    constitution of the Germanic body was incorporated in the same instrument, and
                    the neutrality and independence of the smallest cities and commonwealths were
                    established and guaranteed. Every state in Europe had therefore an equal right
                    and interest to invoke the authority of the treaty, and to claim the execution
                    of all its conditions. A complete fabric of European polity, such as had never
                    existed before, was thus literally established by mutual contract; and every
                    infraction of it might justly be brought under the consideration of the high
                    contracting parties, or might even have been the ground of a declaration of war.
                    In several instances this controlling power was wisely and beneficially
                    exercised, and more than one burning question was adjusted by the conferences
                    which met from time to time, always on the basis of the treaties of 1815. This
                    certainly was the nearest approach ever made to a practical balance of power;
                    and we owe to it, as we have seen, a long period of mutual confidence, respect
                    for public law, and peace, which contributed enormously to the progress,
                    prosperity, and happiness of the world.</p>
                <p>But there are darker shades to the picture. The comprehensive interest which
                    every state was thus held to have acquired in maintaining the general settlement
                    might be held, and was held, to justify a dangerous and mischievous degree of
                    intervention in the internal affairs of every other country, and this right was
                    too often exercised in a manner injurious to liberty and independence. The
                    northern powers, not content with the terms of the general alliance and the
                    Treaties of Vienna, proceeded to connect themselves more closely by the mystic
                    ties of the Holy Alliance, which provided that they were to act together on all
                    subjects, and to regard their interests as one and indivisible. The construction
                    they put upon the system recently established in Europe was that it gave the
                    allied powers a right to interfere, not only for the prevention of quarrels,
                    aggressions, and war, but in the internal government of states, for the purpose
                    of preventing changes which they chose to regard as injurious to their own
                    security and eventually to the balance of power. At the congresses and
                    conferences of Troppau, Carlsbad, Aix-la-Chapelle, and Verona, these doctrines
                    were avowed and acted upon to their furthest extent, and under pretence of
                    maintaining and defending the common interests of Europe, the popular movements
                    and constitutional progress of Italy were crushed, a French army entered Spain
                    in 1823 to restore the authority of Ferdinand VII. against the Cortes, and even
                    the independence of the South American colonies was represented as a blow to the
                    peace and security of Europe. The British Government had early perceived that
                    the interpretation thus given to the theory of the balance of power, and to what
                    was termed the federal system in Europe, was only another name for an
                    intolerable oppression, and that the right of intervention in the internal
                    affairs of other countries <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit03newyrich/page/n286/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0903-0286-0271"/> was claimed and exercised under false and
                    dangerous pretexts. The duke of Wellington, who represented this country at the
                    Congress of Verona, under instructions framed by Lord Castlereagh, was the first
                    to declare that England could be no party to such an application of the theory
                    of the alliance, and that this country preferred isolation to any such system of
                    combined policy. That was the germ of the modern doctrine of non-intervention.
                    But as long as the Treaties of Vienna lasted, it was our duty and our right to
                    endeavour to support their authority, and to vindicate the rights established by
                    a compact to which this country was a party. We declined in 1852 to join with
                    Prussia in enforcing the declaration made by the allied powers in 1815, which
                    excluded any member of the family of Bonaparte from the throne of France; but we
                    sought, in conjunction with France, to protest against the annihilation of the
                    kingdom of Poland, the incorporation of Cracow, the admission of non-German
                    provinces into the confederation, and the invasion of Schleswig <hi
                    rend="italic">; and we</hi> opposed the annexation of Savoy and Nice to France,
                    but alone and without effect. The compact of Vienna was gradually set aside and
                    violated in the course of years by those who were most interested in maintaining
                    it; and when the Emperor Napoleon III. proposed, in 1863, a new congress for the
                    purpose of revising and re-establishing the balance of power in Europe, under
                    the name of an International Council, England refused to be a party to the
                    negotiation, and rejected the scheme. Lord Russell replied, “There being no
                    supreme authority in such an assembly to enforce the decision of the majority,
                    the congress would probably separate, leaving many of its members on worse terms
                    with each other than they had been before.” This was the last attempt made to
                    bring the authority of a congress, representing the collective authority of
                    Europe, to bear on questions affecting the general peace. When this point was
                    reached it was apparent that the whole theory of the confederated system in
                    Europe had become, for a time at least, obsolete; that the treaties and mutual
                    guarantees on which that system rested had lost their power; and that there was
                    no controlling force to resist the ambitious or warlike designs of any state
                    capable of giving effect to them. The Italian campaign of 1859 had considerably
                    altered the condition of Southern Europe, and weakened Austria. Possibly,
                    Prussia, in withholding her assistance at that time from her federal ally,
                    foresaw in the defeat of Austria an event favourable to her own future
                    pretensions. At any rate, for the first time, a war seriously affecting the
                    balance of power was begun and ended by the two principal belligerents alone,
                    and even the price paid by the house of Sardinia for the services of France—the
                    cession of Savoy and Nice—was tacitly acquiesced in by Europe. Twenty years
                    before, it would have been thought impossible that the doctrine of
                    non-intervention should have acquired so great an ascendency.</p>
                <p>But the consequences of this novel state of affairs soon became manifest in the
                    increasing disintegration of Europe. No state could have a greater claim than
                    Denmark to the protection of the principles of the balance of power, for, as
                    late as 1852, all the great powers had pledged themselves by treaty to maintain
                    the integrity of her dominions, the unity of the monarchy, and the order of
                    succession to the crown which was then established. Yet in 1864 the German
                    powers proceeded to what was termed a Federal Execution against her; Holstein,
                    Lauenberg, and, eventually, Schleswig were torn from her by Prussia, Austria
                    acting a subordinate part. England in vain appealed by her diplomacy to the
                    terms of the agreement of 1852, but France and Russia stood aloof, and the
                    greatest injustice the world had witnessed since the partition of Poland was
                    consummated. As every event in political life is closely connected, Prussia now
                    proceeded to ally herself with the crown of Italy against Austria, and to
                    execute her grand design of the overthrow of the Germanic Confederation and the
                    expulsion of Austria from that body, which had been regarded as the centre of
                    gravity of the European system. As long as that body subsisted, war was
                    impossible between its respective members, and France was incapable of attacking
                    their united forces. The success of Prussia in the campaign of 1866 was rapid
                    and complete, and Austria ceased to form part of the Germanic Confederation. The
                    power of Prussia was further increased by the military conventions, which gave
                    her the absolute command over the armies of the minor German states. This was
                    undoubtedly the severest blow which had yet been inflicted on the balance of
                    power in Europe; and the Emperor Napoleon III., who had recently given vent to
                    his dissatisfaction with the treaties of 1815, now found himself confronted by
                    an enemy infinitely more powerful and dangerous. The results of Sadowa were as
                    fatal to the influence and security of France as if she herself had lost a
                    campaign. The French nation, however, failed to understand the magnitude of the
                    danger, though they were irritated by the approach of it. War was, on more than
                    one occasion, on the point of breaking out; and at length France plunged into it
                    with a recklessness and incapacity only to be equalled by the tremendous
                    calamities that war caused her to endure. Again, no third state was drawn by
                    political considerations into the conflict. The terms of peace were settled
                    between the vanquished and the conquerors without reference to the general
                    interests of other nations <hi rend="italic">; and no</hi> attempt has been made
                    to place these arrangements under the sanction of the public law of Europe.
                    Russia took advantage of the agitated condition of Western Europe to abrogate,
                    by her own will and pleasure, an important stipulation of the Treaty of Peace of
                    1856, and Europe again submitted to this breach of covenant.</p>
                <p>The general result is that, at the present time, the military power of the German
                    empire far surpasses that of any other state, and could only be resisted by a
                    general combination of all the rest. The balance of power, as it was understood
                    fifty years ago, and down to a more recent time, has been totally destroyed; no
                    alliances can be said to exist between any of the great powers, but each of them
                    follows a distinct course of policy, free from any engagements to the rest,
                    except on some isolated points; the minor states can appeal to no certain
                    engagement or fixed general principle for protection, except, perhaps, as far as
                    the neutrality of Switzerland and Belgium is concerned; and for the last two
                    centuries there has not been a time at which all confidence in public
                    engagements and common principles of international law has been so grievously
                    shaken. Where the reign of law ends, the reign of force begins, and we trace the
                    inevitable consequence of this dissolution of legal international ties in the
                    enormous augmentation of military establishments, which is the curse and the
                    disgrace of the present age. Every state appears to feel that its security
                    depends on arming the whole virile population, and maintaining in what is called
                    a state of peace all the burdens of a complete armament; indeed, in the most
                    barbarous ages and the most sanguinary wars there were, doubtless, fewer men
                    under arms, and less money was spent in arming them, than at the present
                    day.</p>
                <p>We have shown in the preceding observations that we do not retain the faith of
                    our forefathers in the balance of power. It is impossible to equalise the
                    strength of nations. It is impossible to regulate or control the growth and
                    development of their forces, which depend not on territorial possessions alone,
                    but on their industry, their credit, their natural resources, and their internal
                    institutions. It is <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit03newyrich/page/n287/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0903-0287-0272"/> impossible to weigh their relative power and
                    influence in nice or golden scales, nor can we always compel them “parcere
                    subjectis et debellare superbos.” But the recognition of certain mutual
                    obligations and principles of public law is the fundamental condition of
                    civilisation itself. Nothing can be more injurious to society than that the
                    states of Europe should exist without alliances, without mutual confidence,
                    without a common system based on the principles of justice and of peace, the
                    weak living in dread of the strong, the strong armed to the teeth against each
                    other. We trust that before another great catastrophe arises from this state of
                    disguised hostility, a truer balance of power may be established by a return to
                    sounder principles; for peace can never be secure unless it is protected by the
                    concurrence of the leading nations of the world, and by their determination to
                    oppose a combined resistance to those who have no object but their own
                    aggrandisement and ambition. <hi rend="smallcaps">(h. k.)</hi></p>
