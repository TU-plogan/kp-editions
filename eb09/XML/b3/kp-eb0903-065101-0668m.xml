                <p>The term Bibliography has passed through different meanings. The <hi
                    rend="italic">βιβλιόγραφος</hi> of the Greeks, like the <hi rend="italic"
                    >librarius</hi> of the Romans, was a mere copyist. When the name <hi
                    rend="italic">bibliographie</hi> was adopted by the French, it was used, as late
                    as the middle of the last century, to signify skill in deciphering and judging
                    of ancient manuscripts. Its special application to printed books may be said to
                    date from the <hi rend="italic">Bibliographie</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Instructive</hi> of De Bure in 1763; not that he appears to have coined the new
                    meaning of the term, but his work first popularized the study which the growth
                    of libraries and the commerce in literature had created.</p>
                <p>Bibliography, thus understood, may be defined as the science of books, having
                    regard to their description and proper classification. Viewing books simply as
                    vehicles of learning, it would undoubtedly be correct to extend our inquiry to
                    the period when the only books, so called, were manuscripts. And such is, in
                    fact, the view adopted by bibliographers like Peignot, Namur, and Hartwell
                    Horne. But a survey so extensive is open to practical objections. In the first
                    place, bibliography as a science was unknown until long after printing had laid
                    its first foundations, and indeed made it a necessity, with requirements
                    increasing with the multiplied productions of the press. The materials for
                    comparative study were wanting in an age when books were regarded as isolated
                    treasures, to be bought at prices corresponding with their scarcity. In the
                    second place, the critical study and comparison of ancient manuscripts, their
                    distribution into families deduced from one or more archetypes, and the
                    investigation of ancient systems of writing, embrace a subject so wide in its
                    scope and special in its character, that convenience of treatment, confirmed as
                    it is by the facts of history, would alone suggest the propriety of
                    distinguishing between manuscript and printed bibliography. This distinction it
                    is here proposed to observe, the subject of MSS. being reserved for the article
                    <hi rend="smallcaps">Palaeography,</hi> the name which in its maturity it
                    received.</p>
                <p>Amid much variety of treatment in detail, two main divisions underlie the general
                    study of bibliography, viz., <hi rend="italic">material</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">literary,</hi> according as books are regarded with reference to
                    their form or their substance. The former belongs chiefly to the bookseller and
                    book-collector; the latter to the literary man and the scholar. Material
                    bibliography treats of what Savigny terms the “äussere Bücher wesen,” or the
                    external characteristics of books, their forms, prices and rarity, the names of
                    the printers, the date and place of publication, and the history of particular
                    copies or editions. It involves a knowledge of typography, not, indeed, as a
                    mechanical process, but in its results, and, in fact, of all the constituent
                    part of books, as a means of identifying particular productions. Its full
                    development is due to the gradual formation of a technical science of books.
                    Considerations of buying and selling, which were first reduced to a system in
                    Holland, and afterwards advanced to their present complete form in France and
                    England, gave an impetus to this branch of bibliography. The growth of private
                    libraries, especially during the last century in France, promoted a passion
                    among rich amateurs for rare and curious books; and literary antiquarians began
                    to study those extrinsic circumstances, apart from the merit of their contents,
                    which went to determine their marketable value, and to reveal the elements of
                    rarity.</p>
                <p>Literary, or, as it is sometimes called, intellectual bibliography treats of
                    books by their contents, and of their connection in a literary point of view. It
                    has been subdivided into <hi rend="italic">pure</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >applied,</hi> according as its functions became more complex with the spread of
                    printed books and the increasing requirements of learning. Catalogues expanded
                    into dictionaries, whose object was to acquaint literary men with the most
                    important works in every branch of learning. Books were accordingly classified
                    by their contents, and the compiler had to distinguish between degrees of
                    relative utility, so that students might know what books to select. This duty,
                    which devolved in mos* cases on men of learning, has led French writers in
                    particular to exaggerate the province of bibliography. “La bibliographie,” says
                    Achard, “étant la plus étendue de toutes les sciences, semble devoir les
                    renfermer toutes; ’* and Peignot describes it under his proposed title of <hi
                    rend="italic">Bibliologie,</hi> as “la plus vaste et la plus universelle de
                    toutes les connaissances humaines.” We know of no excuse for such pretensions
                    beyond this, that books represent, in its transmissible form, the sum total of
                    all kinds of knowledgo. The bibliographer has to determine the genuineness, not
                    the authenticity of a book; its identity of authorship or publication, not the
                    correctness of its contents. When he pronounces judgment on its intrinsic merits
                    he usurps the office of the critic. Some works, indeed,—like Bailiet’s <hi
                    rend="italic">Jugemens des Savans,</hi><hi rend="italic">sur les Principaux
                    Ouvrages des</hi><hi rend="italic">Auteurs,</hi> augmentés par Μ. de la Monnoye,

                    >Censura</hi><hi rend="italic">Literaria of</hi> Sir Egerton Brydges, 10 vols.,
                    1805-9,—are collections of critical bibliography of extreme value to the
                    literary historian; but there is a wide difference in design between
                    compilations even of this kind and works devoted to original criticism. In like
                    manner the proper objects of classification have been neglected by many
                    bibliographers, who have indulged in refinements of method, not as a means of
                    facilitating reference, but for the purpose of illustrating a philosophical
                    system of learning. Pretensions such as these, have, unfortunately, done much to
                    discredit bibliography as a science of practical application, by investing it
                    with a false air of mystery, and exposing it to the charge of empiricism. Its
                    real value, in a literary aspect, depends on the recognition of its purpose as
                    ancillary to the study of literature; not, in short, as an end, but as a means
                    to the attainment of knowledge, by the investigation of its sources.</p>
                <p>France must be regarded as the real mother of bibliography.<note anchored="true"

                    which book-collections first began on a large scale, and that country can boast
                    of names like Magliabecchi, Apostolo Zeno, Bandini, Audiffredi, Mazzuchelli, and
                    Morelli, besides provincial works like Moreni’s <hi rend="italic">Bibliografia
                    della Toscana,</hi> and Gamba’s <hi rend="italic">Serie di Testi.</hi> But the
                    labours of French bibliographers, especially after Naudé, converted a study,
                    more or less desultory, into a science and a systematic pursuit. In Germany,
                    poor in public and almost destitute of private libraries, bibliography has been
                    studied almost exclusively in its literary aspect. Belgium has shown much recent
                    activity; but neither Holland, Spain, nor Portugal can show any modern work of
                    importance. In England the paucity of bibliographers is the more to be regretted
                    from the wealth of her resources. Richard de Bury, in his <hi rend="italic"
                    >Philobiblion,</hi> had descanted on the charms of book-collecting as early as
                    the 14th century; but Blount’s <hi rend="italic">Censura,</hi> published in

                    wh03e <hi rend="italic">British Librarian</hi> first appeared in 1737 but was
                    never completed, was among the first in this country to divert the public taste
                    from an exclusive attention to new books, by making the merit of old ones the
                    subject of critical discussion; and Maittaire, who was second master of
                    Westminster School, and who died in 1747, first established the study of
                    bibliography in England on a solid basis. The labours of Dibdin we shall have
                    occasion frequently to refer to; they mark a new phase of bibliography in
                    England which followed the opening up of the Continent after the great war with
                    France. The science in America has been cultivated only recently; but the names
                    of Cogswell, Ticknor, and Jewett are already well-known to bibliographers.</p>
                <p>I <hi rend="italic">The Constituent Parts of Books, and Differences of
                    Editions.</hi></p>
                <p>The history of the materials used for early manuscripts— a subject fruitful in
                    research—lies outside the limits we have proposed for bibliography as the study
                    of printed literature. Fortunately for the spread of books, in the modern sense
                    of the term, the invention of printing was preceded by the important discovery
                    of the art of making paper from linen rags. The precise date of this discovery
                    is not known, nor are writers agreed as to the country in which it was made; but
                    it seems to be ascertained that this kind of paper was in general use in Europe
                    before the end of the 14th century. Caxton and the other early English printers
                    appear to have used paper of foreign manufacture. Such questions, among others,
                    as the relative priority of different editions, or the productions of different
                    presses, are frequently to be determined by a comparison of the constituent
                    elements of the books themselves; but the subject is too technical to be noticed
                    in detail. The question as to the origin of printing belongs strictly to a
                    consideration of that art; but as its history and its progress are illustrated
                    by the productions of different presses, the bibliographer will find much matter
                    of interest in the principal works devoted to the subject. Prominent among these
                    are the <hi rend="italic">Monumenta</hi><hi rend="italic">Typographies</hi> of
                    Wolfius, Hamburg, 1740; Meerman’s <hi rend="italic">Origines</hi><hi

                <p>An accurate knowledge of the different forms of books is necessary to the
                    bibliographer, as without it no book can be correctly described; and however
                    easy such knowledge may appear, it is yet certain that errors in this respect
                    have been committed even by experienced bibliographers, and that doubts have
                    been entertained as to the existence of editions, owing to their forms having
                    been inaccurately described.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    this, that there are different sizes of paper comprehended under the same name.
                    But the water-lines in the sheets afford a test, as they are uniformly
                    perpendicular in the folio and octavo, and horizontal in the quarto and
                    duodecimo sizes. In the infancy of printing the sizes were generally folio and
                    quarto, and some have supposed that no books were printed in the smaller forms
                    till after 1480; but Μ. Peignot instances many editions in the smallest forms of
                    an earlier date; as may be seen in the article “Format” of the supplement to his
                    <hi rend="italic">Dictionnaire</hi><hi rend="italic">de Bibliologie.</hi> The
                    subject of water-marks is treated at length in Sotheby’s <hi rend="italic"

                <p>The respective merits of different editions can bo ascertained often only by
                    minute inquiries. It is a principal object of the bibliographical dictionaries,
                    to be afterwards mentioned, to point out those editions of important works which
                    such inquiries have discovered to be the best. There are many particulars in
                    which one edition may differ from or excel another. There may be differences or
                    grounds of preference in size, in paper, and in printing. Later revision by the
                    author may give his work, when it comes to be reprinted, a complexion differing
                    largely from what it had at the first; while the first edition exhibits his
                    orginal thoughts as they came fresh from his pen. One edition may derive its
                    superiority from being furnished with notes, an index, or a table of contents.
                    Plates make great differences in the value of editions, and even in the value of
                    copies of the same edition. In the beautifully engraved edition of <hi
                    rend="italic">Horace</hi> by Pine, a small error in the first impressions serves
                    as a test whether any copy contains the best engravings of those elegant
                    vignettes which illustrate that edition. The medal of Augustus, on page 108 of
                    the second volume, has in the first copies the incorrect reιding <hi
                    rend="italic">Post</hi><hi rend="italic">Est</hi> instead of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Potest;</hi> this was rectified in the after impressions; but as the plates had
                    meanwhile sustained some injury, the copies which show the incorrect reading are
                    of course esteemed the best. Dibdin, in his <hi rend="italic">Bibliomania,</hi>
                    points out this as an instance of preference founded on a <hi rend="italic"
                    >defect;</hi> but the real ground of preference is the superiority of the
                    impressions, ascertained by the presence of this trifling defect. There are
                    sometimes differences between copies of the same edition of a work.<note

                    acknowledgement of this piece of patronage on the part of the Protector; but in
                    other copies the compliment is expunged, and replaced by some invectives against

                <p>II. <hi rend="italic">Early Printed Books.</hi></p>
                <p>The first productions to which the name of <hi rend="italic">Books</hi> has been
                    applied, were printed, not with movable types, but from solid wooden blocks.
                    These consisted of a few leaves only, on which were impressed images of saints
                    and other historical pictures, with a text or a few explanatory lines. The ink
                    was of a brownish hue, and glutinous quality, to prevent it from spreading.
                    These are known by the name of <hi rend="italic">Image Books,</hi> or <hi
                    rend="italic">Block Books,</hi> and are generally supposed to have succeeded the
                    earlier impressions for playing cards, which are dated back to the end of the
                    14th century. Strictly speaking, they were the immediate precursors, rather than
                    the first specimens of typography; in fact, they mark the transition to that art
                    from engraving.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Mr Holt,
                    who contends that printing preceded engraving, ascribes the date of 1423 on the

                    no copy of the <hi rend="italic">Biblia</hi><hi rend="italic">Pauperum</hi> was

                    extended it to ten. They belong chiefly to the Low Countries, and were often
                    reprinted, as is generally thought, during the first half of the 15th century,
                    and, indeed, after <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0903-0670-0653"/> the discovery of printing, properly so called.
                    One of the most celebrated is the <hi rend="italic">Biblia</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Pauperum,</hi><hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi> consisting of forty leaves,
                    printed on one side, so as to make twenty when pasted together, on which
                    passages from Scripture are represented by means of figures, with inscriptions.
                    It appears to have been originally intended for the use of those poor persons
                    who could not afford to buy complete copies of the Bible. Some fugitive sheets
                    still attest the primitive attempts at printing, in the modern sense of the
                    word. <hi rend="italic">The Letters of Indulgence</hi> of Pope Nicholas V., two
                    editions of which, on a small sheet of parchment, were printed in 1454, fix the
                    earliest period of the impression of metal types, with a date subjoined. <hi
                    rend="superscript"> 2</hi> The earliest known book, however, of any magnitude,
                    and probably the first thus printed, was the undated <hi rend="italic">editio
                    princeps</hi> of the Bible, commonly known as the Mazarin Bible, from a copy
                    having been found by De Bure in the library of the Cardinal. It is undated, but
                    authorities generally concur in ascribing it to a period between 1450 and 1455.
                    The work is usually divided into two volumes, the first containing 324, and the
                    second 317 pages, each page consisting of two columns. The characters, which are
                    Gothic, are large and handsome, and resemble manuscript. No fewer than twenty
                    copies are known to be extant. <hi rend="superscript"> 3</hi> The first printed
                    book with a date is the <hi rend="italic">Psalter</hi> of Fust and Schöffer,
                    printed at Mentz in 1457, as a somewhat pompous colophon announces. It was
                    found, in 1665, in the Castle of Ambras, near Innsbruck, where the Archduke
                    Francis Sigismund had collected a quantity of MSS. and printed books, taken
                    chiefly from the library of Corvinus. A few other copies are in existence, one
                    of which was bought under Louis XVIII. for the Royal Library at Paris for the
                    sum of 12,000 francs. Whether the types employed were wooden or metallic has
                    been disputed between Van Praet and Didot. As a specimen of early printing the
                    work is magnificent; it contains richly embellished capitals in blue, red, and
                    purple.</p>
                <p>Besides these monuments of infant typography, a special interest attaches to the
                    productions of the 15 th century. They are usually known as <hi rend="italic"
                    >Incunabula,</hi> a term applied to them by modern German writers. Brunet,
                    following Santander, estimates their number at 18,000 or 20,000; but it is
                    probable that many duplicates are included in this reckoning. They came into
                    demand chiefly at the beginning of the last century, and especially about 1740,
                    at the third centenary of printing. The passion for them at first was
                    indiscriminate, but preference afterwards was given to the presses of Mayence,
                    Bamberg, Cologne, Strasburg, Rome, and Venice.</p>
                <p>As regards these early printed books, a knowledge of typography is necessary to
                    the bibliographer, to enable him to verify their identity. A brief reference to
                    some of their leading peculiarities must suffice here. The printer’s name, and
                    the date <hi rend="superscript"> 4</hi> and place of printing were at first
                    omitted, the printer imitating the reticence of the copyist, and the book being
                    a mere fac-simile of the manuscript. In Germany and the Low Countries few dated
                    books are found before 1476 or 1480. Title-pages appear to have come in a few
                    years later; none of Caxton’s works, with one doubtful exception, have any.
                    Titles to chapters were first used in the <hi rend="italic">Epistles of
                    Cicero,</hi> 1470. According to Palmer, the use of signatures, or letters at the
                    bottom of the page to guide the bookbinder in the arrangement of the sheets,
                    began with Zarot in a Terence printed by him at Milan in 1470. Marolles ascribes
                    them to John of Cologne, who printed at Venice in 1474, and the Abbé Rive to <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Jo1id</hi> Koelhof, a printer of Cologne. They were in use in
                    that city in 1475, and at Paris the next year, but were not employed by Caxton
                    until 1480. Catch-words, which, like signatures, preceded the numbering of
                    pages, are found in MSS. of the 11th century, and were first applied to printing
                    by Vindelin de Spira at Venice. Their purpose, to direct the binder, had been
                    previously supplied by <hi rend="italic">Registers, or</hi> alphabetical tables
                    of the first word of chapters, which were introduced about 1469. The earliest
                    system of numbering was applied, not to pages, but to leaves, a large Roman
                    figure being placed at the top of the <hi rend="italic">recto</hi> in each leaf.
                    The characters were uniformly Gothic—the foundation of our Black-letter—until
                    1467, when Gothic was supplanted by the Roman type, introduced in that year at
                    Rome, and improved on by Jenson at Venice. It was first used in England by
                    Pynson. <hi rend="italic">Italics</hi> were first used by Aldus in his <hi
                    rend="italic">Virgil</hi> of 1501; they are said to have been suggested to him
                    by Petrarch’s writing, and were employed to compress matter into his small
                    octavos without the inconvenience of abbreviations. Hebrew characters began at
                    Soncino, in the duchy of Milan, in 1482, and at Naples in 1487. The only points
                    first used were the colon and full stop; but Alduβ improved punctuation by
                    giving a better shape to the comma and adding the semicolon. With Caxton oblique
                    strokes took the place of commas and periods. The form of the earliest books was
                    chiefly folio and quarto. Almost every page abounded in abbreviations or
                    contractions. Blank spaces were left for capitals and the first letters of
                    periods, which were afterwards filled up by the illuminator. The Basel press was
                    noted for its ornamental initials; and Calliergus at Rome and the Paris printers
                    excelled in decorative printing of this kind. The taste for embellishment led to
                    ornamental title-pages about 1490, the usual ornament at first being the “author
                    at his desk.” The custom of coloured frontispieces appears to have prevailed
                    until the end of last century. Decorated borders appear in the first page of
                    some of Sweynheim and Pannartz’s productions; few ornaments, however, were
                    introduced into the body of the text before the first Hebrew publications. <hi

                <p>The devices of the early printers are of importance to the bibliographer, since
                    questions occur as to the early editions which can only be ascertained by
                    discovering the printer’s name. The invention of marks or vignettes is ascribed
                    by Laire <hi rend="italic">(Index</hi><hi rend="italic">Librorum</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Soec.</hi><hi rend="italic">XV.,</hi> ii. 146) to Aldus; he traces
                    them to a Greek Psalter of 1495. A device, however, consisting of two shields
                    occurs in Fust and Schöffer’s Bible of 1462. They were not used by Ulric Zell,
                    the first printer at Cologne, nor by the fathers of the Paris or Venetian
                    presses. Monograms or ciphers were frequently employed, with initial letters of
                    names or other devices curiously interwoven, and these furnish a trustworthy
                    clue to identity. The monograms of the Early English printers are explained in
                    Ames’s <hi rend="italic">Typographical Antiquities.</hi> Of the devices of

                    treated separately by different writers. Schwarz in 1740 and Wurdtwein in 1787
                    reviewed the productions of the Mentz press. Those of Nuremberg were noticed by
                    Röder in 1742; and a catalogue of them, in the library of that town, was
                    compiled by Säubert in 1643. In Italy, the Roman press is represented by Michael
                    Canensio in 1740, and more particularly by Audiffredi in 1783, who afterwards
                    extended his researches to all early Italian productions. The books issued from
                    Milan between 1465 and 1500 have been noticed by Saxius; the Parmese editions by
                    Affo in 1791; those of the Spiras at Venice by Pellegrini in 1794; those of
                    Friuli by Bartolini in 1798; and those of Ferrara by Antonelli in 1830. The
                    early Paris press has been copiously treated by Chevillier, and that of Lyons by
                    Péricaud, 1840. For Spain there is Caballero in 1793; and the works printed in
                    the Low Countries are reviewed at length in Meermann’s <hi rend="italic"
                    >Uitvindung den Bock-drukkonst,</hi> Amsterdam, 1767. Herbert, Ames, and Dibdin
                    well-nigh exhaust the subject of early English bibliography. The different
                    collections of <hi rend="italic">incunabula</hi> in public or private libraries
                    have been noticed in more or less detail. Seemiller in 1785 catalogued upwards
                    of 1800 editions of the 15th century at Ingolstadt.. Those in the Magliabecchian
                    library at Florence have been described by Fossi (or rather Follini) in 1793-95.
                    The collection of Lomenie de Brienne is known through the labours of the elder

                    the fac-similés alone would entitle these works to the front rank of hooks on

                    Books.</hi></p><p>This branch of what Ebert terms “restricted” bibliography
                    belongs peculiarly to the book-collector and bookseller, if regard be had
                    especially to the inclinations of purchasers, the actual demand, and the
                    marketable value of books. Rarity and price depend very much on each other;
                    rarity makes them dear, and dearness makes them rare. Hallam asserts that the
                    price of books was reduced four-fifths by the inventing of printing. From a
                    letter of Andreas, bishop of Aleria, to the pope, in his preface to the <hi
                    rend="italic">Epistles of Jerome,</hi> it would seem that 100 golden crowns was
                    the maximum demanded for a valuable MS., and that the first printed books were
                    sold for about 4 golden crowns a volume. At any rate, one natural effect of
                    printing was to restrict the number of rare books to a separate class. Cailleau,
                    who has been followed by most other writers on this subject, distinguishes
                    between <hi rend="italic">absolute</hi> and <hi rend="italic">relative</hi>
                    rarity. The former term is applied to those books or editions of which only a
                    small number has been printed. Such for the most part are works printed for
                    private circulation, as those of the Strawberry Hill Press, which are very
                    scarce and enormously dear. This class of English books is treated in the <hi
                    rend="italic">Bibliographical Catalogue of Books, privately printed,</hi> by
                    John Martin, 1834, republished, with additions, in 1854, 8vo. Much of the value
                    attached to editions of the 15th century arises from the limited number of
                    impressions. They were seldom more than 300; John of Spira printed only 100
                    copies of his <hi rend="italic">Pliny</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Cicero;</hi>
                    and printers had the example of Sweynheim and Pannartz, who were reduced to
                    poverty by their surplus copies, to avoid exceeding the current demand.
                    Suppressed works belong to the same category, in proportion to the success of
                    prohibition. Others owe their scarcity to accidental destruction; as, for
                    instance, the second volume of Hevelius’s <hi rend="italic">Machina
                    Coelestis,</hi> 1679, which would have shared the fate of the remainder of his
                    works, on the burning of his house, had the author not previously given some
                    copies to his friends. At the great fire of London in 1666 there were some works
                    of Dugdale, among other writers, as well as the first volume of Prynne’s <hi
                    rend="italic">Records of the Tower,</hi> of which only a few copies escaped; but
                    their value has been reduced by subsequent impressions. The same kind of rarity
                    attaches to <hi rend="italic">Editions de luxe,</hi> chiefly made for rich
                    amateurs; to large paper copies and <hi rend="italic">tall</hi> copies, <hi

                    and barely cut down by the binder; and to books printed on coloured paper. A

                    origin of printing to 1500, but his researches into printed literature extended
                    in the third volume to 1557; and there is an appendix which affords a partial

                    the finest specimens in this country. The <hi rend="italic">relative</hi> rarity
                    of books is due to a variety of causes, chiefly connected with the peculiar
                    nature of their contents. Among works of this kind, generally speaking, are
                    local histories, lives of learned men, books of antiquities, or of curious arts,
                    those written in languages little known, macaronic treatises, and catalogues of
                    private libraries. Works like the <hi rend="italic">Acta Sanctorum,</hi> in 53
                    volumes, however accessible in public though not in private libraries, are rare
                    in this sense of the term. The class of publications known as <hi rend="italic"
                    >Ana,</hi> containing the sayings and doings of men great in their day, has
                    become comparatively scarce. The first of these was the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Scaligerana</hi> of 1666. The public fastened upon them at first with avidity,
                    but the number of such productions created in time a distaste for them (see <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Ana,</hi> vol. L, pp. 784—5). Burton’s <hi rend="italic"
                    >Anatomy of Melancholy,</hi> which fascinated Dr Johnson, is an instance of
                    undeserved neglect. For a long time it fell into disuse, and from being a
                    waste-paper book, became extremely rare, until reprinted in recent times.

                    of this kind in England. It owes its origin to the industry of the bookseller

                <p>In a Hterary sense, a book, to deserve the title of rare, should be a work of
                    some merit, and not one whose obscurity is due to its worthlessness. Curious
                    books, however, depend very much on the pleasure of the curious; and the follies
                    and caprice of collectors are summed up in the word <hi rend="italic"

                    enclosed Mr Fox’s historical work in fox’s-skin; and a story is told of Dr Askew
                    having caused a book to be bound in human skin, for the payment of which he was
                    prosecuted by the binder. German bibliographers reproach us with an undue
                    passion for book curiosities. <hi rend="italic">Bibliomania</hi> forms the title
                    of an amusing work by Dr Dibdin, who, though accused of a leaning to this
                    weakness, knew well how to value the intelligent study of books. The practice
                    was satirized as early as the time of Brandt,</p>
                <p>(see his <hi rend="italic">Ship of Fools.)</hi> It prevailed in England chiefly
                    during last century, and reached its height at the sale of the duke of

                    collecting rare and curious books, without regard to their usefulness, merit, or
                    beauty, was too often a failing with well-educated persons. The love of uncut
                    and large-paper copies of vellum and first editions, and of illustrated books,
                    has been better regulated since book-madness was attacked by the Abbé Rive,
                    Dibdin, Dr Ferrier, and the Rev. James Beresford; and modern book-clubs like the
                    Roxburghe (1812), the Bannatyne (1823), the Maitland (1823), and the Surtees
                    (1834) Societies, the Abbotsford Club (1834), and the Early English Text
                    Society, have done important service to bibliography by reprinting scarce old
                    books.</p>
                <p>Detached, notices of rare and curious books are to be found in the catalogues of
                    private libraries, especially those compiled by French writers during the last
                    century. Beloe’s <hi rend="italic">Anecdotes of Literature</hi> contains much

                    letter H, terminating there in consequence of the author’s death. Clement is
                    generally blamed for a very profuse and inaccurate application of his own
                    nomenclature; his notes, moreover, are crammed with citations, and tediously
                    minute, but they abound with curious morsels of literary history, and it is to

                    This work did much to popularize bibliography in France. The author criticizes
                    parts of Clement’s dictionary, but recognizes the general merit of that work. De
                    Bure published a supplement in 1769, containing a catalogue of rare ana curious
                    books in the library of Gaignat. <hi rend="italic">Dictionnaire typographique,

                <p>Fortunately for the preservation of ancient literature, the discovery of printing
                    coincided very closely with the full development of that zeal for classical
                    learning, which had begun with the 15th century.<note anchored="true"

                    an imperishable form, those materials which the industry of Poggio and others
                    had rescued from the dust of monastic libraries. Tn rapid succession the first
                    editions of the classics issued from Italian presses; no less than fifty of

                    printed out of Italy before 1480, or, indeed, until the last ten years of that
                    century. The <hi rend="italic">De</hi><hi rend="italic">Officiis</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">&lt;A</hi> Cicero, it is true, had appeared at Mentz in 1465,—the
                    first portion of any classical work committed to the press, unless precedence is
                    given to the <hi rend="italic">De</hi><hi rend="italic">Oratore</hi> of
                    Sweynheim and Pannartz at Subiaco. But with that exception the first impressions
                    of <hi rend="italic">Terence</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Valerius Maximus</hi> at
                    Strasburg, and of <hi rend="italic">Sallust,</hi> and, perhaps, <hi
                    rend="italic">Florus</hi> at Paris, are all that Cisalpine presses contributed
                    of that kind within the period under review. The first appearance of <hi
                    rend="italic">Velleius Paterculus</hi> at Basel and of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Anacreon</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Menander</hi> at Paris was not until the
                    next century was well advanced. In Spain the first classical book was a <hi
                    rend="italic">Sallust</hi> of 1475. In England, the earliest was a <hi
                    rend="italic">Terence,</hi> printed by Pynson in 1497; but, besides that, <hi
                    rend="italic">Virgil, Sallust,</hi> and Cicero’s <hi rend="italic">Offices,</hi>
                    together with two Greek books, were the only classics published down to 1540. A
                    complete edition of <hi rend="italic">Cicero,</hi> printed in 1585 at London,
                    was the chief Latin work up to that date. A neat edition of Homer’s <hi
                    rend="italic">Iliad</hi> appeared in 1591, and the first impression of <hi
                    rend="italic">Herodotus</hi> in this country came out in the same year at
                    Cambridge. Our early printers were content with French translations for their
                    versions and abridgments; and Gawin Douglas, in the preface to his translation
                    of <hi rend="italic">Virgil,</hi> records his indignation at the injustice done
                    to the “divine poet” by the second-hand translation of Caxton.</p>
                <p>Most of the Latin classics had appeared in print before the art was employed on
                    any Greek author. This was due rather to the want of adequate editorship than to
                    any indifference to Greek in Italy; for the taste for that language had steadily
                    increased since the arrival of the learned Greeks from Constantinople, and the
                    want of printed editions became general before the close of the 15th century. To
                    Afdus belongs the glory of ministering to that desire, by publishing, in quick
                    succession and with singular beauty and correctness, almost all the principal
                    authors in that tongue. Beginning in 1494 with Musaeus’s <hi rend="italic">Hero
                    and Leander,</hi> he printed before 1516, the year of his death, upwards of
                    sixty considerable works in Greek literature. The list includes the first
                    impressions of <hi rend="italic">Aristophanes, Herodotus, Theocritus, Sophocles,
                    Thucydides, Euripides, Demosthenes, Pindar,</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >Plato.</hi> The <hi rend="italic">editio princeps</hi> of Aristotle is the
                    finest of his productions. Himself, in several cases, editor as well a3 printer,
                    he had the assistance of the most learned scholars of the day; and the handy
                    size of his octavos, which he substituted for the more cumbrous quartos after
                    his removal from Venice, added to the popularity of his editions. Within two
                    years after Aldus commenced his labours, Greek printing began at Florence with
                    the works of Callimachus,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"

                    however, the earliest work was the <hi rend="italic">Pindar</hi> of Calliergus

                    first been used in a treatise of’Jerome, printed at Rome in 1468; and detached
                    passages are found in some of the first copies of Latin authors.</p></note> At
                    Paris the first Greek press of importance was established in 1507 by Gourmont,
                    but the days of its chief celebrity date from his successors Colines and
                    Stephens. Aldus, though the most prolific, was not the earliest Greek printer.
                    The first entire work in that language was the <hi rend="italic">Grammar</hi> of
                    Constantine Lascaris, printed by Zarot at Milan in 1476. Homer’s <hi
                    rend="italic">Batrachomyomachia</hi> was the earliest printed Greek classic; his
                    complete works first appeared in the</p>
                <p>Florence <hi rend="italic">Homer of</hi> 1488, a volume which, Gibbon observes,
                    “displays all the luxury of the typographical art.” Besides these works, the <hi
                    rend="italic">Orations</hi> of Isocrates had appeared in 1493. Aldus has been
                    unduly eulogized by his biographer, Μ. Renouard,<note anchored="true"

                    direction to the art of printing, and indeed to the literary taste of Europe.
                    His taste for Greek he had imbibed from the age: he saw that there was a great
                    and growing want of Greek books, and his peculiar praise lies in this, that he
                    applied himself to supply it with much more constancy and skill and with much
                    more learning than any other printer of that period. His preface to Aristotle’s
                    <hi rend="italic">Organon,</hi> published in 1595, amply recognizes the demand
                    for Greek books. “Those,” he says, “who cultivate letters must be supplied with
                    books necessary for that purpose; and till this supply is obtained I shall not
                    be at rest.”<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>The preface

                <p>The <hi rend="italic">absolute</hi> rarity of the first editions of the classics
                    it is difficult to determine with precision. They have been much prized by
                    collectors, especially during last century, though their price has fluctuated
                    considerably at different times. The date of some, as for instance, of <hi

                    >Florus</hi> being the other three,—of which the printer is unknown. The Naples

                    was chiefly to possess this book that Earl Spencer bought the famous library of
                    the duke of Cassano. Of the first edition of <hi rend="italic">Lucretius</hi>
                    only two copies are believed to exist; and not one in its integrity of
                    Azzoguidi’s <hi rend="italic">editio princeps</hi> of Ovid. On the other hand,
                    there are several classical authors, of whom the second and even later
                    impressions are far the most valuable and scarce. The intrinsic merit of the <hi
                    rend="italic">editiones principes</hi> of the classics is too unequal to admit
                    of any general description. Their chief value, in a literary sense, consists in
                    the security afforded by printing against the further progress of
                    transcriptional error; but it would be a great mistake to imagine that the text
                    was then finally established. Maittaire gives precedence to their authority as
                    equivalent to that of the MSS. from which they were taken, but the question
                    obviously turns on the character of those MSS. themselves. Later discoveries and
                    the progress of critical research confirm the testimony of many of the first
                    editors, in their prefaces,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"
                    ><p>These prefaces have been edited by Botfield, with an introduction of some
                    merit.</p></note> ® regarding the insufficiency and mutilated character of their
                    materials. Thus Graevius observes of the celebrated <hi rend="italic">editio
                    princeps</hi> of Cicero’s <hi rend="italic">De</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Officiis</hi> by Fust, that it was printed from a very inaccurate manuscript.
                    Schelhorn, in his <hi rend="italic">Amoenitates</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Literarioe,</hi> insists, with good reason, on the want of collation among the
                    first editors. Frequently the first manuscript that offered itself was hastily
                    committed to the press, in order to take advantage of the recent discovery; and
                    fragments of different manuscripts were patched together to form <hi
                    rend="italic">Opera Omnia</hi> editions, without regard to the relative
                    authority of their contents. On the other hand there are first editions which
                    represent a single lost archetype, and whose value, therefore, cannot be
                    exaggerated, while others <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0903-0674-0657"/> represent copies of undoubted merit. La Grange
                    assures us, in the preface to his French translation of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Seneca,</hi> that he never, in any case of difficulty, consulted the first
                    edition of 1475, without finding a solution of his doubts. The fact is that each
                    <hi rend="italic">editio princeps</hi> must be judged by itself. It is to such
                    scholars as Turnebus, Muretus, and Lipsius that we owe a juster estimate of
                    their relative value, than prevailed in the early days of printing. Victorius
                    has been called the “Sospitator Ciceronis and the real restorers of Greek
                    learning are to be found in Scaliger, Casaubon, Budaeus, Camerarius, and
                    Stephens. The text of the classics has been slowly and laboriously constructed,
                    and in some cases, as with Aristophanes, Dion Cassius, and Pliny, among others,
                    a manuscript, discovered in modern times, has superseded entirely the authority
                    of early editions. This branch of the subject is fully treated in an article in
                    the <hi rend="italic">Edinburgh Review</hi> on “Classical Manuscripts and First
                    Editors” (Jan. 1873).</p>
                <p>Sets of the classics, more or less complete, have been published at different
                    times, and for different purposes. Among the earliest and most important are the
                    <hi rend="italic">Delphin</hi> editions, prepared, by order of Louis XIV., at
                    the instance of the duke de Montausier, for the use of the Dauphin. The duke had
                    been in the habit of studying the classics on his campaigns, and the want of
                    books of reference appears to have suggested to him the idea of a uniform series
                    of the principal classics, with explanatory notes and illustrative comments. On
                    his becoming governor to the Dauphin, the scheme was carried into execution; and
                    Huet, bishop of Avranches, a preceptor of the prince, was entrusted with the
                    choice of authors and editors, and with the general supervision of the series. A
                    list of the editors is given by Baillet in his <hi rend="italic"
                    >Critiques</hi><hi rend="italic">Grammairiens.</hi> The collection, which,
                    including Danet’s <hi rend="italic">Dictionary of Antiquities,</hi> extends to
                    sixty-four volumes quarto, is of very unequal merit; but the copious verbal
                    indices, which were added by the direction of Huet, afford a useful means of
                    reference to particular passages. Only Latin classics, however, are included in
                    the series; and “it is remarkable,” as Dr Aikin observes, “that <hi

                    1819-1830, by A. J. Valpy, forming in all 185 vols., 8vo. These <hi

                    edited in the course of the 17th and 18th centuries. A complete collection is
                    very rare; Peignot mentions one belonging to Μ. Mel de Saint-Ceran, which was
                    sold for 3000 livres. For the names of the authors and commentators see De

                    collectors are the Elzevirs and the Foulises. The <hi rend="italic"
                    >Elzevirs,</hi> or properly Elseviers, were a family of famous printers and
                    booksellers at Amsterdam, no fewer than fifteen of whom carried on the business
                    in succession from 1580 to 1712. Their <hi rend="italic">Eliny</hi> (1635), <hi

                    the masterpieces of their press; the last of the family brought out editions in

                    curious research. The project of reprinting the Elzevir editions, which
                    originated in 1743 with the Abbé Lenglet-Dufresnoy, led to the famous <hi
                    rend="italic">Barbou</hi> collection, commenced by Cou-stelier and continued by
                    Joseph Gaspard Barbou, one of the family of Paris printers and booksellers of

                    collections of Latin classics which exists in France, although the list of
                    authore is incomplete, and the notes far too voluminous. The whole series
                    extends to 154 volumes in 8vo. The editions of Robert and Andrew Foulis,
                    printers at Glasgow, were the finest which Britain produced during the 18th
                    century. Their <hi rend="italic">chef d</hi> ’ <hi rend="italic">oeuvre</hi> was

                    after the example of Robert Stephens at Paris, was hung up in the college of
                    Glasgow, and a reward offered for the discovery of any error.</p>

                <p>Books of this class originate, generally speaking, either from the necessities or

                    several motives for concealed authorship.</p></note> Their number, however, has
                    been such as to occupy, at an early time, the attention of bibliographers. In
                    1669 Frederick Geisler, professor of public law at Leipsic, published a
                    dissertation, <hi rend="italic">De</hi><hi rend="italic">Nominum Mutatione,</hi>
                    which he reprinted in 1671, with a short catalogue of anonymous and pseudonymous
                    authors. About the same time, a similar but more extensive work had been
                    undertaken by Vincent Placcius, professor of morals and eloquence at Hamburg,
                    which was published in 1674 with the title <hi rend="italic">De</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Scriptis</hi><hi rend="italic">et</hi><hi rend="italic"

                    rend="italic">pseudonymis Syntagma,</hi> in which the writer invited information
                    from learned men in Europe. Four years later, John Decker, a German lawyer,
                    published his <hi rend="italic">Conjecturez</hi><hi rend="italic">de</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Scriptis</hi><hi rend="italic">adespotis, pseudepigraphis,</hi><hi

                    in 1686, with the addition of two letters on the same subject, one by Paul
                    Vindingius, a professor at Copenhagen, and the other by the celebrated Peter
                    Bayle. In 1689 appeared the <hi rend="italic">Centuria</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >plagiariorum</hi><hi rend="italic">et</hi><hi rend="italic">pseudonymarum</hi>
                    of John Albert Fabricius, as well as a letter to Placcius from John Mayer, a
                    clergyman of Hamburg, under the title— <hi rend="italic">Dissertatio
                    Epistolica</hi><hi rend="italic">ad Placcium, qua anonymorum</hi><hi

                    complete fruits of Placcius’s researches were published after his death in a
                    folio volume at Hamburg in 1708, by Matthew Dreyer, a lawyer of that city. The
                    work was now entitled <hi rend="italic">Theatrum</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Anonymorum</hi><hi rend="italic">et</hi><hi rend="italic">Pseτιdonymorum;</hi>

                    and Decker with the relative letters of Vindingius and Bayle, and the
                    Dissertation of Mayer. This elaborate work contains notices of six thousand
                    books or authors; but it is ill-arranged and frequently inaccurate, besides
                    being cumbered with citations and extracts, equally useless and fatiguing</p>
                <p>The subject of false and fanciful names attached to books had been undertaken in
                    France by Adrien Baillet, nearly about the same period that Placcius commenced
                    his inquiries. In 1690 this author published his <hi rend="italic"
                    >Auteurs</hi><hi rend="italic">Déguises</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> but this is
                    little more than an introduction to an intended catalogue which Baillet never
                    completed, being deterred, as Niceron says, by the fear lest the exposure of
                    concealed authors should in some way or other involve him in trouble. In this
                    piece, which was reprinted in the sixth volume of De La Monnoye’s edition of
                    Baillet’s <hi rend="italic">Jugemens des Savans,</hi> there are some curious
                    literary anecdotes, especially with reference to the passion which prevailed
                    after the revival of letters for assuming classical names. In Italy these names
                    were so generally introduced into families, that the names of the saints,
                    hitherto the common appellatives, almost disappeared from that country. A
                    similar rage for assuming the names of celebrated authors was common among
                    French writers in the 18th century.</p>
                <p>The taste for this kind of research, which the work of Placcius had diffused in
                    Germany, produced several supplements to it in that country. In the <hi

                    >anonymis</hi><hi rend="italic">et</hi><hi rend="italic">pseudonymis
                    Schediasma,</hi> published by Christopher Augustus Neumann in 1711, there is a
                    dissertation on the question, Whether it is lawful for an author either to
                    withhold or disguise his name Î which question he decides in the affirmative But
                    the most considerable of these supplements was that published in 1740 by John
                    Christopher Mylius, librarian at Hamburg. It contains a reprint of the <hi
                    rend="italic">Schediasma</hi> of Neumann, with remarks, and a list of 3200
                    authors, in addition to those noticed by Placcius. The notices of Mylius,
                    however, are limited to books in Latin, French, and German. The younger De Bure
                    occupied himself partially with these researches: his omissions were supplied by
                    Μ. Née de la Rochelle in his <hi rend="italic">Table</hi><hi rend="italic"

                    Barbier, librarian to Napoleon I., the last edition of which is as recent as
                    1872. It comprises a vast number of articles, but the plan does not extend to
                    foreign productions, except those which have been translated into French. His
                    labours have been supplemented and improved upon by De Manne, in his <hi

                    Rochefoucauld, and Cardinal Richelieu. The authorship of Montesquieu’s <hi
                    rend="italic">Esprit des Lois</hi> was disguised, on its appearance in 1748, as

                <p>Books supposed hurtful to the interests of government, religion, or morality have

                    followed in various countries, with regard both to their own and to foreign
                    productions; and lists have been published from time to time of the works so

                    and ascribed to him, were burnt by order of the Senate; the story of their
                    discovery, however, is a mere fabrication. Tacitus mentions a <hi rend="italic"
                    >History</hi> by Cremutius Cordus, which the Senate, to flatter Tiberius,
                    condemned, because it designated C. Cassius the last of the Romans.<note

                    Scriptures to be burnt, but the early Christian Church was not slow in following
                    the example of intolerance, and the charge of heresy was a ready instrument for
                    putting down works alleged to be injurious to the faith. The first recorded
                    instance is that of Arius, whose writings were condemned to the flames at the
                    Council of Nicaea, Constantine himself threatening with death those who should
                    harbour any copies. The same fate befell the works of Nestorius at the Council
                    of Ephesus, and those of Eutyches at Chalcedon. Pagan works were prohibited at
                    the Council of Carthage in 400. Aristotle was forbidden by the church in the
                    13th century, but the restriction was relaxed in favour of the universities by
                    Pope Nicholas V. A list of prohibited books is found in a decree of a council at
                    Rome as early as 494.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"

                    literature increased in severity with the multiplication of books through the
                    press. In 1515 the Council of Lateran at Rome appointed clerical censors to

                    book should be printed without leave from the Inquisition, and booksellers were,
                    accordingly, required to send in catalogues. Brunet mentions, however, a list of
                    prohibited authors, prepared by order of Charles V., which was printed at
                    Brussels in 1540, and is the earliest of its kind. An <hi rend="italic"

                    similar catalogues followed from the universities of Paris and Louvain. The
                    first Index of the Court of Rome appeared in 1558, and was reprinted in 1559.
                    The subject was discussed at the Council of Trent, who delegated the right of
                    supervision to the Pope, and the result was the <hi rend="italic">Index
                    Tridentinus</hi> of Pius IV.,—the first strictly Papal Index,— which was printed
                    by Aldus at Rome in 1564. Thence began a long series of literary proscriptions,

                    printing to Switzerland and Germany. The right of dictating what books should or
                    should not be read was a consequence of the claims of the Papacy over the
                    conscience and morals of mankind; and the vitality of persecution has been
                    υreserved w ithiιr the Romish Church by the consistent exercise of such

                    decrees of their condemnation. The best known, though not the latest, edition of

                    Among the earlier victims were Galileo and Copernicus; and English literature is
                    represented by such names as Gibbon, Robertson, Bacon, Hallam, Milton, Locke,
                    Whately, and J. Stuart Mill. In Spain the power of the Inquisition, provoked by
                    the invasion of, Lutheranism, was wielded by Fernando de Valdes, whose catalogue
                    of 1559 formed the model of that issued by Pius IV. in the same year. An edict
                    of Philip II. was published at Antwerp in 1570, and a general Index of all books
                    suppressed by royal authority appeared at Madrid in 1790. It is noticeable that
                    Smith’s <hi rend="italic">Wealth of Nations</hi> has been proscribed in that
                    country, “on account of the lowness of its style and the looseness of its
                    morals.” A list of books suppressed in France between 1814 and 1850 has been

                    Henry VIII., the sudden ness of whose breach with Rome is shown by the
                    circumstance that, whereas in 1526 anti-popery books were condemned as
                    heretical, in 1535 all books favouring popery were decreed to be seditious.
                    Several of the early translations of the Bible were suppressed,—Tyndal ’ s
                    version among others. As many copie≡ of that work as the superior clergy could
                    buy up, were publicly burnt at St Paul’s on Shrove Tuesday, 1527, Fisher, bishop
                    of Rochester, preaching a sermon on the occasion. An edition of the Bible was
                    suppressed for a misprint, the printer having omitted the word “not” in the
                    seventh commandment, but a copy survives in the Bodleian. A general burning of
                    unlicensed books was ordered by the king in 1530, tho <hi rend="italic"
                    >Supplication of Beggars,</hi> a well-known invective against Wolsey, being
                    included in the list. Another catalogue was issued in 1546 by proclamation, and
                    the Act 3 and 4 Edward VI. made a raid against missals and books of devotion.
                    The regulations of the Star Chamber in 1585 claimed the power of licensing and
                    seizing books, and their scrutiny was as rigorous as that of the Inquisition.
                    Nevertheless the reign of Elizabeth was fruitful in “schismatic and libellous

                <p>This branch of bibliography has a peculiar interest to the literary historian. It
                    serves to indicate, for the most part, periods of political excitement or
                    religious intolerance. Fortunately, however, the efficacy of persecution has
                    been frustrated by the disseminating power of the press. <hi rend="italic"

                    experience has abundantly proved that it is easier to destroy an author than his
                    book. Melancholy as are the records of literary martyrdom, there remains this
                    satisfaction that, in the main, the policy of oppression has defeated its own
                    ends.</p>

                <p>The first catalogues, after the invention of printing, were those of the early
                    printers, who, as booksellers, published sale-lists of their works, to attract

                    classification to printed books. Its interest is enhanced by its containing the
                    price of the books advertised for sale. The increasing commerce in literature
                    was at once a cause and a consequence of similar catalogues; and the example of
                    Aldus was followed by the Stephens, and by Colines, Wechell, and Vascosan, and
                    other French printers of the first half of the 16th century, whose lists are

                    Frankfort book-fair, published by George Weller, a bookseller at Augsburg; and
                    in 1604 it was followed by the general Easter catalogue, printed by permission
                    of the Government. These catalogues of the different book-fairs were collected
                    together in 1592 by Cless —whose researches included all books printed since
                    1500 —and by Draudius in his <hi rend="italic">Bibliotheca</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Classica</hi> (1611). The same has been done by Georgi in his <hi rend="italic"

                    catalogues, compiled in many instances by learned and well-qualified librarians,

                    P. Garnier in 1678 prepared an excellent catalogue of the library of the Jesuit
                    Collège de Clermont at Paris, using the materials, like other bibliographers
                    after him, for a classified system of his own. Dr Johnson and Oldys were the
                    joint editors of the <hi rend="italic">Bibliotheca Harleiana,</hi> which they
                    prepared for Osborne the bookseller, who bought the library of the earl of
                    Oxford; and Maittaire drew the scheme of arrangement. The earliest catalogues of
                    public libraries were simple inventories, disposed in alphabetical order, with,
                    at most, a few biographical notices interspersed; yet they paved the way, in the
                    hands of Conrad Gesner, for the study of “pure” bibliography. The compilation of
                    <hi rend="italic">catalogues</hi><hi rend="italic">raisonnés</hi> was deferred
                    till the 18 th century, when the labours of French librarians or booksellers,
                    such as Piget, Prosper Marchand, Martin, Barrois, Baillet, and the De Bures,
                    created by that means a public taste for books. The greatest work of this kind
                    was the French <hi rend="italic">Bibliothèque</hi><hi rend="italic">Loyale,</hi>
                    begun in 1739, and finished in 10 vols, in 1753. Part i., relating to printed
                    books, was superintended by the Abbés Sallier and Boudot. In a perfect <hi
                    rend="italic">catalogue</hi><hi rend="italic">raisonné</hi> alphabetical
                    arrangement is dispensed with; every work occupies its proper place in regard to
                    the light it throws on the subject treated, and the ground traversed by the
                    author. “Catalogues of this sort,” says Dibdin, “are to bibliographers what
                    reports are to lawyers;” and Maittaire terms them “proces-verbaux littéraires,
                    servant à decider une infinité de questions qui s’élèvent sur la bibliologie.”
                    The consolidation of these detached catalogues was a consequence of the
                    increased requirements of learning, and the <hi rend="italic">Bibliothecae,</hi>
                    or registers of particular libraries, supplied the first materials for a general
                    dictionary of reference. Bibliography, thus represented, is the <hi
                    rend="italic">codex dij)lomaticus</hi> of literary history, with a field of
                    research co-extensive with the innummerable productions of the press. But a
                    universal dictionary of this kind is but a dream of bibliographers; nor would
                    any single compiler be equal to the task. The <hi rend="italic">Bibliotheca
                    Universalis</hi> of Gesner in 1545 is the earliest and almost the only effort of
                    this nature. His work professed to include the titles of all known books,
                    existing or lost, but he confined himself to those in Hebrew, Greek, and Latin.
                    The first volume is classed alphabetically, according to the authors’ names; the
                    second contains a distribution of subjects, and is divided into nineteen books.
                    Balthazar Ostern, in 1625, published a <hi rend="italic">Bibliothèque
                    Universelle,</hi> or catalogue of printed books from 1500 to 1624. A general
                    survey of printed literature might be made to the end of the 16th century; but
                    the idea is now wholly chimerical, since the number of books surpasses all human
                    calculation. The <hi rend="italic">Bibliotheca Britannica, or General Index of
                    British and Foreign Literature,</hi> by Dr Watt of Glasgow, published in 1824, 4
                    vols., is perhaps the nearest modern exposition of Gesner’s idea. All so-called
                    general dictionaries are, in fact, written on a selective principle of some
                    kind, the only means, as Baron de Reiffenberg remarks, of achieving utility and
                    completeness. Erseh, the founder of modern bibliography in Germany, published
                    his <hi rend="italic">Allgemeines</hi><hi rend="italic">Bepertorium</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">der Literatur</hi> in 1793-1809; but the first really
                    comprehensive work in that country was Ebert’s <hi rend="italic">Allgemeines
                    Bibliographisches</hi><hi rend="italic">Lexicon,</hi> Leipsic, 1821-1830, an
                    English translation of which was printed at Oxford in 1837, 4 vols. 8vo.
                    Kaiser’s <hi rend="italic">Vollständiges</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Biicherlexicon,</hi> and Heinsius’s <hi rend="italic">Allgemeines
                    Bücherlexicon</hi><hi rend="italic subscript"> Ύ</hi> with the continuation by
                    Schultz, are useful works of reference; but their contents, as might be
                    expected, are far from justifying the epithet of universal. Osmont, Cailleau,
                    and other French compilers on a large scale, limited their notices to rare and
                    remarkable books; and De Bure in his <hi rend="italic">Bibliographie</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Instructive</hi> only included productions of inferior repute,
                    because his original materials were too scanty to illustrate all the divisions
                    of a complete system and comprise what he termed a “Corps de Bibliographie
                    choisie.” Brunet’s <hi rend="italic">Manuel</hi><hi rend="italic">du
                    Libraire</hi> was the first work which embraced in alphabetical order what was
                    most precious in the literature of all times and nations. It was first published
                    in three volumes, 8vo, in 1810, and has since passed through several editions.
                    It is far richer in English and German books than any of the preceding
                    compilations, and its plan is such as to afford all the advantages both of a
                    dictionary and a classed catalogue. As apractical work of reference, whether to
                    the bibliographer or the student, it is the most complete dictionary yet
                    published on a scale so comprehensive. The <hi rend="italic">Bibliographie
                    Universelle</hi> (Manuels-Roret), Paris, 1857 contains a copious list of the
                    leading works on the different subjects of learning, which are arranged in
                    alphabetical order, and a succinct summary of the principal editions of an
                    author’s work, including the ancient classics. Among works avowedly devoted to
                    <hi rend="italic">special</hi> bibliography, some are limited to the productions
                    of certain epochs. The first century of printing has been an attractive subject
                    of research, as has been noticed above in the chapter on early printed books.
                    The <hi rend="italic">Bibliographie</hi><hi rend="italic">de la France</hi> was
                    the first trustworthy compilation of annual literature in that country. Of more
                    immediate value for purely literary purposes are those dictionaries or
                    catalogues which are restricted to particular branches of knowledge; and they
                    have the advantage of being able to ensure greater fulness and accuracy, from
                    the limited scope of their contents, than is available in a work professedly
                    general. “Through the want of such,” said Oldys, “how many authors have we who
                    are consuming <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit03newyrich/page/n678/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0903-0678-0661"/> their time, their quiet, and their wits, in
                    searching for either what is past finding, or already found.” A catalogue, in
                    short, might be made of superfluous writings by authors who have dug in mines of
                    literature already exhausted. The tendency, however, of modern bibliography is
                    fortunately to subdivide the field of literature; and the student of any special
                    department of learning need be at no loss for authorities to consult. Bale’s <hi

                    part ii. to the bibliography of different nations; and part iii. to works
                    connected with special branches of learning, which are classified into leading
                    divisions. The <hi rend="italic">Répertoire Bibliographique Universel</hi> of Μ.
                    Peignot is a useful but ill-arranged work; it dates back, moreover, to 1812. The
                    progress of knowledge and research, especially with regard to scientific
                    subjects, obviously throws works of this description soon out of date to the
                    student, who desires to be acquainted with the most recent as well as the
                    earlier authorities. As landmarks, however, of the state of knowledge at
                    different epochs, they are full of interest to the literary bibliographer.</p>
                <p>VIII. <hi rend="italic">On the Classification of Books.</hi></p>
                <p>The different methods, adopted from time to time, of classing books according to
                    their subject matter, has occasioned a variety of so-called <hi rend="italic"
                    >systems</hi> of bibliography, which it is important to notice, but which space
                    forbids us to describe in detail. A distinction must be observed between a
                    scheme of arrangement applied to a particular library, and limited therefore by
                    its contents, and one which embraces in its divisions and subdivisions the
                    entire range of literature. Nothing, on either head, is learnt from the Greeks
                    and Romans; the classed catalogue of the library of St Emmeran at Ratisbon,
                    compiled in 1347, and containing twelve divisions, is cited as the earliest
                    specimen of its kind. (See <hi rend="smallcaps">Libraries.)</hi> The most
                    ancient system, in the wider sense of the term, is ascribed to the Chinese, who
                    in the 13th century distributed the field of human knowledge into classes
                    numbering from fourteen to twenty, with sectional subdivisions to each.</p>
                <p>Classified systems suggested by or devised for particular libraries after
                    printing had multiplied their contents, originated chiefly with librarians or
                    compilers of catalogues. In 1587 Jean Baptiste Cardona wrote four treatises on
                    the principal libraries of his day. His description of the library of the
                    Escorial was followed in 1635 by Arias Montanus, whose catalogue divided the
                    books there according to languages, separating MSS. from printed works, and
                    distributed the whole into sixty-four classes. Their number was reduced by
                    Casiri in his <hi rend="italic">Bibliothèque</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Arabico-Espagnole de ΓEscurial,</hi> Madrid, 1760. In 1631 John Rhodius
                    proposed a scheme for the arrangement of the university library at Padua, which
                    has been recently published in the <hi rend="italic">Serapeum</hi> by Dr
                    Hoffman, from a manuscript found in the town library at Hamburg, under the title
                    of <hi rend="italic">Ein bibliothekarisches Gutachten abgegeben im Jahre,</hi>
                    1631. His method is very similar to that of Claudius Clement, in his <hi
                    rend="italic">Musei sive</hi><hi rend="italic">Bibliothecoe</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">tam privatae quam publicas exstructio, instructio,</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">curoe</hi><hi rend="italic">usus,</hi> 1635. A catalogue of the
                    library of the Canon de Cordes, which was purchased by Mazarin, was compiled in
                    1643 by his librarian, Gabriel Naudé, whose <hi rend="italic">Addition</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">à</hi><hi rend="italic">la vie de Louis XI.</hi> contains much
                    curious matter on bibliography, but who is best known, perhaps, from his defence
                    of the massacre of St Bartholomew. His <hi rend="italic">Dissertatio</hi><hi

                    the difference between arranging a catalogue and a library. Naudé finds fault
                    with the far-fetched refinements of his predecessors, and his divisions have the
                    merit of being more simple and precise. “It is certain,” says Mr Edwards, « that
                    a good catalogue will require a much more minute classification than would be
                    either useful or practicable in the presses of a library.”<note anchored="true"

                    A confusion between these two distinct objects has largely pervaded the “system”
                    of even later writers, who have supposed the same nicety and exactness to be
                    equally necessary and equally practicable in both. Where there is a classed
                    catalogue, the grand objects of a systematic arrangement are sufficiently
                    provided for, independently of the location of the books on which so much
                    fanciful lore has been expended. If there be no classed catalogue, it is
                    tolerably clear that, for purposes of convenient and ready reference, a minute
                    classification of books on the shelves, however accurate, may tend only to
                    bewilder and confuse. Simplicity is the readiest means to aid the memory and
                    abridge the labour of the librarian; and this object can be attained by a much
                    more elementary division of books than could be tolerated in any classified
                    catalogue extending to details.</p>
                <p>These remarks apply largely to the ordinary system of modern French
                    bibliographers, the origin of which is variously ascribed to Bouillaud, Garnier,
                    and Martin. Priority of date appears to belong to Bouillaud, for his <hi
                    rend="italic">Bibliotheca Thuana,</hi> or sale catalogue of the famous library
                    of De Thou, had existed in MS. some time before it was edited by Quesnel in
                    1679. His system embraces five classes, theology, jurisprudence, history,
                    philosophy, and literature,—the last including heterodox and miscellaneous
                    works. The catalogue by P. Garnier of the library of Clermont, entitled <hi

                    >Collegii</hi><hi rend="italic">Parisiensis</hi><hi rend="italic"

                    published two years previously. The headings embrace 461 subdivisions, of which
                    74 belong to theology, 88 to philosophy (a class clumsily and confusedly
                    arranged), 227 to history, and 72 to jurisprudence. In 1709 appeared Prosper
                    Marchand’s system, developed in his <hi rend="italic">Catalogus</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">bibliothecae Joachimi</hi><hi rend="italic">Faultrier.</hi> In his
                    preface he attacks the system of Naudé, and, after treating of the different
                    methods, viz., the order of nature, of nations, of languages, of time, and
                    alphabetical, sums up his divisions into theology, or divine knowledge;
                    philosophy, or human knowledge, separated into belles lettres and sciences; and
                    history, or the knowledge of events. Bouillaud’s system, as modified by
                    Marchand, was adopted by Gabriel Martin in most of the catalogues, amounting to
                    nearly 150, which he published between 1711 <hi rend="superscript"> an</hi> d

                    rend="italic">Instructive.</hi> The result of their successive labours, which is
                    known as “the system of the Paris booksellers,” is the one commonly adopted in
                    France, and consists of theology, jurisprudence, sciences and arts, literature,
                    and history. Some changes, it is true, were afterwards proposed. Μ. Ameilhon, in
                    a paper published in 1799 in the <hi rend="italic">Memoirs</hi> of the French
                    Institute, suggested as primitive classes, —grammar, logic, morals,
                    jurisprudence, metaphysics, physics, arts, belles lettres, and history,—his
                    Revolutionary sympathies inducing him to discard theology from the list. But the
                    system, finally elaborated by Martin, survived to govern the classification of
                    the principal libraries in his country. Of the various innovations, the system
                    of Daunou in his <hi rend="italic">Mémoire sur</hi><hi rend="italic">la
                    Classification des Livres</hi><hi rend="italic">d’une</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >grande</hi><hi rend="italic">Bibliothèque,</hi> 1800, is frequently cited as
                    the best. Since then the Paris scheme has been modified by bibliographers like
                    Barbier, Achard, and Brunet; by Μ. Merlin in his catalogue of the library of
                    Baron Silvestre de Sacy (1842); and by Μ. Albert, in his <hi rend="italic"
                    >Recherches sur les principes fondamentaux de la classification d'une
                    Bibliothèque,</hi> Paris, 1847. Olenin’s system (1808), for the Imperial library
                    at St Petersburg, separated sciences from arts, and introduced philology as a
                    distinct class. Dr Conyers Middleton in 1723 submitted a scheme to the senate of
                    Cambridge for the classification of the university library; the classes proposed
                    by him being these—theology, history, jurisprudence, philosophy, mathematics,
                    natural history, medicine, belles lettres, <hi rend="italic">(liter</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">oe</hi><hi rend="italic">humaniores),</hi> and miscellaneous.

                    Library,</hi> based on the Paris system, were submitted about the same time to
                    the Trustees of the British Museum. A serviceable “Scheme for Town Libraries” is
                    embodied in the chapter of Mr Edward’s book previously quoted.</p>
                <p>Of the more general “systems,” based on a survey of the field of human knowledge,
                    and not immediately directed to the requirements of a library, a brief notice
                    must suffice. The earliest system, in this sense of the word, is commonly
                    ascribed to Conrad Gesner, the founder, as Dibdin calls him, of pure
                    bibliography. Yet he was, in fact, preceded, however feebly, by Alexo Vanegas,
                    whose work, published at Toledo in 1540, forms the first imperfect type of
                    future efforts of that kind. His divisions are fourfold, viz.: <hi rend="italic"
                    >“Original—</hi> of the harmony between predestination and free will; <hi
                    rend="italic">Natural</hi> —of the philosophy of the visible world; <hi

                    Christofle de Savigny, which Brunet asserts was the model of Bacon’s
                    “Encyclopaedical Tree,” but which was substantially the system of Gesner. The
                    well-known speculations of Bacon as to the genealogy of knowledge were embodied
                    by D’Alembert in his <hi rend="italic">Discours préliminaire à l’Encyclopédie
                    Méthodique,</hi> Amst., 1767. They were also made th© basis of other schemes by
                    Regnault-Warin, Laire, Ferrario, and especially Peignot, whose system was
                    divided’ into three primitive classes, viz., history, philosophy, and
                    imagination, with the addition of bibliography, as an introductory class.
                    Girard’s system was embodied in an <hi rend="italic">Encyclopédie ou
                    Dictionnaire raisonné des Sciences, des Arts, et des Métiers,</hi> edited in
                    1751 by Diderot and d’Alembert, the latter of whom undertook the part relating
                    to mathematics. Camus in 1798 took man in a state of nature, and then classed
                    his libraιy in the order in which this “man of nature” is supposed to form his
                    impressions of the universe. The divisions of Thiébaut in 1802 comprised—(1),
                    Connaissances instrumentales; (2), Connaissances essentielles; and (3),
                    Connaissances de convenances, and were founded on a somewhat similar principle
                    to that adopted in 1822 by the Marquis Fortia d’Urban, in his <hi rend="italic"

                    The system of Leibnitz, however, in 1718, is well suited to practical purposes.
                    His leading classes are these—theology, jurisprudence, medicine, intellectual
                    philosophy, mathematics, natural philosophy, philology, history, and

                    than 1200 subdivisions. The system of Denis, formerly keeper of the imperial

                    he classifies learning into theology, jurisprudence, philosophy, medicine,
                    mathematics, history, and philology. Krug’s system followed in 1796, and
                    Schleiermacher’s in 1852. Wuttig’s <hi rend="italic"
                    >Universal-Bibliographie,</hi> 1862, aimed at embracing in a systematic survey
                    the collected literature of the current time.</p>
                <p>In England the classification of learning has been treated as a branch of
                    philosophy rather than of bibliography. Locke’s <hi rend="italic">Essay on the
                    Human Understanding</hi> contains, in book iv. c. 21, a “Division of the

                    it to apply to the distribution of books. Coleridge, in his <hi rend="italic"
                    >Universal Dictionary of Knowledge,</hi> 1817, aimed at combining the advantages
                    of a philosophical and alphabetical arrangement, and adopted four leading
                    classes, viz.,—pure sciences, mixed sciences, history, and literature, including
                    philology Lord Lindsay’s <hi rend="italic">Progression by Antagonism,</hi> 1845,
                    contains another method, based on his theory of the divisions of human
                    thought.</p>
                <p>For further information on this branch of the subject the reader is referred
                    to.Peignot’s article on “Système” in his <hi rend="italic">Dictionnaire</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">de Bibliologie,</hi> and especially to the chapter on
                    “Bibliographical Systems” in Petzholdt’s <hi rend="italic">Bibliotheca
                    Bibliographica,</hi> Leipsic, 1866. Many of the above-named schemes,
                    particularly those of high, philosophical pretensions, are fanciful in theory,
                    and quite unsuited to the practical requirements of a catalogue of reference.
                    The seven classes of Denis were based on the words of Solomon, “Wisdom hath
                    builded a house; she hath hewn out her seven pillars and Naudé mentions a writer
                    who proposed to class all sorts of books under the three heads of morals,
                    sciences, and devotion; and λvho assigned, as the grounds of this arrangement,
                    the words of the Psalmist, <hi rend="italic">Disciplinam, Bonitatem, et
                    Scientiam doce me.</hi> There are obvious objections to all bibliographical
                    systems which aspire to follow the genesis and remote affinities of the
                    different branches of knowledge. The truth is that, when bibliographers
                    speculate in this field with a view to cataloguemaking, they entirely forget
                    their proper province and objects. The compilation of a good catalogue of an
                    extensive library is quite difficult enough, without indulging in refined
                    abstractions on the genealogy of human knowledge.</p>
                <p>As regards works and collections which cannot with propriety be limited to any
                    one division of knowledge, it would be advisable to refer them to an additional
                    or <hi rend="italic">miscellaneous</hi> class, as has, in fact, been done by
                    some writers. Camus proposes to enter such works in the class in which their
                    authors most excelled; but this plan would obviously produce much confusion.
                    While, however, a miscellaneous class might properly indicate the collective
                    editions of an author’s works, yet his separate treatises should be entered
                    under the subjects to which they belong. A system of cross-reference is in many
                    cases unavoidable, if completeness of general design is to be combined with the
                    cardinal object of a classed catalogue, namely, that of showing what has been
                    written by the authors specified therein on the different branches of knowledge
                    as they may be best arranged.</p>
                <p>IX. <hi rend="italic">Bibliography in General.</hi></p>
                <p>It has been our object in this article to institute such a division of the
                    subject, as should enable us to point out the best sources of information in
                    regard to all its branches. Some works still remain to be noticed which treat
                    generally of all matters relating to bibliography, though their scope and
                    purpose differ according to the view of the science adopted by the writer. A
                    comprehensive and judicious digest of bibliographical lore is still wanted, but
                    there are several works which may be consulted with advantage. Cailleau’s <hi
                    rend="italic">Essai de Bibliographie,</hi> appended to his <hi rend="italic"
                    >Dictionnaire</hi> of 1790, is an interesting treatise. The <hi rend="italic"

                    of Μ. Denis, 1795-96, is an excellent work divided into two parts, the first of
                    them relating to bibliography, and the second to literary history. The <hi
                    rend="italic">Traité Élémentaire de Bibliographie,</hi> by S. Boulard, Paris,
                    1806, was intended to serve as an introduction to all works on that subject
                    written up to the date of its appearance. The labours of Peignot, besides his
                    works on suppressed and rare books already noticed, include—(1), the <hi
                    rend="italic">Manuel</hi><hi rend="italic">Bibliographique, ou Essai sur la
                    connaissance des livres, des formats, des éditions, de la manière de composer
                    une Bibliothèque, etc.,</hi> 1801; and (2), the <hi rend="italic">Dictionnaire
                    raisonné de Bibliologie,</hi> 2 vols. 8vo, 1802. The plan of this work, as
                    Brunet admits, is well conceived, and furnishes a convenient mode of reference.
                    Bibliography is certainly indebted to this industrious compiler, but his details
                    have in many respects been rendered obsolete by subsequent research, and his
                    vague notions of the scope and objects of his study have frequently led him into
                    confusion and extravagance. A <hi rend="italic">Manuel du Bibliophile,</hi> by
                    the same author, appeared at Dijon in 1823. The <hi rend="italic">Cours</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Élémentaire de Bibliographie,</hi> by C. F. Achard, Marseilles, 3
                    vols. 8vo, 1807, derives its chief value from its excellent summary of the
                    different systems of classification applied to books. We learn from the
                    introduction, that Μ. François de Neuf chateau, when Minister of the Interior,
                    ordered the librarians of all the departments to deliver lectures on
                    bibliography, but that the plan, which indeed appears fanciful, entirely failed,
                    the librarians having been found quite incapable of prelecting upon their
                    vocation. The <hi rend="italic">Introduction to the Study of Bibliography,</hi>
                    by Thos. Hartwell Horne, 2 vols, in 1, 8vo, London, 1814, is perhaps the most
                    useful book of this kind in the English language, though the compiler would have
                    done better to restrict himself to printed books, instead of ranging
                    discursively over the whole field of MS. literature. His book is chiefly
                    translated and compiled from French bibliographical works, and will be found
                    useful to those who have not access to them. Besides some excellent specimens of
                    early typography, it contains full lists of authorities on bibliography and
                    literary history, and a copious account of libraries both British and foreign.
                    The <hi rend="italic">Studio Bibliographico,</hi> by Vincenzo Mortillaro,
                    Palermo, 1832, is an Italian treatise of considerable merit. P. Namur’s <hi
                    rend="italic">Bibliographie paloeographico-diplomatico-bibliogique,</hi> Liège,
                    1838, embraces many subjects outside the province of bibliography proper. The
                    <hi rend="italic">Librarian's Manual,</hi> by Reuben A. Guild, New York, 1858,
                    is a compendious book of reference for the student in search of authorities.
                    Enough has been said to show that the different branches of bibliography have
                    been treated with considerable industry; but there is room for further effort,
                    if bibliographers will recognize the chief value of their science as the
                    handmaid of literature, <hi rend="smallcaps">(e. f. t.)</hi><pb break="no"
