                    Lascaris at Messina, he chose the ecclesiastical profession. After a
                    considerable time spent in various cities and courts of Italy, where his
                    learning already made him welcome, he accompanied Julio de’ Medici to Rome,
                    where he was soon after appointed secretary to Leo X. On the Pontiff’s death he
                    retired, with impaired health, to Padua, and there lived for a number of years
                    engaged in literary labours and amusements. In 1529 he accepted the office of
                    historiographer to his native city, and shortly afterwards was appointed
                    librarian of St Mark’s. The offer of a cardinal’s hat by Pope Paul III. took him
                    in 1539 agaiu to Rome, where he renounced the study of classical literature and
                    devoted himself to theology and classical history, receiving before long the
                    reward of his conversion in the shape of the bishoprics of Gubbio and Bergamo.
                    He died on the 18th of January 1547. Bembo, as a writer, is the <hi
                    rend="italic">beau ideal</hi> of a purist. The exact imitation of the style of
                    the genuine classics was the highest perfection at which he aimed. This at once
                    prevented the graces of spontaneity and secured the beauties of artistic
                    elaboration. One cannot fail to be struck with the Ciceronian cadence that
                    guides the movement even of his Italian writings.</p>
                <p>His works include a <hi rend="italic">History of Venice</hi> from 1487 to 1513,
                    dialogues, poems, and what we would now call essays. Perhaps the most famous are
                    a little treatise on Italian prose, and a dialogue entitled <hi rend="italic"
                    >Gli Asolani,</hi> in which Platonic affection is explained and recommended in a
                    rather long-winded fashion, to the amusement of the reader who remembers the
                    relations of the beautiful Morosina with the author. The edition of Petrarch’s
                    <hi rend="italic">Italian Poems,</hi> published by Aldus in 1501, and the <hi
                    rend="italic">Terzerime,</hi> which issued from the same press in 1502, were
                    edited by Bembo, who was on intimate terms with the great typographer. See <hi
                    rend="italic">Opere</hi><hi rend="italic">de P. Bembo,</hi> Venice, 1729; Casa,
