                    estimated at 1119 English square miles. Surrounded nearly on all sides by
                    mountains, it divides itself naturally into three parts, the low country about
                    Lake Copais, or, as it is now called, the Lake of Topolias, the valley of the
                    River Asopus (now Oropo), and the coast district between Mount Helicon and the
                    Corinthian Gulf. The country about the lake is a large valley, so completely
                    surrounded by hills that it is connected with the Eubcean Sea by subterranean
                    passages only. The natural passages, or <hi rend="italic">katavothra,</hi> not
                    being sufficient to carry off the great masses of water accumulating in the
                    valley, which is traversed by the Cephisus, the principal river in the country,
                    the early inhabitants often suffered severely from inundations; and at a very
                    remote period large artificial drains were constructed, probably by the Minyans
                    of Orchomenos, to supplement the natural outlets. Remains of these works, as
                    stupendous as any that were executed in antiquity, still excite the admiration
                    of the traveller. They formerly rendered that part of Boeotia one of the most
                    fertile districts of Greece, but being neglected for centuries, the shores of
                    the lake became an extensive marsh. A large stretch of country is still often
                    under water during the winter, but it begins to dry up in spring, and in summer
                    forms fine wheat-fields and meadows. Between this valley of the Copais and the
                    basin of the Asopus is situated the Theban plain, which is still distinguished
                    for its fertility, especially in grain. The lowlands and valleys of Boeotia were
                    notorious in antiquity for their moist and thick atmosphere, which was believed
                    to render the inhabitants dull and stupid. For these characteristics the
                    Boeotians are frequently satirized by the Attic writers; and it is certain that
                    comparatively few names were added to the long roll of Greek literature from
                    this portion of the Greek soil. One writer alone, perhaps, the poet Pindar,
                    stands out in striking contrast to the national character; the two others who
                    alone of his fellow-countrymen can claim to be also his intellectual kinsmen,
                    Hesiod and Plutarch, bear no small trace of a Boeotian origin. The dialect
                    spoken by the Boeotians was a broad Aeolic. In the earliest times of history
                    Boeotia was inhabited by various tribes, such as the Aonians, Temmicians,
                    Thracians, Leleges, Phlegyans, and the Minyans of Orchomenos. Of these we know
                    almost nothing, but the last-mentioned appear to have formed a great centre of
                    civilization at a very remote period. All these tribes were gradually expelled
                    or absorbed by the Boeotian Aeolians, who immigrated from Thessaly about sixty
                    years after the destruction of Troy, according to the ordinary chronology. The
                    country, which had previously possessed no common name, henceforth is always
                    spoken of as Boeotia, and the several cities and towns, with Thebes at their
                    head, formed a sort of confederation, in which, however, the Thebans and the
                    other Boeotians frequently came into hostile collision, Thebes claiming the
                    supremacy of the whole country, and the other cities insisting on their
                    independence. The confederation was administered by a number of officers called
                    Boeotarchs, of whom two were chosen by Thebes and one by each of the remaining
                    confederate communities. The federal temple was that of Athene Itonica at
                    Coronea, and there a religious festival was held. The political history of the
                    country is inseparable from that of <hi rend="smallcaps">Orchomenos,</hi><hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Thebes,</hi><hi rend="smallcaps">Plataeae,</hi> and <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Thespiae,</hi> to which the reader must be referred for
                    details. The confederacy continued its nominal existence even under the Roman
                    emperors, although the country was so,reduced that, about the time of Augustus,
                    Tanagra and Thespiae alone could be considered towns, the other cities having
                    either been entirely destroyed, or existing only as villages. The more important
                    of the towns which had formerly existed, besides those already mentioned, were
                    Tegyra, Arne, Haliartus, Alalcomenae, and Lebadea in the Copaic valley;
                    Anthedon, Mycalessus, and Oropus along the Euripus; Thisbe and Creusis on the
                    Corinthian Gulf; Ascra and Leuctra further inland; and Sidae, Tanagra, and
                    Pherae in the valley of the Asopus. During the Middle Ages and under the Turkish
                    domination, Livadia, the ancient Lebadea, was the capital of the country, which
                    indeed was frequently called after that city. The district is now united in one
                    <hi rend="italic">Nomos</hi> with Attica (Attikoviotia), and is divided into two
                    eparchies that take their names from Thebes and Livadia. The population in the
                    eastern part is largely Albanian, and is engaged in the growing of grain and
                    culture of the vine. See the Travels of Clarke, Wheler, Dodwell, Sir W.^Gell,
