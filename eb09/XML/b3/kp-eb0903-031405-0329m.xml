                    novelist of great power and ability, was born at Kilkenny in 1798. He received a
                    good education, and at a very early age gave evidence of remarkable genius. In
                    his thirteenth year he entered Kilkenny College, where many other eminent
                    Irishmen have received their training, and devoted himself specially to drawing
                    and painting, in which he became so proficient that he resolved to adopt the
                    profession of an artist. He accordingly proceeded to Dublin and studied for two
                    years in the schools connected with the Royal Society, where he obtained high
                    prizes. For some time afterwards he taught drawing in his native town, and while
                    doing so had the misfortune to fall violently in love with one of his pupils.
                    His affections were returned, but the parents of the young lady interfered and
                    removed her from Kilkenny. She pined away and died in two months. The occurrence
                    made a deep impression on Banim’s mind, and this, together with his exposure to
                    the weather on the night of her funeral, caused a severe illness which
                    completely shattered his health. After a partial recovery he set out for Dublin
                    and settled finally to the work of literature. He published a poem, <hi
                    rend="italic">The. Celts' Paradise,</hi> and had some success as a writer for
                    the stage. During a short visit to Kilkenny he married, and at the same time
                    planned, in conjunction with his brother Michael (born 1796), a series of tales
                    illustrative of Irish life. He then set out for London, the great centre of
                    literary activity, and supported himself by writing for magazines and for the
                    stage. A volume of miscellaneous essays was published anonymously in 1824,
                    called <hi rend="italic">Revelations of the Dead Alive.</hi> In April 1825
                    appeared the first series of <hi rend="italic">Tales of the O’Hara Family,</hi>
                    which achieved immediate and decided success. One of the most powerful of them,
                    <hi rend="italic">Crohoore of the Bill Hook,</hi> was by Michael Banim. In 1826
                    a second series was published, containing what is decidedly one of the best
                    Irish novels in our literature, <hi rend="italic">The Nowlans.</hi> John’s
                    health had almost entirely given way,and the next effort of the “O’Hara family”
                    was almost entirely the production of his brother Michael. <hi rend="italic">The
                    Croppy, a Tale of</hi> 1798, is hardly equal to the earlier tales, though it
                    contains some wonderfully vigorous passages. <hi rend="italic">The Denounced,
                    The Mayor of Windgap, The Ghost Hunter</hi> (by Michael Banim), and <hi
                    rend="italic">The Smuggler,</hi> followed in quick succession, and were received
                    with considerable favour. Banim, meanwhile, had completely broken down in
                    health, and had become much straitened in circumstances. During his absence in
                    France a movement to relieve his wants was set on foot by the English press,
                    headed by Sterling in the <hi rend="italic">Times.</hi> A sufficient sum was
                    obtained to remove him from any danger of actual want, and to this Government
                    afterwards added a pension <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit03newyrich/page/n330/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0903-0330-0315"/> of £150. He settled in Windgap Cottage, a short
                    distance from Kilkenny; and there, a complete invalid, he passed the remainder
                    of his life. His last piece of literary work was the novel, entitled <hi
                    rend="italic">Father Connell.</hi> He died in July 1842, aged 44. Banim’s true
                    place in literature is to be estimated from the merits of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >O'Hara Tales;</hi> his later works, though of considerable ability, are not
                    unfrequently prolix, and are marked by too evident an imitation of the <hi
                    rend="italic">Waυerley Novels.</hi> The <hi rend="italic">Tales,</hi> however,
                    show him at his best; they are masterpieces of faithful delineation. The strong
                    passions, the lights and shadows of Irish peasant character, have rarely been so
                    ably and truly depicted. The prevailing quality is a wonderful vehemence,
                    combined with a gloominess extending at times to natural phenomena as well as to
                    the characters of the tale; the incidents are striking, sometimes even horrible,
                    and it is not without some justice that the authors have been accused of <hi
                    rend="italic">sensationalism,</hi> of straining after melodramatic effect. The
                    lighter, more joyous side of Irish character, which appears so strongly in
                    Lover, does not receive due prominence from the Banims. (See P. J. Murrav, <hi
                    rend="italic">Life of John Banim,</hi> 1857.)</p>
