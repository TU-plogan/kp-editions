                    Benedict—</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Benedict</hi> I. (573-8) succeeded John III., and occupied
                    the Papal chair during the incursions of the Lombards, and during the series of
                    plagues and famines which followed these invasions. (PauL Diacon., <hi

                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Benedict</hi> IL (684-685) succeeded Leo II., but although
                    chosen in 683 he was not ordained till 684, because the leave of the Emperor
                    Constantine was not obtained until some months after the election. (Paul.
                    Diacon., <hi rend="italic">op. cit.</hi> vi. 53.)</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Benedict</hi> III. (855—858) was chosen by the dergy and
                    people of Rome, but the election was not confirmed by the Emperor Lothair, who
                    appointed an anti-pope, Anastasius. Benedict was at last successful, and the
                    schism helped to weaken the hold of the emperors upon the popes. The mythical
                    Pope Joan is usually placed between Benedict and his predecessor Leo IV.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Benedict</hi> IV. (900-903).</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Benedict</hi> V. (964-965) was elected by the Romans on the
                    death of John XII. The Emperor Otho did not approve of the choice, and carried
                    off the pope to Hamburg, where he died.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Benedict</hi> VI. (972-974) was chosen with great ceremony
                    and installed pope under the protection of the Emperor Otho the Great. On the
                    death of the emperor the turbulent citizens of Rome renewed their outrages, and
                    the pope himself was strangled by order of Crescentius, the son of the notorious
                    Theodora.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Benedict</hi> VII. (975-983) belonged to the noble family of
                    the counts of Tusculum, and governed Rome quietly for nearly nine years, a
                    somewhat rare thing in those days.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Benedict</hi> VIII. (1012-1024), also of the family of
                    Tusculum, was opposed by an anti-pope, Gregory, who compelled him to flee from
                    Rome. He was restored by Henry of Saxony, whom he crowned emperor in 1014. In
                    his pontificate the Saracens began to attack the southern coasts of Europe, and
                    effected a settlement in Sardinia. The Normans also then began to settle in
                    Italy.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Benedict</hi> IX. (1033-1056), the son of Alberic, count of
                    Tusculum, and nephew of Benedict VIII., obtained the Papal chair by simony. He
                    was deposed in 1044, and Sylvester was chosen in his stead. The result was a
                    long and disgraceful schism <hi rend="italic">(cf.</hi> Mittler, <hi

                    scarcely deserves to be reckoned a pope. He reigned nine months. It is
                    important, however, to remember that his election is one of the latest made by
                    Roman factions, and under his successor the mode of election by the cardinals
                    was adopted.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Benedict</hi> XI. (1303-1304) succeeded the famous Boniface
                    VIII., but was unable to carry out his Ultramontane policy. He released Philip
                    the Fair of France from the excommunication laid on him by Boniface, and
                    practically ignored the bull <hi rend="italic">Unam Sanctam.</hi> The popes who
                    immediately succeeded him were completely under the influence of the kings of
                    France, and removed the Papal seat from Rome to Avignon.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Benedict</hi> XII. (1334-1342) succeeded Pope John XXII.,
                    but did not carry out the policy of his predecessor. He practically made peace
                    with the Emperor Louis, and as far as possible came to terms with the
                    Franciscans, who were then at war with the Roman see. He was a reforming pope,
                    and tried to curb the luxury of the monastic orders, but without much success.

                    the Italian cardinals had chosen Boniface IX.; the election of Benedict
                    therefore perpetuated the great schism. The greater portion of the church
                    refused to recognize him, and in 1397 the French Church, which had supported
                    him, withdrew from allegiance to both popes, and in 1398 Benedict was imprisoned
                    in his own palace at <pb break="no"

                    state of matters to an end. Benedict abdicated in 1417, but was recognized by
                    Scotland and Spain until his death in 1424. His name does not appear in the
                    Italian list of popes. <hi rend="italic">(Of.</hi> Dupuy, <hi rend="italic"

                    in 1724. He at first called himself Benedict XIV., but afterwards altered the
                    title. He was a reforming pope, and endeavoured to put down the luxury of the
                    Italian priesthood and of the cardiualate. He died in 1730.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Benedict</hi> XIV. (1740-1758) belonged to a noble family of
                    Bologna. Elected to the Papal chair in a time of great difficulties, chiefly
                    caused by the disputes between Roman Catholic nations about the election of
                    bishops, he managed to overcome most of them. The disputes of the Holy See with
                    Naples, Sardinia, Spain, Venice, and Austria were settled. Perhaps the most
                    important act of his pontificate was the promulgation of his famous laws about
                    missions in the two bulls, <hi rend="italic">Ex quo</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >singulari</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Omnium solicitu-dinum.</hi> In these bulls
                    he denounced the custom of accommodating Christian words and usages to express
                    heathen ideas and practices, which had been extensively done by the Jesuits in
                    their Indian and Chinese missions. The consequence of these bulls was that most
                    of the so-called converts were lost to the church.</p>
