                    Southern India, the ancient capital of an independent sovereignty of the same
                    name, and once an extensive, splendid, and opulent city, but now retaining only
                    the vestiges of its former grandeur. It is situated in a fertile plain, in 16°
                    50' N. lat. and 75° 48' E. long., and is a place of great extent, consisting of
                    three distinct portions—the citadel, the fort, and the remains of the city. The
                    citadel, a mile in circuit, is a place of great strength, well built of the most
                    massive materials, and encompassed by a ditch 100 yards wide, formerly supplied
                    with water, but now nearly filled up with rubbish, so that its original depth
                    cannot be discovered. It was built in 1489, by Yusaf Adil Shâh, the founder of
                    the dynasty of Bijâpur. The fort consists of a rampart flanked by numerous
                    towers, a ditch, and a covered way. Its defences, which are not less than six
                    miles in circumference, were completed by Ali Adil Shâh. in 1566. The interior
                    formerly contained the king’s palace, the houses of the nobility, large
                    magazines, and extensive gardens. At present, though considerable portions of
                    the area are covered with buildings or ruins, there is room for corn-fields and
                    extensive enclosures. Outside the fort are remains of a vast city, now for the
                    most part in ruins, but the innumerable tombs, mosques, caravanserais, and other
                    edifices, which have resisted the havoc of time, afford abundant evidence of the
                    ancient splendour of the place. It is asserted by the natives that Bijâpur
                    contained, according to authentic records, 1600 mosques and nearly 1,000,000
                    houses. The number of houses is certainly overrated; that of the mosques, in the
                    opinion of recent travellers, is no exaggeration. The outer wall of the city on
                    the western side runs nearly south and north, and is of great extent. It is
                    built of stone, is of prodigious thickness, and is about 20 feet in height, with
                    a ditch and rampart; and at intervals of 100 yards are capacious towers, built
                    of large hewn stones. The whole is now in a ruinous condition,—the wall and the
                    towers having in many places fallen into the ditch, and in other parts being
                    covered with rubbish. Several mosques and mausoleums, adorned with all the
                    embellishments of Eastern architecture, are still to be seen in Bijâpur. The
                    fort in the interior is adorned with many of these edifices, in rather better
                    preservation than the outworks. Among these is the great mosque, which is 97
                    yards long by 55 broad. The wings, which are 15 yards broad, project 73 yards
                    from the north and south ends, enclosing on three sides, with the body of the
                    mosque, a large reservoir of water and a fountain. The mausoleum of Sultan
                    Muhammad Shah is a plain building, 153 feet square, over which is reared a dome
                    117 feet in diameter at its greatest concavity, and called by the natives the
                    grand cupola. The mosque and mausoleum of Ibrahim Adil Shâh, king of Bijâpur,
                    which was probably completed about the year 1620, is said to have cost
                    £1,700,000, and to have occupied thirty-six years in its construction. It is
                    built on a basement 130 yards in length by 52 in breadth, and raised 15 feet. On
                    this is a plain building, 115 feet by 76, covered by an immense dome raised on
                    arches. The mausoleum is a room 57 feet square, enclosed by two verandahs, 13
                    feet in breadth and 22 feet in height. There are, besides, many other public
                    buildings more or less injured by time and the violence of the Marhattâs. Almost
                    all the buildings, the palaces of the fort excepted, are of massive stone, and
                    in the most durable style; and at the same time the workmanship is minutely
                    elegant. Among the curiosities of the capital is the celebrated monster gun,
                    stated to be the largest piece of cast brass ordnance in the world. It was
                    captured from the king of Ahmadnagar by the king of Bijâpur about the middle of
                    the 17th century. An inscription on the gun recording that fact was erazed by
                    Aurangzeb, who substituted the present inscription, stating that he conquered
                    Bijâpur in 1685. The city is well watered, having, besides numerous wells,
                    several rivulets running through it.</p>
                <p>After the dissolution of the great Bâhmani dynasty of the Deccan in 1489, a race
                    of independent sovereigns arose, who ruled over the new kingdom of Bijâpur,
                    extending on the east from the confluence of the Bhimâ and the Krishnâ to the
                    sea-coast, on the west from Goa to Bombay. Their rule endured through several
                    generations, until at length, in 1650, Shâh Jahân compelled them to become
                    tributary to the empire; and shortly after, their monarchy was totally subverted
                    by his successor Aurangzeb. The city and territory of Bijâpur remained annexed
                    to Dehli till 1724, when the Nizâm established his independence in the Deccan,
                    and included Bijâpur within his dominions. His sway over this portion of his
                    acquisitions, was, however, of brief duration; for, being defeated by the Peshwâ
                    <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit03newyrich/page/n687/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0903-0687-0670"/> in 1760, lie was constrained to purchase peace by
                    its cession to the Marhattâs. Upon the fall of the Peshwâ in 1818, Bijâpur
                    passed into the hands of the British, and was by them included in the territory
                    assigned to the Râjâ of Satârâ.</p>
                <p>The place, as already intimated, is rich in monuments of the bygone period when
                    Bijâpur was the capital of a powerful and flourishing Mahometan kingdom. Such
                    traces of the past it is always desirable to preserve to the greatest possible
                    extent, as they furnish the best commentary upon the history of the times in
                    which they were raised, and, indeed, constitute their history, so far as manners
                    are concerned. It is fortunate that their value was duly appreciated by the late
                    Râjâ of Satârâ, who took great pains to preserve them; and that the British
                    Government, participating in the same feeling, has, since the country passed
                    into its possession, manifested great zeal in rescuing these magnificent relics
                    from the ravages of time. Bijâpur is distant 130 miles S.E. of Satara, and 245
                    S.E. of Bombay.</p>
