                    education was undertaken by his maternal uncle Thomas Bigg, an eminent surgeon
                    in London. When about seven years old he was sent to the Charterhouse School,
                    and in 1735 he was admitted upon the foundation there by the nomination of Sir
                    Robert Walpole. His progress was so rapid that at the age of fifteen he was at
                    the head of the school, and qualified to be removed to the university, and he
                    was accordingly entered a commoner at Pembroke College, Oxford, on the 30th of
                    November 1738. At the time of entering he held an exhibition from his school,
                    and in February following he was elected by his college to one of Lady Holford’s
                    exhibitions for Charterhouse scholars. He was a diligent student, devoting
                    himself specially though not exclusively to the Greek and Roman poets. At the
                    early age of twenty he compiled a treatise, entitled <hi rend="italic">Elements
                    of Architecture,</hi> intended for his own use only and not for publication,
                    which was highly spoken of by those who were permitted to read it.</p>
                <p>Having made choice of the profession of the law, he was entered in the Middle
                    Temple, November 20, 1741. In a copy of verses of considerable merit, afterwards
                    published by Dodsley in the fourth volume of his Miscellanies, entitled <hi
                    rend="italic">The Lawyer's Farewell to his Muse,</hi> he gave utterance to the
                    regret with which he abandoned the pleasing pursuits of his youth for severer
                    studies. Besides this, several fugitive pieces were at times communicated by him
                    to his friends; and he left, but not with a view to publication, a small
                    collection of juvenile pieces, consisting of both original poems and
                    translations. Some notes which just before his death he communicated to
                    Steevens, and which were inserted by the latter in his last edition of
                    Shakespeare’s works, show how well he understood the meaning and relished the
                    beauties of his favourite English poet.</p>
                <p>In November 1743 he was elected into the society of All Souls’ College. In the
                    November following he spoke the anniversary speech in commemoration of
                    Archbishop Chichele, the founder, and the other benefactors to that house of
                    learning, and was at the same time admitted actual fellow. From this period he
                    divided his time between the university and the Temple, where he took chambers
                    in order to attend the courts. In the former he pursued his academical studies,
                    and on the 12th of June 1745 took the degree of bachelor of civil law; in the
                    latter he applied himself closely to his profession, both in the hall and in his
                    private studies; and on the 28th of November 1746 he was called to the bar.
                    Though but little known or distinguished in Westminster Hall, he was actively
                    employed, during his occasional residences at the university, in taking part in
                    the internal management of his college. In May 1749, as a small reward for his
                    services, and to give him further opportunities of advancing the interests of
                    the college, Blackstone was appointed steward of its manors. In the same year,
                    on the resignation of his uncle, Seymour Richmond, he was elected recorder of
                    the borough of Wallingford in Berkshire. On the 26th of April 1750 he commenced
                    doctor of civil law, and thereby became a member of the convocation, which
                    enabled him to extend his views beyond the narrow circle of his own society, to
                    the benefit of the university at large. In the summer of 1753 he took the
                    resolution of wholly retiring to his fellowship and an academical life, still
                    continuing the practice of his profession as a provincial counsel.</p>
                <p>His lectures on the laws of England appear to have been an early and favourite
                    idea; for in the Michaelmas term immediately after he quitted Westminster Hall,
                    he entered on the duty of reading them at Oxford; and we are told by the author
                    of his <hi rend="italic">Life,</hi> that even at their commencement, the high
                    expectations formed from the acknowledged abilities of the lecturer attracted to
                    these lectures a very crowded class of young men of the first families,
                    characters, and hopes. Bentham, however, declares that he was a “formal,
                    precise, and affected lecturer—just what you would expect from the character of
                    his writings—cold, reserved, and wary, exhibiting a frigid pride.” It was not
                    till the year 1758 that the lectures in the form they now bear were read in the
                    university. Mr Viner having by his will left not only the copyright of his
                    abridgment, but other property to a considerable amount, to the University of
                    Oxford, in order to found a professorship, fellowships, and scholarships of
                    common law, Blackstone was on the 20th of October 1758 unanimously elected
                    Vinerian professor; and on the 25th of the same month he read his first
                    introductory lecture, which he published at the request of the vice-chancellor
                    and heads of houses, and afterwards prefixed to the first volume of his
                    celebrated <hi rend="italic">Commentaries.</hi> It is doubtful whether the <hi
                    rend="italic">Commentaries</hi> were originally intended for the press; but many
                    imperfect and incorrect copies having got into circulation, and a pirated
                    edition of them being either published or preparing for publication in Ireland,
                    the author thought proper to print a correct edition himself, and in November
                    1765 published the first volume, under the title of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Commentaries on the Laws of England.</hi> The remaining parts of the work were
                    given to the world in the course of the four succeeding years. It ought to be
                    remarked, that before this period the reputation which his lectures had
                    deservedly acquired for him had induced him to resume his practice in
                    Westminster Hall; and, contrary to the general order of the profession, he who
                    had quitted the bar for an academic life was sent back from the college to the
                    bar with a considerable increase of business. He was likewise elected to
                    parliament, first for Hindon, and afterwards for Westbury in Wilts; but in
                    neither of these departments did he equal the expectations which his writings
                    had raised. The part he took in the Middlesex election drew upon him the attacks
                    of some persons of ability in the senate, and likewise a severe animadversion
                    from the caustic pen of <hi rend="italic">Junius.</hi> This circumstance
                    probably strengthened the aversion he professed to parliamentary attendance,
                    “where,” he said, “amidst the rage of contending parties, a man of moderation
                    must expect to meet with no quarter from any side.” In 1770 he declined the
                    place of solicitor-general; but shortly afterwards, on the promotion of Sir
                    Joseph Yates to a seat in the court of Common Pleas, he accepted a seat on the
                    bench, and on the death of Sir Joseph succeeded him there also. Blackstone died
                    on the 14th February 1780, in the fifty-seventh year of his age.</p>
                <p>The design of the <hi rend="italic">Commentaries</hi> is exhibited in his first
                    Vinerian lecture printed in the introduction to them. The author there dwells on
                    the importance of noblemen, gentlemen, and educated persons generally being well
                    acquainted with the laws of the country; and his treatise, accordingly, is as
                    far as possible a popular exposition of the laws of England. Falling into the
                    common error of identifying the various meanings of the word law, he advances
                    from the law of nature (being either the revealed or the inferred will of God)
                    to municipal law, which he defines to be a rule of civil conduct prescribed by
                    the supreme power in a state commanding what is right and prohibiting what is
                    wrong. On this definition he founds the division observed in the <hi
                    rend="italic">Commentaries.</hi> The objects of law are rights and wrongs.
                    Rights are ’either rights of persons or rights of things. Wrongs are either
                    public or private. These four headings form respectively the subjects of the
                    four books of the <hi rend="italic">Commentaries.</hi></p>
                <p>Blackstone was by no means what would now be called a scientific jurist. He has
                    only the vaguest possible grasp of the elementary conceptions of law. He
                    evidently regards the law of gravitation, the law of nature, and the law of <pb
                    break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit03newyrich/page/n819/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0903-0819-0802"/> England, as different examples of the same
                    principle—as rules of action or conduct imposed by a superior power on its
                    subjects. He propounds in terms a fallacy which is perhaps not yet quite
                    expelled from courts of law, viz., that municipal or positive laws derive their
                    validity from their conformity to the so-called law of nature or law of God. “No
                    human laws,” he says, “are of any validity if contrary to this.” Hie distinction
                    between rights of persons and rights of things, implying, as it would appear,
                    that things as well as persons have rights, is attributable to a
                    misunderstanding of the technical terms of the Roman law. In distinguishing
                    between private and public wrongs (civil injuries and crimes) he fails to seize
                    the true principle of the division. Austin, who accused him of following
                    slavishly the method of Hale’s <hi rend="italic">Analysis of the Law,</hi>
                    declares that he “blindly adopts the mistakes of his rude and compendious model;
                    missing invariably, with a nice and surprising infelicity, the pregnant but
                    obscure suggestions which it proffered to his attention, and which would have
                    guided a discerning and inventive writer to an arrangement comparatively just.”
                    By the want of precise and closely-defined terms, and his tendency to substitute
                    loose literary phrases, he falls occasionally into irreconcilable
                    contradictions. Even in discussing a subject of such immense importance as
                    equity, he hardly takes pains to discriminate between the legal and popular
                    senses of the word, and, from the small place which equity jurisprudence
                    occupies in his arrangement, he would scarcely seem to have realized its true
                    position in the law of England. Subject, however, to these strictures the
                    completeness of the treatise, its serviceable if not scientific order, and the
                    power of lucid exposition possessed by the author demand emphatic recognition.
                    Blackstone’s defects as a jurist are more conspicuous in his treatment of the
                    underlying principles and fundamental divisions of the law than in his account
                    of its substantive principles.</p>
                <p>Blackstone by no means confines himself to the work of a legal commentatos It is
                    his business, especially when he touches on the framework of society, to find a
                    basis-in history and reason for all our most characteristic institutions. There
                    is not much either of philosopny or fairness in this part of his work. Whether
                    through the natural conservatism of a lawyer, or through his own timidity and
                    subserviency as a man and a politician, he is always found to be a specious
                    defender of the existing order of things. Bentham accuses him of being the enemy
                    of all reform, and the unscrupulous champion of every form of professional
                    chicanery. Austin says that he truckled to the sinister interests and
                    mischievous prejudices of power, and that he flattered the overweening conceit
                    of the English in their own institutions. He displays much ingenuity in giving a
                    plausible form to common prejudices and fallacies; but it is by no means clear
                    that he was not imposed upon himself. More undeniable than the political
                    fairness of the treatise is its merit as a work of literature. It is written in
                    a most graceful and attractive style, and although no opportunity of
                    embellishment has been lost, the language is always simple and clear. Whether it
                    is owing to its literary graces, or to its success in flattering the prejudices
                    of the public to which it was addressed, the influence of the book in England
                    has been extraordinary. Not lawyers only, and lawyers perhaps even less than
                    others, accepted it as an authoritative revelation of the law. It performed for
                    educated society in England much the same service as was rendered to the people
                    of Rome by the publication of their previously unknown laws. It is more correct
                    to regard it as a handbook of the law for laymen than as a legal treatise; and
                    as the first and only book of the kind in England it has been received with
                    somewhat indiscriminating reverence. It is certain that a vast amount of the
                    constitutional sentiment of the country has been inspired by its pages. To this
                    day Blackstone’s criticism of the English constitution would probably express
                    the most profound political convictions of the majority of the English people.
                    Long after it has ceased to be of much practical value as an authority in the
                    courts, it remains the arbiter of all public discussions on the law or the
                    constitution. On such occasions the <hi rend="italic">Commentaries</hi> are apt
                    to be construed as strictly as if they were a code. It is amusing to observe how
                    much importance is attached to the <hi rend="italic">ipsissima</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">verba</hi> of a writer who aimed more at presenting a picture
                    intelligible to laymen than at recording the principles of the law with
                    technical accuracy of detail. <hi rend="smallcaps">(e. r.)</hi></p>
