                <p><label type="entry">BELL</label> (from Ang. Sax. <hi rend="italic">bellan,∖a</hi>
                    resound, akin to peαZ),an open percussion instrument varying in shape and
                    material, but usually cup-like or globular and metallic, so constructed as to
                    yield one dominant note. This definition excludes on the score of sound the
                    cauldrons of Dodona <hi rend="italic">{Dodonaei lebetes</hi> of the Greek
                    oracular temples), and also the Chinese or Indian gongs, and, on the score of
                    shape, all drums, cymbals, the metal plates of the Romans, and resonant bars of
                    metal or wood still used by many savage tribes.</p>
                <p>Antiquaries have worried themselves and their readers about the antiquity of
                    bells and to small purpose. It is doubtful whether the bells of gold (Exod.
                    xxvni. 32, 35) were anything but jangling ornaments of some kind worn by the
                    high priest; but Mr Layard believes that he has found some small bronze bells in
                    the palace of Nimroud. We may gather generally that small bells long preceded
                    large ones, which latter, however, were used in India and China long before they
                    were known in Europe.</p>
                <p>The Romans used bells for various purposes. Lucian, 180 A.D., mentions an
                    instrument <hi rend="italic">{Clepsydra')</hi> mechanically constructed with
                    water, which rang a bell as the water flowed to measure time. Bells summoned the
                    Romans to the public baths; they were also used in processions, and so passed
                    naturally into the service of the Western Church. The first recorded application
                    of them to churches is ascribed by Polydore Vergil to Paulinus <hi rend="italic"
                    >{circa</hi> 400 <hi rend="smallcaps">a.d.)</hi> He was bishop of Nola, a city
                    of Campania (hence <hi rend="italic">nola</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >campana,</hi> the names of certain bells). It has been maintained that Pope
                    Sabinianus, 604, first used church bells; but it seems clear that they were
                    introduced into France as early as 550. In 680 Benedict, abbot of Wearmouth,
                    imported them from Italy; and in the 7th century, Bede mentions them in England.
                    St Dunstan hung many in the 10th century; and in the 11th they were not uncommon
                    in Switzerland and Germany. It is incredible that the Greek Christians, as has
                    been asserted, were αnacquainted with bells till the 9th century; but it is
                    certain that, for political reasons after the taking of Constantinople by the
                    Turks, in 1453, their use was forbidden, lest they should provide a popular
                    signal for revolt.</p>
                <p>Several old bells are extant in Scotland, Ireland, and Wales; the oldest are
                    often quadrangular, made of thin iron plates hammered and rivetted together. Dr
                    Reeves of Lusk described in 1850 St Patrick’s bell preserved at Belfast, called
                    <hi rend="italic">Clog an eadhachta Phatraic, “</hi> the bell of St Patrick’s
                    will.” It is 6 inches high, 5 broad, 4 deep, adorned with gems and gold and
                    silver filagree-work; it is inscribed 1091 and 1105, but is probably alluded to
                    in Ulster annals in 552. For Scotch belle, see <hi rend="italic">Illustrated
                    Catalogue oj Archaeological Museum,</hi> Edinburgh, for 1856.</p>
                <p>The four-sided bell of the Irish missionary St Gall, 646, is preserved at the
                    monastery of St Gall, Switzerland. In these early times bells were usually
                    small; even in the 11th century a bell presented to the church at Orleans
                    weighing 2600 lb was thought large. In the 13th century larger bells were cast.
                    The bell, Jacqueline of Paris, cast 1400, weighed 15,000 ft&gt;; another Paris
                    bell of 1472, 25,000 ft&gt;; and the famous Amboise bell at Rouen, 1501, 36,364
                    ft. But there we have reached the threshold of the golden age of bells, of which
                    more anon.</p>
                <p>Before we enter on the history and manufacture of the bell in Europe it is worth
                    while to enumerate the different kinds of bells named by Hieronymus Magius in
                    his work <hi rend="italic">De</hi><hi rend="italic">Tintinnabulis:</hi><hi

                    large bell, first used in the Latin churches in the steeple (Durandus), in the
                    tower (Belethus); 6. <hi rend="italic">Squilla,</hi> a shrill little bell. We
                    read of <hi rend="italic">cymbalum</hi> for the cloister (Durandus), or <hi
                    rend="italic">campanella</hi> for the cloister (Belethus); <hi rend="italic"
                    >nolula</hi> or <hi rend="italic">dupla</hi> in the clock; <hi rend="italic"
                    >signum</hi> in the tower. There was also a bell called <hi rend="italic"
                    >corrigiuncula</hi><hi rend="italic subscript"> t</hi> to summon the monks at
                    scourging time.</p>
                <p>We shall now give a brief account of the manufacture of the bell proper, <hi
                    rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> the church bell of the last five centuries. It must not
                    be supposed that the early bell-founders understood all the principles of
                    construction, mixture of metals, lines, and proportions which go to form our
                    notion of a good bell. As the Amati or Stradiuarius violin is the result of
                    innumerable experiments extending over centuries, so the bells of Van den Gheyn
                    (1550) and Hemony (1650) disengaged themselves after ages of empirical trials as
                    the true models, and supplied the finished type for all succeeding
                    bell-workers.</p>
                <p>Bell-metal is a mixture of copper and tin in the proportion of 4 to 1. In Henry
                    III.’s reign it was 2 to 1. In Mr Layard’s Nineveh bronze bells, it was 10 to 1.
                    Zinc and lead are used in small bells. The thickness of the bell’s edge is
                    1*15th of its diameter, and its height is twelve times its thickness.</p>
                <p>Bells, like viols, have been made of every conceivable shape within certain
                    limits. The long narrow bell, the quadrangular, and the mitre-shaped in Europe
                    at least indicate antiquity, and the graceful curved-inwardly-midway and full
                    trumpet-mouthed bell indicates an age not earlier than the 16th century.</p>
                <p>The bell is first designed on paper according to the scale of measurement. Then
                    the crook is made, which is a kind of double wooden compass, the legs of which
                    are respectively curved to the shape of the inner and outer sides of the bell, a
                    space of the exact form and thickness of the bell being left betwixt them. The
                    compass is pivotted on a stake driven into the bottom of the casting-pit. A
                    stuffing of brickwork is built round the stake, leaving room for a fire to be
                    lighted inside it. The outside of this stuffing is then padded with fine soft
                    clay, well mixed and bound together with calves’ hair, and the inner leg of the
                    compas3 run round it, bringing it to the exact shape of the inside of the bell.
                    Upon this <hi rend="italic">core,</hi> well smeared’with grease, is fashioned
                    the false clay bell, the outside of which is defined by the outer leg of the
                    compass. Inscriptions are now moulded in wax on the outside of the clay-bell;
                    these are carefully smeared with grease, then lightly covered with the finest
                    clay, and then with coarser clay, until a solid <hi rend="italic">mantle</hi> is
                    thickened over the outside of the clay belL A fire is now lighted, and the whole
                    baked hard; the grease and wax inscriptions steam out through holes at the top,
                    leaving the sham clay bell baked hard and tolerably loose, between the <hi
                    rend="italic">core</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">cope</hi> or <hi rend="italic"
                    >mantle.</hi> The cope is then lifted, the clay bell broken up, the <hi
                    rend="italic">cope</hi> let down again, enclosing now between itself and the <hi
                    rend="italic">core</hi> the exact shape of the bell. The metal is then boiled,
                    and run molten into the mould. A large bell will take several weeks to cool.
                    When extιicated it ought to be scarcely touched, and should hardly require
                    tuning. This is called its maiden state, and it is one so sought after that many
                    bells are left rough and out of tune in order to claim it.</p>
                <p>A good bell, when struck, yields one note, so that any person with an ear for
                    music can say what it is. This note is called the <hi rend="italic"
                    >consonant,</hi> and when it is distinctly heard the bell is said to be “true.”
                    Any bell of moderate size (little bells cannot well be experimented upon) may be
                    tested in the following manner Tap the bell just on the curve of the top, and it
                    will yield a note one <hi rend="italic">octave</hi> above the consonant. Tap the
                    bell about one quarter’s distance from the top, and it should yield a note which
                    is the <hi rend="italic">quint</hi> or fifth of the octave. Tap it two quarters
                    and a half lower, and it will yield a <hi rend="italic">tierce</hi> or third of
                    the octave. Tap it strongly above the rim where the clapper strikes, and the
                    quint, the tierce, and the octave will now sound simultaneously, yielding the
                    consonant or key-note of the bell.</p>
                <p>If the tierce is too sharp the bell’s note <hi rend="italic">(i.e.,</hi> the
                    consonant) wavers between a tone and a half-tone above it; if the tierce is flat
                    the note wavers between a tone and a half-tone below it; in either case the bell
                    is said to be “false.” A sharp tierce can be flattened by filing away the inside
                    of the bell just where the tierce is struck; but if the bell when cast is found
                    to have a flat tierce there is no remedy. The consonant or key-note of a bell
                    can be slightly sharpened by cutting away the inner rim of the bell, or
                    flattened by filing it a little higher up inside, just above the rim. (See H. R.
                    Haweis’s <hi rend="italic">Music and Morals,</hi> 5th edition, p. 429.)</p>
                <p>The quality of a bell depends not only on the casting and the fineness and
                    mixture of metals, but upon the due proportion of metal to the calibre of the
                    bell. The larger the bell the lower the tone; but if we try to make a large E
                    bell with metal only enough for a smaller F bell, the E bell will be puny and
                    poor. It has been calculated that for a peal of bells to give the pure chord of
                    the ground tone or key-note, third, fifth, and octave, the diameters are
                    required to be as thirty, twenty-four, twenty, fifteen, and the weights as
                    eighty, forty-one, twenty-four, and ten.</p>
                <p>The history of bells is full of romantic interest. In civilized times they have
                    been intimately associated, not only with all kinds of religious and social
                    rights, but with almost every important historical event. Their influence Upon
                    architecture is not less remarkable, for to them indirectly we probably owe all
                    the most famous towers in the world. Grose in his <hi rend="italic"
                    >Antiquities</hi> observes, “Towers at first scarcely rose above the roof, being
                    intended as lanterns for the admission of light, an addition to the height was
                    in all likelihood suggested on the more common use of bells.”</p>
                <p>Bells early summoned soldiers to arms, as well as citizens to bath or senate, or
                    Christians to church. They sounded the alarm in fire or tumult; and the rights
                    of the burghers in their bells were jealously guarded. Thus the chief bell in
                    the cathedral often belonged to the town, not to the cathedral chapter. The
                    curfew, the Carolus, and St Mary’s bell in the Antwerp tower all belong to the
                    town; the rest are the property of the chapter. He who commanded the bell
                    commanded the town; for by that sound, at a moment’s notice, he could rally and
                    concentrate his adherents. Hence a conqueror commonly acknowledged the political
                    importance of bells by melting them down; and the cannon of the conquered was in
                    turn melted up to supply the garrison with bells to be used in the suppression
                    of revolts. Many a bloody chapter in history has been rung in and out by
                    bells.</p>
                <p>On the third day of Easter 1282, at the ringing of the Sicilian vespers, 8000
                    French were massacred in cold blood by John of Procida, who had thus planned to
                    free Sicily from Charles of Anjou. On the 24th of August, St Bartholomew’s day,
                    1571, bells ushered in the massacre of the Huguenots in France, to the number,
                    it is said, of 100,000. Bells have rung alike over slaughtered and ransomed
                    cities; and far and wide throughout Europe in the hour of victory or irreparable
                    loss. At the news of Nelson’s triumph and death at Trafalgar, the bells of
                    Chester rang a merry peal alternated with one deep toll, and similar <pb
                    break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit03newyrich/page/n553/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0903-0553-0538"/> striking incidents could be indefinitely
                    multiplied. It was, however, in the low countries of Belgium and Holland,
                    distracted with incessant civil wars, that, for purely political reasons, bells
                    acquired unique importance.</p>
                <p>But their religious and civil uses may be further noticed. The Ave Mary bell
                    tolled at 6 and 12 to remind men of prayer to the Virgin; the vesper bell for
                    evening prayer; the compline was for the last service of the day. The sanctus,
                    often a handbell, rung at the sacrifice of the mass; the passing bell, at death.
                    The curfew <hi rend="italic">{couvre</hi><hi rend="italic">feu),</hi> introduced
                    by the Conqueror into England, rang at 8 o’clock to extinguish all lights. In
                    many parts of the country and in university towns at 8 and 6 o’clock bells are
                    still rung. At Antwerp cathedral we find the <hi rend="italic">Cloche</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">de Triomphe,</hi> by Dumery; sixteen bells at Sotteghem and
                    several at Ghent and elsewhere bear the same maker’s name. The Horrida, or
                    ancient tocsin at Antwerp, said to date from 1316, is longshaped and is now
                    unused. The curfew in the same tower rings at 5, 12, and 8. The Santa Maria (4⅜
                    tons) first rang when Carl the Bold entered Antwerp 1467. St Antoine is another
                    celebrated bell, and the favourite Carolus, given by Charles V. (7∣ tons), is
                    made of copper, silver, and gold, and valued at .£20,000. At Strasburg we have
                    the Holy Ghost bell, with motto, “0 Rex gloriae Christoe veni cum pace,” and
                    date 1375, 3 nonas Augusti (8 tons), only rung when two fires are seen in the
                    town at once. The recall or storm bell warns travellers in the plain of the
                    storm coming from the Vosges Mountains. The Thor or gate bell, for shutting and
                    opening gates of the city, has been cast three times (1618, 1641, and 1651); it
                    bears the following inscription :—</p>
                <p>“Dieses Thor Glocke das erst mal schallt Als man 161S sahlt</p>
                <p>Dass Mgte jahr regnet man</p>
                <p>Nach doctor Luther Jubal jahr Das Bös hinaus das Gut hinein Zu läuten soll igr
                    arbeit seyn.”</p>
                <p>The Mittags, or 12 o'clock bell, taken down in the French Revolution, bore the
                    motto—</p>
                <p>“Vox ego sum vitae</p>
                <p>Voco vos—orate—venite.”</p>
                <p>From all this it will appear that these Continental bells acquired a strong
                    personality from the feelings and uses with which they were associated; and,
                    indeed, they were formally christened with more ceremony than we give to
                    christening our ships, and were then supposed to have the power of driving away
                    evil spirits, dispersing storms, &amp;c.</p>
                <p>Bell-founding attained perfection in Holland in the 16th and 17th centuries; and
                    the names of Hemony, Dumery, and the Van den Gheyns stand out as the princes of
                    the art. Their bells are still heard throughout the Low Countries, and are
                    plentiful at Amsterdam, Bruges, Ghent, Louvain, Mechlin, and Antwerp. These
                    bells are frequently adorned with bas reliefs of exquisite beauty, such as
                    feathers, forest leaves, fruit, flowers, portraits, or dancing groups, and
                    inscribed with Latin, sometimes bad, but strong, quaint, and often pathetic. We
                    give the preference to Hemony’s small bells, and to Van den Gheyns’s large ones.
                    The names of Deklerk, Claes Noorden and Johann Albert de Grave (1714), Claude
                    and Joseph Plumere (1664), Bartholomew Goethale (1680), and Andrew Steiliert
                    (1563) also occur in Belgium. The following illustrate the nature of
                    inscriptions and mottoes common in Belgium :—“Non sunt loquelae neque sermones
                    audiantur voces eorum, F. Hemony, Amstelodamia, 1658;” “Laudate Domini omnes
                    gentes, F. Hemony, 1674 <hi rend="subscript">;</hi>” and on a Ghent bell—</p>
                <p>“Mynem naem is Roelant</p>
                <p>Als ick clippe dan ist brandt</p>
                <p>Ale ick luyde dan is storm in Vlaenderland. ’</p>
                <p>A common inscription runs—</p>
                <p>“Funera plango, Fulgura frango, Sabbata pango, Excito lentos, Dissipo ventos,
                    Paco cruentos.”</p>
                <p>A few other inscriptions which occur on bells in France and England may be
                    quoted. The bell in the cathedral at Rouen, already mentioned, which was melted
                    down by the Revolutionists in 1793, bore the words—</p>
                <p>“Je suis George d’Ambois Qui trente cinque mille pois Mais lui qui me pesera
                    Trente six mille me trouvera.”</p>
                <p>Bells of the parish church at Winnington,Bedfordshire,had— “Nomina campanis haec
                    indita sunt quoque nostris.” 1st bell.—“Hoc signum Petri pulsatur nomine
                    Christi.” 2d „ “Nomen Magdalene campana sonat melode.”</p>
                <p>8d ,, “Sit nomen Domini benedictum semper in eum.”</p>
                <p>4th ,, “Musa Raphaelis sonat auribus Immanuelis.”</p>
                <p>δth ,, “Sum Rosa pulsata mundique Maria vocata.”</p>
                <p>By an old chartulary it appears that the bells of the Priory of Little Dunmow, in
                    Essex, were in the year 1501 new cast and baptized—</p>
                <p>“Prima in honore Sancti Michaelis Archangeli.</p>
                <p>Secunda in honore Sancti Johannis Evangelist!</p>
                <p>Tertia in honore S. Johannis Baptisti.</p>
                <p>Quarta in honore Assumptionis beatae Mariae.</p>
                <p>Quinta in honore sanctae Trinitatis et omnium sanctorum.”</p>
                <p>In the little sanctum at Westminster, Edward III. built a clocher, and placed in
                    it bells for St Stephen’s chapel, round the largest of which was cast—</p>
                <p>“King Edward made mee thirtye thousand weight and three Take me down and wey
                    mee,</p>
                <p>And more you shall fynd mee.”</p>
                <p>Some of the music played on the carillon clavecin is still extant. We may
                    specially mention the <hi rend="italic">morceaux fugues</hi> discovered by the
                    Chevalier van Elewyck, in the archives at Louvain, the work of the celebrated
                    organist and carilloneur Matthias van den Gheyn (published by Schott and Co.,
                    Brussels and London). This music is as fine in its way as Bach or Handel.</p>
                <p>Quite lately several carillons have been put up in England; and one (1875) is in
                    contemplation for St Paul’s cathedral. The new carillon machinery by Messrs
                    Gillett and Bland of Croydon, now employed almost everywhere in connection with
                    clocks and carillons, is incomparably superior to anything of the kind on the
                    Continent. By its aid the hammer, which falls on the outside of the bell, is
                    raised mechanically instead of by the action of the fist or fingeT on the key;
                    and all that the stroke on the key does is to let it slide off like a
                    hair-trigger, and drop on the bell. Thus the touch of the modern carillon
                    clavecin bids fair to rival that of the organ. The same firm has also invented a
                    bell piano. The chief carillons in England at present are at Boston church,
                    Lincolnshire, Worcester cathedral, Bradford town-hall, Rochdale town-hall, and
                    Shoreditch. Several good peals of bells in London are immortalized in the common
                    nursery rhyme—</p>
                <p>“Gay go up and Gay go down,</p>
                <p>To ring the bells of London town.’</p>
                <p>Bell-ringing by rope is still a popular art in England. The first regular <hi
                    rend="italic">peal</hi> of bells in this country was sent in 1456 by Pope
                    Calixtus III. to King’s College, Cambridge, and was for 300 years the largest
                    peal in England. At the beginning of the 16th century sets of eight bells were
                    hung in a few large churches. In 1668 a famous work on bells, <hi rend="italic"
                    >Tintinalogia,</hi> by T. W. [White], appeared, introducing a sort of
                    bell-notation by printing the bells 1, 2, 3, 4, &amp;c., on slips of paper in
                    different orders according to the changes rung. Of these changes there is a
                    great variety, spoken of technically as hunting, dodging, snapping,
                    place-making, plain-bob, bob-triple, bob-major, bobmajor reversed, double
                    bob-major, grandsire-bob-cator, &amp;c.</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit03newyrich/page/n554/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0903-0554-0539"/>
                <p>The following numbers show how three bells can ring six changes 1, 2, 3; 1, 3, 2;
                    2,1, 3; 2,3,1; 3,1,2; 3, 2,1. Four bells ring four times as many as three, <hi
                    rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> twenty-four; five bells ring five times as many as
                    four, or 120. And it may thus be shown that it would take ninety-one years to
                    ring all the changes upon twelve bells at two strokes a second; whilst
                    twenty-four bells would occupy more than 117 billions of years!</p>
                <p>Bell-ringing is conducted as follows :—Ropes hang through holes in the
                    bell-chamber, and are usually fastened to a wheel for leverage, round which the
                    rope passes. There is a great knack in handling the rope. The first half-pull
                    “drops” the bell, the second “sets” it; it next swings up to the slur-bar, then
                    it swings down and up to the other side, the clapper striking as it ascends.
                    Eight bells make the most perfect peal, tuned in the diatonic scale.</p>
                <p>Bells are struck in three ways,—(1) with a hammer on the outside, let off either
                    by a tambour or revolving drum, similar in appearance to the prickly cylinder of
                    a musical box, which drum can be fitted with tunes or chimes by musical nuts or
                    spikes, and altered at will; (2) the bell can also be struck by hand, as in the
                    common stand of small bells to be seen occasionally in the London streets, the
                    player having a hammer in each hand; or (3) the clapper may strike the bell
                    internally, either being pulled by a rope, the bell being stationary, or by the
                    bell swinging to and fro. If the hammer or clapper be too light the tone of the
                    bell is not properly drawn; if too heavy it will pulverize or crack the bell in
                    time.</p>
                <p>Great reforms are needed in the hanging of bells, a subject to which the
                    Americans have given much attention. What Messrs Gillett and Bland are in
                    England with reference to carillon machinery, the Meneelys of New York are to
                    the ordinary mechanism and hanging of bells. There is hardly a cathedral tower
                    in England where the hanging of one or more bells, or the oscillation of the
                    tower, is not justly complained of. When a bell is hard to ring it is usually on
                    account of its hanging. The leverage is wrongly applied; the wood-work is
                    crowded against the masonry, and many of the finest towers have thus become
                    unsafe.</p>
                <p>There are a few bells of world-wide renown, and several others more or less
                    celebrated. The great bell at Moscow, <hi rend="italic">Tzar Kolokol,</hi>
                    which, according to the inscription, was cast in 1733, was in the earth 103
                    years, and was raised by the Emperor Nicholas in 1836. The present bell seems
                    never to have been actually hung or rung, having cracked in the furnace.
                    Photographs of it are now common, as it stands on a raised platform in the
                    middle of a square. It is used as a chapel. It weighs about 440,000 lb; height,
                    19 feet 3 inches; circumference, 60 feet 9 inches; thickness, 2 feet; weight of
                    broken piece, 11 tons. The second Moscow bell, the largest in the world in
                    actual use, weighs 128 tons. The great bell at Peking weighs 53 tons; Nanking,
                    22 tons; Olmutz, 17 tons; Vienna (1711), 17 tons; Nôtre Dame (1680), 17 tons;
                    Erfurt, one of the finest bell metal, 13 tons; Great Peter, York Minster, which
                    cost .£2000 in 1845, 10 tons; St Paul’s, 5 tons; Great Tom at Oxford, 7 tons;
                    Great Tom at Lincoln, 5 tons. Big Ben of the Westminster clock tower (cracked)
                    weighs between 13 and 14 tons; it was cast by George Mears under the direction
                    of Edward Beckett Denison in 1858. Its four quarters were cast by Warner in
                    1856. The Kaiserglocke of Cologne cathedral, lately recast (1875), weighs 25
                    tons.</p>
                <p>On the varied uses past and present of small bells a volume might be written.
                    Octaves of little bells have been introduced into organs and utilized in the
                    orchestra. FTandringers are still common throughout the country— one man with a
                    bell fitted with a clapper, in each hand, ringing but two notes of the tune in
                    his turn. Upright stands of bells without clappers, struck -with wands, may
                    often be seen in the streets. Bells for horses, dogs, cows, sheep, &amp;c., have
                    already been alluded to. In Italy and elsewhere they are often made of baked
                    earth; these have a very sweet sound, and cost about a penny. For sledges and
                    harness they are of metal, and worn usually in bunches. A bunch of twelve costs
                    about two francs. On the Italian lakes and elsewhere a bell fixed to a floating
                    cork marks the spot where lines or nets are laid for fish. Hunting-hawks were
                    formerly supplied with small bells to facilitate recovery.</p>
                <p>Whilst some uses of bells have gone out, new ones have come in. A few instances
                    will give the reader some idea of the indefinite number of services to which
                    they have been applied. The expression to curse with book, bell, and candle,
                    alludes to an old form of exorcism, in which the bell was used to scare the evil
                    spirit—a function also attributed to larger bells. Bearing the bell alludes to
                    the prize of a silver bell usually given at horse-races to the winner; hence
                    comes what is, after all, only the bell reversed and used as a drinking
                    vesβel—the prize cup. The diving-bell no more comes within the scope of the
                    present article than the dome of a mosque. Certain uses of small bells are fast
                    disappearing. The dustman’s bell is now seldom heard. The towncrier, with his
                    “Oh, yes” <hi rend="italic">(oyez,</hi> hear ye), has been banished to the
                    provinces. The 5 o’clock postman, with his hand-bell to collect letters, went
                    out when the present postal system came in. On the other hand the muffin-bell,
                    the railway-bell, the dock-bell, the half-hour bells at sea, and the stage-bell
                    survive; whilst new applications, unknown to our forefathers, have been
                    introduced. Few people are aware that housebells worked with wires are scarcely
                    100 years old. Long before them, no doubt, handbells had to a great extent
                    superseded the use of the horn, whistle, rattle, clapping of hands, and
                    hammering on the door with a stick, and fir-ebells were in frequent use. The old
                    bell-pulls, which still linger in country inns and mansions, have been replaced
                    by spring handles in the walLs, and these are disappearing from hotels and clubs
                    in favour of electric bells, now so common in railway stations in connection
                    with the telegraph. A current of electricity sets a small hammer in motion, and,
                    in the dark, the stream of sparks between the hammer and bell is clearly
                    visible. In a word, then, it is plain that the whole of civilized life is set to
                    bell music in one shape or another; and although the more important uses of
                    bells have been enumerated, time would fail to mention all their lowly but not
                    less useful functions,—such as the familiar dinner-bell, yard-bell, school-bell,
                    factory-bell, jail-bell, small portable cupola spring-bell (pressed with the
                    hand), spring signal door-bell (used in shops), safety-bell on swinging coil
                    (fastened to shutters or doors); and, not to forget the nursery, the coral and
                    bells, bell-rattles—which call to mind, and are probably relics of, the old
                    fool’s cap and bells and fool’s wand with its crown of jingling baubles, or it
                    may be that the fool’s baubles are copies of the child’s playthings.</p>
                <p>The Rev. ÏÏ. T. Ellacombe, author of various works on bells, gives in his <hi
