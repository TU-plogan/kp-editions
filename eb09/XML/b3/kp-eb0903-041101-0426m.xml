                    Bash-kûrt appears for the first time in the beginning of the 10th century in the
                    writings of Ibn-Foslan, who, describing his travels among the Volga-Bulgarians,
                    mentions the Bashkirs as a warlike and idolatrous race. The name w as not used
                    by the people themselves in the 10th century, but is a mere nickname. It
                    probably points to the fact that the Bashkirs, then as now, were distinguished
                    by their large, round, short, and, possibly, closecropped heads. Of European
                    writers the first to mention the Bashkirs are Plano-Carρini and Rubruquis. These
                    travellers, who fell in with them in the upper parts of the River Ural, call
                    them Pascatir, and assert that they spoke at that time the same language as the
                    Hungarians. Till the arrival of the Mongolians, about the. middle of the 13th
                    century, the Bashkirs were a strong and independent people, and troublesome to
                    their neighbours, the Bulgarians and Pechenegs. At the time of the downfal of
                    the Kazan kingdom they were in a weak state. In 1556 they voluntarily recognized
                    the supremacy of Russia, and, in consequence, the city of Upha was founded to
                    defend them from the Kirghiz, and they w ere subjected to a fur-tax. In 1676
                    they rebelled under a leader named Seit, and were with difficulty reduced; and
                    again in 1707, under Aldar and Kûsyom, on account of ill-treatment by the
                    Russian officials. Their third and last insurrection was in 1735, at the time of
                    the foundation of Orenburg, and it lasted for six years. In 1786 they were freed
                    from taxes; and in 1798 an irregular army was formed from among them. They are
                    now’ divided into thirteen cantons, and each canton into yûrts or districts, the
                    whole being under the jurisdiction of the Orenburg governor-general. In military
                    matters they are subject to an Ataman, chosen from the generals of the army; but
                    in civil affairs the yûrts and cantons are administered by Bashkir officials.
                    They maintain a military cordon, escort caravans through the Kirghiz steppes,
                    and are employed in various other services. By mode of life the Bashkirs are
                    divided into settled and nomadic. The former, who are not distinguishable from
                    the inhabitants of the Tatar villages, are engaged in agriculture,
                    cattle-rearing, and bee-keeping, and live without want. The nomadic portion is
                    subdivided, according to the districts in which they wander, into those of the
                    mountains and those of the steppes. Almost their sole occupation is the rearing
                    of cattle; and they attend to that in a very negligent manner, not collecting a
                    sufficient store of winter fodder for all their herds, but allowing part of them
                    to perish. The Bashkirs are usually very poor, and in winter live partly on a
                    kind of gruel called yûryu, and badly prepared cheese named skûrt. They are
                    hospitable but suspicious, apt to plunder, and to the last degree lazy. They
                    have <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit03newyrich/page/n427/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0903-0427-0412"/> large heads, black hair, eyes narrow and flat,
                    small foreheads, ears always sticking out, and a swarthy skin. In general, they
                    are strong and muscular, and capable of enduring all kinds of labour and
                    privation. They profess Mahometanism, but are little acquainted with its
                    doctrines. In intellectual development they do not stand high.</p>
