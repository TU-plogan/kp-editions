                <p><label type="entry">BILBAO</label>, one of the principal cities of Spain, and
                    capital of the province to which it gives its name, is situated in 43° 14' N.
                    lat. and 2° 56' W. long., in a small but beautiful and fertile valley, bounded
                    on three sides by mountains, about six miles from the sea, on the banks of the
                    River Ansa, which is also known as the Nervion, or, in Basque, as the Ibaizabal.
                    The old town lies on the left bank, while the new town, which is by far the more
                    important, rises on the right in handsome terraces. Communication across the
                    river is afforded by several bridges, of which the oldest, San Antonio, is of
                    stone, and dates from the 14th century; the second was finished in 1827, the
                    third in 1847, and the fourth, an iron structure, in 1868. The houses in the
                    principal streets are built of hewn stone, and are several stories high, with
                    projecting eaves that give shelter both from sun and rain. Many of the streets
                    are very narrow, and they have an appearance of cleanliness and quiet. For a
                    long time no carts or carriages were permitted to enter the city for fear of
                    polluting and injuring the pavement, and the transport of goods was carried on
                    in trucks. The principal promenades are the Paseo del Arenal, which lies along
                    the right bank of the river, the Campo Volantin in the same neighbourhood, and
                    the Paseo de los Canos, so called from its forming the roof of the great
                    aqueduct for conveying the water of the river to the town. The public buildings
                    comprise several churches, of which the oldest, Santiago, is of earlier date
                    than the city itself, the townhall, the palace of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Diputacion Provincial,</hi> an arsenal, a hospital, a theatre, and an abattoir.
                    Of the educational institutions the most important are the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Colegio General de Vizcaya,</hi> a nautical academy, and the schools supported
                    by the board of trade for gratuitous instruction in design, architecture,
                    languages, and mathematics. A bank of issue and discount was founded in 1857.
                    The industrial establishments include iron and steel foundries (for which the
                    town was at one time famous), anchor-forges, potteries, glass-works,
                    paper-mills, and a cotton factory; and leather, sail-cloth, ropes, and tobacco
                    are also manufactured. The exports consist mainly of grain and flour, iron,
                    zinc, and lead ore, wine, madder, liquorice, lamb and goat skins, chestnuts, and
                    oil. The wool trade has ceased for many years, and shipbuilding has greatly
                    declined. A great stimulus was given to the import trade by the construction of
                    the Bilbao and Tudela railway, which was completed in 1863; but the prosperity
                    of the place is hindered by its distance from the sea. Large sums of money have
                    been spent in improving the river, but ships of any size have to discharge at
                    Portugalete, the average depth on the bar being 13⅜ feet at high tides. In spite
                    of this disadvantage, however, Bilbao ranks as one of the principal trading
                    ports in Spain. In 1870 the total tonnage of the ships that entered was 160,952,
                    and the value of the imports amounted to £2,075,900. There is regular steam
                    communication with London and Liverpool. Population, 17,649. Bilbao, or Belvao,
                    was founded about 1300 by Don Pedro Lopez de Haro, and soon rose into
                    importance. It was captured by the French in 1795, and was again held by them
                    from 1808 to 1813. During the Carlist contest it was gallantly defended against
                    Zumalacarregui in 1835.</p>
