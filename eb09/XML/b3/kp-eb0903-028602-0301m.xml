                    river; on the E. by the districts of Kadapa and Karnul; on the S. by the Mysore
                    country; and on the W. by Mysore, and the Bombay district of Dharwar. Its
                    extreme length from north to south is 170 miles, and its breadth from east to
                    west about 120 miles. The area of the district, including 145 square miles of
                    the Sandfir State, is estimated at about 11,496 square miles; according to other
                    returns, the area is 10,857 square miles (excluding Sandfir), of which 1004
                    consists of barren soil, sites of villages, beds of water-courses, Ac., and 9852
                    of lands either actually cultivated or capable of cultivation. The census of
                    1871 returned the population at 1,652,044, of whom 94 per cent, were Hindus. It
                    is estimated that 941,712, or 71 ’ 8 per cent, of the population, live by
                    agriculture. The general aspect of the district is that of an extensive plateau
                    between the Eastern and Western Ghfits, of an average height of from 800 to 1000
                    feet above sealevel. The most elevated tracts are on the W., where the surface
                    rises towards the culminating range of hills, and on the S., where it rises to
                    the elevated table-land of Mysore. Towards the centre the surface of the plain
                    presents a monotonous aspect, being almost treeless, and unbroken <pb break="no"

                    abruptly from the sheet of black soil below. The hill ranges in Ballâri are
                    those of Sandur and Kampli to the W., the Lankâ Malia to the E., and the Copper
                    mountain to the S.W. The last has an elevation of 3148 feet. Th^e district is
                    watered by five hill streams, viz., the Tungbhadrâ, formed by the junction of
                    two small rivers, Tung and Bhadrâ, the Haggari, Hindri, Ponnâr, and Chitravati.
                    The Ponnâr is considered a sacred river by the natives. None of the rivers are
                    navigable, and all are fordable during the dry season.</p>
                <p>The agricultural products of the district are cotton, indigo, wheat, rice,
                    sugar-cane, flax, betel, plantain, turmeric, chillies, onions, hemp, coriander,
                    tobacco, areca-nut, cocoa-nut, oil-seeds, &amp;c. The following is a rough
                    estimate of acreage under different crops :— Food grains, 2,687,000 acres;
                    oil-seeds, 103,000 acres; green and garden crops, 36,000 acres; orchards, 18,000
                    acres; cotton, indigo, and sugar-cane, 37,000 acres; fallow, 541,000 acres;
                    total, 3,922,000 acres. The manufactures of the district consist of cotton
                    goods, tape, carpets, rope, blankets, felts, dyes, oil, sugar and molasses,
                    paper, leather, glass bangles or bracelets, and iron and earthen pots. Cotton,
                    blankets, raw hides, iron, &amp;c., form the articles of export. The chief
                    mineral products are iron, copper, lead, antimony, manganese, alum, and
                    gun-flints. Among precious stones diamonds are found, the chief diamond mines
                    being at Munimadagu and Wajrâ-kanir. The diamonds are collected in the sandstone
                    breccia and conglomerate. The mines no longer yield sufficient profit to be
                    regularly worked, though every now and then diamonds of small value are met
                    with. The revenue of the Ballari district from all sources amounted in 1845 to
                    £257,199; in 1855 to £248,284; and in 1868 to £322,548. The land tax forms the
                    principal source of revenue. In 1868 it yielded £242,684. More than one-fourth
                    of the lands are held as <hi rend="italic">Indm, i.e.,</hi> under grants
                    formerly made for services or for religious purposes. These were very lightly
                    taxed by the native Governments,but the present state of their assessment is not
                    less than that of ordinary lands. The police force numbered 1122 in 1871,
                    maintained at. a cost of £16,012. In 1870-71 the district contained 153 schools,
                    attended by 4274 pupils. It has only seven towns with a population of more than
                    7000 souls—(1), Ballari, population, including troops in the cantonment, 51,145;
                    (2), Hospetta, 9845; (3), Tadipatri, 8182; (4), IIarpanhalli, 7895; (5),
                    Raidrug, 7734; (6), Emmiganur, 7326; and (7), Yadiki, 7202. Only four municipal
                    towns exist in the district :—1. Ballari—population, 51,145; municipal income in
                    1871, £7651; expenditure, £7495; rate of taxation, 2s. 3¾d- per head. 2.
                    Gutti—population, 6033; municipal income, £992; expenditure, £930; rate of
                    taxation, 3s. 3}d. per head. 3. Anantpur—population, 4971; municipal income,
                    £794; expenditure, £784; rate of taxation, 3s. 2∣d. per head. 4. Adoni—municipal
                    income, £2147; expenditure, £1905. Fifty-nine roads, of a total length of 1465
                    miles, connect the different towns and villages in the Ballari district; and the
                    Madras Railway, with a branch to Ballâri, passes through it. The climate of
                    Ballari is characterised by extreme dryness, in consequence of the air passing
                    over a great extent of heated plains, and it has a smaller rainfall than any
                    other district in South India. The average daily range of the thermometer is
                    from 67° to 83°; average rain-fall for the five years ending 1869, 17 inches.
                    The prevailing diseases are cholera, fever, small-pox, ophthalmia, dysentery,
                    and skin diseases among the lower classes. Ballari is subject to disastrous
                    storms and hurricanes, and to famines arising from a series of bad seasons. The
                    storms of 1804 and 1851, and the famines of 1751, 1792, 1793, 1803, 1833, 1854,
                    and 1866 still live in the popular memory.</p>
                <p>Little is known of the early history of the district. It appears to have been a
                    portion of the ancient kingdom of Vijayanagaram, and on the overthrow of that
                    state in 1564 A.D. by the Mahometans, the tract now forming the district of
                    Ballâri λvas split up into a number of military holdings, held by chiefs called
                    Poligârs. In 1635 the Carnatic was annexed to the Bijâpur dominions, from which
                    again it was wrested in 1680 by Sivaji, the founder of the Marhattâ power. It
                    was then »eluded in the dominions of Nizâm-ul-mulk, the nominal viceroy of the
                    Great Mughul in the Dakhin, from whom again it was subsequently conquered by
                    Haidar All of Mysor. At the close of the war with Tipù Sultân in 1792, the
                    territories which now form the Ballari district fell to the share of the Nizam
                    of Haidarâbâd, by whom it was ceded to the British in 1800, in return for a
                    force of English troops to be stationed at his capital. In 1818 the district of
                    Ballâri was constituted as it at present remains. Amidst all these political
                    convulsions the little state of Sandιir, occupying a central position in the
                    Ballâri district, and surrounded by a cordon of hills, preserved its integrity.
                    Sandur can only be entered by one of three principal natural passes, viz., the
                    Bhimagundi pass on the N.E., the Râmanagundi pass on the N., and the Oblagundi
                    pass on the W. Its chief is the representative of one of the most ancient
                    Marhattâ families, and derives a revenue of £4500 from his state. He now holds
                    Sandιir as a <hi rend="italic">Jâgir</hi> or a military tenure from our
                    Government, but pays no tribute.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Ballârî,</hi> the principal town of the above district, is
                    the chief seat of the judicial and revenue establishments, and the headquarters
                    of the military force iu the ceded districts consisting of Ballâri and Kadapa.
                    The fort rises from a huge mass of granitic rocks, which jut up abruptly to a
                    height of 450 feet above the plain, with a circumference of nearly 2 miles. Its
                    length from north-east to south-west is about 1150 feet. To the E. and S. of the
                    Ballâri rock lies a heap of boulders irregularly piled one on the other, but to
                    the W. is an unbroken surface of sheet-rock, while the N. is walled by bare
                    rugged ridges. Ballâri rock is defended by two distinct lines of works, the
                    upper and the lower fort. The upper fort is a quadrangular building on the
                    summit of the rock, with only one way up to it, and deemed impregnable by the
                    Mysore princes. But as it has no accommodation for a garrison, it is now
                    unoccupied by our troops, with the exception of a small guard in charge of
                    prisoners. The ex-Nawâb of Karnul was confined in it for forty years for the
                    murder of his wife. It contains several tanks or cisterns excavated in the rock.
                    Outside the turreted rampart are a ditch and covered way. The lower fort lies at
                    the eastern base of the rock, and measures about half a mile in diameter. It
                    contains the barracks for our troops, the arsenal and commissariat stores, the
                    Protestant church, orphanage, Masonic lodge, post-office, and numerous private
                    dwellings. The fort of Ballâri was originally built by one Timmapa, in the 16th
                    century. It was first dependent on the kingdom of Vijayanagaram, afterwards on
                    Bijâpur, and subsequently subject to the Nizâm and Haidar All The latter
                    improved the fortifications with the assistance of French artisans, whom he
                    afterwards hanged for not building the fort on a higher rock adjacent to it. The
                    cantonment bâzâr of Ballâri enjoys the reputation of being the best military
                    bâzâr in Southern India. To the W. of the rock are the regimental lines for two
                    Native infantry regiments, one European regiment, and one regiment of cavalry.
                    On the E. are the jail, the public courts, and the terminus of the branch line
                    of the Madras Railway. Ballâri town, including the cantonment, contained in 1866
                    a population of 37,015 'souls, of which 13,341 were Hindus, 4178 Mahometans, and
                    1042 Christians. Population ascertained by the census of 1871, 51,145. Elevation
                    above the sea, 1600 feet. Distance from Bombay, S.E., 380 miles; from Madras,
                    N.W., 270 miles. Lat. 15° 18' N.; long. 76° 59' E.</p>
