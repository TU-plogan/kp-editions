                    population of the country. It is doubtful whether the god meant was Merodach or
                    Anu, Merodach being the patron divinity of Babylon in the Semitic period, and
                    Su-Anna, “the valley of Anu” (Anammelech), being one of its oldest name3∙
                    Another synonym of the place was <hi rend="italic">Ed,</hi> “the hollow,” in
                    reference to its situation, and it was also known, down to the latest times, as
                    Din-Tir, “the house of the jungle,” though this seems properly to have been the
                    designation of the town on the left bank of the Euphrates. Under the Cassite
                    dynasty of Khammuragas, it received the title of Gan-Duniyas or Gun-Duni, “the
                    Fortress of Duniyas,” which was afterwards made to include the neighbouring
                    territory, so that the whole of Babylonia came to be called by this name. Sir H.
                    Rawlinson has suggested that it was the origin of the Biblical Gan Eden, or
                    “Garden of Eden,” to which a popular etymology has given a Hebrew form. However
                    this may be, Babylon figures in the antediluvian history of Berosus, the first
                    of his mythical monarchs, Alorus, being a native of it. The national epic of the
                    Babylonians, which grouped various old myths round the adventures of a solar
                    hero, knows of four cities only—Babylon, Erech, Nipur <hi rend="italic"
                    >{Niffer)</hi> or Calneh, and Surippac or Larankha; and according to Genesis x.,
                    Babylon was a member of the tetrapolis of Shinar or Sumir, where the Semite
                    invaders of the Accadians first obtained permanent settlement and power. It
                    seems, however, to have ranked below its three sister-cities, among which Erech
                    took the lead until conquered by the Accadian sovereigns of Ur. It was not until
                    the conquest of Khammuragas that Babylon became a capital, a position, however,
                    which it never afterwards lost, except during the Assyrian supremacy. But it
                    suffered severely at the hands of its northern neighbours. Tiglath-Adar drove
                    the Cassi from it, and established an Assyrian dynasty in their place; and after
                    being captured by Tiglath-Pileser I. (1130 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.)</hi> and
                    Shalmaneser (851 B.C.), it became a dependency of the Assyrian empire in the
                    reign of the son of the latter. The decline of the first Assyrian empire
                    restored Babylon to independence; but it had soon afterwards to submit to the
                    Caldai, and from the reign of Tiglath-Pileser II. to the death of
                    Assur-bani-pal, it was a mere provincial town of Assyria, breaking now and then
                    into fierce revolt under the leadership of the Caldai, and repeatedly taken and
                    plundered by Sargon, Sennacherib, and Assur-bani-paL Sennacherib, indeed, razed
                    the city to its foundations. After the defeat of Suzub (690 <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >b.c.</hi>), he tells us that he “pulled down, dug up, and burned with fire the
                    town and the palaces, root and branch, destroyed the fortress and the double
                    wall, the temples of the gods and the towers of brick, and threw the rubbish
                    into the Araxes,” the river of Babylon. After this destruction it is not likely
                    that much will ever be discovered on the site of Babylon older than the
                    buildings of Essar-haddon and Nebuchadnezzar. It was under the latter monarch
                    and his successors that Babylon became the huge metropolis whose ruins still
                    astonish the traveller, and which was described by Greek writers. Of the older
                    city we can know but little. The Babylon of Nebuchadnezzar and his father,
                    Nabopolassar, must have suffered when taken by Cyrus; but two sieges in the
                    reign of Darius Hystaspis, and one in the reign of Xerxes, brought about the
                    destruction of the defences, while the monotheistic rule of Persia allowed the
                    temples to fall into decay. Alexander found the great temple of Bel a shapeless
                    ruin, and the rise of Seleucia in its neighbourhood drew away its population and
                    completed its material decay. The buildings became a quarry, first for Seleucia
                    and then for Ctesiphon,AlModain, Baghdad, Kufa, Kerbelah, Hillah,and other
                    towns, and our only cause for wonder is that the remains of the great capital of
                    Babylonia are still so extensive.</p>
                <p>The principal of these lie on the left bank of the Euphrates, and consist of
                    three vast mounds—the <hi rend="italic">Babil</hi> or <hi rend="italic"
                    >Mujellibe,</hi> the <hi rend="italic">Kasr,</hi> and the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Aπιτdm,</hi> which run from north to south; two parallel lines of rampart east
                    and west of them; and an isolated mass, together with a series of elevations
                    separated by the river westward of the <hi rend="italic">Kasr,—</hi> the whole
                    being surrounded by a triangular rampart. Cur two chief authorities for the
                    ancient topography of the city are Herodotus and Ctesias; and though both were
                    eye-witnesses, their statements differ considerably. The city was built, we are
                    told, on both sides of the river, in the form of a square, and enclosed within a
                    double row of high walls. Ctesias adds a third wall, but the inscriptions refer
                    only to two; the inner <hi rend="italic">enceinte,</hi> called Imgur-Bel, and
                    its <hi rend="italic">salkhu</hi> or outwork, called Nimitti-BeL Ctesias makes
                    the outermost wall 360 stades (42 miles) in circumference, while according to
                    Herodotus it measured 480 stades (56 miles), which would include an area of
                    about 200 square miles! Pliny (√V^. <hi rend="italic">H.,</hi> vi. 26) follows
                    Herodotus in his figures, but Strabo (xvi 1, 5) with his 385 stades, Qu. Curtius
                    (v. 1, 26) with his 368 stades, and Clitarchus (ap. Diod. Sic., ii. 7) with 365
                    stades, agree sufficiently closely with Ctesias. Even the estimate of Ctesias,
                    however, would make Babylon cover a space of about 100 square miles, nearly five
                    times the size of London. Such an area could not have been occupied by houses,
                    especially as these were three or four stories high (Hdt., i. 180). Indeed Q.
                    Curtius asserts (v. 1, 27) that even in the most flourishing times, nine-tenths
                    of it consisted of gardens, parks, fields, and orchards. According to Herodotus,
                    the height of the walls was about 335 feet, and their width 85 feet; while
                    Ctesias makes the height about 300 feet. Later writers give smaller dimensions,
                    but it is clear that they have merely tried to soften down the estimates of
                    Herodotus (and Ctesias); and we seem bound, therefore, to accept the statement
                    of the two oldest eye-witnesses, astonishing as it is. But we may remember that
                    the ruined wall of Nineveh was 150 feet high, even in Xenophon’s time <hi
                    rend="italic">(Andb.,</hi> iii. 4, 10, and <hi rend="italic">cf.</hi> ii. 4,
                    12), while the spaces between the 250 towers irregularly disposed along the wall
                    of Babylon (Ctes. ap. Diod., ii. 7) were broad enough to allow a four-horse
                    chariot to turn (Hdt., i. 179). The clay dug from the moat had served for the
                    bricks of the wall, which was pierced with 100 gates, all of brass, with brazen
                    lintels and posts. The two inner enclosures were faced with coloured brick, and
                    represented hunting-scenes. Two other walls ran along the banks of the Euphrates
                    and the quays with which it was lined, each containing 25 gates, which answered
                    to the number of the streets they led into. Ferry-boats plied between the
                    landing-places of the gates; and a movable drawbridge (30 feet broad), supported
                    on stone piers, joined the two parts of the city together. At each end of the
                    bridge was a palace; the great palace of Nebuchadnezzar on the eastern side (the
                    modern <hi rend="italic">Kasr),</hi> which Herodotus incorrectly transfers to
                    the western bank, being the most magnificent of the two. It was surrounded,
                    according to Diodorus (ii. 8, 4), by three <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit03newyrich/page/n198/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0903-0198-0183"/> walls, the outermost being 60 stades (7 miles) in
                    circuit. The inner walls were decorated with hunting-scenes painted on brick,
                    fragments of which have been discovered by modern explorers. Two of its gates
                    were of brass, and had to be opened and shut by a machine; and Mr Smith has
                    found traces of two libraries among its ruins. The palace, called “the
                    Admiration of Mankind” by Nebuchadnezzar, and commenced by Nabopolassar,
                    overlooked the Ai-ipur-sabu, the great reservoir of Babylon, and stretched from
                    'this to the Euphrates on the one side, and from the Imgur-Bel, or inner wall,
                    to the Libil, or eastern canal, on the other. Within its precincts rose the
                    Hanging Gardens, consisting of a garden of trees and flowers on the topmost of a
                    series of arches at least 75 feet high, and built in the form of a square, each
                    side measuring 400 Greek feet. Water was raised from the Euphrates by means, it
                    is said, of a screw (Strab., xvi 1, 5; Diod., ii. 10, 6). Some of the materials
                    for the construction of this building may have been obtained from the old ruined
                    palace of the early kings, now represented by the adjoining Amrâm mound. The
                    lesser palace in the western division of the city belonged to Neriglissar, and
                    contained a number of bronze statues.</p>
                <p>The most remarkable edifice in Babylon was the temple of Bel, now marked by the
                    <hi rend="italic">Babil,</hi> on the north-east, as Professor Rawlinson has
                    shown. It was a pyramid of eight square stages, the basement stage being over
                    200 yards each way. A winding ascent led to the summit and the shrine, in which
                    stood a golden image of Bel 40 feet high, two other statues of gold, a golden
                    table 40 feet long and 15 feet broad, and many other colossal objects of the
                    same precious material. At the base of the tower was a second shrine, with a
                    table and two images of solid gold. Two altars were placed outside the chapel,
                    the smaller one being of the same metaL A similar temple, represented by the
                    modern <hi rend="italic">Birs Nimrud,</hi> stood at Borsippa, the suburb of
                    Babylon. Γt consisted of seven stages, each ornamented with one of the seven
                    planetary colours, the azure tint of the sixth, the sphere of Mercury, being
                    produced by the vitrifaction of the bricks after the stage had been completed.
                    The lowest stage was a square, 272 feet each way, its four corners exactly
                    corresponding to the four cardinal points, as in all other Chaldean temples, and
                    each of the square stages raised upon it being placed nearer the south-western
                    than the north-eastern edge of the underlying one. It had been partly built by
                    an ancient monarch, but, after lying unfinished for many years, like the
                    Biblical tower of Babel, was finally completed by Nebuchadnezzar.</p>
                <p>The amount of labour bestowed upon these brick edifices must have been enormous,
                    and gives some idea of the human force at the disposal of the monarch. If any
                    further illustration of this fact were needed, it would be found in the
                    statement made by Nebuchadnezzar in one of his inscriptions (and quoted also
                    from Berosus), that he had finished the Imgur-Bel in fifteen days. The same
                    monarch also continued the embankment of the Euphrates for a considerable
                    distance beyond the limits of Babylon, and cut some canals to carry off the
                    overflow of that river into the Tigris. The great reservoir, 40 miles square, on
                    the west of Borsippa, which had been excavated to receive the waters of the
                    Euphrates while the bed of its channel was being lined with brick, was also used
                    for a similar purpose. The reservoir seems to have been entered by the Arakhtu
                    or Araxes, “the river of Babylon,” ∙which flowed through a deep wady into the
                    heart of Northern Arabia, as Wetzstein has pointed out. Various nomad tribes,
                    such as the Nabathaeans or the Pekod, pitched their tents on its banks; but,
                    although it is not unfrequently mentioned in early Babylonian history, we hear
                    no more of it after the time of Nebuchadnezzar. It is possible, therefore, that
                    it was drained by the western reservoir, <hi rend="smallcaps">(a. h.
