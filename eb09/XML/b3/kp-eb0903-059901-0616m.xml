                <p><label type="entry">BERMUDAS, <hi rend="smallcaps">Somers’s Islands</hi>, or <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Summer Islands</hi></label>, a group in the Atlantic Ocean, the
                    seat of a British colony, in lat. 32° 20' N. and long. 64° 50' W., about 600
                    miles E. by S. from Cape Hatteras on the American coast. They lie to the south
                    of a coral reef or atoll, which extends about 24 miles in length from N.E. to
                    S.W., by 12 in breadth. The largest of the series is Great Bermuda, or Long
                    Island, enclosing on the east Harrington or Little Sound, and on the west the
                    Great Sound, which is thickly studded with islets, and protected on the north by
                    the islands of Somerset, Boaz, and Inland. The remaining members of the group,
                    St George’s, Paget’s, Smith’s, St David’s, Cooper’s, Nonsuch, &amp;c., lie to
                    the east, and form a semicircle round Castle Harbour. The islands are wholly
                    composed of a white granular limestone of various degrees of hardness, from the
                    crystalline “base rock,” as it 13 called, to friable grit. It seems that they
                    are in a state of subsidence and not of elevation. The caves which usually
                    appear in limestone formations are well represented, many of them running far
                    into the land and displaying a rich variety of stalagmites and stalactites.
                    Among the less ordinary geological phenomena may be mentioned the “sand glacier”
                    at Elbow Bay. The surface soil is a curious kind of red earth, which is also
                    found in ochre-like strata throughout the limestone. It is generally mixed with
                    vegetable matter and coral sand. There is a total want of streams and wells of
                    fresh water, and the inhabitants are dependent on the rain, which they collect
                    and preserve in tanks. The climate of the Bermudas has a reputation for
                    unhealthiness which is hardly borne out, for the ordinary death-rate is only 22
                    per 1000. Yellow fever and typhus, however, have on some occasions raged with
                    extreme violence, and the former has appeared four times within the space of
                    thirty years. The maximum reading of the thermometer is about 85*8, and its
                    minimum 49,—the mean annual temperature being 70° Fahr., and that of March 65°.
                    Vegetation is very rapid, and the soil is clad in a mantle of almost perpetual
                    green. The principal kind of tree is the so-called “Bermudas cedar,” really a
                    species of juniper, which furnishes timber for small vessels. The shores are
                    fringed with the mangrove; the prickly pear grows luxuriantly in the most barren
                    districts; and wherever the ground is left to itself the sage-bush springs up
                    profusely. The citron, sour orange, lemon, and lime grow wild; but the apple and
                    peach do not come to perfection. The loquat, an introduction from China, thrives
                    admirably. The gooseberry, currant, and raspberry, all run to wood. The oleander
                    bush, with all its beauty, is almost a nuisance. The soil is very fertile in the
                    growth of esculent plants and roots; and a considerable trade has grown up
                    within recent years between Bermudas and New York, principally in arrowroot, of
                    excellent quality, onions, Irish potatoes, and tomatoes. Regular steam
                    communication between the island and that city is maintained, the Government
                    subsidizing the vessels. The total value of the export of these articles in 1872
                    was £64,030. Medicinal plants, as fhe castor-oil plant, aloe, and jalap, come to
                    great perfection without culture; and coffee, indigo, cotton, and tobacco are
                    also of spontaneous growth. Tobacco curing ceased about 1707. Few oxen or sheep
                    are reared in the colony, a supply being obtained from North America; but goats
                    are kept by a large number of the inhabitants. The ass is the usual beast of
                    burden. The indigenous Mammalia are very few, and the only Reptilia are a small
                    lizard and the green turtle. Birds, however, especially aquatic species, are
                    very numerous,—one of the commonest being the cardinal-grosbeak. The list
                    includes the cat-bird, blue-bird, kingfisher, ground-dove, blue heron,
                    sandpiper, moorhen, tropic bird, and Carolina crake. Insects are comparatively
                    few; but ants swarm destructively in the heat of the year, and a species of
                    ant-lion, a cicada (scissor-grinder), and the chigre or jigger, are common. Fish
                    are plentiful round the coasts, and the whale-fishery was once an important
                    industry. Gold-fish, introduced from Demerara, swarm in the ditches.</p>
                <p>There are two towns in the Bermudas, St George’s, founded in 1794, and Hamilton,
                    founded in 1790, and incorporated in 1793. The former was the capital till the
                    senate and courts of justice were removed by Sir James Cockburn to Hamilton,
                    which being centrally situated, is much more convenient. The streets of St
                    George’s are close and narrow, and the drainage bad. It is a military station,
                    the barracks lying to the east of the town. The population is about 2000.
                    Hamilton, in the Great Bermuda, at the bottom of a bay which is entered by
                    Trenblin’s Narrows, consists of an irregular half-street fronting a line of
                    wharves. Its principal buildings include a court-house, a legislative assembly
                    house, a council room, a library (1839), a jail, and a large church. About a
                    mile from the town is Langton, the governor’s residence. In Inland Island is
                    situated the royal dockyard and naval establishment. A hospital stands on the
                    highest point, and a lunatic asylum has also been built. The bay is defended by
                    a breakwater. On Boaz Island there is a convict station. A causeway, opened in
                    1871, runs from St George’s through Longbird Island westward, across Castle
                    Harbour. The harbour of St George’s has space enough to accommodate the whole
                    British navy; yet, till deepened by blasting, the entrance was so narrow as to
                    render it almost useless. A marine slip was constructed in 1865, with a capacity
                    of 1200 tons. The chief military establishment is at Prospect <pb break="no"

                    appointed by the Crown, and a privy council of nine members appointed by the
                    governor. The House of Assembly consists of thirty-six members, who receive
                    salaries. The Acts are usually passed for a definite period, and require to be
                    renewed from time to time. Much of the judicial administration is left to unpaid
                    magistrates. The currency of the colony, which had formerly twelve shillings to
                    the pound sterling, was assimilated to that of England in 1842. The colony is
                    ecclesiastically attached to the bishopric of Barbados. Both Presbyterians and
                    Wesleyans are endowed. There are numerous schools, and in 1847 an educational
                    board was established; but the general educational condition is unsatisfactory.
                    Of 2600 children between the ages of five and six, only about 1500 attend
                    school. Sunday schools are of much greater importance than in England, and most
                    of them have libraries. The revenue of the islands in 1872 was £33,256,
                    inclusive of £1500 raised by loan; the gross expenditure was £32,236; and the
                    public debt amounted to £17,330. The population in 1850 was 11,092, of whom 4669
                    were whites; by the census of 1871 it had increased to 12,121.</p>
                <p>The discovery of the Bermtιdas resulted from the shipwreck of Juan Bermudez, a
                    Spaniard (whose name they now bear), when on a voyage from Spain to Cuba with a
                    cargo of hogs, about the year 1522. Henry May, an Englishman, suffered the same
                    fate in 1593; and lastly, Sir George Somers shared the destiny of the two
                    preceding navigators in 1609. Sir George was the first who established a
                    settlement upon them, but he died before he had fully accomplished his design.
                    In 1612 the Bermudas were granted to an offshoot of the Virginia Company, which
                    consisted of 120 persons, 60 of whom, under the command of Mr Henry More,
                    proceeded to the islands; and an accession of inhabitants was gained during the
                    civil wars, many having sought a refuge from the tyranny of the ruling party in
                    this distant sanctuary. Into the details of the history we cannot enter, but the
                    following items are important. The first source of colonial wealth was the
                    growing of tobacco; and at a later period the produce of the salt-lagoons at
                    Turk’s Island became a main article of trade. In 1726 Berkeley chose the Summer
                    Islands as the seat of his projected missionary establishment. The first
                    newspaper, the <hi rend="italic">Bermuda Gazette,</hi> was published in 1784.
