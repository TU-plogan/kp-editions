                <p><label type="entry">BETUL</label>, a hilly district of British India, in the
                    Central Provinces, comprising the westernmost section of the great Sâtpurâ
                    plateau, ßituated between 21° 20' and 22° 35' N. lat., and 77° 20' and 78° 35'
                    E. long. It is bounded on the N. by the Hoshangâbâd district and the Makrâi
                    territory, on the E. by the district of Chhindwârâ, on the S. by the
                    commissionership of West Berars, and on the W. by the district of Hoshangâbâd.
                    The area is about 4118 square miles; the population, as ascertained by the
                    census of 1866, 258,335. In 1872 the population had increased to 284,055, of
                    whom 168,788 were Hindus, 4555 Mahometans, 937 Buddhists and Jains, 19
                    Christians, and 109,756 aborigines; population, 69 per square mile. The mean
                    elevation of the district above the sea is about 2000 feet. The country is
                    essentially a highland tract, divided naturally into three distinct portions,
                    differing in their superficial aspects, the character of their soil, and their
                    geological formation. The northern part of the district forms an irregular plain
                    of the sandstone formation. It is a well-wooded tract, in many places stretching
                    out in charming glades like an English <pb break="no"

                    little cultivated land. In the extreme north a line of hill rises abruptly out
                    of the great plain of the Narbadâ valley. The central tract alone possesses a
                    rich soil, well watered by the Machnâ and Sâmpna rivers, almost entirely
                    cultivated and studded with villages. To the south lies a rolling plateau of
                    basaltic formation (with the sacred town of Multâi, and the springs of the River
                    Tapti at its highest point), extending over the whole of the southern face of
                    the district, and finally merging into the wild and broken liae of the Ghâts,
                    which lead down to the plains. This tract consists of a succession of stony
                    ridges of trap rock, enclosing valleys or basins of fertile soil, to which
                    cultivation is for the most part confined, except where the shallow soil on the
                    tops of the hills has been turned to account.</p>
                <p>The principal rivers of the district arc the Tapti, Wardha, Bel Madina, Sampnâ,
                    Morar, and Tawâ. The Tapti rises a few miles from Multâi, traverses the southern
                    part of the district, and then plunges into the gorge of the Sâtpurâ hills,
                    formed on the one side by the Chikaldâ hills of Berar, and on the other side by
                    the wild Kalibhit hills of Hoshangâbâd. The Wardha can hardly be called a river
                    of the district, as it merely takes its rise in the Sâtpurâ hills on the
                    south-eastern boundary. The River Bel also rises in the high plateau of Betul,
                    and forms one of the chief affluents of the Kanhân. The Machnâ and Sampnä rise
                    among the hills that shut in the rich basin of the district They unite their
                    waters at the town of Betùl, force their way through the Sâtpurâ range, and join
                    the Tawâ near Shâhpur. The Moran rises in the Satpurâ hills within the district,
                    and enters Hoshangâbâd near the town of Seoni. The Tawâ rises in Chhindwârâ, and
                    flowing for a short distance through the northcast corner of this district,
                    eventually joins the Narbadâ above Hoshangâbâd. These are the rivers of
                    importance; but throughout the district, and more especially amid the trap
                    formation, there are a number of smaller streams useful for irrigation. The
                    principal agricultural products of the district are wheat and pulses, more than
                    three-fourths of the open lands being devoted to these crops. The other products
                    are cotton, rice, millet, rye, sugar-cane, and opium. The area under sugar-cane
                    cultivation is estimated at 2400 acres, the juice extracted from it being
                    exported in its raw state. The principal agricultural tribe is the Kunbis, many
                    of whom are modern immigrants from Northern India. The aboriginal Gonds are
                    found in all the wild jungle villages, where they follow the nomadic system of
                    cultivation known as the <hi rend="italic">ddhya.</hi> Extensive forests occupy
                    some 700 square miles of the district area, and yield teak and other good
                    timber. Coal occurs in many parts of the district, but is not worked, as except
                    at one place not a single seam has been found exceeding 3 feet in thickness, and
                    it is doubtful if a seam of that thickness can be profitably mined in India.
                    District revenues in 1868-69—land revenue, £19,159; excise, £7219; assessed
                    taxes, £1136; forests, £1218; stamps, £2743; total, £31,475. Strength of regular
                    constabulary and town police, 333 men; cost, £3857 per annum.</p>
                <p>Little is known of the early history of the district except that it must have
                    been the centre of the first of the four ancient Gond kingdoms of Kherlâ,
                    Deogarh, Mandla, and Chândâ. According to Farishtâ, these kingdoms engrossed in
                    1398 all the hills of Gondwânâ and adjacent countries, and were of great wealth
                    and power. About the year 1418 Sultân Husain Shâh of Mâlwa invaded Kherlâ, and
                    reduced it to a dependency. Nine years later the Râjâ rebelled, but although
                    with the help of the Bâhmini kings of the Deccan he managed for a time to assert
                    his independence, he was finally subdued and deprived of his territories. In
                    1467 Kherlâ was seized by the Bâhmini king, but was afterwards restored to
                    Mâlwa. A century later the kingdom of Mâlwa became incorporated into the
                    dominions of the emperor of Delhi. In 1703 a Musâlman convert of the Gond tribe
                    held the country, and in 1743 Raghuji Bhonslâ, the Marhattâ ruler of Berar,
                    annexed it to his dominions. The Marhattâs in the year 1818 ceded this district
                    to the East India Company as payment for a contingent, and by the treaty of 1826
                    it was formally incorporated with the British possessions. Detachments of
                    British troops were stationed at Multâi, Betul, and Shâhpur to cut off the
                    retreat of Apâ Sâhib, the Marhattâ general, and a military force was quartered
                    at Betul until June 1862. The ruined city of Kherlâ formed the seat of
                    government under the Gonds and preceding rulers, and hence the district was,
                    until the time of its annexation to the British dominions, known as the “Kherlâ
                    Sarkâr.” The town of Multâi contains an artificial tank, from the centre of
                    which the Tapti is said to take its rise; hence the reputed sanctity of the
                    spot, and the accumulation of temples in its honour.</p>
                <p>The climate of Betul is fairly salubrious. Its height above the plains and the
                    neighbourhood of extensive forests moderate the heat, and render the temperature
                    pleasant throughout the greater part of the year. During the cold season the
                    thermometer at night falls below the freezing point; little or no hot wind is
                    felt before the end of April, and even then it ceases after sunset. The nights
                    in the hot season are comparatively cool and pleasant. During the monsoon the
                    climate is very damp, and at times even cold and raw, thick clouds and mist
                    enveloping the sky for many days together. The average annual rainfall is 40
                    inches. In the denser jungles malaria prevails for months after the cessation of
                    the rains, but the Gonds do not appear to suffer much from its effects.
                    Travellers and strangers who venture into these jungles run the risk of fever of
                    a severe type at almost all seasons of the year.</p>
