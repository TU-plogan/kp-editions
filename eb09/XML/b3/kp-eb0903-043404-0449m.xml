                <p><label type="entry">BATHS</label>. In the ordinary acceptation of the word a bath
                    is the immersion of the body in a medium different from the ordinary one of
                    atmospheric air, which medium is usually common water in some form. In another
                    sense it includes the nature of the different media that may be used, and of the
                    various arrangements by which they are applied. Perhaps the simplest method of
                    presenting a general view of the whole subject is first to give an outline of
                    the history of baths in all ages, and next to give some account of the
                    principles on which baths act on the human system.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Ancient Baths.—</hi> Bathing, as serving both for cleanliness
                    and for pleasure, has been almost instinctively practised by nearly every
                    people. The most ancient records mention bathing in the rivers Nile and Ganges.
                    From an early period the Jews bathed in running water, used both hot and cold
                    baths, and employed oils and ointments. So also did the Greeks; their earliest
                    and commonest form of bathing was swimming in rivers, and bathing in them was
                    practised by both sexes. Warm baths were, according to Homer, used after fatigue
                    or exercise. The Athenians appear for a long time only to have had private
                    baths, but afterwards they had public ones: the latter seem to have originated
                    among the Lacedaemonians, who invented the hot-air bath, at least the form of it
                    called after them, the <hi rend="italic">Laconicum.</hi> Although the baths of
                    the Greeks were not so luxurious as those of some other nations, yet effeminate
                    people were accused among them of using warm baths in excess; and the bath
                    servants appear to have been rogues and thieves, as in later and larger
                    establishments. The Persians must have had haudsomely equipped baths, for
                    Alexander the Great admired the luxury of the baths of Darius.</p>
                <p>But the baths of the Greeks, and probably of all Eastern nations, were on a small
                    scale as compared with those which eventually sprung up among the Romans. In
                    early times the Romans used after exercise to throw themselves into the Tiber.
                    Next, when ample supplies of water were brought into the city, large <hi
                    rend="italic">piscines,</hi> or cold swimming baths, were constructed, the
                    earliest of which appear to have been the <hi rend="italic">piscina</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">publica</hi> (312 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi>), near the Circus
                    Maximus, supplied by the Appian aqueduct, the <hi rend="italic">lavacrum</hi> of
                    Agrippina, and a bath at the end of the Clivus Capitolinus. Next, small public
                    as well as private baths were built; and with the empire more luxurious forms of
                    bathing were introduced, and warm became far more popular than cold baths.</p>
                <p>Public baths or <hi rend="italic">balneae</hi> were first built in Rome after
                    Clodius brought in the supply of water from Praeneste. After that date baths
                    began to be common both in Rome and in other Italian cities; and private baths,
                    which gradually came into use, w ere attached to the villas of the wealthy
                    citizens. Maecenas was one of the first who built public baths at his own
                    expense. After his time each emperor, as he wished to ingratiate himself with
                    the people, lavished the revenues of the state in the construction of enormous
                    buildings, which not only contained suites of bathing apartments, but included
                    gymnasia, and sometimes even theatres and libraries. Such enormous
                    establishments went by the name of <hi rend="italic">thermos.</hi> The principal
                    thermae were those of Agrippa 21 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.,</hi> of Nero 65 <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">a.d.,</hi> of Titus 81, of Domitian 95, of Commodus 185, of
                    Caracalla 217, and still later those of Diocletian 302, and of Constantine. The
                    technical skill displayed by the Romans in rendering their walls and the sides
                    of reservoirs impervious to moisture, in conveying and heating water, and in
                    constructing flues for the conveyance of hot air through the walls, was of the
                    highest order.</p>
                <p>The Roman baths contained swimming baths, warm baths, baths of hot air, and
                    vapour baths. The chief rooms (which in the largest baths appear to have been
                    mostly distinct, whereas in smaller baths one chamber was made to do duty for
                    more than a single purpose) were the following :—(1.) The <hi rend="italic"
                    >apodyterium</hi> or <hi rend="italic">spoliatorium,</hi> where the bathers
                    undressed; (2.) the <hi rend="italic">alipterium</hi> or <hi rend="italic"
                    >unctuarium,</hi> where oils and ointments were kept (although the bathers often
                    brought their own pomades), and where the <hi rend="italic">aliptce</hi>
                    anointed the bathers; (3.) The <hi rend="italic">frigidarium</hi> or cool room,
                    <hi rend="italic">cella frigida,</hi> in which usually was the cold bath, the
                    <hi rend="italic">piscina</hi> or <hi rend="italic">baptisterium</hi>; (4.) The
                    <hi rend="italic">tepidarium,</hi> a room moderately heated, in which the
                    bathers rested for a time, but which was not meant for bathing; (5.) The <hi
                    rend="italic">calidarium</hi> or heating room, over the <hi rend="italic"
                    >hypocaustum</hi> or furnace; this in its commonest arrangement had at one end a
                    warm bath, the <hi rend="italic">alveus</hi> or <hi rend="italic">calida
                    lavatio</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> at the other end in a sort of alcove was
                    (6.) The <hi rend="italic">sudatorium</hi> or <hi rend="italic">laconicum,</hi>
                    which usually had a <hi rend="italic">labrum</hi> or large vessel containing
                    water, with which bathers sprinkled themselves to help in rubbing off the
                    perspiration. In the largest baths the laconicum was probably a separate
                    chamber, a circular domical room with recesses in the sides, and a large opening
                    in the top; but there is no well-preserved specimen, unless that at Pisa may be
                    so regarded. In the drawing of baths from the thermae of Titus (fig. 1), the
                    laconicum is represented as a small cupola rising in a corner of the calidarium.
                    It is known that the temperature of the laconicum was regulated by drawing up or
                    down a metallic plate or <hi rend="italic">clypeus.</hi> Some think that this
                    clypeus was directly over the flames of the hypocaustum, and that when it was
                    withdrawn, the flames must have sprung into the laconicum. Others, and
                    apparently they have Vitruviu3 on their side, think that the clypeus was <pb
                    break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit03newyrich/page/n450/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0903-0450-0435"/> drawn up or down only from the aperture in the
                    roof, and that it regulated the temperature simply by giving more or less free
                    exit to the hot air. The question must for the present remain unsettled; if the
                    laconicum was only one end of the calidarium, it is difficult to see how that
                    end of the room was kept so much hotter than the rest of it; on the other hand
                    to have had flames actually issuing from the laconicum, must have caused smoke
                    and soot, and have been very unpleasant. The most usual order in which the rooms
                    were employed seems to have been the following, but there does not appear to
                    have been any absolute uniformity of practice then, any more than in modern
                    Egyptian and Turkish baths. Celsus recommends the bather first to sweat a little
                    in the tepidarium with his clothes on, to be anointed there, and then to pass
                    into the calidarium; after he has sweated freely there he is not to descend into
                    the solium or cold bath, but to have plenty of water poured over him from his
                    head,—first warm, then tepid, and then cold water,—the water being poured longer
                    over his head than on the rest of the body; next to be scraped with the strigil,
                    and lastly to be rubbed and anointed.</p>
                <p>The warmest of the heated rooms, <hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> the calidarium and
                    laconicum, were heated directly from the hypocaustum, over which they were built
                    or suspended <hi rend="italic">(suspensτιra);</hi> while from the hypocaustum
                    tubes of brass, or lead, or pottery carried the hot air or vapour to the walls
                    of the other rooms. The walls were usually hollow, so that the hot air could
                    readily circulate.</p>
                <p>The water was heated ingeniously. Close to the furnace, about 4 inches off, was
                    placed the <hi rend="italic">calidarium,</hi> the copper <hi rend="italic"
                    >{ahenum)</hi> for boiling water, near which, with the same interval between
                    them, was the copper for warm water, the <hi rend="italic">tepidarium,</hi> and
                    at the distance of 2 feet from this was the receptacle for cold water, or the
                    <hi rend="italic">frigidarium,</hi> often a plastered reservoir. A constant
                    communication was kept up between these vessels, so that as fast as hot water
                    was drawn off from the calidarium a supply was obtained from the tepidarium,
                    which, being already heated, but slightly reduced the temperature of the hotter
                    boiler. The tepidarium, again, w as supplied from the frigidarium, and that from
                    an aqueduct. In this way the heat which was not taken up by the first boiler
                    passed on to the second, and instead of being wasted, helped to heat the
                    second—a principle which has only lately been introduced into modern furnaces.
                    In the case of the large thermae the water of an aqueduct was brought to the <hi
                    rend="italic">castellum,</hi> or top of the building, and was allowed to descend
                    into chambers over the hypocaustum, where it was heated and transmitted in pipes
                    to the central buildings. Remains of this arrangement are to be seen in the
                    baths of Caracalla. The general plan of such buildings will be more clearly
                    understood after an examination of the accompanying illustrations. In the
                    well-known drawing (fig. 1) found in the baths of Titus, the name of each part
                    of the building is inscribed on it. The small dome inscribed laconicum directly
                    over the furnace, and having the clypeus over it, will be observed in the corner
                    of the chamber named concamerata sudatio. The vessels for water are inscribed,
                    according to their temperature, with the same names as some of the chambers,
                    frigidarium, tepidarium, and calidarium.</p>
                <p>The baths of Pompeii (as shown in fig. 2) were a double set, and were surrounded
                    with tabernae or shops, which are marked by a lighter shade. There were streets
                    on four sides; and the reservoir supplying water was across the street in the
                    building on the left hand of the cut. There were three public entrances—21«,
                    216, 21c—to the men’s baths and one to the women’s. The furnaces (9) heated
                    water, which was conveyed on one side to the larger baths of the men, on the
                    other to the women’s. Entering from the street at 21c there was a latrina on the
                    left hand (22). From this it was usual to proceed to a court (20) surrounded by
                    pillars, where servants were in attendance. There is some doubt as to the
                    purpose to which the room (19) was devoted. Leaving the hall a passage conducted
                    to the apodyterium or dressing-room (17), at one end of it is the frigidarium,
                    baptisterium, or cold plunge bath (18). Entering out of the apodyterium is the
                    tepidarium, or warming-room (15), which most probably was also used as the
                    alipterium or anointing-room. From it bathers passed into the hot room or
                    calidarium (12), which had at one end the alveus or calida lavatio (13), at the
                    other end the labrum (14). This end of the calidarium served as the laconicum.
                    The arrangements of the women’s baths were similar, but on a smaller scale. The
                    calidarium (5) had the labrum (7) at one end, and the alveus (6) was in one side
                    of the room. The general arrangements of a calidarium are well illustrated by
                    the accompanying section (fig. 3) of a bath discovered.at</p>
                <p>Tusculum. The disposition of the parts is the same as at Pompeii. We here have
                    the calidarium supported on the pillars of the fornax, the suspensura. The
                    alveus (3) is <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit03newyrich/page/n451/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0903-0451-0436"/> at one end, and the labrum (4) at the other. (1)
                    and (2) are the vessels for water over the fornax; and the passages in the roof
                    and walls for the escape of heated air will be observed.</p>
                <p>A clear idea of the relative position of the different rooms, and some slight
                    indication of their ornamentation, will be obtained from the accompanying
                    woodcut (fig. 4). The Hues under the calidarium and the labrum (1) may be
                    observed, as also the opening in the roof above. (2), (3), and (4) mark the
                    vessels for water which are placed between the men’s baths on the left and the
                    women’s on the right.</p>
                <p>The arrangements of the <hi rend="italic">thermae</hi> were mainly those of the
                    balneae on a larger scale. Some idea of their size may be gathered from such
                    facts as these, that in the baths of Diocletian one room has been transmuted
                    into a church of most imposing proportions, and that the outside walls of the
                    baths of Caracalla extend about a quarter of a mile on each of the four sides. A
                    visit to the remains of the baths of Titus, of Diocletian, or of Caracalla
                    impresses the mind strongly with a sense of the vast scale on which they were
                    erected, and Ammianus’s designation of them as provinces appears scarcely
                    exaggerated. It is said that the baths of Caracalla contained 1600, and those of
                    Diocletian</p>
                <p>3200 marble seats for the use of the bathers. In the largest of the thermae there
                    was a stadium for the games of the young men, with raised seats for the
                    spectators. There were open colonnades and seats for philosophers and literary
                    men to sit and discourse or read their productions aloud, or for others to
                    discuss the latest news. Near the porticoes, in the interior open space, rows of
                    trees were planted. There was a <hi rend="italic">sphaeristerium,</hi> or place
                    for playing ball, which was often over the apodyterium; but it must be confessed
                    that the purposes of many portions of these large edifices have not been made
                    out in as satisfactory a way as those of smaller baths. A more definite idea of
                    the thermae can be best got by an examination of the accom&gt; panying plan of
                    the baths of Caracalla (fig. 5). A good deal of the plan is conjectural,—the
                    restorations being marked by lighter shading.</p>
                <p>At the bottom of the plan is shown a long colonnade, which faces the street,
                    behind which was a series of chambers, supposed to have been separate
                    bathing-rooms. Entering by the opening in its centre, the visitor passes what
                    was probably an inner colonnade round the main building. Passing in by either of
                    the gates (2, 2), he reaches the large chamber (3), which has been variously
                    called the natatio or large swimming bath, or the tepidarium. The great central
                    room (4) in all probability was the calidarium, with two labra (6, 6) on
                    opposite sides, and with four alvei, one in each corner, represented by small
                    circular dots. (9) has been regarded by some as the laconicum, although it
                    appears very large for that purpose. The rooms (15, 15) have been variously
                    described as baptisteria and as laconica. Most authors are agreed in thinking
                    that the large rooms (13) and (16) were the sphaeristeria, or places for playing
                    ball.</p>
                <p>Returning to the outside, (1) and (18) and the corresponding place3 on the other
                    side, are supposed to have been the exedrae for philosophers, and places
                    corresponding to the Greek xysti. (20) and (19) have been considered to be
                    servants’ rooms. (22) was the stadium, with raised seats for the spectators. The
                    space between this and the large central hall (9) was planted with trees, and at
                    (21) the aqueduct brought water into the castellum or reservoir, which was on an
                    upper story. There were upper stories in most portions of the building, and in
                    these probably were the libraries and small theatres.</p>
                <p>The magnificence of many of the thermae and their luxurious arrangements were
                    such that some writers, as Seneca,, are quite lost in their descriptions of
                    them. The piscinae were often of immense size,—that of Diocletian being 200 feet
                    long,—and were adorned with beautiful marbles. The halls were crowded with
                    magnificent columns, and were ornamented with the finest pieces of statuary. The
                    walls, it has been said, were covered with exquisite mosaics that imitated the
                    art of the painter in their elegance of design and variety of colour. The
                    Egyptian syenite was encrusted with the precious green marbles of Numidia. The
                    rooms contained the works of Phidias and Praxiteles. A perpetual stream of water
                    was poured into capacious basins through the wide mouths of lions of bright and
                    polished silver; water issued from silver, and was received on silver. “To such
                    a pitch of luxury have we reached,” says Seneca, “that we are dissatisfied if we
                    do not tread on gems in our baths.”</p>
                <p>The richer Pιomans used every variety of oils and pomades <hi rend="italic"
                    >(smegmata)’,</hi> they scarcely had true soaps. The poorer class had to be
                    content with the flour of lentils, an article used at this day for the same
                    purpose by Orientals.“’ The most important bath utensil was the strigillus, a
                    curved instrument made of metal, with which the skin was scraped and all sordes
                    removed.</p>
                <p>The bath servants assisted in anointing, in using the strigillus, and in various
                    other menial offices. The poorer classes had to use their strigils themselves.

                    xml:id="kp-eb0903-0452-0437"/> various processes of the aliptae seem to have
                    been carried on very systematically.</p>
                <p>The hot baths appear to have been open from 1 P.M. till dark. It was only one of
                    the later emperors that had them lighted up at night. When the hot baths were
                    ready (for, doubtless, the plunge baths were available at an earlier hour), a
                    bell or <hi rend="italic">oes</hi> was rung for the information of the people.
                    Among the Greeks and Romans the eighth hour, or 1 o’clock, before their dinner,
                    was the commonest hour for bathing. The bath was supposed to promote appetite,
                    and some voluptuaries had one or more baths after dinner, to enable them to
                    begin eating again; but such excesses, as Juvenal tells us, occasionally proved
                    fatal. Some of the most effeminate of the emperors are said to have bathed seven
                    or eight times in the course of the day. In early times there was delicacy of
                    feeling about the sexes bathing together; even a father could not bathe with his
                    sons, but latterly, under most of the emperors, men and women often used the
                    same baths. There frequently were separate baths for the women, as we see at
                    Pompeii, or at Badenweiler; but although respectable matrons would not go to
                    public baths, promiscuous bathing was common during the empire.</p>
                <p>The public baths and thermae were under the more immediate superintendence of the
                    aediles. The charge made at a public bath was only a quadrans or quarter of an
                    as, about half a farthing. Yet cheap though this was, the emperors used to
                    ingratiate themselves with the populace, by making the baths at times
                    gratuitous.</p>
                <p>Wherever the Romans settled, they built public baths; and wherever they found hot
                    springs or natural stufae, they made use of them, thus saving the expense of
                    heating, as at the <hi rend="italic">myrteta</hi> of Baiae, or the <hi
                    rend="italic">aquae</hi><hi rend="italic">solis</hi> of Bath. In the cities
                    there appear to have been private baths for hire, as well as the public baths;
                    and every rich citizen had a set of baths attached to his villa, the fullest
                    account of which is given in the <hi rend="italic">Letters</hi> of Pliny, or in
                    Ausonius’s <hi rend="italic">Account of a Villa on the Moselle,</hi> or in
                    Statius’s <hi rend="italic">De</hi><hi rend="italic">Balneo Etrusco.</hi>
                    Although the Romans never wholly gave up cold bathing, and that practice was
                    revived under Augustus by Antonius Musa, and again under Nero by Charmis (at
                    which later time bathing in the open sea became common), yet they chiefly
                    practised warm bathing <hi rend="italic">(calida lavatio').</hi> This is the
                    most luxurious kind of bathing, and when indulged to excess, is enervating. The
                    women were particularly fond of these baths, and were accused, at all events in
                    some provincial cities, of drunkenness in them.</p>
                <p>The unbounded licence of the public baths, and their connection with modes of
                    amusement that were condemned, led to their being to a considerable extent
                    proscribed by the early Christians, The early fathers wrote that bathing might
                    be practised for the sake of cleanliness or of health, but not of pleasure; and
                    Gregory the Great saw no objection to baths being used on Sunday. About the 5th
                    century many of the large thermae in Rome fell into decay. The cutting off of
                    the aqueducts by the Huns, and the gradual decrease of the population,
                    contributed to this. Still it is doubtful whether bathing was ever disused to
                    the extent that is usually represented. It was certainly kept up in the East in
                    full vigour at -Alexandria and at Brusa. Hot bathing, and especially hot air and
                    vapour baths, were adopted by the Mahometans; and the Arabs brought them with
                    them into Spain. The Turks, at a later time, carried them high up the Danube,
                    and the Mahometans spread or, it may be more correct to say, revived their use
                    in Persia and in Hindustan. The Crusaders also contributed to the spread of
                    baths in Europe, and hot vapour baths were specially recommended for the leprosy
                    so prevalent in those days. After the commencement of the 13th century there
                    were few large cities in Europe without hot vapour baths. We have full accounts
                    of their regulations,—how the Jews were only allowed to visit them once a week,
                    and how there were separate baths for lepers. In England they were called
                    hothou3es. Erasmus, at the date of the Reformation, spoke of them as common in
                    France, Germany, and Belgium; he gives a lively account of the mixture of all
                    classes of people to be found in them, and would imply that they were a common
                    adjunct to inns. They seem after a time to have become less common, though
                    Montaigne mentions them as being still in Rome in his day. In England the next
                    revival of baths was at the close of the 17th century, under the Eastern name of
                    Hummuns, or the Italian name of Bagnios. As these, like more recent revivals of
                    them, were avowedly on the principle of the Turkish baths, that species of bath
                    must be briefly noticed. But before doing so, we must observe that there were
                    several considerable epochs in the history of baths, one in the commencement of
                    the 18th century, when Floyer and others recalled attention to cold bathing, of
                    which the virtues had long been overlooked. In the middle of the century also,
                    Russell and others revived sea-bathing in England, and were followed by others
                    on the Continent, until the value of sea-bathing became fully appreciated. Later
                    in the same century the experiments of Currie on the action of complete or of
                    partial baths on the system in disease attracted attention; and though forgotten
                    for a while, they have borne abundant fruit in more recent times.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Modern Baths.—</hi> It is uncertain how far the Turkish and
                    Egyptian and even the Russian baths are to be regarded merely as successors of
                    the Roman baths, because the principle of vapour baths has been known to many
                    nations in a very early period of civilization. Thus the Mexicans and Indians
                    were found using small vapour baths. The ancient inhabitants of Ireland and of
                    Scotland had some notion of their use, and the large vapour baths of Japan, now
                    so extensively employed, are probably of independent origin. We extract at some
                    length accounts of Turkish and of Russian baths, as they illustrate the
                    practices of the ancient Roman and of modern Turkish baths. The first is taken,
                    from Lane’s work <hi rend="italic">On the Modern Egyptians :—“</hi> The building
                    consists of several apartments, all of which are paved with marble, chiefly
                    white. The inner apartments are covered with domes, which have a number of small
                    glazed apertures for the admission of light·. The bather, on entering, if he has
                    a watch or purse, gives them in charge to the keeper of the bath. The servant of
                    the bath takes off his shoes, and supplies him with a pair of wooden clogs. The
                    first apartment has generally three or four <hi rend="italic">leeu·ans</hi>
                    (raised parts of the floor used as couches) cased with marble, and a fountain of
                    cold water, which rises from an octagonal basement in the centre. One of the
                    leewans, which is meant for the higher classes, is furnished with cushions or
                    mats.</p>
                <p>“In warm weather bathers usually undress in this room; in winter they undress in
                    an inner room, called the <hi rend="italic">beytowwal,</hi> or first chamber,
                    between which and the last apartment there is a passage often with two or three
                    latrines off it. This is the first of the heated chambers. It generally has two
                    raised seats. The bather receives a napkin in which to put his clothes, and
                    another to put round his waist; this reaches to the knees, a third, if he
                    requires it, is brought him to wind round his head, leaving the top of it bare;
                    a fourth to put over his chest, and a fifth to cover his back. When the bather
                    has undressed, the attendant opens to him the door of the inner and principal
                    apartment. This in general has four leewans, which gives it the form of a cross,
                    and in the centre a fountain of hot water rises from a small shallow basin. The
                    centre room, with the adjoining ones, forms almost a square. The beytowwal <pb
                    break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit03newyrich/page/n453/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0903-0453-0438"/> already mentioned is one of them. Two small
                    chambers which adjoin each other, one containing a tank of hot water, the other
                    containing a trough, over which are two taps, one of hot and one of cold water,
                    occupy the two other angles; while the fourth angle of the square is occupied by
                    the chamber which contains the fire, over which is the boiler.</p>
                <p>“The bather having entered this apartment soon perspires profusely from the humid
                    heat which is produced by the hot water of tanks and fountains, and by the steam
                    of the boiler. The bather sits on one of the marble seats, or lies on the
                    leewan, or near one of the tanks, and the operator then commences his work. The
                    operator first cracks aloud every joint in the body. He makes the vertebrae of
                    the back and even of the neck crack. The limbs are twisted with apparent
                    violence, but so skilfully, that no harm is ever done. The operator next kneads
                    the patient’s flesh. After this he rubs the soles of the feet with a kind of
                    rasp of baked clay. There are two kinds of rasps, one porous and rough, one of
                    fine smooth clay. Those used by ladies are usually encased in thin embossed
                    silver. The next operation is rubbing the bather’s flesh with a small coarse
                    woollen bag, after which the bather dips himself in one of the tanks. He is next
                    taken to one of the chambers in the corner, and the operator lathers the bather
                    with fibres of the palm tree, soap and water. The soap is then washed off with
                    water, when the bather having finished washing, and enveloped himself in dry
                    towels, returns to the beytowwal and reclines. Here he generally remains an hour
                    to an hour and a half, sipping coffee and smoking, while an attendant rubs the
                    soles of the feet and kneads the body and limbs. The bather then dresses and
                    goes out.”</p>
                <p>The following description of a Russian bath is from Kohl’s <hi rend="italic"
                    >ltιcssia, :—</hi> “The passage from the door is divided into two behind the
                    check-taker’s post, one for the male, one for the female guests. We first enter
                    an open space, in which a set of men are sitting in a state of nudity on
                    benches, those who have already bathed dressing, while those who are going to
                    undergo the process take off their cl0the3. Round this space or apartment are
                    the doors leading to the vapour-rooms. The bather is ushered into them, and
                    finds himself in a room full of vapour, which is surrounded by a wooden platform
                    rising in steps to near the roof of the room. The bather is made to lie down on
                    one of the lower benches, and gradually to ascend to the higher and hotter ones.
                    The first sensation on entering the room amounts almost to a feeliug of
                    suffocation. After you have been subjected for some time to a temperature which
                    may rise to 145’, the transpiration reaches its full activity, and the sensation
                    is very pleasant. The bath attendants come and flog you with birchen twigs,
                    cover you with the lather of soap, afterwards rub it off, and then hold you over
                    a jet of ice cold water. The shock is great, but is followed by a pleasant
                    feeling of great comfort and of alleviation of any rheumatic pains you may have
                    had. In regular establishments you go after this and lie down on a bed for a
                    time before issuing forth. But the Russiaus often dress in the open air, and
                    instead of using the jet of cold water, go and roll themselves at once in the
                    snow.”</p>
                <p>Turkish baths have, with various modifications, become popular in Europe. The
                    Russian baths were introduced into most German towns about half a century ago.
                    They had a certain limited amount of popularity, but did not take firm root.
                    Another class practically owes its origin to Dr Barter and Mr Urquhart. It
                    professed to be founded on the Turkish bath, but in reality it was much more of
                    a hot air bath, <hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> more devoid of vapour than either
                    Roman or Turkish baths ever were, for it is doubtful whether in any case the air
                    of the laconicum was free from vapour. These baths, with their various
                    modifications, have become extremely popular in Great Britain, in Germany, and
                    in Northern Europe, but have, curiously enough, never been used extensively in
                    France, notwithstanding the familiarity of the French with Turkish baths in
                    Algiers.</p>
                <p>In England hot air baths are now employed very extensively. .They are often
                    associated with Turkish and electric baths, and with the usual processes of
                    hydropathic treatment.</p>
                <p>Bathing among the ancients was practised in various forms. It was sometimes a
                    simple bath in cold or in tepid water; but at least, in the case of the higher
                    orders, it usually included a hot air or vapour bath, and was followed by
                    affusion of cold or warm water, and generally by a plunge into the piscina. In
                    like manner the order varies in which the different processes are gone through
                    in Turkish baths in modern Europe. Thus in the new baths in Vienna, the process
                    begins by immersion in a large basin of warm water. Sudation is repeatedly
                    interrupted by cold douches at the will of the bathers, and after the bath they
                    are satisfied with a short stay in the cooling-room, where they have only a
                    simple sheet rolled round them. In Copenhagen and in Stockholm the Oriental
                    baths have been considerably modified by their association with hydropathic
                    practices.</p>
                <p>This leads us to notice the introduction of hydropathy. Although cold baths were
                    in vogue for a time in Rome, warm baths were always more popular. Floyer, as we
                    have seen, did something to revive their use in England; but it was nearly a
                    century and a half afterwards that a Silesian peasant, Priessnitz, introduced,
                    with wonderful success, a variety of operations with cold water, the most
                    important of which was the packing the patient in a wet sheet, a process which
                    after a time is followed by profuse sudation. Large establishments for carrying
                    out this mode of bathing and its modifications have within the last thirty years
                    been erected in many places on the Continent and in Great Britain, and have
                    enjoyed a large share of popularity.</p>
                <p>But the greatest and most important development of ordinary baths in modern times
                    has taken place in England, and has been extending gradually to the Continent.
                    The English had long used affusion and swimming baths freely in India. Cold and
                    hot baths and shower baths have been introduced into private houses to an extent
                    never known before; and, from 1842 downwards, public swimming baths, besides
                    separate baths, have been supplied to the public at very moderate rates, in some
                    cases associated with wash-houses for the poorer classes. Their number has
                    increased rapidly in London, and in the principal Continental cities. Floating
                    baths in rivers, always known in some German towns, have become common
                    where-ever there are flowing streams. The better supply of most European cities
                    with water has aided in this movement. Ample enclosed swimming baths have of
                    late years been erected at many sea-side places. When required, the water, if
                    not heated in a boiler, is raised to a sufficient temperature by the aid of hot
                    water pipes or of steam; and gas I1a3 been utilized for heating small quantities
                    of water for baths in private houses. As to separate baths they used to be of
                    wood, painted; they are now most frequently of metal, painted or lined with
                    porcelain enamel. The swimming baths are lined with cement, tiles, or marble and
                    porcelain slabs; and in some of the newest baths a good deal of ornamentation
                    and painting of the walls and ceiling of the apartments, in imitation of the
                    ancients, has been attempted.</p>
                <p>We have thus traced in outline the history of baths through successive ages down
                    to the present time. The medium of the baths spoken of thus far has been water,
                    vapour, or dry hot air. But baths of more complex <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0903-0454-0439"/> nature, and of the greatest variety, have been in
                    use from the earliest ages. The best known media are the various mineral waters
                    and sea-water. These, and baths impregnated with their gases, cannot here be
                    considered in detail; we can do little more than enumerate a few of the
                    artificial baths. Of baths of <hi rend="italic">mineral</hi> substances, those
                    of sand are the oldest and best known; the practice of <hi rend="italic"
                    >arénation</hi> or of burying the body in the sand of the seashore, or in heated
                    sand near some hot spring, is very ancient, as also that of applying heated sand
                    to various parts of the body. Within the last few years establishments have been
                    introduced into various European cities where hot dry sand is methodically
                    applied. Baths of <hi rend="italic">peat</hi> earth are of comparatively recent
                    origin, and are little used out of Germany. The peat earth is carefully prepared
                    and pulverized, and then worked up with water into a pasty consistence, of which
                    the temperature can be regulated before the patient immerses himself in it.</p>
                <p>There are various baths that may be termed <hi rend="italic">chemical,</hi> in
                    which chlorine or nitromuriatic acid is added to the water of the bath, or where
                    fumes of sulphur are made to rise and envelop the body.</p>
                <p>Of <hi rend="italic">vegetable</hi> baths the number is very large. Leys of wine,
                    in a state of fermentation, have been employed. An immense variety of aromatic
                    herbs have been used to impregnate water with. Of late years fuci or sea-weed
                    have been added to baths, under the idea of conveying into the system the iodine
                    which they contain; but by far the most popular of all vegetable baths are those
                    made with an extract got by distilling certain varieties of pine leaves. They
                    are pleasant and stimulating.</p>
                <p>The strangeness of the baths of <hi rend="italic">animal</hi> substances, that
                    have been at various times in use, is such that their employment seems scarcely
                    credible. That baths of milk or of whey might be not unpopular is not
                    surprising, but baths of blood, in some cases even of human blood, have been
                    used; and baths of horse dung were for many ages in high favour, and were even
                    succeeded for a short time by baths of guano.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Electrical</hi> or <hi rend="italic">galvanic</hi> baths have
                    been popular of late years, in which galvanic action is communicated to the
                    patient while in baths.</p>
                <p>Baths also of <hi rend="italic">compressed air,</hi> in which the patient is
                    subjected to the pressure of two or three atmospheres, have been in use at
                    certain places for some years.</p>
                <p>A <hi rend="italic">sun</hi> bath <hi rend="italic">(insolatio</hi> or <hi
                    rend="italic">heliosis'),</hi> exposing the body to the sun, the head being
                    covered, was a favourite practice among the Greeks and Romans. This list of
                    artificial baths might be readily increased.</p>
                <p>We have hitherto spoken of general baths, but there are many varieties of local
                    ones, the use of w hich has become somewhat more definite than it used to be,
                    before the principles of hydropathy were understood. Some of these are affusion,
                    half-baths, full baths, sitz baths, wave baths, local baths, shower and spray
                    baths, douches, fomentations, injections, wrapping up in the wet sheet. Some of
                    these processes, though by no means of novel origin, require a few words of
                    explanation.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Douches</hi> were used by the ancients, and have always been au
                    important mode of applying water to a circumscribed portion of the body. They
                    are, in fact, spouts of water, varying in size and temperature, applied with
                    more or less force for a longer or shorter time against particular parts A
                    douche exercises a certain amount of friction, and a continued impulse on the
                    spot to which it is applied, which stimulate the skin and the parts beneath it,
                    quicken the circulation of the capillaries, and thus favour the absorption of
                    abnormal deposits. It wakes up the slumbering activity of the tissues and helps
                    to remove congestions from the deeper seated organs. The effects of the douche
                    are so powerful that it cannot be applied for a long time continuously. After
                    every two or three minutes there should be an interval in its use. It is obvious
                    that a douche is capable of many local applications, on the description of which
                    it is here impossible to enter. Nor need we say that the douche must be used
                    with great care in the case of nervous and excitable people, and better not at
                    all when any irritation or inflammation is present. Douches are invaluable in
                    old neuralgias, in the sequelae of rheumatism, and in thickened joints.</p>
                <p>The alternation of hot and cold douches, which for some unknown reason has got
                    the name of <hi rend="italic">Ecossaise,</hi> is a very powerful remedy from the
                    strong action and reaction which it produces, and is one of very great value.
                    The shower bath may be regarded as a union of an immense number of fine douches
                    projected on the head and shoulders. It has been long in use in England, and
                    produces a strong effect on the nervous system. An ingenious contrivance for
                    giving circular spray baths, by which water is propelled laterally in fine
                    streams against every portion of the surface of the body, is now found in most
                    establishments.</p>
                <p>To all these modes of acting on the cutaneous surface and circulation must be
                    added dry rubbing, as practised by the patient with the flesh glove, but much
                    more thoroughly by the bath attendants, if properly instructed.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Action of Baths on the Human System.—</hi> We shall now inquire
                    shortly into the theory of the operation of the baths and of the bathing
                    processes, of which we have briefly traced the history.</p>
                <p>The primary operation of baths is the action of heat and cold on the cutaneous
                    surfaces through the medium of water.</p>
                <p>The first purpose of baths is simply that of abstersion and cleanliness, to
                    remove any foreign impurity from the surface, and to prevent the pores from
                    being clogged by their own secretions or by desquamations of cuticle. It need
                    scarcely be said that such objects are greatly promoted by the action of the
                    alkali of soaps and by friction; that the use of warm water, owing to its
                    immediate stimulation of the skin, promotes the separation of sordes; and that
                    the vapour of water is still more efficient than water itself.</p>
                <p>It has been supposed that water acts on the system by being absorbed through the
                    skin. The question has been frequently discussed; but the great majority of
                    observers believe that, under ordinary circumstances, no water is absorbed, or
                    if any, so minute a quantity that it is not worth considering. And further, as
                    we have alluded to medicated baths, it is proper to say that, according to the
                    latest authorities, no foreign bodies, under the ordinary circumstances of a
                    bath, are absorbed into the system; although when a portion of skin has been
                    entirely cleared of its sebaceous secretion, it is possible that a strong
                    solution of salts may be partially absorbed. In the case of medicated baths we
                    therefore only look (in addition to the action of heat and cold, or more
                    properly to the abstraction or communication and retention of heat) to any
                    stimulant action on the skin which the ingredients of the bath may possess.</p>
                <p>The powerful influence of water on the capillaries of the skin, and the mode and
                    extent of that operation, depend primarily on the temperature of the fluid; for
                    the influence of the mechanical pressure on the body of the water of a bath,
                    which has been calculated at nearly one pound on each square inch of the
                    surface, has never been accurately determined. Baths have therefore to be
                    considered according to their temperature; and the effects of cold and of hot
                    baths have to be studied. But we may as well first point out one or two general
                    facts. The human system bears changes of temperature of the air much better than
                    changes of the temperature of water. While the temperature of the <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit03newyrich/page/n455/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0903-0455-0440"/> air at <hi rend="italic">75° is</hi> perhaps too
                    warm for the feelings of many people, a continued bath at that temperature is
                    felt to be cold and depressing. Again, a bath of 98° to 102° acts far more
                    excitingly than air of the same temperature, both because, being a better
                    conductor, water brings more heat to the body, and because it suppresses the
                    perspiration, which is greatly augmented by air of that temperature. Further, a
                    temperature a few degrees below blood heat is that of indifferent baths, which
                    can be borne longest without natural disturbance of the system.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Cold</hi> baths act by refrigeration, and their effects vary
                    according to the degree of temperature. The effects of a cold bath, the
                    temperature not being below 50°, are these :— there is a diminution of the
                    temperature of the skin and of the subjacent tissues; the blood at first rises
                    in temperature nearly 4°, but soon subsides again, this diminution of
                    temperature of the blood usually not taking place in the bath, but shortly after
                    leaving it. There is a certain feeling of shock diffused over the whole surface,
                    and if the cold is intense it induces a slight feeling of numbness in the skin.
                    It becomes pale and its capillaries contract. The further action of a cold bath
                    reaches the central nervous system, the heart and the lungs, as manifested by
                    the tremor of the limbs it produces, along with a certain degree of oppression
                    of the chest and a gasping for air, while the pulse becomes small and sinks.
                    After a time reaction takes place, and brings redness to the skin and an
                    increase of temperature.</p>
                <p>The colder the water is, and the more powerful and depressing its effects, the
                    quicker and more' active is the reaction, λ <hi rend="superscript"> 7</hi> ery
                    cold baths, anything below 50°, cannot be borne long. Lowering of the
                    temperature of the skin may be borne down to 9°, but a further reduction may
                    prove fatal. The diminution of temperature is much more rapid when the water is
                    in motion, or when the bather moves about; because, if the water is still, the
                    layer of it in immediate contact with the body gets warmed to a certain
                    degree.</p>
                <p>The effects of <hi rend="italic">hydropathy</hi> depend on the power of
                    abstracting heat from the body, and of stimulating it by the application of cold
                    water. The action is depressing or exciting, according as the withdrawal of heat
                    or the stimulation predominates.</p>
                <p>A great deal depends on the form of the bath; thus one may have—(1.) Its
                    depressing operation,—with a loss of heat, retardation of the circulation, and
                    feeling of weariness, when the same water remains in contact with the skin, and
                    there is continuous withdrawal of heat without fresh stimulation. This occurs
                    with full or sitz baths, with partial or complete wrapping up the body in a wet
                    sheet which remains unchanged, and with frictions practised without removing the
                    wet sheets. (2.) Its exciting operation,—with quickening of the action of the
                    heart and lungs, and feeling of glow and of nervous excitement and of increased
                    muscular power. These sensations are produced when the layer of water next the
                    body and heated by it is removed, and fresh cold water causes fresh stimulus.
                    These effects are produced by full baths with the water in motion used only for
                    a short time, by frictions when the wet sheet is removed from the body, by
                    douches, shower baths, bathing in rivers, &amp;c. <hi rend="superscript"> j</hi>
                    The depressing operation comes on much earlier in very cold water than in
                    warmer; and in the same way the exciting operation comes on faster with the
                    colder than with the warmer water. The short duration of the bath makes both its
                    depressing and its exciting action less; its longer duration increases them; and
                    if the baths be continued too long, the protracted abstraction of animal beat
                    may prove very depressing.</p>
                <p>We shall not attempt to give more than those few hints about hydropathic
                    processes, and shall merely remark that, under them the system is subjected to
                    alternate periods of excitement and of rest. There is persistent lowering of the
                    temperature of the body, with contraction of the capillaries and local anaemia.
                    This is succeeded by the reverse, or by local hyperaemia. There is powerful
                    excitement of the vascular and nervous systems. The processes of absorption and
                    of excretion are stimulated. There is a great increase of perspiration. The
                    transformation of tissue is materially quickened.</p>
                <p>We must next consider the operation of warm baths of different temperatures.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Tepid,</hi> 85° <hi rend="italic">to</hi> 95°.—The effects of a
                    bath of this temperature are confined to the peripheral extremities of the
                    nerves, and are so slight that they do not reach the central system. There is no
                    reaction, and the animal temperature remains unchanged. Eaths of this kind can
                    be borne for hours with impunity.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Warm baths from</hi> 96° <hi rend="italic">to</hi> 104°.—In
                    these the action of the heat on the peripheral surface is propagated to the
                    central system, and causes reaction, which manifests itself in moderately
                    increased flow of the circulating fluids to the surface, and in an increased
                    frequency of pulse. It appears to supply a slight stimulus to the renewal of
                    tissue.</p>
                <p>With a <hi rend="italic">hot bath</hi> from 102° up to 110° the central nervous
                    and circulating systems are more affected. The frequency of the pulse increases
                    rapidly, the respiration becomes quickened, and is interrupted by deep
                    inspirations. The skin is congested, and the retained animal heat bursts out,
                    causing a profuse perspiration.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Very hot bath.—</hi> Everything above 110° feels very hot;
                    anything above 120° almost scalding. Baths of from 119° to 126° have caused a
                    rise of 2° to 4⅛ <hi rend="superscript"> o</hi> in the temperature of the blood.
                    Such a bath can only be borne for a few minutes. It causes violent reflex action
                    on the heart and the arterial system, excessive congestion of the skin, and
                    violent perspiration.</p>
                <p>In the use of hot baths a certain amount of vapour reaches the parts of the body
                    not covered by the water, and is also inhaled.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Vapour</hi> baths produce profuse perspiration, and act in
                    cleansing the skin, as powerful hot water baths do. Vapour, owing to its smaller
                    specific heat, does not act so fast as water on the body. A vapour bath can be
                    borne for a much longer time when the vapour is not inhaled. Vapour baths can be
                    borne hotter than water baths, but cannot be continued so long, as vapour, being
                    a bad conductor, prevents radiation of heat from the body. A higher heat than
                    122° is not borne comfortably. The vapour bath, though falling considerably
                    short of the temperature of the hot air batfi, heats the blood considerably
                    more.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Hot air</hi> baths differ from vapour baths in not impeding the
                    respiration as the latter do, by depositing moisture in the bronchial tubes. The
                    lungs, instead of having to heat the inspired air, are subjected to a
                    temperature above their own. Hot air baths, say of 135°, produce more profuse
                    perspiration than vapour baths. If very hot, they raise the temperature of the
                    body by several degrees.</p>
                <p>Vapour baths, hot air baths, and many hydropathic processes agree in producing
                    violent sudation, and also frequently in subjecting thebody, while in a stateof
                    perspiration, to the action of water of a comparatively low temperature. Of
                    perspiration we shall only say, that it is sensible and insensible: 30 oz. may
                    be considered to be about its average amount in the twenty-four hours; of this,
                    which is chiefly water, about ⅜ of an oz. consists of urea and of other peculiar
                    substances. A man has been known to lose 3 lb in a Russian bath; some think more
                    may be lost. As perspiration eliminates water and effete matter from the system,
                    and also aids in respiration, it is obvious that its regulation must have an
                    important effect on the economy.</p>
                <p>In comparing the general effects of hot and cold baths, it <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit03newyrich/page/n456/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0903-0456-0441"/> may be said that while the former tend to check
                    cutaneous transpiration, the latter favour it. It is supposed, but is scarcely
                    proved, that cold baths, by the stimulus they give, increase the reaction of the
                    gastric and other fluids of the stomach, and of the alimentary canal, and that
                    warm baths rather serve to retard it. Either hot or cold baths, but especially
                    the latter, favour the secretion of urine. Whether warm or cold baths, like the
                    breathing of hot or cold air, have any effect on the exhalation of carbonic acid
                    has not been determined.</p>
                <p>The warm bath causes swelling and congestion of the capillaries of the surface in
                    the first instance; when the stimulus of heat is withdrawn their contraction
                    ensues. A cold bath, again, first causes a contraction of the capillaries of the
                    surface, which is followed by their expansion when reaction sets in. A warm bath
                    elevates the temperature of the body, both by bringing a supply of heat to it
                    and by preventing the radiation of heat from it. It can be borne longer than a
                    cold bath. It draws blood to the surface, while a cold bath favours internal
                    congestions. There is in both cases increased oxidation or waste of the tissues;
                    but with the warm bath there is less call made on the system, as oxidation
                    depends chiefly on increased heat, which in the case of the warm baths is
                    artificially supplied. The reason why a man when much exhausted feels a hot bath
                    refreshing, while he cannot bear a cold one, may be that the increased heat
                    conveyed to him by the warm bath helps the process of oxidation, and thus
                    relieves his system. Cold refreshes by exciting the functions, heat by
                    physically relieving their action; a hot bath calms by reducing the loss of
                    heat, and by supplying a certain amount of it. Very hot baths, it is true, act
                    like cold baths, as stimulants to the heart and nervous centres; but they do it
                    more gradually and with less shock to the system than cold baths. The general
                    result of this comparison would show that warm are a milder remedy than cold
                    baths, and are applicable often when the system does not possess power of
                    reaction sufficient to make the use of the latter expedient.</p>
                <p>As regards the use of baths simply for the promotion of health, it follows, from
                    what has been stated, that warm baths are best suited for the delicate, for the
                    very young, and for the old; cold baths for the strong and active, in whom the
                    powers of reaction are unimpaired. It would be out of place to say much here
                    about the use of baths in medicine. Warm baths according to their degree of heat
                    are of great value in relaxing spasms, in calming the nervous system, and in
                    neuralgias, chronic rheumatism, and gout. Turkish baths are useful in these last
                    affections, and wherever it is of importance that there should be free action of
                    the skin. Cold baths, again, are more useful when the system requires tonics,
                    and when it can bear the shock of cold affusion; when diseases of the system,
                    especially of the nervous system, are more functional than organic. It is
                    obvious that the cold-water cure, including, as it does, copious sudation,
                    combines in a certain degree the effects of both kinds of baths.</p>
                <p>But baths often produce injurious effects when used injudiciously. Long continued
                    warm baths are soporific, and have owing to this action often caused death by
                    drowning. The effects of very hot baths are swimming in the head, vomiting,
                    fainting, congestion of the brain, and, in some instances, apoplexy.</p>
                <p>The symptoms seem to point to paralysis of the action of the heart. It is
                    therefore very evident how cautious those should be, in the use of hot baths,
                    who have weak hearts or any obstruction to the circulation. Fat men, and those
                    who are full-blooded or predisposed to epilepsy, should avoid them. Protracted
                    indulgence in warm baths is relaxing, and has been esteemed a sign of effeminacy
                    in all ages. Sleepiness, though it will not follow the first immersion in a cold
                    bath, is one of the effects of protracted cold baths; depression of the
                    temperature of the surface that exceeds 9° becomes dangerous. The risk in cold
                    baths is congestion of the internal organs, as often indicated by the lips
                    getting blue. Extremely cold baths are, therefore, very unsafe wherever there is
                    a tendency to internal congestion; and they are always dangerous when the system
                    is exhausted by fatigue.</p>
                <p>We shall conclude with a few words of advice about ordinary bathing for hygienic
                    purposes :—"Wherever it is practicable, bathing should be over before 1 p.m. It
                    is not to be thought of when the stomach is loaded, or after much wine. The
                    shorter the bath is, especially if the water be cold, and the bather cannot
                    swim, the better,—say five minutes. He should swim if possible, and then a
                    quarter of an hour is long enough. Bathing should not be practised more than
                    once a day. When one is over-heated, but not exhausted, it is advisable to bathe
                    at once, without waiting to cool. After hot air or vapour baths care must be
                    taken that cold be not caught, although the more enthusiastic advocates of such
                    baths declare that there is no risk of this.</p>
