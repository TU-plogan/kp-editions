                    regulate their decisions. An endeavour had been made by the Emperor Leo the
                    Isaurian to remedy this evil, but his attempted reform of the law had been
                    rather calculated to increase its uncertainty; and it was reserved for Basilius
                    the Macedonian to show himself worthy of the throne, which he had usurped, by
                    purifying the administration of justice and once more reducing the law into an
                    intelligible code. There has been considerable controversy as to the part which
                    the Emperor Basilius took in framing the new code. There is, however, no doubt
                    that he abrogated in a formal manner the ancient laws, which had fallen into
                    desuetude, and the more probable opinion would seem to be, that he caused a
                    revision to be made of the ancient laws which were to continue in force, and
                    divided them into forty books, and that this code of laws was subsequently
                    enlarged and distributed into sixty books by his son Leo the Philosopher. A
                    further revision of this code is stated to have been made by Constantinus
                    Porphyrogenitus, the son and successor of Leo, but this statement rests only on
                    the authority of Theodoras Balsamon, a very learned canonist of the 12th
                    century, who, in his preface to the <hi rend="italic">Nomocanon</hi> of
                    Patriarch Photius, cites passages from the Basilica, which differ from the text
                    of the code as revised by the Emperor Leo. The weight of authority, however, is
                    against any further revision of the code having been made after the formal
                    revision which it underwent in the reign of the Emperor Leo, who appointed a
                    commission of jurists under the presidency of Sympathius, the captain of the
                    body-guard, to revise the work of his father, to which he makes allusion in the
                    first of his <hi rend="italic">Xovelloe.</hi> This latter conclusion is the more
                    probable from the circumstance, that the text of the code, as revised by the
                    Emperor Leo, agrees with the citations from the Basilica which occur in the
                    works of Michael Psellus and Michael Atta-liates, both of them high dignitaries
                    of the court of Constantinople, who lived a century before Balsamon, and who are
                    silent as to any second revision of the code having taken place in the reign of
                    Constantinus Porphyrogenitus, as well as with other citations from the Basilica,
                    which are found in the writings of Mathaeus Blastares and of Constantinus
                    Hermenopulos, both of whom wrote shortly after Balsamon, and the latter of whom
                    was far too learned a jurist and too accurate a lawyer to cite any but the
                    official text of the code.</p>
                <p>Authors are not agreed as to the origin of the term Basilica, by which the code
                    of the Emperor Leo is now distinguished. The code itself appears to have been
                    originally entitled <hi rend="italic">The Revision of the Ancient Laus</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">άνακά-</hi><hi rend="italic">θapσις</hi><hi rend="italic">των
                    παλαιών νόμων);</hi> next there came into use the title <hi rend="italic"
                    >η</hi><hi rend="italic">Ιξηκοντάβιβλος,</hi> derived from the division of tho
                    work into sixty books: and finally, before the conclusion of the 10th century,
                    the code came to be designated ο <hi rend="italic">βασιλικός,</hi> or <hi
                    rend="italic">τα βασιλικά,</hi> being elliptical forms of o <hi rend="italic"
                    >βασιλικός νόμος</hi> and <hi rend="italic">τά βασιλικά νόμιμα,</hi> namely the
                    Imperial Law or the Imperial Constitutions. This explanation of the term
                    “Basilica <hi rend="superscript"> n</hi> is more probable than the derivation of
                    it from the name of the father of the Emperor Leo, inasmuch as the Byzantine
                    jurists of the 11th and 12th centuries ignored, altogether the part which tho
                    Emperor Basilius had taken in initiating the legal reforms, <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit03newyrich/page/n435/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0903-0435-0420"/> which were completed by his <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >sod</hi>; besides the name of the father of the Emperor Leo was written
                    βασiλ∈ιoς, from which substantive, according to the genius of the ancient Greek
                    language, the adjective <hi rend="italic">βασιλικός</hi> could not well be
                    derived.</p>
                <p>No perfect MS. has been preserved of the text of the Basilica, and the existence
                    of any portion of the code seems to have been ignored by the jurists of Western
                    Europe, until the important bearing of it upon the study of the Roman law was
                    brought to their attention by Viglius Zuichemus, professor of the Roman law in
                    the university of Padua, in his preface to his edition of the Greek <hi
                    rend="italic">Paraphrase of Theophilus,</hi> published in 1533. A century,
                    however, elapsed before an edition of the sixty books of the Basilica, as far as
                    the MSS. then known to exist supplied materials, was published in seven volumes,
                    by Carolus Annibal Fabrotus, under the patronage of Louis XIII. of France, who
                    assigned an annual stipend of two thousand livres to the editor during its
                    publication, and placed at his disposal the royal printing-press. This edition,
                    although it was a great undertaking and a work of considerable merit, was a very
                    imperfect representation of the original code. A newly restored, and far more
                    complete text of the sixty books of the Basilica, has recently issued from the
                    press of Johannes Ambrosius Barth at Leipsic, in six volumes, edited by
                    Professor Charles William Ernest Heimbach of the university of Jena, assisted by
                    his brother Gustavus Ernest Heimbach. This is one of the most important literary
                    works of the 19 th century. The learned editor lived long enough to witness the
                    completion of the text of the Basilica by the publication of the fifth volume in
                    1850. He died in 1865, leaving behind him a valuable historical introduction to
                    the code, and a manual of its contents, which are printed in the sixth and last
                    volume, published at Leipsic in 1870. Several MSS., which contain portions of
                    the code or of works bearing directly on the code, have been available for this
                    edition, which were not accessible to Fabrotus when he published his edition in
                    1647. Amongst others may be mentioned— MS. Coislin 151, of the 11th century, now
                    in the Bibliothèque Nationale in Paris, which came direct from Mount Athos into
                    the hands of Chancellor Seguier, and which contains a general index of the
                    contents of the sixty books of the Basilica; MS. Coislin 152, of the 13th
                    century, also in the Bibliothèque Nationale in Paris; a Palimpsest MS. of the
                    Holy Sepulchre (τοΰ <hi rend="italic">ayloυ</hi><hi rend="italic">τάφου),</hi>
                    which was discovered in 1838 by Dr C. E. Zachariae von Lingenthal, in the palace
                    of the patriarch of Jerusalem in Constantinople. The text of four books of the
                    Code has been restored by Dr C. E. Zachariae von Lingenthal from this MS., and
                    is printed in an appendix to the third volume of Heimbach’s edition. A further
                    MS. deserves notice, being No. 853 in the Vatican Library at Rome; it belongs to
                    the 14th century, and is the only MS. which contains the work known as <hi
                    rend="italic">Tipucitus.</hi> This MS. has been very carefully collated by
                    Gustavus Ernest Heimbach, and the text of a portion of Tipucitus has been
                    printed from this MS. in the appendix to the second volume of Heimbach’s
                    edition, the remaining portions of the work having been incorporated by Heimbach
                    into the text of the restored code. It may seem strange that so important a body
                    of law as the Basilica should not have come down to <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >ils</hi> in its integrity, but a letter has been preserved, which was addressed
                    by Mark the patriarch of Alexandria to Theodorus Balsamon, from which it appears
                    that copies of the Basilica were in the 12th century very scarce, as the
                    patriarch was unable to procure a copy of the work. The great bulk of the code
                    was an obstacle to the multiplication of copies of it, whilst the necessity for
                    them was in a great degree superseded by the publication from time to time of
                    synopses and encheiridia of its contents, composed by the most eminent jurists,
                    of which a very full account will be found in the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Histoire</hi><hi rend="italic">du Droit</hi><hi rend="italic">Byzantin,</hi> by
                    the advocate Mortreuil, published in Paris in 1846.</p>
