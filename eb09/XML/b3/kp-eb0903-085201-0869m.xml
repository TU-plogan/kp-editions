                    appears in English literature as Beem, Behmont, &amp;c., and notably in the form
                    <hi rend="smallcaps">Behmex,</hi> was born at Alt-Seidenberg, in Upper Lusatia,
                    a straggling hamlet among the hills, some ten miles S.E. of Görlitz. He came of
                    a well-to-do family, but his first employment was that of herd boy on the
                    Landskrone, a hill in the neighbourhood of Görlitz, and the only education he
                    received was at the town-school of Seidenberg, a mile from his home. Seidenberg,
                    to this day, is filled with shoemakers, and to a shoemaker Jakob was apprenticed
                    in his fourteenth year (1589), being judged not robust enough for husbandry. Ten
                    years later (1599) we find him settled at Görlitz as master-shoemaker, and
                    married to Katharina, daughter of Hans Kuntzschmann, a thriving butcher in the
                    town. After industriously pursuing his vocation for ten years, he bought (1610)
                    the substantial house, which still preserves his name, close by the bridge, in
                    the Neiss-Vorstadt. Two or three years later he gave up business, and did not
                    resume it as a shoemaker; but for some years before his death he made and sold
                    woollen gloves, regularly visiting Prague fair for this purpose.</p>
                <p>Boehme’s authorship began in his 37th year (1612) with a treatise, <hi
                    rend="italic">Morgen Rothe im Auffgang,</hi> which though unfinished was
                    surreptitiously copied, and eagerly circulated in MS. by Karl von Ender. This
                    raised him at once out of his homely sphere, and made him the centre of a local
                    circle of liberal thinkers, considerably above him in station and culture. The
                    charge of heresy was, however, soon directed against him by Gregorius Richter,
                    then pastor primarius of Görlitz. Feeling ran so high after Richter’s pulpit
                    denunciations, that, in July 1613; the municipal council, fearing a disturbance
                    of the peace, made a show of examining Boehme, took possession of his
                    fragmentary quarto, and dismissed the writer with an admonition to meddle no
                    more with such matters. For five years he obeyed this injunction. But in 1618
                    began a second period of authorship; he poured forth, but did not publish,
                    treatise after treatise, expository and polemical, in the next and the two
                    following years. In 1622 he composed nothing but a few short pieces on true
                    repentance, resignation, &amp;c., which, however, devotionally speaking, are the
                    most precious of all his writings. They were the only pieces offered to the
                    public in his lifetime and with his permission, a fact which is evidence of the
                    essentially religious and practical character of his mind. Their publication at
                    Görlitz, on New Year’s 'Day 1624, under the title of <hi rend="italic">Der Weg
                    zu Christo,</hi> was the signal for renewed clerical hostility. Boehme had by
                    this time entered on the third and most prolific though the shortest period
                    (1623-4) of his speculation. His labours at the desk were interrupted in May
                    1624 by a summons to Dresden, where his famous “colloquy” with the Upper
                    Consistorial Court was made the occasion of a flattering but transient ovation
                    on the part of a new circle of admirers. Richter died in August 1624, and Boehme
                    did not long survive his pertinacious foe. Seized with a fever when away from
                    home, he was with difficulty conveyed to Görlitz. His wife was at Dresden on
                    business; and during the first week of his malady he was nursed by a literary
                    friend. He died, after receiving the rites of the church, grudgingly
                    administered by the authorities, on Sunday, 17th November. Clerical ill-will
                    followed him to the grave, and the malice of the vulgar defaced his
                    monument.</p>
                <p>Boehme always professed that a direct inward opening or illumination was the only
                    source of his speculative power. He pretended to no other revelation. Ecstatic
                    raptures we should not expect, for he was essentially a Protestant mystic. No
                    “thus saith the Lord” was claimed as his warrant, after the manner of Antoinette
                    Bourignon, or Ludowick Muggleton; no spirits or angels held converse with him as
                    with Swedenborg. It is needless to dwell, in the way either of acceptance or
                    rejection, on the very few occasions in which his outward life seemed to him to
                    come into contact with the invisible world. The apparition of the pail of gold
                    to the herd boy on the Landskrone, the visit of the mysterious stranger to the
                    young apprentice, the fascination of the luminous sheen, reflected from a common
                    pewter dish, which first, in 1600, gave an intuitive turn to his meditations,
                    the heavenly music which filled his ears as he lay dying— none of these matters
                    are connected organically with the secret of his special power. The mysteries of
                    which he discoursed were not reported to him: he “beheld” them. He saw the root
                    of all mysteries, the <hi rend="italic">Ungrund</hi> or <hi rend="italic"
                    >Urgrund,</hi> whence issue all contrasts and discordant principles, hardness
                    and softness, severity and mildness, sweet and bitter, love and sorrow, heaven
                    and hell. These he “saw” in their origin; these he attempted to describe in
                    their issue, and to reconcile in their eternal result. He saw into the being of
                    God; whence the birth or going forth of the divine manifestation. Nature lay
                    unveiled to him, he was at home in the heart of things. “His own book, which he
                    himself was,” the microcosm of man, with his threefold life, was patent to his
                    vision. Such was his own account of his qualification. If he failed it was in
                    expression; he confessed himself a poor mouthpiece, though he saw with a sure
                    spiritual eye.</p>
                <p>It must not be supposed that the form in which Boehme’s pneumatic realism worked
                    itself out in detail was shaped entirely from within. In his writings we trace
                    the influence of Theophr. Bombast von Hohenheim, known as Paracelsus
                    (1493-1541), of Kaspar Schwenkfeld (1490- 1561), the first Protestant mystic,
                    and of Valentin Weigel (1533-1588). From the school of Paracelsus came much of
                    his puzzling phraseology,—his <hi rend="italic">Turba</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >Tinxtur</hi> and so forth,— a phraseology embarrassing to himself as well as to
                    his readers. His friends plied him with foreign terms, which he was delighted to
                    receive, interpreting them by an instinct, and using them often in a corrupted
                    form and always in a sense of his own. Thus the word <hi rend="italic">Idea</hi>
                    called up before him the image of “a very fair, heavenly, and chaste virgin.”
                    The title <hi rend="italic">Aurora,</hi> by which his earliest treatise is best
                    known, was furnished by Dr Balthasar Walther. These, however, were false helps,
                    which only serve to obscure a difficult study, like the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Flagrat</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Lubet,</hi> with which his English
                    translator veiled Boehme’s own honest <hi rend="italic">Schreck</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">Lust.</hi> There is danger lest his crude science and his crude
                    philosophical vocabulary conceal the fertility of Boehme’s ideas and the
                    transcendent greatness of his religious insight. Few will take the pains to
                    follow him through the interminable account of his seven <hi rend="italic"
                    >Quellgeister,</hi> which remind us of Gnosticism; or even of his three first
                    properties of eternal nature, in which his disciples find Newton’s formulae
                    anticipated, and which certainly bear a marvellous resemblance to the three <hi
                    rend="italic">ἄ</hi><hi rend="italic">ρχαι</hi> of Schelling’s <hi rend="italic"
                    >Theogonische</hi><hi rend="italic">Natur.</hi> Boehme is always greatest when
                    he breaks away from his fancies and his trammels, and allows speech to the voice
                    of his heart. Then he is artless, clear, and strong; and no man can help
                    listening to him, whether he dive deep down with the <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit03newyrich/page/n870/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0903-0870-0853"/> conviction “ohne Gift und Grimm kein Leben,” or
                    rise with the belief that “the being of all beings is a wrestling power,” or
                    soar with the persuasion that Love “in its height is as high as God.” The
                    mystical poet of Silesia, Joh. Angelus, discerned where Boehme’s truest power
                    lay when he sang—</p>
                <p>“Im Wasser lebt der Fisch, die Pflanze in der Erden, Dei Vogel in der Luit, die
                    Sonn’ am Firma*inent, Der Salamander muss im Feu’r erhalten werden, Und Gottes
                    Herz ist Jakob Böhme’s Element.”</p>
                <p>The three periods of Boehme’s authorship constitute three distinct stages in the
                    development of his philosophy. He himself marks a threefold division of his
                    subject matter :—1. <hi rend="smallcaps">Philosophia,</hi> ι.e., the pursuit of
                    the divine <hi rend="italic">Sophia,</hi> a study of God in himself; this was
                    attempted in the <hi rend="italic">Aurora.</hi> 2. <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Astrologia,</hi> ι.e., in the largest sense, cosmology, the manifestation of
                    the divine in the structure of the world and of man; hereto belong, with others,
                    <hi rend="italic">Die</hi><hi rend="italic">drei</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Principle»,</hi><hi rend="italic">göttlichen Wesens</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >;</hi><hi rend="italic">Vom dreifachen Leben der Menschen, Von der
                    Menschwerdung Christi; Von der Geburt und Bezeichnung aller Wesen</hi> (known as
                    <hi rend="italic">Signatura Rerum).</hi> 3 <hi rend="smallcaps">Theologia,</hi>
                    i.e., in Scougall’s phrase, “the life of God in the soul of man.” Of the
                    speculative writings under this head the most important are <hi rend="italic"
                    >Von der</hi><hi rend="italic">Gnadenwαhl;</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Mysterium</hi><hi rend="italic">Magnum</hi> (a spiritual commentary on
                    Genesis); <hi rend="italic">Von Christi Testamenten</hi> (the Sacraments).</p>
                <p>Although Boehme’s philosophy is essentially theological, and his theology
                    essentially philosophical, one would hardly describe him as a philosophical
                    theologian; and, indeed, his position is not one in which either the philosopher
                    or the theologian finds it easy to make himself completely at home. The
                    philosopher finds no trace in Boehme of a conception of God which rests its own
                    validity on an accord with the highest canons of reason or of morals; it is in
                    the actual not in the ideal that Boehme seeks God, whom he discovers as the
                    spring of natural powers and forces, rather than as the goal of advancing
                    thought. The theologian is staggered by a language which breaks the fixed
                    association of theological phrases, and strangely reversing the usual point of
                    view, characteristically pictures God as underneath rather than above. Nature
                    rises out of Him; we sink into Him. The <hi rend="italic">Uηgruηd</hi> of the
                    unmanifested Godhead is boldly represented in the English translations of Boehme
                    by the word <hi rend="italic">Abyss,</hi> in a sense altogether unexplained by
                    its Biblical use. In the <hi rend="italic">Theologia Germanica</hi> this
                    tendency to regard God as the <hi rend="italic">substantia,</hi> the underlying
                    ground of all things, is accepted as a foundation for piety; the same view, when
                    offered in the colder logic of Spinoza, is sometimes set aside as atheistical.
                    The procession of spiritual forces and natural phenomena out of the <hi
                    rend="italic">Engrund</hi> is described by Boehme in terms of a threefold
                    manifestation, commended no doubt by the constitution of the Christian Trinity,
                    but exhibited in a form derived from the school of Paracelsus. From Weigel he
                    learned a purely idealistic explanation of the universe, according to which it
                    is not the resultant of material forces, but the expression of spiritual
                    principles. These two explanations were fused in his mind till they issued forth
                    as equivalent forms of one and the same thought. Further, Schwenkfeld supplied
                    him with the germs of a transcendental exegesis, whereby the Christian
                    Scriptures and the dogmata of Lutheran orthodoxy were opened up in harmony with
                    his new-found views. Thus equipped, Boehme’s own genius did the rest. A primary
                    effort of Boehme’s philosophy is to show how material powers are substantially
                    one with moral forces. This is the object with which he draws out the dogmatic
                    scheme which dictates the arrangement of his seven <hi rend="italic"
                    >Quellgeister.</hi> Translating Boehme’s thought out of the uncouth dialect of
                    material symbols (as to which one doubts sometimes whether he means them as
                    concrete instances, or as pictorial illustrations, or as a mere <hi
                    rend="italic">memoria</hi><hi rend="italic">technica)</hi> we find that Boehme
                    conceives of the correlation of two triads of forces. Each triad consists of a
                    thesis, an antithesis, and a synthesis; and the two are connected by an
                    important link. In the hidden life of the Godhead, which is at once <hi
                    rend="italic">Nichts</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Alles,</hi> exists the original
                    triad, viz., Attraction, Diffusion, and their resultant, the Agony of the
                    unmanifested Godhead. The transition is made; by an act of will the divine
                    Spirit comes to Light; and immediately the manifested life appears in the triad
                    of Love, Expression, and their resultant, Visible Variety. As the action of
                    contraries and their resultant are explained the relations of soul, body, and
                    spirit; of good, evil, and free will; of the spheres of the angels, of Lucifer,
                    and of this world. It is a more difficult problem to account on this philosophy
                    for the introduction of evil. Boehme does not resort to dualism, nor has he the
                    smallest sympathy with a pantheistic repudiation of the fact of sin. That the
                    difficulty presses him is clear from the progressive changes in his attempted
                    solution of the problem. In the <hi rend="italic">Aurora</hi> nothing save good
                    proceeds from the <hi rend="italic">Ungrund,</hi> though there is good that
                    abides and good that falls—Christ and Lucifer. In the second stage of his
                    writing the antithesis is directly generated as such; good and its contrary are
                    coincidently given from the one creative source, as factors of life and
                    movement; while in the third period evil is a direct outcome of the primary
                    principle of divine manifestation—it is the wrath side of God. Corresponding to
                    this change we trace a significant variation in the moral end contemplated by
                    Boehme as the object of this world’s life and history. In the first stage the
                    world is created in remedy of a decline; in the second, for the adjustment of a
                    balance of forces; in the third, to exhibit the eternal victory of good over
                    evil, of love over wrath.</p>
                <p>Boehme’s influence has lain chiefly with the learned. Translations of sundry
                    treatises have been made into Latin (by J. A. Werdenhagen, 1632), Dutch
                    (complete, by W. v. Bayerland, 1634- 41), and French (by Jean Macle, cιrc. 1640,
                    and L. C. de Saint-Martin, 1800-9). For the nearest approach to popularity which
                    his writings have enjoyed we must search the annals of the English Commonwealth.
                    Between 1644 and 1662, all Boehme’s works were translated by John Ellistone (d.
                    1652) and John Sparrow, assisted by Durand Hotham and Humphrey Blunden, who paid
                    for the undertaking. At that time regular societies of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Behmeηists,</hi> embracing not only the cultivated but the vulgar, existed in
                    England and in Holland. They merged into the Quaker movement, holding already in
                    common with Friends that salvation is nothing short of the very presence and
                    life of Christ in the believer, and only kept apart by an objective doctrine of
                    the sacraments which exposed them to the polemic of Quakers <hi rend="italic"
                    >{e.g.,</hi> J. Anderdon). Muggleton led an anthropomorphic reaction against
                    them, and between the two currents they were swept away. The Philadelphian
                    Society at the beginning of the 18th century consisted of cultured mystics, Jane
                    Lead, Pordage, Francis Lee, Bromley, &amp;c., who fed upon Boehme. William Law
                    (1686-1761) somewhat later recurred to the same spring, with the result,
