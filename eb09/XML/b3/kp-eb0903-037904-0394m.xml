                    was born in 1547. He was a native of Amersfoort in the province of Utrecht, and
                    could boast of a long line of noble ancestors. Endowed with superior abilities,
                    he was educated for the profession of the law, and commenced practice as an
                    advocate at the Hague in 1569. He sympathized deeply with his countrymen in
                    their resolution to throw off the hated yoke of Spain, and served as a volunteer
                    at the sieges of Haarlem and Leyden. In 1575 he married; and in the following
                    year he was appointed to the honourable post of counsellor and chiefpensionary
                    of Rotterdam. In 1585, when, in consequence of the assassination of the
                    sagacious and resolute leader of the Dutch, and the general success of the
                    Spaniards under the Prince of Parma, the cause of the patriots seemed almost
                    hopeless, Barneveldt was chosen head of an embassy to Queen Elizabeth, to ask
                    for her assistance and to offer her the sovereignty of the United Provinces. The
                    queen agreed to give aid both in money and in men, but refused to accept the
                    sovereignty. An expedition was sent under the command of Dudley, earl of
                    Leicester, on whom the Dutch conferred supreme and absolute authority.
                    Barneveldt was then raised to the high office of advocate-general of Holland and
                    West Friesland. Dissatisfied and indignant at Leicester’s incompetence,
                    arrogance, and mismanagement, he endeavoured to limit his powers. For this
                    purpose he succeeded in persuading the States to appoint Maurice of Nassau, the
                    young son of the late Prince of Orange, stadtholder and captain-general of
                    Holland and Zealand, thus contributing to place in the highest position the man
                    who was afterwards to become his great antagonist. Leicester was recalled at the
                    close of 1586. In the course of a few years Barneveldt, by his prudence and
                    energy in administration, succeeded in restoring order and materially improving
                    the financial affairs of the States. He proposed to resign in 1592, but at the
                    urgent entreaty of the States retained his post. In 1598 he was sent on an
                    embassy to Henry IV. of France, the object of which was to strengthen and
                    maintain the friendship of France and the United Provinces. In 1603, on the
                    accession of James I. to the throne, Barneveldt was again sent to England as
                    head of an embassy, and in conjunction with the French ambassador, Μ. de Rosny,
                    afterwards duke of Sully, negotiated an arrangement for further assistance
                    against the Spaniards. In 1607, having first insisted on and obtained a
                    recognition of the independence of the Provinces, he began negotiations with
                    Spain with a view to establish a truce. He had to contend against the opposition
                    of the stadtholder and the army, and to suffer from unmerited popular suspicions
                    of taking bribes from the Spanish court. But he triumphed over all difficulties,
                    and on April 9, 1609, the famous twelve years’ truce was concluded. From this
                    time Maurice was his sworn foe. The two men were leaders of two great political
                    parties, and the struggle between them was embittered by the admixture of
                    theological and ecclesiastical controversy. In the strife then going on between
                    the Gomarites (the Calvinistic party) and the Arminians, Maurice sided with the
                    former, while Barneveldt supported the latter. Maurice was aiming at the
                    sovereign power; Barneveldt resolutely maintained the freedom of the republic.
                    The clerical party, who looked up to Prince Maurice as their chief, were bent on
                    getting the Calvinistic system established as the state religion, and on
                    refusing to tolerate any other system; Barneveldt and the Arminians contended
                    that each province should be free to adopt the form which it preferred.
                    Barneveldt was the consistent champion of the supremacy of the civil authority,
                    and “the prime minister of Protestantism” (Motley). The convocation of a
                    National Synod was proposed by the party of the stadtholder and resisted by
                    Barneveldt. When disturbances broke out against the Arminians, Maurice refused
                    <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit03newyrich/page/n395/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0903-0395-0380"/> to suppress them, and disarmed the militia
                    organized for the purpose by Barneveldt. The former now assumed the chief power.
                    An interview took place on August 17,1618, between the advocate and the
                    stadtholder; each adhered resolutely to his own views, and the meeting remained
                    fruitless. Barneveldt, -with his friends Grotius and Hoo-gerbeets, was arrested
                    and imprisoned on the 29th. In November following, in pursuance of the command
                    of Prince Maurice, the famous Synod of Dort assembled. A few days later the
                    trial of the prisoners began before a special. commission. The proceedings were
                    illegal; the accusations against Barneveldt were fully disproved, but he was
                    unjustly found guilty and sentenced to death. This sentence was unscrupulously
                    confirmed by the clerical synod. It was a foregone conclusion, and Barneveldt
                    had seen clearly that there was no hope for him. On the 14th of May 1619, just
                    five days after the closing of the synod, the venerable statesman and patriot,
                    then in his seventy-first year, was beheaded at the Hague. He met his fate
                    without a word of regret, without a sign of fear. His calm courage and his
                    tenderness of heart are attested by a letter, still extant, written to his wife
                    a few hours before his execution. Besides his wife, Maria van Utrecht,
                    Barneveldt left two sons and two daughters. Four years after their, father’s
                    death the sons took part in a plot against Prince Maurice; one of them made his
                    escape and entered the service of Spain, the other was arrested and
                    beheaded.</p>
