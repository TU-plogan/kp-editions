                    undecided, whereas the average time of a base ball match is from two hours to
                    two hours and a half. The first regular base ball society was the old
                    Knickerbocker Club, founded at New York in the autumn of 1845; and for fifteen
                    years the sphere of play was very limited. In the spring of 1860 tho Excelsior
                    Club was inaugurated at Brooklyn, New York, and the amateur element, in
                    contradistinction to the professional, gave a marked impetus to the pastime.
                    This club was second to none in the United States of America, either in social
                    standing or as correct exponents of the game. The secession of the Confederate
                    States soon after, and the sanguinary civil war which followed, was a serious
                    interruption to national or other sports, and base ball became almost obsolete
                    till the season of 1865. Then it began to spread throughout the Union, and to be
                    recognized as a profession, not a few devoting their whole time to it and being
                    paid for their services. Now there are hundreds of games played for every one
                    ten years since. In the summer of 1874 the Boston Base Ball Club and the
                    Athletic Base Ball Club of Philadelphia crossed the Atlantic and played a series
                    of exhibition matches in England and Ireland; but, as anticipated, the pastime
                    did not find favour with Englishmen or take root in British soil.</p>
                <p>The scene chosen for the pastime should be a clear level piece of turf, not less
                    than 500 feet by 350 feet. The following diagram shows the laying out of the
                    ground.</p>
                <p>The position of the bases and base lines may be likened to a 90 feet square
                    shaped diamond. The first point to be selected is the rear angle of the home
                    base, which should be not less than 90 feet from the most suitable end of the
                    ground, and equi-distant from each side. Lay out this base 1 foot square, and
                    from the front apex measure 127 feet 4 inches in a straight line down the
                    ground, and the point reached will be the centre of the second base. Take a
                    cord, 180 feet long, fixing one end on the front angle of the home base, and the
                    other on the centre of the second base. By hauling the centre of this cord taut
                    on the two sides, two isosceles right angled triangles will be formed, and the
                    90 feet square completed. Standing on the home base and looking down the ground,
                    the apex of the triangle on the right hand is the centre of the first base, and
                    of that on the left hand the centre of the third base. 48 feet from the front
                    angle of the home base has then to be measured down the diagonal of the square,
                    in order to fix the centre of the pitcher’s position, which is 6 feet square.
                    Lastly come the foul ball posts, which are on a line with the home and first
                    bases, and home and third bases, and not less than 100 feet from the centres of
                    first and third bases respectively.</p>
                <p>Formerly, nine a side was the usual number of players; but, latterly, an
                    additional man has been introduced as right short-stop, and the sides increased
                    to ten. Their positions are marked in the above diagram. The theory of the game
                    is that one side takes the field, and the other goes in. The pitcher then
                    delivers the ball to the striker, who endeavours to hit it in such a direction
                    as to elude the fielders, and enable him to run round all the base lines home
                    without being put out. If he succeeds a run is scored. When three players are
                    put out the fielding side come in: and after nine innings have been played the
                    side w Inch have scored the most runs wins the game. The rules are voluminous
                    and minute, but the pith of them may be gleaned from the following résumé :—</p>
                <p>The ball must weigh not less than 5 ounces or more than δj ounces avoirdupois,
                    must be not less than 9 inches or more than 9∣ inches in circumference, and must
                    be composed of 1 ounce avoirdupois of vulcanized india-rubber, covered with
                    worsted and leather, red being the most suitable colour for the latter. The bat
                    must be circular in shape, not exceeding 2⅛ inches in diameter at any part, or
                    <hi rend="italic">42</hi> inches in length, and must be made exclusively of
                    wood. The bases shall be 1 foot square, the first, second, and third consisting
                    of white canvas <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit03newyrich/page/n422/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0903-0422-0407"/> tags securely fastened to the ground, and the
                    home base of white etone or marble, level with the ground, and with one angle
                    facing the pitcher. Unless five innings on each side are ooncluded it is no
                    game. No game can be drawn, unless play is stopped by darkness or the weather,
                    when the score of the two sides is even. The pitcher’s position shall be within
                    a 6 feet square, the front of which shall be 45 feet from the centre of the home
                    base, and the centre equidistant from the centre of first and third bases, each
                    angle being marked by a flat iron or stone plate 6 inches square. In delivering
                    the ball, the pitcher must not move either foot outside the limits of the
                    square, and the hand must not be raised higher than the hip. All balls delivered
                    over the home base, and at the height requested by the striker, are fair balls.
                    All other balls are unfair or called balls, and if three occur in succession the
                    striker is allowed to take the first base, and any other players move on a base
                    accordingly. A striker may, however, take an unfair ball at his own risk.
                    Balking, or pretending to deliver the ball and not doing so, is inadmissible,
                    and any player, on first, second, or third base, is allowed to run a base
                    whenever balking is attempted. If, after being warned by the umpire, three balks
                    are made during-the same innings, the out side at once forfeit the game. A ball
                    which hits the bat without being struck at, or the person of the striker or
                    umpire, is a dead ball and out of play. The striker shall stand in a space of
                    ground 6 feet by 3 feet, on either side of the home base, extending 2 feet in
                    front and 4 feet behind the centre thereof, and the inside 1 foot from the
                    outside angle thereof, otherwise it is a foul strike. The striker may call for a
                    high ball, which shall be delivered above his waist, but below his shoulder, ora
                    low ball, <hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> below his waist, but not within 1 foot of
                    the ground. Should the striker fail to strike three fairly delivered balls, he
                    must run the first base. The foul ball lines are unlimited in length, and shall
                    extend in a straight line from the front angle of the first base through the
                    centres of first and third bases respectively. A ball is fairly hit if it first
                    touches the ground, a player’s person, or other object, on or in front of the
                    foul ball lines. A batsman is out—(1.) If a fair ball Be caught before touching
                    the ground, no matter how held by the fielder catching it, or whether the ball
                    first touches the person of another fielder or not, provided it be not caught by
                    the cap; (2.) If a foul ball be similarly held, or if it be so held after
                    touching the ground but once; (3.) If a fair ball be securely held by a fielder
                    while touching the first base with any part of his person before the base-runner
                    touches said base, after hitting a fair ball; (4.) If the batsman, after
                    striking three times at the ball and failing to hit it, and, running to first
                    base, fails to touch that base before the ball is legally held there; (5.) If,
                    after the batsman has similarly failed to hit the ball, it be caught either
                    before touching the ground, or after touching the ground but once; (6.) If the
                    batsman wilfully strikes at the ball to hinder the ball from being caught; (7.)
                    If the batsman hit the ball on a called foul strike, and it be caught either
                    fair or foul, or if he make two called foul strikes. Directly a striker has
                    fairly struck a fair ball he becomes a base-runner; starting from the home base
                    to first base, thence to second, third, and home bases respectively, all bases
                    being invariably run in this order. No base-runner is compelled to vacate his
                    base except by the striker’s striking a fair ball. The lines from base to base
                    are 3 feet wide, clearly marked out on the turf, and a base-runner who leaves
                    the base line to avoid being touched by the ball in the hands of a fielder is
                    out. A run is scored when any base-runner reaches the home base again, after
                    touching all the other bases in proper succession, and provided three players
                    are not put out. No base can be run, or run scored, when a fair strike is caught
                    before touching the ground, unless the base-runner returns to the base he
                    started from, which he cannot leave again until the ball is held by the pitcher,
                    -wherever that fielder may happen to be. No unavoidable obstruction may be
                    offered to any base-runner keeping the base lines. A base-runner is out—(1.) If,
                    while the ball is in play, he be touched by a fielder with the ball in hand,
                    when no part of his person is touching a base; and should the said fielder,
                    while in the act of touching the base-runner, have the ball knocked out of his
                    hand, the base-runner so touched shall be declared out; (2.) If the ball be held
                    by a fielder on the first base before the baserunner, after hitting a fair ball,
                    touches that base; but if a fielder holding the ball, and a base-runner touch a
                    base simultaneously, the latter shall not be declared out; (3.) If he fail to
                    touch the base he runs for, the ball being held by a fielder, while touching
                    said base, before the base-runner returns and touches it; (4.) If he in any way
                    interfere with or obstruct a fielder while attempting to catch a fair fly-ball
                    or a foul ball; (5.) If he wilfully obstruct a fielder from fielding a ball.
                    (6.) If he intentionally kick the ball or let it strike him. The umpire must be
                    thoroughly conversant with the game and all minutiae of the rules. He is the
                    sole arbiter of every point of play, whether pitching, catching, fielding,
                    striking, or running the bases.</p>
                <p>The catcher’s duty is to catch all balls pitched to the striker. He stands close
                    to the striker’s position when the pitching is slow, and some 50 feet off when
                    it is swift. He must be a sure catch in order to catch the striker out when
                    opportunity occurs, and a swift and accurate thrower of the ball to the basemen.
                    The pitcher is the most responsible person on the out side. His great object is
                    to deceive the striker as to where a ball is coming, and he must therefore have
                    full command over the ball, besides possessing the nerve to face any catches hit
                    straight at him. The first, second, and third basemen must all be sure catchers,
                    swift and accurate throwers, and good judges of which bases to send the ball to
                    in order to put an opponent out. The short-stop must be an active man, of great
                    coolness and judgment, a general backer up of the in-field. He is placed near
                    the line from second to third base. The right, centre, and left fielders must
                    all be sure catchers, good long distance throw ers, and active runners. Bight
                    short-stop is generally the captain of the side, and is available either in this
                    position or anywhere else where an extra hand is required. Having less work to
                    do than any other fielder, he has better opportunities of attending to his
                    general duties of supervision. The usual positions of all the fielders are
                    defined in the diagram. The catcher, pitcher, first and third basemen, and
                    short-stop comprise the in-field; the remainder the out-field.</p>
                <p>The pastime requires good catching, throwing, and running powers, combined with
                    courage, nerve, good judgment, and quick perception of what to do in the field.
                    The great draw-back is so much being left to the umpire, and his decision being
                    so frequently called for. Hardly a ball is pitched or struck, or a base run
                    without his being called on for a decision under some rule or other, whereas the
                    details of the game should be so plain and clear as only to call for an umpire’s
                    decision under exceptional circumstances. The attitude of the striker is not an
                    elegant one, and the pitcher is allowed to keep the former’s muscles too long on
                    the stretch before actually delivering the ball. Base ball is a quicker and more
                    lively pastime than the great English national game of cricket, which is the
                    chief thing to be said in its favour. <hi rend="smallcaps">(h. f. w.)</hi></p>
