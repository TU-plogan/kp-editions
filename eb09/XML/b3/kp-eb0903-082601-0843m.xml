                <p><label type="entry">BLIND</label>. The blind, as a class, are limited to such
                    narrow spheres of action that those unacquainted with the subject fail to
                    realize how large a number of the human race are deprived of sight. In the
                    temperate regions of the globe about 1 in every 1000 of the population is blind,
                    but in less favourable climates the percentage is much greater. When we consider
                    what medical skill has already accomplished in Europe and America, not only for
                    the relief but the positive prevention of blindness, we may readily conclude
                    that in warmer and less civilized countries the class is more numerous and their
                    condition more deplorable.</p>
                <p>We rejoice that much can still be done by proper care and treatment to prevent
                    blindness; for instance, ophthalmia of infants is a very common cause, and ought
                    not to terminate in loss of sight, which in most cases results from neglect and
                    dirt. Glaucoma is also a fruitful source of blindness, invariably causing loss
                    of sight if left to itself; but, thanks to Professor Gräfe’s brilliant
                    discovery, these cases are generally curable if operated on early. Another very
                    common cause of blindness is serious injury to one eye, which is thus lost, and
                    if the injured organ be not at once removed, sympathetic inflammation and
                    destruction of the other is very apt to follow, resulting in total blindness;
                    whereas, if the injured eye be at once removed the other is generally
                    preserved.</p>
                <p>Loss of sight from small-pox is now comparatively rare, owing to the general
                    practice of vaccination, but much undoubtedly may still be done towards
                    diminishing the frequency of blindness by further advances in the art of
                    treating eye-disease, and especially by spreading among all classes a knowledge
                    of what has already been done in this direction.</p>
                <p>It often occurs that children become blind through the most trivial causes by
                    parents consulting unskilful practitioners. The improvement and increase in the
                    number of well-regulated hospitals now makes it possible for every parent,
                    however poor, to have the best medical advice and attendance.</p>
                <p>In all ages of the world the blind have been the objects of pity and
                    commiseration, yet it has only been within the past century that Christian
                    civilization in its grand onward march has taken them in its embrace, and shed
                    the influence of its light upon their midnight darkness. During recent years
                    leading philanthropists have given much earnest thought to the best methods of
                    ameliorating and improving the condition of the blind. Nearly all the European
                    Governments and the States of the American Union have made liberal provision for
                    their education and special training. In Great Britain the work has been left
                    thus far to charitable enterprise. Much, however, has been done,—almost every
                    large town having its asylum, workshop, or home teaching society.</p>
                <p>The following summary, from <hi rend="italic">A Guide to Institutions and
                    Charities for the Blind,</hi> prepared by M. Turner and W. Harris in 1871, will
                    show the state of these institutions at a recent date :—</p>
                <p>“In the year 1800 there were only four institutions for the blind in the United
                    Kingdom; during the next thirty years six others were added to the list; in the
                    succeeding thirty years seventeen more were opened; while within the last ten
                    years twenty new ones have been established, making a total now of fifty-three,
                    without including societies for visiting the blind at their homes, and other
                    charities.</p>
                <p>Scotland with five institutions sold, in the last year of which we have any
                    report, goods of the value of £21,930, while England with forty institutions
                    only sold in the same period goods of the value of £33,598; and Ireland, only
                    £454.</p>
                <p>Scotland provides for, on an average, 76 blind in each institution; while England
                    only provides for 43, and Ireland for 60.</p>
                <p>The donations and subscriptions in Scotland for the same year amount to more than
                    £20 per head of the number benefited; while in England they amount to about £21,
                    and in Ireland to about £16.</p>
                <p>So far as returns have reached us, it appears that Mr Moon’s system of reading
                    for the blind is adopted by 38 institutions and home-teaching societies, while
                    only 22 use the books of other systems—Lucas’s, 7; Roman, 4; Alston’s, 4;
                    Frere’s, 3; Braille, 4. [Since 1871 the use of Braille has been introduced into
                    many other institutions.]</p>
                <p>Of the 30,000 blind in the United Kingdom, there are only about 2250 being
                    instructed or assisted to wont. The total amount received per annum for the
                    benefit of the blind, according to the answers received, is about £66,000;
                    besides, there are twelve societies from which no return has been made. Of
                    institutions for the blind generally, we may remark that in each institution
                    nearly the same difficulties appear to exist, the principal one being the
                    difficulty of selling the goods manufactured at such prices as will secure a
                    ready sale and cover the cost of production, and consequently in most instances
                    there is a large surplus stock. In cases where the stock is wholly disposed of,
                    our observations lead us to think that sales have been secured by selling at a
                    loss.</p>
                <p>The principal trades practised by the blind in the United Kingdom are the making
                    of baskets, brushes, brooms, mattresses, rugs, mats, caning of chairs, with
                    knitting and sewing for women.”</p>
                <p>Within a few years a great impetus has been given in England to the higher
                    education of the blind, by the formation of the British and Foreign Blind
                    Association, the establishment of the College for the Blind Sons of Gentlemen at
                    Worcester, and the Royal Normal College and Academy of Music for the Blind,
                    Upper Norwood.</p>
                <p>The first-mentioned association “has been formed for the purpose of promoting the
                    education and employment of the blind, by ascertaining what has been done in
                    these respects in this and other countries, by endeavouring to supply
                    deficiencies where these are found to exist, and by attempting to bring about
                    greater harmony of action between the different existing schools and
                    institutions.</p>
                <p>“The founders of the association took as an axiom that in all questions which
                    relate to obtaining impressions by touch the blind are the best judges; the
                    council of the association therefore consists entirely of gentlemen who are
                    either blind, or so nearly so that they have to use the finger instead of the
                    eye for the purpose of reading.</p>
                <p>“One main difficulty in the way of educating the young blind is the great cost of
                    most of the appliances; this the council have endeavoured to meet by the
                    manufacture of cheaper and better apparatus than any hitherto in use.</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit03newyrich/page/n844/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0903-0844-0827"/>
                <p>No one who has not made the attempt can have any idea of the extreme difficulty
                    of combining great accuracy and durability with cheapness. This has been in a
                    great measure accomplished as regards the Braille writing frames, which are now
                    within the reach of every blind person who wishes to avail himself of the
                    advantages of writing. The fact that a large number of these frames has been
                    already sold speaks for itself, and, as the great majority of the purchasers are
                    poor, the quick sale is evidence not only of the cheapness of the frames, but
                    also of the widespread desire for self-education existing among the blind.</p>
                <p>“Another obstacle to the diffusion of the knowledge of the Braille system has
                    been the absence of printed books in English. With the view of meeting this want
                    one of the council has perfected the process of stereotyping used in France, by
                    which the cost of production of stereotype plates is greatly reduced; and as the
                    blind can themselves produce these plates, a new and remunerative means of
                    employment has been discovered. Some school books have already been issued by
                    the association, and will shortly be followed by others. The work on the <hi
                    rend="italic">Education and Employment of the Blind,</hi> by the honorary
                    secretary, has been published under the sanction and at the expense of the
                    association.”</p>
                <p>The following extract from an address delivered by the honorary secretary before
                    the Society of Arts on the various types for the blind, shows how thoroughly
                    they are investigating the subject :—</p>
                <p>“The happy idea of printing on paper letters recognizable by the touch is due to
                    Μ. Haiiy of Paris, who printed his first book in 1784, and founded the Institut
                    des Jeunes Aveugles, Paris. The type he adopted was the script, or Italic form
                    of the Roman letter. This was introduced into England by the present Sir C.
                    Lowther, who printed the gospel of St Matthew in 1832 with type obtained from
                    Paris, and followed it with other portions of the Bible. In 1834, Gall, of
                    Edinburgh, printed the gospel of St John in Roman capitals, in which, however,
                    all curves were replaced by angular lines, and the lines themselves were
                    serrated, which changes, he believed, gave greater distinctness to the
                    letter.</p>
                <p>Alston, of Glasgow, adopted Fry’s plan of using ordinary Roman capitals. Dr Howe,
                    of Boston, U.S., makes use of the small Roman letters, giving them angularity
                    according to Gall’s idea.</p>
                <p>The Philadelphia type does not differ much from Alston’s. The combination of
                    capitals with small letters has also been tried, and a society has recently been
                    formed at Worcester with the intention of printing on a large scale in this
                    type. In Germany various modifications of the Roman letter exist, the principal
                    of which, the so-called Stachelschrift of Stuttgart, consists of Roman capitals
                    formed by finely dotted lines. AU these modifications are suggestive of the
                    strong tendency among those who have attempted to benefit the blind to retain
                    for them the form of letter to which the seeing are accustomed, while the
                    constant change of form indicates a fact with which most blind persons are
                    familiar from personal experience, viz., that none of these modifications are
                    satisfactory as to the primary condition of being easily felt. A better form
                    than any which has obtained currency was suggested twenty years ago by Mr Welch,
                    a blind man, who has been the pioneer of education amongst the blind of London,
                    and this is almost identical with one independently worked out by Mr Littledale
                    of Cheltenham.</p>
                <p>The second great class is made up of alphabets deviating more or less widely from
                    the Roman letter, and consists of a stenographic shorthand invented by Mr Lucas,
                    a phonetic shorthand due to Mr Frere, and a fuU written system introduced by Mr
                    Moon, in which the Roman letter is retained in a more or less modified form
                    whenever he considered this could be done compatibly with easy recognition, the
                    simple line-signs employed by Mr Frere being used to replace the more
                    complicated of the Roman letters. It will be necessary to examine these systems
                    in detail, and it will facilitate this examination if we compare them with each
                    other in the following particulars :—(a.) As respects the shape of the letter;
                    (δ.) As respects the advantage of conformity with the Roman letter; (c.) As
                    regards the reading from right to left and from left to right alternately; (cf.)
                    Advantage of a shorthand as contrasted with a full written system.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">(a.) As respects the shape of the letter.—</hi> Mr Lucas and Mr
                    Frere brought out their systems about the year 1838, Lucas preceding Frere by a
                    few months. They employed at first almost identically the same characters, but
                    unfortunately could not agree to represent the same sound by the same symbol. Mr
                    Frere had the advantage of having his plan carried out by a very ingenious and
                    sensible blind man, who soon discovered that the letters formed by lines and
                    curves upon which dots were placed were too similar to those formed by the
                    corresponding lines and curves without dots; he, therefore, changed all his
                    dotted characters, replacing the dotted curves by angles of 45°, and the dotted
                    lines by lines in which a short line is substituted for the dot.</p>
                <p>The result of this change is, that Frere’s character is now far superior to
                    Lucas’s in the quality of easy recognition. Mr Moon’s character, in the large
                    size which is used by him, is quite as easily distinguishable as Frere’s, but in
                    the form in which he now prints his characters, his right-angles are not true
                    right-angles, but are rounded. In the size which he uses, this defect is of very
                    little importance, but it effectually prevents any considerable diminution,
                    because, if this is attempted, the rounded right-angles cannot be distinguished
                    from the hooked lines.</p>
                <p>The importance of using a character as small as is compatible with easy
                    recognition may be readily understood from the following statement :—The largest
                    type used by Mr Frere is that employed, in the gospel of St John. The character
                    is 4⅜-sixteenths of an inch long, and is about the same size as Moon’s
                    character. The pages occupied by the gospel of St John in Frere are 96. In his
                    medium type, in which the length of the letter is 4-sixteenths of an inch, the
                    same matter would go into 67 pages; and in his smallest type, in which the
                    length of the letter is 3⅛-sixteenths, it would occupy 46 and a third pages. It
                    has been found, by an experience extending over 27 years, and embracing many
                    hundreds of individuals of all ages and conditions, that all those who can read
                    the largest type can read the medium, and almost all can read the smaUest.</p>
                <p>The medium type is very generally preferred, as being more pleasant to the
                    finger, and many with delicate touch prefer the smallest for the same reason.
                    Thus it will be seen that, by selecting a well-devised character, not only can a
                    very considerable saving be made in the size, and therefore in the cost of
                    books, but by a diminution of size, within certain limits, the character is
                    rendered absolutely more legible. The gospel of St John, in Moon’s type,
                    occupies 140 pages.</p>
                <p>(δ.) <hi rend="italic">As respects the advantage of conformity with the Reyman
                    letter.—</hi> Much has been said and written on this subject. A favourite
                    argument with the advocate of the Roman letter is, that by its use a blind man
                    can be assisted in his reading by those around him who are possessed of sight.
                    This, no doubt, would be valid if no simpler character for the blind had been
                    invented, but when we have to choose between a character in the reading of which
                    the blind can be assisted by the seeing, and one which is so simple that no
                    assistance is required, there can hardly be a doubt as to which ought to be
                    used.</p>
                <p>Another plea for the use of the Roman letter is, that by its means the blind can
                    write in a character understood by everybody. This writing is, as we shall
                    presently see, a very imperfect process; but this argument is undoubtedly of
                    some weight. These remarks apply simply to the existing systems in which the
                    Roman letter is employed. It is probable that a much more legible alphabet might
                    be constructed, but, after our 96 years of experience and experiments with.the
                    Roman letter, another failure may well be feared. The small angularized Roman
                    letter of Dr Howe, of Boston, which is used in most of the schools of the United
                    States, is probably as good a form as any, and if printed in a larger size would
                    not be difficult to feel; in its present size, however, it is far too small, and
                    has signally failed in America. The American schools are aU State institutions,
                    and have to furnish accounts to their respective State Legislatures of the work
                    done by them.</p>
                <p>Out of 664 pupils in seven schools, where the Roman character of Dr Howe is used,
                    one-third learn to read fluently, one-third by spelling, while none fail; and it
                    must be borne in mind that those who learn to read by this system also acquire
                    an admirable method of writing. Moon’s system retains those Roman letters which
                    can be easily distinguished, and thus makes a transition between the systems in
                    Λvhich the Roman character is used and those which employ purely arbitrary
                    signs. For this reason, and from its great simplicity of construction, it is
                    more easily learned than any other, and therefore is well suited to the great
                    mass of the poor, who from want of intelligence or of application cannot learn
                    one of the shorthand systems. Its great bulk, however, involving costliness of
                    production and comparative slowness of reading, is a serious obstacle to its
                    general use.</p>
                <p>(c.) <hi rend="italic">Reading from left to right, and from right to left,
                    alternately.</hi> —In Frere’s system the lines are read from left to right, and
                    from right to left, alternately, an arc of a circle taking the finger from the
                    end of the upper to the beginning of the lower line. The plan may be illustrated
                    by imagining the letters to be fixed on the upper edge of a long string. Let it
                    be supposed that this string is doubled backwards and forwards upon itself in
                    such a way that the letters always occupy its upper edge. This will give a good
                    idea of Frere’s method of reversing the line; not only is the line reversed, but
                    every letter in it is also reversed, so that the finger, when <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit03newyrich/page/n845/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0903-0845-0828"/> moving forwards, whether towards the right or
                    towards the left, meets the characters in the same position, and is, in fact,
                    never moving backwards, in the same manner that a person may walk to the end of
                    a room, turn and walk back, yet is moving forwards in both directions. Moon, on
                    the other hand, while borrowing the reversal of the line from Frere retains the
                    letters in the returning line in the same position as the advancing, so that the
                    finger in the return line meets the characters in the opposite direction from
                    that in the advancing line; and to those accustomed to Frere’s simpler method of
                    reversal an unpleasant feeling is produced, exactly comparable to walking
                    backwards.</p>
                <p>The following example of both modes of reversal, in which Roman Capitals are
                    used, will make this clear :—</p>

                <p>No doubt habit will accustom a reader to either plan, and probably there is not
                    much difference in the difficulty of either, but, as we shall see by-and-by, it
                    is absolutely necessary for writing that the pupil should thoroughly understand
                    that, whichever way he goes, he is moving forwards; it is, therefore, wise to
                    accustom him in reading to a process which he will have to follow in writing.
                    Opinions differ widely among the blind whether it is best to read forwards in
                    one direction and backwards in the other, or forward in both; it seems, however,
                    among those who have had experience of the return line, that there can be no
                    doubt of its great value, as by its use no time is lost by the reading finger
                    having to return from the end of the upper to the beginning of the lower line,
                    and the setting free of the left hand enables it to follow the right in reading,
                    to take its place, or to rest.</p>
                <p>(d∙) <hi rend="italic">Shorthand.—</hi> By a shorthand system, reading is more
                    rapid, and a nearer approach is made to the way in which the eye takes in a
                    whole word at a glance, than in a full-written system. The books are also more
                    manageable and less costly, but the stereographic method is distinctive of
                    correct spelling, and in the phonetic method this is not even attempted; yet it
                    is advisable, for many reasons, that the blind should be able to spell. The
                    shorthand systems seem therefore to be of the same use to the blind as to the
                    seeing—not being of universal application, but extremely useful to those who
                    have to read much.</p>
                <p>In all the systems which we have hitherto considered, the letters, whether Roman
                    or arbitrary, are formed by raised lines. The method employed for writing them
                    is as follows :—Small cubes of wood are used with projecting pin points, so
                    placed as to assume the form of each letter. The paper to be written on being
                    laid on a soft surface, the pin-point letters are pressed into it; each point
                    carries some of the paper before it, forming a little prominence on the reverse
                    side, ana as the pin points are very close together, the series of little
                    prominences formed by them feel to the fingers like serrated lines. This plan
                    ought rather to be called printing than writing. It requires great practice, and
                    is at the best very slow and imperfect; yet it has its uses, as by employing
                    Roman capitals the blind can correspond with the seeing. The letters, however,
                    are not sufficiently distinct, and communications from blind correspondents
                    written in this manner, or with pencil, are less satisfactory, both to writer
                    and reader, than if the letter had been written from dictation. Printing from
                    the Roman letter (not embossed) can be effected by the blind, with considerable
                    rapidity, by means of Hughes’s typograph or Foucault’s writing-machine; but the
                    blind writer cannot read what he has written, and the apparatus is so costly
                    that it is not procurable by the poor.</p>
                <p>[A new machine called ‘the type-writer,’ has lately been invented in America. It
                    is largely manufactured, and is coming into general use for the seeing. It is
                    equally well adapted to the use of the blind, is veιy simple, and can be
                    manipulated very rapidly. A skilful operator can write at least twice as fast as
                    an expert penman. It is not only a valuable invention, but one superior to all
                    others of the kind.]</p>
                <p>Various plans exist to enable the blind to keep their lines when writing with a
                    pencil or with a stile on carbonized paper, but such writing can only be used
                    for correspondence with the seeing, and cannot, of course, be read by touch.</p>
                <p>We come now to the third class of systems, viz., those in which the letters are
                    formed by a combination of dots. These are :—</p>
                <p>1. The Braille system, universal in France, both for writing and printing, and
                    very much used for both purposes in Switzerland, and employed as the <hi
                    rend="italic">written</hi> character in almost all countries, with the exception
                    of the United Kingdom.</p>
                <p>2. The Carton type, which was introduced into Belgium by the Abbé Carton.</p>
                <p>3. Hughes’s system consists of large and small dots, and lines placed in
                    different positions. It never obtained much currency, and seems never to have
                    attracted the attention which its ingenuity merited.</p>
                <p>4. A modification of the French method has been lately proposed in New York, and
                    seems to have much to recommend it.</p>
                <p>To begin with the French method. This was invented in 1334 by Μ. Braille, a blind
                    pupil of the <hi rend="italic">Institut</hi><hi rend="italic">des jeunes
                    Aveugles.</hi> It spread with great rapidity, and has, as we have before seen,
                    become almost the universal written language of the blind. Its signs are purely
                    arbitrary and consist of varying combinations of six dots placed in an oblong,
                    of which the vertical side contains three and the horizontal two dots. For
                    writing, a frame is used consisting of a grooved metal bed, containing ten
                    grooves to the inch; over this is fitted a guide whose vertical diameter is <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 1</hi> ⅜ inch, while the horizontal diameter is <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 1</hi> ⅞. This perforated guide is fixed into a light wooden
                    frame, like the frame of a slate, which is attached to the grooved metal bed by
                    hinges. The paper is introduced between the frame and the grooved bed. The
                    instrument for writing is a blunt awl, which cames a little cap of paper before
                    it into the grooves of the bed, thereby producing a series of little pits on the
                    side next the writer. When taken out and turned over, kittle prominences are
                    felt, corresponding to the pits on the other side. The reading is performed from
                    left to right, consequently the writing is from right to left; but this reversal
                    presents no practical difficulty as soon as the pupil has caught the idea that
                    in reading and writing alike he has to go <hi rend="italic">forwards.</hi> The
                    brass guide has a double row of openings, which enables the writer to write two
                    lines; when these are written, he shifts his guide downwards until two little
                    pins, which project from the under surface at its ends, drop into corresponding
                    holes of the frame, when the writer writes two more lines, and this operation is
                    repeated until he aιτives at the bottom of the page.</p>
                <p>The first ten letters, from ‘a’ to ’ j, ’ are formed in the upper and middle
                    grooves; the next ten, from ‘k’ to ‘t,’ are formed by adding one lower dot
                    behind to each letter of the first series; the third row, from ‘ u ’ to ‘ ιι ’
                    is formed from the first by adding two lower dots to each letter; the fourth
                    row, from ‘a’ to ‘ w, ’ similarly, by adding one lower front dot.</p>
                <p>The first ten letters, when preceded by the prefix for numbers, stand for the
                    nine numbers and the cypher. The same signs, written in the lower and middle
                    grooves, instead of the upper and middle, serve for punctuation. The seven last
                    letters of each series stand for the seven musical notes—the first series
                    representing quavers, the second minims, the third semibreves, the fourth
                    crotchets. Rests, accidentals, and every other sign used in music, can be
                    readily and clearly expressed, without having recourse to the staff of five
                    lines which forms the basis of ordinary musical notation, and which, though it
                    has been reproduced for the blind, can only be considered as serving to give
                    them an idea of the method employed by the seeing, and cannot, of course, be
                    written. By means of this dotted system a blind man is able to keep memoranda or
                    accounts, write his own music, emboss his own books from dictation, and carry on
                    correspondence.</p>
                <p>But this French system, though extremely useful, is not perfect. The letter is
                    too small for ready recognition by the unskilful or hard-handed, and if this is
                    sought to be remedied by increasing the size, the reading finger does not cover
                    the whole of the letter, and has to proceed up and down, feeling out each
                    letter, instead of following the even gliding motion essential to good reading.
                    The modification proposed in New York remedies this defect, though this does not
                    appear to have been the intention of its promoters. It proceeds on the principle
                    that the letters occurring most frequently in the English language should be
                    represented by the fewest number of dots, and that the letters should be so
                    spaced that a letter composed of one dot should not, as is the case in the
                    French system, occupy the same room as one with six dots. For this purpose the
                    oblong, consisting of six dots, composing the root-form of the letter, is placed
                    horizontally instead of vertically, the greatest vertical depth of any letter in
                    two dots instead of three. From these two changes results a saving of about
                    one-third in space; this involves a saving of about one-third in the price of
                    printed books; writing is rendered more rapid; and as the size can now be
                    increased, owing to the diminution of the vertical length of the letter, it can
                    be made sufficient for the dullest touch. Ten-word and part-word signs have been
                    introduced, which effect a further saving of nearly one-third, while they do not
                    interfere in the least degree with correct spelling. These advantages make it
                    well worth while to consider whether the modification of the Braille system
                    ought not to be adopted as the written system of all English-speaking blind; but
                    before such a step is recommended, the question should be carefully considered
                    in all its bearings on musical notation as well as on ordinary wilting.”</p>
                <p>Regarding the Worcester College for Blind Sons of ι Gentlemen, founded in 186G by
                    the Rev. R. H. Blair, the &lt; Report informs us that—</p>
                <p>“It was opened with the view of giving to families of the better class an
                    opportunity of educating their children in a systematic <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit03newyrich/page/n846/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0903-0846-0829"/> manner, with a due regard to home comforts, and
                    with surroundings befitting their position.</p>
                <p>The course of education projected by Mr Blair was such as would convert the
                    pupils into intelligent home companions, if no other object were desired. But a
                    conviction, based on personal knowledge, that the blind were capable of the
                    highest competition with the seeing, lay at the root of this gentleman’s
                    endeavours. Selfhelpfulness and usefulness in the ordinary affairs of life is
                    therefore but one of the first results which reward the teaching of the blind;
                    and it appears that blind men can be made reproductive also, not only in the
                    particular instance, but in the bulk, and that the arts of teaching and
                    lecturing, acting as deputations, translating, presiding over blind or other
                    institutions, the law, and in the most favoured cases the church, are fully
                    within the capacity of the well-educated blind. A prejudice has hitherto existed
                    against the employment of blind men, owing to their supposed incapacity, and
                    certain other drawbacks resulting from neglect. Let this impression be removed,
                    and there will be an increase in the number of positions open to them.</p>
                <p>For an entrance into these walks of life, the training must be such as to enable
                    its recipients to compete for university distinctions. The objections to this
                    course, if they are entertained, will be removed by a little reflection on the
                    nature and uses of a university; and the difficulties which in the idea of
                    inexperienced persons a blind man has to overcome, are greatly diminished by
                    being met and grappled with in early years, and are actually being materially
                    lessened by the earnest efforts now made by blind instructors and
                    investigators.</p>
                <p>It is impossible to rule definitely at what age the school education of a child
                    born blind should begin. Children vary as much in natural quickness as parents
                    in the power of educating. A quick and resolute child will, through the
                    clumsiness of nurses or the carelessness of a parent, early acquire tricks which
                    it takes years to eradicate, and acquire habits and ways of thought and action
                    which may have a profound effect on his after life. The sooner, therefore, a
                    child can consistently with his health and other considerations be admitted to
                    cheerful and active society, where his character can have free play and find
                    sympathy, yet be quietly trained, the more easy will his education be
                    afterwards. For those who have become blind from accident or disease, in
                    childhood or towards the age of adolescence, one word of advice may be given. As
                    soon as it is ascertained that the blindness is past remedy, the child should be
                    sent to school, so that the habit of study may be remitted as little as
                    possible. It is in the highest degree impolitic to allow the faculties to
                    degenerate through several years’ disuse, as is often done; and it is in reality
                    kinder to a child or youth to send him away to pick up strength and consolation
                    by the example of his cheerful and patient fellows, and to distract his grief by
                    learning the instruments which he will ultimately need in his education, than to
                    keep him in the indulgences of home, brooding over his misfortune, or buoyed up
                    by a hope which will not be realized.</p>
                <p>No claim to exclusiveness is asserted in the use of English types. There are
                    useful works to be found in all; and when a pupil arrives who lias been educated
                    in one or other form of type, he is never discouraged from its continued use.
                    But as uniformity of classbooks is desirable, and one system must be employed as
                    a basis, the Roman form, in which are printed books suitable for higher
                    education, is adopted for class purposes. Dr Moon’s type is read by some for
                    recreation or private study, and the American Bible, which is the most portable
                    yet printed, and is beautifully executed, is read by those whose dexterity,
                    acquired by long practice, enables them to master this somewhat difficult,
                    because small, type. After Some years of practice the desire for smaller type
                    seems to become a passion for those possessed of a quick and nimble touch.</p>
                <p>Dr Moon’s type is large and easy, and comprises the Bible, Prayer Book, and a
                    large number of religious and devotional works, together with numerous stories,
                    biographies, and other works suitable for the young and aged. Dr Moon has also
                    several educational works of a very useful character; but his plan of action has
                    not yet led him to enter largely into the production of higher literature.”</p>
                <p>The Royal Normal College and Academy of Music for the Blind has for its object
                    the affording of a thorough general and musical education to the youthful blind
                    of both sexes who possess the requisite talent, so as to qualify them for
                    self-maintenance. The Report of the institution states that</p>
                <p>“As without previous trial it would in many cases be difficult to determine
                    whether an applicant for admission has sufficient capacity for the kind of
                    education given at the college, candidates will first be received as <hi
                    rend="italic">probationers</hi> for a term of three months, or less. If, at the
                    end of that period, they are found to possess adequate ability, they may become
                    permanent pupils.</p>
                <p>With a view to adapting the methods of instruction to pupils of different ages
                    and capacities, the following classification has been adopted, viz. :—A. The
                    elementary section, the instnιction in which is designed especially for children
                    from seven to nine years of age;</p>
                <p>B. The inteπnediate, for pupils from nine to twelve yearn of age;</p>
                <p>C. The junior, for pupils from twelve to fifteen years of age; D. The senior, for
                    pupils from fifteen to twenty-one years of age. Exceptional cases over
                    twenty-one yearn of age can only be admitted by special vote of the
                    committee.</p>
                <p>The college embraces three distinct departments—1. General education; 2. The
                    science and practice of music; 3. Pianoforte tuning.</p>
                <p>The department of general education embraces all the ordinary branches of a sound
                    English education. Special care is bestowed on the intellectual training of the
                    pupils; for experience has shown that in order to qualify the blind for
                    self-support, it is essential .o afford them a thorough <hi rend="italic"
                    >general</hi> as well as musical education.</p>
                <p>In the musical department both vocal and instrumental instruction is given,
                    according to the improved methods which have been employed during late years
                    with marked success in the leading institutions of France and America. This
                    department embraces the culture of the voice, the study of the piano, organ, and
                    other solo instruments, harmony, counterpoint, composition, the history of
                    music, and the art of teaching.</p>
                <p>In the department for training the pupils in the art of regulating and tuning
                    pianos, pupils are instructed who have passed the age at which they might have
                    become qualified for remunerative employment in other departments. Though a
                    superficial knowledge of the art of tuning may be readily acquired by those
                    deprived of sight, a prolonged course of careful training is necessary in order
                    to enable them to become thoroughly successful.</p>
                <p>Experience has shown that the blind can seldom fully support themselves merely by
                    <hi rend="italic">manual labour,</hi> and the great majority of those who have
                    been trained to industrial trades continue to require charitable assistance
                    during their whole life.</p>
                <p>It is well known that many of the blind possess musical talent, yet only a small
                    number in the United Kingdom have ever been qualified to earn their living by
                    the profession of music.</p>
                <p>Such was formerly the case in other countries, but during recent years great
                    improvements in the general and musical education of the blind have been
                    effected abroad, particularly in France and America, and large numbers of this
                    class educated in the institutions of those countries have been enabled to
                    maintain themselves fully by various pursuits, especially as skilled organists,
                    teachers, pianists, and pianoforte tuners.</p>
                <p>In view of the practical results of the improved education of the blind in other
                    countries, the Normal College and Academy of Music was founded in order to
                    afford similar advantages to the youthful blind of the United Kingdom.</p>
                <p>The college was opened in March 1872, under the direction of a committee,
                    including members of the governing bodies of various metropolitan societies and
                    institutions for the blind, with an experienced principal, and a staff of
                    highly-trained teachers.</p>
                <p>Upwards of seventy pupils from London and other large towns have been under
                    instruction; a number have already left the college, and are now regularly
                    employed as thoroughly competent pianoforte tuners.”</p>
                <p>As it will be impossible in this article to give any lengthened account of the
                    institutions on the Continent and in America, we will briefly sketch the plan of
                    working in a few of the most progressive.</p>
                <p>The following extracts from addresses delivered at the first European Congress of
                    Teachers of the Blind at Vienna in 1873, will best give an insight into the
                    schools of Saxony :—</p>
                <p>Herr Reimer, superintendent of the <hi rend="italic">Preparatory School for the
                    Blind</hi> at Hubertusberg, pointed out that, “even among the families which are
                    not very poor, blind children often grow up without learning to wash or feed
                    themselves, with hands hanging soft and helpless at. their sides, and thus
                    become more incapable than the poorest, who are forced to exert themselves by
                    the necessity of the case.</p>
                <p>If they are not taught to help themselves at home, it is very difficult to teach
                    them at school, and as the existing blind institutions cannot admit young
                    children without injuring the education of the older ones, they ought to be
                    taught in preparatory schools or Kindergärten separately, which should be
                    established by the State.</p>
                <p>In the preparatory school at Hubertusberg in Saxony, the first thing aimed at is
                    the strengthening of the limbs, then to make the children use them properly, to
                    make them help themselves instead of relying on others, to correct their bad
                    habits and to improve their mental condition, arousing in their minds the love
                    ot God and of truth as well as conscience. All this must be done methodically,
                    and each lesson must be given separately and repeatedly as well as most
                    patiently.</p>
                <p>The change wrought thus is wonderful, if the teachers are eχ. perienced. They
                    must be encouraged to move about as directed, and the ‘ Frobel play and
                    exercises ’ will be found useful. Plaiting <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit03newyrich/page/n847/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0903-0847-0830"/> Btrips of leather, and other occupations which
                    combine play with work, are carried on with advantage. A good manager of
                    Kindergärten can do them great good, and gymnastics give them the power of
                    controlling their limbs; but every exercise must be first taught singly</p>
                <p>Object lessons must be given by means of models, stuffed animals, birds, fish,
                    &amp;c., to bring out the powers of memory and reason. Simple hymns and ballads
                    are practised.</p>
                <p>Very little technical work can be taught, except making rush baskets, &amp;c., as
                    the children are all under ten. This school has been carried on for eleven
                    years, and the benefits of teaching blind children so early are plainly seen by
                    all who watch the progress which they make when removed to the Blind
                    Institution; they are fit for independent work at an age three years less than
                    the average of those who do not go through it.</p>
                <p>As the children pass through the institution more rapidly, there is also more
                    room for those who become blind as adults.”</p>
                <p>Of the <hi rend="italic">National Blind Institution</hi> at Dresden, Dr Reinhard,
                    the director, said—“It is organized so that the working school forms an
                    essential part of it, ana when children enter it, consideration is at once
                    given, not only to their physical, religious, and intellectual education, but
                    also to their instruction in work. Whilst between the ages of six and eleven
                    they remain in the preparatory school, and find inexhaustible occupation in
                    Fröbel’s system of play and exercise</p>
                <p>‘ Playwork ’ is given them as they become fit for it; for the feeling that they
                    can make something useful rejoices the little workers and excites their
                    activity; it is important that they should learn early to aim at real work. They
                    learn to plait reed mats, which is an excellent means of strengthening the
                    muscles of the arm and hand, and they also make little rush baskets.</p>
                <p>The range of their work is extended when they are transferred to the higher
                    class, which is usually during their eleventh year; and from that time till
                    their confirmation, which is generally at the end of their fourteenth year, they
                    have at least three hours’ work every day in the shops.</p>
                <p>The work of the girls is, unfortunately, much restricted, and it is doubtful
                    whether their learning to make baskets and rope is without injury to their
                    constitution. Besides, we must not lose sight of the evils arising from then·
                    working with male overseers and workmen.</p>
                <p>Hence, girls learn in general only knitting, plaiting counterpanes, chair-caning,
                    hair-working, and sewing—as much as is required for mending their linen.</p>
                <p>Hair-work has already been adopted in another institution, and is the most
                    profitable work for blind girls, as a clever one can eaπι 7 or 8 groschen (about
                    9d. ) a day by it, whilst the quickest knitter can scarcely make 2 groschen a
                    day.</p>
                <p>The boys learn either basket-making or rope-making; they learn in the rope
                    factory various kinds of light work, and, when they have been confirmed, choose
                    for themselves between these two trades, their muscles being strengthened by
                    alternately being employed at both.</p>
                <p>It is important to consider the grounds of fitness for these trades. Rope-making
                    requires strength and health of body, for much of the work must be carried on in
                    places exposed to the weather; and besides this it requires a great deal of
                    dexterity which is not indispensable in basket-making. It is also of great
                    importance that each should learn the trade in which he is most likely to
                    succeed after leaving the institution; for the great object is that pupils
                    should be fitted for independent work eventually.</p>
                <p>All those who understand the subject are now convinced that the blind cannot be
                    really helped by building asylums. If there were three times as many asylums as
                    there are schools, there would not be room for all, and the inmates would never
                    be satisfied with their condition. Even women prefer an independent life full of
                    care to the sameness of an asylum, where one quarrelsome person often embitters
                    the whole life of the institution.</p>
                <p>If there is any possibility of establishing pupils of either sex without exposing
                    them to the risk of losing their health, there can be no doubt that it is to be
                    preferred to placing them in asylums.</p>
                <p>“The Dresden Blind Institution is managed on the principle that the pupils, on
                    commencing independent work, requiro much assistance before they can support
                    themselves by it, and tust the institution must give the necessary help. The
                    director of the institution makes known to the manufacturers that a blind worker
                    is coming to settle near them, and induces some of the families around to take
                    an interest in him, and recommend him for employment. He also inserts in the
                    newspapers short notices describing his capacity for work, and his difficulty in
                    finding customers, &amp;c., and requesting people to employ him.</p>
                <p>The outfit required for pupils on leaving the institution consists of tools and
                    clothing, and materials must also be provided at first. The cost of these is
                    partly defrayed by the fund established for the purpose, partly by the savings
                    of the pupils, and partly, if necessary, by a grant from the parish.</p>
                <p>It is indispensable that the blind worker should have some person near in whom he
                    can fully confide, and from whom he can get advice and help in any time of
                    temporary difficulty, whilst the manager of the institution can rely on his
                    taking an interest in the worker, and seeing that he obeys the rules.</p>
                <p>The purchase of raw material causes the greatest difficulty; the blind man has
                    not the means of buying much at a time, and must, consequently, pay highly for
                    it; therefore the institution helps him by buying it at wholesale prices and
                    letting him have it at the same price in small quantities. The number of his
                    applications for materials shows the managers whether the man is
                    industrious.</p>
                <p>More than 200 blind support themselves in Saxony by means of the aid afforded by
                    the fund and their own exertions. The fund amounted, in 1873, to 85,000 dollars,
                    subscribed in all parts of the country.”</p>
                <p>Previous to the Franco-German War, Mr Liebreich, a celebrated oculist and
                    practical friend of the blind, by order of the empress of the French, prepared a
                    report in regard to the <hi rend="italic">Institution</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Imperiale</hi><hi rend="italic">des jeunes Aveugles</hi> of Paris, in which he
                    says that the institution—</p>
                <p>“Is an establishment of the State, in which children of both sexes deprived of
                    sight receive an intellectual, musical, and industrial training. Children are
                    received at the age of 13 years. They remain in the institution 8 years, and are
                    made professors, musicians, tuners of pianos, workmen and workwomen.</p>
                <p>During the last ten years 110 male pupils have left the institution, concerning
                    whom we have received satisfactory information. The workwomen, on the contrary,
                    earn but very little; among 166 blind, 108 have received α very good education,
                    which ensures to them an easy and independent living; 56 have received an
                    elementary training, and have not been put entirely beyond the charge of public
                    charity.</p>
                <p>The annual expense for 200 pupils is very nearly 240,000 francs (of which 146,000
                    francs are given by the State), making an average of 1200 fr. (£48) per
                    pupil,—the workman costing a little less, the artist a little more. This sum is
                    not excessive for the education of a tuner, a professor, or an organist, but it
                    certainly is for the education of a workman, who only receives an elementary
                    training, and is not even qualified to earn his own living.</p>
                <p>Μ. Gaudet, chief instructor of the institution, expresses disapproval of the
                    simultaneous education of artists and workmen. He says, ‘ Realizing from the
                    first the great difference which exists between the future of an organist or a
                    piano tuner on one side, and of a blind workman on the other, the apprentices
                    regard themselves as sacrificed; therefore they do all they can to become
                    tuners, and thus often lose much time in fruitless efforts before they resign
                    themselves to become workmen, and even then toil reluctantly. On quitting the
                    establishment to follow their occupations, they are not habituated to assiduous
                    toil; returning to their indigent families they regret the comfortable life of
                    the institution, and finally become discouraged.’</p>
                <p>Tuners begin ordinarily to work with piano manufacturers, and earn easily 1500
                    francs per year. If a little later they succeed in obtaining a town connection,
                    they have no difficulty in earning double that or more. Some have even succeeded
                    in uniting manufacture with tuning. The organists, by obtaining places in
                    churches and by giving music lessons, very soon earn a good livelihood.</p>
                <p>In short, the tuners, organists, and teachers have, in spite of their infirmity,
                    become independent men, exercising honourable and lucrative professions; some
                    have maπied and reared families, others have come to the aid of their indigent
                    relatives.</p>
                <p>Very different is the lot of the blind workmen, who by toiling without relaxation
                    many more hours than sighted workmen, barely succeed in gaining a part of what
                    they need to support themselves. By perfecting as far as possible the industrial
                    training of the institution, a greater number of the male pupils might be
                    enabled to earn 300 or 400 francs, but none far exceed this sum. The workwomen
                    seldom earn more than 100 or 150 francs per year.”</p>
                <p>The institutions of America are not asylums, but in the truest sense of the word
                    educational establishments, in which the blind, without regard to their future,
                    receive a thorough education. The blind in the United States are socially far
                    above those of any other country; large numbers of them become eminent scholars
                    and musicians, and even their blind workmen enjoy a degree of comfort unknown in
                    England or on the Continent.</p>
                <p>The results achieved by the Perkins Institution at Boston, U.S., are particularly
                    instructive. High-class musical training appears to have been commenced there
                    about 13 years ago, previous to which time the results in this respect were far
                    from being satisfactory. The report of 18G7 states that music is now taught to
                    all of both sexee whose natural abilities make it probable that under proper <pb
                    break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit03newyrich/page/n848/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0903-0848-0831"/> instruction, they will succeed as organists,
                    teachers of music, or piano tuners, and goes on to say—“The teaching of music
                    and playing is now the largest single field open to the blind as a means of
                    support, and it seems to be growing larger. People are becoming more disposed to
                    employ them; and as they go forth from the school they have more and more ground
                    of hope that they will find opportunities to earn their living in this way.” The
                    whole tone of mind among the musical pupils has been changed, for instead of
                    looking forward to the future with fear and anxiety, they now feel a
                    well-grounded confidence in themselves. It seems that in Boston, and in America
                    generally, the blind are able to earn more as teachers of music than as tuners,
                    which is exactly the reverse of the state of things existing in Paris, and may
                    arise either from differences in the condition of the two countries, or from the
                    training for teachers being more thorough at Boston than at Paris; but their
                    experience is identical in one respect, which is, that the blind who have the
                    requisite amount of talent are almost certain to make a good income out of
                    music; but to attain this end they must aim high. It will not do to be equal to
                    the average seeing teacher or tuner; they must be superior; and this involves a
                    good musical notation with first-rate masters, instruments, and appliances, and
                    above all, a determination on the part of managers and teachers to overcome all
                    obstacles.</p>
                <p>A few paragraphs from American reports will sufficiently illustrate the
                    enlightened views held in that country in regard to the education of the
                    blind.</p>
                <p>“A school for the higher education of the blind should be specially adapted to
                    the condition and wants of the persons to be trained. In it the course of study
                    should be the same as in our best colleges. All instruction should be oral, and
                    the apparatus and modes of illustration be addressed to the touch. It should be
                    supplied with text-books, maps, diagrams, and the like, in raised characters. It
                    should have large collections of models of various kinds, such as weights,
                    measures, tools, machinery, and the like; mannikins and models showing the
                    anatomy of plants and animals, as well as their outward form. It should have
                    collections of shells, crystals, minerals, and the like; models and sections
                    showing geological strata; philosophical apparatus adapted to the touch; in
                    short, everything that can be represented by tangible forms.</p>
                <p>It would amaze those who have not reflected upon it to know how much can be done
                    in this way. Saunderson, the blind professor of mathematics in Cambridge, not
                    only knew ordinary money well, but he was an expert numismatist, and could
                    detect counterfeits in a collection of antique coins better than. ordinary
                    persons could do by the sight.</p>
                <p>Such an institute should have able professors and teachers, with special aptness
                    for adapting their lessons to the condition of their scholars. It should furniä.
                    special facilities for the study of languages, ancient and modem, of
                    mathematics, of pedagogy, and especially of music. It should also be well
                    provided with everything necessary in a good conservatory of music, and have
                    funds for the payment of competent teachers.</p>
                <p>It is evident that there are a large number of persons to whom such an institute
                    would be a source of great happiness, and a means of preparation for great
                    usefulness.</p>
                <p>A little reflection will show what a great advantage generous culture would be to
                    a blind man, even if he were to be only a musician. Let him be ever so
                    accomplished in his immediate art, he is under great disadvantages as compared
                    with his competitors who can see. But if he has generous culture in other
                    branches of knowledge, he will have advantages which few of them possess, and of
                    course he will be more nearly on a level with them, and more capable of earning
                    a living and enjoying it. Human effort will in such a case be successful in
                    counteracting the principal evil which flows from the infirmity of
                    blindness.”</p>
                <p>“The careful observer will see a marked difference between a hundred youths in a
                    blind institution and the same number of boys in an ordinary school. This is
                    especially true of the male sex. He will find among the blind a larger
                    proportion of scrofulous, narrow-chested, angular, pallid, and feeble boys, who
                    move sluggishly and soon tire; and a smaller proportion of those full-chested,
                    chubby, rosy, elastic creatures, whom nothing can keep still, and nothing tire
                    out.</p>
                <p>Now, if the blind, as a class, have a much smaller <hi rend="italic">quantum</hi>
                    of life than ordinary persons, it must be either on account of some flaw in the
                    stock λvhence they sprung, or of some peculiarity in their mode of life, induced
                    by their infirmity, such as bodily inactivity; but it probably results from both
                    causes. At any rate, it is a matter worth considering.</p>
                <p>The following tables have been calculated from data furnished by <hi
                    rend="italic">seven</hi> American State Institutions for the Blind—namely, those
                    of New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Illinois, Missouri, Tennessee, and
                    Massachusetts, and are the results of careful discussion of data, by far the
                    most extensive and trustworthy, it is believed, yet published in any
                    country.</p>
                <p>In each of these tables the number of the blind actually surviving in 1859 are
                    compared with the numbers that <hi rend="italic">should</hi> then be surviving,
                    according to two different Life Tables—first, the Massachusetts Life Table,
                    prepared by Mr Elliott, from the State Census and Registration Returns for the
                    year 1855; and secondly, the English Life Table, prepared by Dr Farr of London,
                    from the returns for the year 1841 :—</p>
                <p>Table I.— <hi rend="italic">Comparing the relative vitality {or ability to resist
                    destructive influences') of the Blind, at divers ages of life, according to the

                    that of the populations of Massachusetts and of England respectively. Calculated
                    by Mr E. B. Elliott, Consulting Actuary, Boston.</hi></p>

                <p><hi rend="italic">Note.—</hi> This table may be read thus:—Of the 68 persons
                    admitted to the before-mentioned institutions during the year 1844, 14 died
                    previous to the middle of the year 1859, and 54 were suiviving in that year. The
                    average age on admission of the 68 persons was 13'9 years, and the average
                    number of years elapsed between the time of admission and the middle of the year
                    1859 was about 15 years. According to the Massachusetts Life Table, the number
                    that should be surviving in 1859 was 58 ’ 6, showing the number of actual
                    survivors to have been 4 6 less than the number demanded by such table. The
                    deficiency (4 ’ 6 +5'3 + 2 ’ 6 = 12’5) of actual survivors relative to the
                    number that should survive of those admitted during the three years 1844, 1845,
                    and 1846, was, according to the Massachusetts Table, 8’9 per cent, of (58∙6 + 37
                    ’ 3 + 44∙6 = 140∙5) the number demanded; and the deficiency of actual survivors
                    relative to the number that should survive of those admitted during the seven
                    years 1839 to 1845 inclusive, was, according to the same life table, 8 ’ 7 per
                    cent, of the number demanded. In like manner may be read the results derived

                <p>According to the first table, it appears that, of the entire 1102 persons
                    admitted whose after-history is known, 878 now survive, whereas the Life Table
                    of Massachusetts calls for about 979 survivors, thereby indicating that the
                    power of the blind, represented by the returns of these institutions, to resist
                    destructive influences is about 9 per cent. (10 <hi rend="superscript"> -</hi>
                    3) <hi rend="italic">less</hi> than that of the population of all England, and
                    that the number of deaths is from 60 to 80 per cent. <hi rend="italic"
                    >greater,</hi> according to the tables employed for the comparison, than the
                    number required by such tables.</p>
                <p>If we could draw our statistics from the blind as a whole, and not from the
                    favoured few who have been taught in schools, the average duration of life would
                    be much less. We should probably find the average amount of vital force, or
                    power to resist destructive agencies, to be nearly one-fifth less than that of
                    ordinary persons.</p>
                <p>It is well known that the blind as a class are happy, contented, and cheerful.
                    There are exceptions, of course, and it is unfortunate that Milton should have
                    been one of them, because his eminence as a poet and scholar makes his example
                    conspicuous, and his words to be taken as the natural language of a class of
                    unfortunates. There have been others more admirable in this respect, for they
                    set forth in their lives and conversation the sublime moral height to which men
                    may attain by grasping courageously the nettle misfortune, and ‘plucking thence
                    the flower’ happiness.” (F. J. C.)</p>
