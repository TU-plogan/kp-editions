                    Hosein. The cause of this heterodoxy is, no doubt, to be sought in ethnological
                    distinctions, the Aryan Persians never having been able to thoroughly
                    accommodate themselves to the creed of their Semitic conquerors. Their
                    dissatisfaction has found vent partly in the universal homage paid to Ali, and
                    the rejection of the Sunna or great mass of orthodox Mahometan tradition, partly
                    in violent occasional outbreaks, most characteristically of all in the mystical
                    philosophy and poetry of the Sufis, which, under the guise of a profound respect
                    for the externals of Mahometanism, dissolves its rigid Monotheism into
                    Pantheism. Babisrn is essentially one of the innumerable schools of Sufism,
                    directed into a more practical channel by its founder’s keen perception of the
                    evils of his times. His first appearance in public took place about 1843, when,
                    on his return from a pilgrimage to Mecca and after a prolonged course of
                    meditation in the ruined mosque of Kufa, the scene of Ali’s murder, he presented
                    himself in his native city with a journal of his pilgrimage and a new commentary
                    on the Koran. He speedily became engaged in controversy with the mollahs or
                    regular clergy, who, exasperated by the freedom of his strictures on their lives
                    as well as their doctrines, obtained an official decree forbidding him to preach
                    in public, and confining him to his house. The Bâb, by which title hé was now
                    universally known, complied in appearance, but continued to instruct his
                    disciples in private; his doctrines rapidly assumed more logical consistency,
                    and his pretensions augmented in an equal ratio. He now laid aside the title of
                    Bâb, declaring himself to be the <hi rend="italic">Nokteh</hi> or Point, <hi
                    rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> not merely the recipient of a new divine revelation,
                    but the focus to which all preceding dispensations converged. There was little
                    in such a pretension to shock Oriental habits of thought; while the simplicity
                    and elevation of the ethical part of the Bab’s system, united to the charm of
                    his manner and the eloquence of his discourse, rapidly gained fresh proselytes.
                    The most remarkable of these was the Mollah Hussein Boushrevieh, a man of great
                    erudition and energy of character, who, having come all the way from Khorassan
                    to hear him, became his convert, and undertook the dissemination of his religion
                    throughout the empire. Two other apostles were speedily added, the appearance of
                    one of whom may almost be said to mark an epoch in Oriental life. It is rare
                    indeed to find a woman enacting any distinguished part in the East, least of all
                    that of a public teacher. Such, however, was the part assumed by the gifted
                    Zerryn Taj <hi rend="italic">(Crown of Gold),</hi> better known by the
                    appellation of Gourred-Oul-Ayn <hi rend="italic">(Consolation of the Eyes),</hi>
                    bestowed in admiration of her surpassing loveliness. The third missionary was
                    Mohammed Ali Balfouroushi, a religious man, who had already acquired a high
                    reputation for sanctity. The new religion made rapid progress, and the
                    endeavours of the authorities to repress it eventually produced a civil war.
                    Hussein constructed a fort in the province of Mazanderan, where he defeated
                    several expeditions despatched against him, but at length fell mortally wounded
                    in the moment of victory, and his followers, reduced to surrender by famine,
                    were mostly put to death (1849). Balfouroushi<pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit03newyrich/page/n196/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0903-0196-0181"/>, with a number of his principal adherents,
                    perished in the city of Zendian after an obstinate defence (May 1850). Ere this
                    event had taken place, the Government had proceeded to the execution of the Bâb
                    himself, who had now been confined for some time in the fortress of Cherigh,
                    where he is said to have greatly impressed his gaolers by his patience and
                    dignity. He was removed to Tabriz, and all attempts to induce him to retract
                    having failed, he was suspended from the summit of a wall by the armpits in view
                    of the people, along with one of his disciples; the object of this public
                    exposure being to leave no doubt of the reality of his death. A company of
                    soldiers discharged their muskets at the martyrs; but although the disciple was
                    killed on the spot, the bullets merely cut the cords by which the Bâb himself
                    was suspended, and he fell to the ground unhurt. With more presence of mind on
                    his part, this apparently miraculous deliverance might have provoked a popular
                    insurrection in his favour; but, bewildered by the fall, instead of invoking the
                    people, he took refuge in a guard-house, where he was promptly despatched. His
                    death was far from discouraging his followers, who recognised as his successor
                    Mirza Yahya, a youth of noble birth. Yahya established himself at Baghdad, where
                    he is or was recently still residing. No new event of importance occurred until
                    1852, when an attempt of several Bâbis to assassinate the Shah led to a
                    ferocious persecution, in which the beautiful Gourred-Oul-Ayn perished with many
                    others. In the opinion of Μ. Gobineau, this persecution has rather tended to
                    encourage than to repress the sect, which is believed to be widely diffused in
                    Persia at this moment, under the mask of conformity to the established creed. It
                    can only be regarded as an individual symptom of a constantly recurring
                    phenomenon—the essential incompatibility between the religious conceptions of
                    Aryan and Semitic races. The doctrines of Bâbism are contained in an Arabic
                    treatise, entitled <hi rend="italic">Biyan</hi> (the Exposition), written by the
                    Bâb himself. It is essentially a system of Pantheism, with additions from
                    Gnostic, Cabbalistic, and even Buddhistic sources. All individual existence is
                    regarded as an emanation from the Supreme Deity, by whom it will ultimately be
                    reabsorbed. Great importance is attached to the number seven, being that of the
                    attributes supposed to be displayed in the act of creation, and to the number
                    nineteen, which mystically expresses the name of the Deity himself, and is,
                    moreover, the sum of the prophets among whom the latest incarnation of the
                    divine nature is conceived to be distributed in the present dispensation. Of
                    these the Bâb is chief, but the other eighteen are regarded as no less
                    participators in the divine nature. This sacred college cannot become extinct
                    until the last judgment; the death of any of its members being immediately
                    followed by a reincarnation, as in the case of the Grand Lama. The prophetic
                    character of Moses, Christ, and Mahomet is acknowledged, but they are considered
                    as mere precursors of the Bâb. The morality of the sect is pure and cheerful,
                    and it manifests an important advance upon all previous Oriental systems in its
                    treatment of woman. Polygamy and concubinage are forbidden, the veil is disused,
                    and the equality of the sexes so thoroughly recognised that one at least of the
                    nineteen sovereign prophets must always be a female. The other chief precepts of
                    Bâbism inculcate hospitality, charity, and generous living, tempered by
                    abstinence from intoxicating liquors and drugs. Asceticism is entirely
                    discountenanced, and mendicancy, being regarded as a form of it, is strictly
                    prohibited.</p>
