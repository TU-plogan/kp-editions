                <p><label type="entry">BISHOP</label>, the title of an ecclesiastical dignitary set
                    over the presbyters and deacons at a very early period in the Christian church.
                    The word is derived from the Saxon <hi rend="italic">bisceop,</hi> which is a
                    corruption of the Greek word <hi rend="italic">episcopos,</hi> which signifies
                    an “overlooker” or “overseer,” and the churches in which the order of bishops is
                    recognized as distinct from and superior to the order of presbyters are styled
                    “Episcopal churches.” The early history of the Episcopal order is obscure, but
                    it would appear that the first bishops were established in the chief cities of
                    Christendom, and each bishop had a certain territorial district placed under his
                    superintendence, whence the city was termed the see <hi rend="italic"
                    >(sedes)</hi> of the bishop, and the district his parish <hi rend="italic"
                    >(παροικία),</hi> and subsequently his diocese <hi rend="italic"
                    >(διοικησις).</hi> In course of time the districts assigned to the first bishops
                    became too populous, whereupon the clergy of each diocese, as the case might be,
                    appear to have assembled and to have subdivided the diocese, and to have
                    selected a second bishop, and so bishops and dioceses were multiplied, according
                    to the wants of the churches, until it was thought expedient to reserve the
                    right of erecting new bishoprics to provincial councils, and this reservation
                    was made a rule of the church by a decree of the Council of Sardica. Meanwhile
                    the bishops of the new sees had grouped themselves round the bishops of the more
                    ancient sees, who exercised over them a certain spiritual authority as primates,
                    and presided in their councils; and as some of the great cities in which the
                    sees of the first bishops had been established were distinguished by the title
                    of “metropolis,” or mother-city, and were in fact the chief cities of civil
                    provinces of the Roman empire, the bishops of those sees came to be
                    distinguished by the title of metropolitan bishops, and exercised a superior
                    authority in the councils of the church in proportion to the greater importance
                    of their respective sees. This superior dignity of the metropolitan bishops over
                    the others was formally recognized at the Council of Nicaea as being in
                    accordance with custom. Upon the establishment of Christianity as the religion
                    of the Roman empire a coercive jurisdiction was engrafted on the spiritual
                    superiority of the metropolitan, and the district over which the metropolitan
                    exercised this jurisdiction was termed his province, the earliest ecclesiastical
                    provinces being for the most part conterminous with the civil provinces of the
                    empire. From the circumstance that there was no metropolitan city in Western
                    Africa, the term metropolitan was never adopted in the Carthaginian Church, the
                    senior bishop of that church being termed the primate, and having precedence and
                    authority as such over the other bishops.</p>
                <p>In the Church of Rome the Pope claims of right the <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit03newyrich/page/n805/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0903-0805-0788"/> appointment of all the bishops; but the exercise
                    of this right is modified by concordats with the sovereigns of the respective
                    states. In France, since the concordat between Pope Leo X. and King Francis I.,
                    the sovereign has had the exclusive right of nominating the bishops, but the
                    nomination is subject to the Pope’s confirmation. In Austria (with the exception
                    of four bishoprics), in Bavaria, in Spain, and in Portugal, the bishops are also
                    nominated by the sovereign. In some countries the bishops are elected by the
                    chapter of the cathedral church, as in Wurtemberg, or by the bishops of the
                    province, as in Ireland. In England, in the United States of America, and in
                    Belgium, the Pope selects one out of a list of candidates submitted to him by
                    the chapter. In all cases the bishop-nominate or the bishop-elect, as the case
                    may be, has to obtain from the Holy See certain letters, entitled provisions, to
                    authorize his consecration, and to recommend him to the protection of the
                    sovereign and to the good offices of his metropolitan</p>
                <p>In the Church of Russia, after its separation from that of Constantinople, the
                    right to elect a bishop was for some centuries vested in a synod of bishops, but
                    by a regulation of the Emperor Peter the Great, the Holy Synod was restricted to
                    recommend two persons to the sovereign for him to select one of them to be
                    bishop. This regulation, .however, is not always observed, and the sovereign, if
                    he .thinks fit, sets aside the list submitted to him by the Synod, and nominates
                    of his own choice a person whom the Synod is obliged to elect. In Russia a
                    diocese sometimes contains two capital cities, and the bishop has his title from
                    both.</p>
                <p>In the Church of the Levant, properly called the Greek Church, which is governed
                    by the four patriarchs of Constantinople, Antioch, Jerusalem, and Alexandria,
                    each patriarch has the right of confirming the election of the bishops within
                    his patriarchate; but the firman or barat of the sultan is likewise necessary to
                    give full authority to •the bishops after their confirmation.</p>
                <p>The bishops of the Church of England are twenty-eight in number, two of them
                    being metropolitans, namely, Canterbury and York, who enjoy the more dignified
                    title of archbishop, and have a special precedence assigned to them by law (see
                    <hi rend="smallcaps">Archbishop).</hi> The twenty-six diocesan bishops, with the
                    exception of the bishop of the Isle of Man, who is designated the bishop of
                    Sodor and Man, are lords of parliament, and take precedence of the barons in the
                    House of Lords; but the junior bishop for the time being is, by statute,
                    disentitled from being summoned to parliament. From this disqualification the
                    bishops of London, Durham, and Winchester are exempt. These three bishops have
                    precedence over one another in the order in which their names are above
                    mentioned, and they precede all the other bishops, the latter taking precedence
                    of one another according to the date of their appointment. The junior bishop who
                    has a seat in parliament acts as chaplain to the House of Lords.</p>
                <p>In the Church of England the bishops exercise certain spiritual functions which
                    are held not to be within the competence of the presbyters. They alone can
                    administer the rite of confirmation to baptized persons, and they alone can
                    ordain candidates for the sacred ministry. These functions the bishops exercise
                    in virtue of their order, but they are also empowered by law to exercise a
                    certain jurisdiction over all consecrated places and over all ordained persons.
                    This jurisdiction they exercise for the most part through their consistorial
                    courts, or through commissioners appointed under 3 and 4 Vict. c. 86, called the
                    Church Discipline Act. The bishops also exercise a certain jurisdiction over
                    marriages, inasmuch as they have by the canons of the Church of England a power
                    of dispensing with the proclamation of banns before marriage. These
                    dispensations are termed marriage licences, and their legal validity is
                    recognized by the Marriage Act, 4 Geo. IV. c. 76. The bishops had formerly
                    jurisdiction over all questions touching the validity of marriages and the
                    status of married persons, but this jurisdiction has been transferred from the
                    consistorial courts of the bishops to a court of the Crown by 20 and 21 Vict. c.
                    85. They have in a similar manner been relieved of their jurisdiction in
                    testamentary matters, and in matters of defamation and of brawling in churches;
                    and the only jurisdiction which they continue to exercise over the general laity
                    is with regard to their use of the churches and churchyards. The churchwardens,
                    who are representative officers of the parishes, are also executive officers of
                    the bishops in all matters touching the decency and order of the churches and of
                    the churchyards, and they are responsible to the bishops for the due discharge
                    of their duties; but the abolition of church-rates has relieved the
                    churchwardens ofthe most onerous part of their duties, which was connected with
                    the stewardship of the church funds of their parishes.</p>
                <p>The bishops are still authorized by law to dedicate and set apart buildings for
                    the solemnization of divine service, and grounds for the performance of burials,
                    according to the rites and ceremonies of the Church of England; and such
                    buildings and grounds, after they have been duly consecrated according to law,
                    cannot be diverted to any secular purpose except under the authority of an Act
                    of parliament.</p>
                <p>The bishops of England have also jurisdiction to examine clerks who may be
                    presented to benefices within their respective dioceses, and they are bound in
                    each case by the 95th canon of 1604 to inquire and inform themselves of the
                    sufficiency of each clerk within twenty-eight days, after which time, if they
                    have not rejected him as insufficiently qualified, they are bound to institute
                    him, or to license him, as the case may be, to the benefice, and thereupon to
                    send their mandate to the archdeacon to induct him into the temporalities of the
                    benefice. Where the bishop himself is patron of a benefice within his own
                    diocese he is empowered to collate a clerk to it,—in other words, to confer it
                    on the clerk without the latter being presented to him. Where the clerk himself
                    is patron of the living, the bishop may institute him on his. own petition. See
                    <hi rend="smallcaps">Benefice,</hi></p>
                <p>The qualifications of a bishop of the Church of England are, that he should be a
                    learned presbyter of at least thirty years of age, born in lawful matrimony, and
                    of good life and behaviour. The mode of his appointment is regulated by 24 Henry
                    VIII. c. 20. Upon the avoidance of a bishopric the Crown is authorized to issue
                    to the dean and chapter of the cathedral church of the see a licence for them to
                    proceed to the election of a bishop, accompanied by a letter missive containing
                    the name of the person whom they are to elect. The dean and chapter are
                    thereupon required, within twelve days, to elect the person so named by the
                    Crown to be the bishop of the vacant see, failing which election the Crown is
                    impowered to name, by letters patent under the Great Seal addressed to the
                    archbishop and metropolitan of the province, such person to be bishop as the
                    Crown shall think able and convenient. Upon the election being reported to the
                    Crown, a mandate issues from the Crown to the archbishop and metropolitan,
                    requesting him and commanding him to confirm the election, and to invest and
                    consecrate the bishop-elect. Thereupon the archbishop issues a commission to his
                    vicar-general to examine formally the process of the election of the bishop, and
                    to supply by his authority all defects in matters of form, and to administer to
                    the bishop-elect the oaths of allegiance, of supremacy, and of canonical
                    obedience.</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit03newyrich/page/n806/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0903-0806-0789"/>
                <p>After this formal confirmation of the bishop’s election has taken place, the
                    archbishop, with the assistance of at least two bishops, proceeds to consecrate
                    the bishop-elect. The most important part of the religious ceremony on this
                    occasion consists in the imposition of hands, in other words, in the archbishop
                    and the bishops placing their hands simultaneously upon the head of the
                    bishop-elect kneeling before them, and in the name of the Holy Trinity
                    committing to him his office of bishop; after which the archbishop delivers to
                    him the Holy Bible and addresses to him a short admonition to preach faithfully
                    the Word of God. The bishop is required afterwards, by statute, to do homage to
                    the Crown, upon which he is put into possession of the temporalities of his see.
                    In the case of the avoidance of the archbishopric of either province, the Crown
                    sends a mandate to the archbishop of the other province to confirm and
                    consecrate the archbishop-elect, and the practice is, for the most part, for the
                    archbishop of the other province to send a commission to four or more bishops of
                    the province of the archbishop-elect to confirm his election and to invest and
                    consecrate him.</p>
                <p>Doubts having been raised whether a bishop of the Church of England, being a lord
                    of parliament, could resign his seat in the Upper House of parliament, although
                    several precedents to that effect are on record, a statute of the realm (19 and
                    20 Vict. c. 115), which is confined to the case of the bishops of London and
                    Durham, was passed in 1856, declaring that on the resignation of their sees
                    being accepted by their respective metropolitans, those bishops should cease to
                    sit as lords of parliament, and their sees should be filled up in the manner
                    provided by law in the case of the avoidance of a bishopric. By a subsequent
                    statute (32 and 33 Vict. c. Ill), provision has been made for the case of an
                    archbishop or bishop being permanently incapacitated by age or mental infirmity.
                    If the archbishop or bishop is capable of executing an act of resignation, a
                    representation may be made to the Crown, which is impowered to declare the see
                    to be vacant, but if the archbishop or bishop should be incapacitated from
                    intimating his desire to resign his bishopric, the Crown may grant a licence to
                    the dean and chapter of the cathedral church of the diocese to appoint a
                    bishop-coadjutor. This Act was to be in force for two years; it has been
                    continued for three years more by 35 and 36 Vict. c. 40.</p>
                <p>A peculiar institution of the Church of England, established by 26 Henry VIII. c.
                    14, having been long allowed to remain dormant, has been recently revived, under
                    which every archbishop and bishop, being disposed to have a suffragan to assist
                    him, may name two honest and discreet spiritual persons for the Crown to give to
                    one of them the title, name, style, and dignity of a bishop of any one of
                    twenty-six sees enumerated in the statute, as the Crown may think convénient.
                    The Crown, having made choice of one of such persons, is impowered to present
                    him by letters patent under the great seal to the metropolitan, requiring him to
                    consecrate him to the same name, title, style, and dignity of a bishop; and the
                    person so consecrated is thereupon entitled to exercise, under a commission from
                    the bishop who has nominated him, such authority and jurisdiction, within the
                    diocese of such bishop, as shall be given to him by the commission, and no
                    other.</p>
                <p>The first colonial bishopric of the Church of England was that of Nova Scotia,
                    founded in 1787, since which time varions colonial bishoprics have been
                    established, some of which were constituted by letters patent of the Crown only,
                    whilst others have been confirmed by acts of the imperial or colonial
                    legislatures. With regard to those bishoprics which have been constituted by
                    letters patent of the Crown only, where the bishopric has been established in a
                    Crown colony, the bishop is legally entitled to exercise the jurisdiction
                    conferred upon him by the letters patent; but where the bishopric has been
                    established in a colony possessing at the time an indepen dent legislature, the
                    bishop is not entitled to exercise such jurisdiction unless it has been
                    confirmed to him by an imperial or colonial statute. The report of the judicial
                    committee of the Privy Council in the case of the bishop of Natal (Moore’s <hi
                    rend="italic">Privy Council Reports,</hi> N.S., iii. p. 115) is an exposition of
                    the law on this subject On the other hand, where bishoprics have been
                    constituted by letters patent of the Crown, in pursuance of imperial statutes,
                    as was the case of the East Indian bishoprics, or where bishoprics constituted
                    by letters patent have subsequently been confirmed or recognized by colonial
                    statutes, the bishop’s jurisdiction is ccmplete; otherwise his authority is only
                    pastoral or spiritual. The practice adopted by the Crown, since the decision of
                    the judicial committee in the case of the bishop of Natal has revealed the
                    invalidity of the letters patent granted to many colonial bishops, has been to
                    grant licences to the archbishop of Canterbury to consecrate bishops for the
                    colonies without any definite diocese, and without any authority to exercise
                    coercive jurisdiction. The Crown has also revoked the letters patent erecting
