                    of votes, and a wooden box received the unused balls. In the assembly, cases of

                <p>In Great Britain the ballot was suggested for use in Parliament by a political
                    tract of the time of Charles II. It was actually used by the Scots Parliament of
                    1662 in proceeding on the “Billeting Act,” a measure proposed by Middleton to
                    secure the ostracism of Lauderdale and other political opponents who were by
                    secret vote declared incapable of public office. The plan followed was this:
                    each member of Parliament wrote, in a disguised hand, on a piece of paper, the
                    names of twelve suspected persons; the billets were put in a bag held by the
                    registrar; the bag was then sealed, and was afterwards opened and its contents
                    ascertained in the Exchequer Chamber, where the billets were immediately burned,
                    and the names of the ostracised concealed on oath. The Billeting Act was
                    repudiated by the king, and the ballot was not again heard of till 1705, when
                    Fletcher of Saltoun, in his measure for a provisional government of Scotland by
                    annual Parliaments in the event of Queen Anne’s death, proposed secret voting to
                    protect members from court influence. The gradual emancipation of the British
                    Parliament from the power of the Crown, and the adoption of a strictly
                    representative system of election, have not only destroyed whatever reason may
                    once have existed for the ballot in deliberative voting, but have rendered it
                    essential that such voting should be open. It was in the agitations for
                    pariiamentary reform at the beginning of the 19th century that the demand for
                    the ballot in parliamentary elections was first seriously made. The Benthamites
                    advocated the system in 1817.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    >Westminster Rev.,</hi> vol. xiii.</p></note> At the Peterloo Massacre (1819)
                    several banners were inscribed with the ballot. O’Connell introduced a bill on
                    the subject in 1830; and the original draft of Lord John Russell’s Reform Bill,
                    probably on the suggestion of Lords Durham and Duncannon, provided for its
                    introduction. Later on Mr Grote became its chief supporter in the House of
                    Commons; and from 1833 to 1839, in spite of the ridicule cast by Sydney Smith on
                    the “mouse-trap,” and on Mr Grote’s “dagger-box, in which you stab the card of
                    your favourite candidate w ith a dagger,”<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    for the ballot increased from 106 to 217. In 1838 the ballot was the fourth
                    point of the People’s Charter. In the same year the abolition of the land
                    qualification introduced rich commercial candidates to the constituencies. Lord
                    Melbourne’s cabinet declared the question open. The cause, upheld by Macaulay,
                    Ward, Hume (in his resolutions, 1848), and Berkeley, was strengthened by the
                    Report of Lord Hartington’s Select Committee (15th March 1870),<note

                    R. 352, 352-1.; and 1870, R. 115</p></note> to the effect that corruption,
                    treating, and intimidation by priests and landlords took place to a large extent
                    at both parliamentary and municipal elections in England and Ireland; and that
                    the ballot, if adopted, would probably not only promote tranquillity at
                    elections, but protect voters from undue influence, and introduce greater
                    freedom and purity in voting, provided secrecy was made inviolable except in
                    cases where a voter was found guilty of bribery, or where an invalid vote had
                    been given. At Manchester and Stafford in 1869, test ballots had taken place on
                    the Australian principle as practised in Victoria,— the voting card containing
                    the names of all the candidates, printed indifferent colours (for the benefit of
                    illiterate voters), and the voter being directed to score out the names of those
                    he did not support, and then to place the card (covered by an official envelope)
                    in the box. It was found at Manchester that the voting was considerably more
                    rapid, and therefore less expensive, than under the old system; that only 80
                    cards out of 11,475 were rejected as informal; and that, the representatives of
                    candidates being present to check false statements of identity, and the public
                    outside being debarred from receiving information what voters had voted, the
                    ballot rather decreased the risk of personation. At Manchester the cards were
                    not numbered consecutively, as isdone in Victoria, so that (assuming the
                    officials to be free from corruption) no scrutiny could have detected by whom
                    particular votes were given. At Stafford the returning officer stamped each card
                    before giving it to the voter, the die of the stamp having been finished only on
                    the morning of the election. By this means the possibility was excluded of what
                    was known in the colonies as “the Tasmanian Dodge,” by which a corrupt voter
                    gave to the returning officer, or placed in the box, a blank non-official
                    ticket, and carried out from the booth his official card, which a corrupt agent
                    then marked for his candidate and gave, so marked, to corrupt voter No. 2
                    (before he entered the booth), on condition that he also would bring out his
                    official card, and so on <hi rend="italic">ad libitum;</hi> the agent thus
                    obtaining a security for his bribe, unless the corrupt voter chose to
                    disfranchise himself by making further marks on the card.</p>
                <p>At the close of 1870 the ballot was employed in the election of members for the
                    London School Board, under the Education Act of that year.</p>
                <p>In 1872 Mr Forster’s Ballot Act (35 and 36 Vict. c. 33) introduced the ballot in
                    all parliamentary and municipal elections, except parliamentary elections for
                    universities; and the code of procedure prescribed by the Act wa≡ adopted by the
                    Scotch Education Board in the first School Board election (1873), under “The
                    Education (Scotland) Act, 1872.” It is impossible here to analyse the Ballot
                    Act, which not only abolishes public nominations of candidates, but deals with
                    the offence of personation and the expenses of elections. As regards the ballot,
                    a white paper is used on which the names of the candidates are printed in
                    alphabetical order, the voter filling up with a X the blank on the right hand
                    opposite the name he votes for. The paper, before being given out, is marked by
                    the presiding officer on both sides with an official stamp, which is kept
                    secret, and cannot be used for a second election within seven years. The paper
                    is marked on the back with the same number as the counterfoil of the paper which
                    remains with the officer. This counterfoil is also marked with the voter’s
                    number on the register, so that the vote may be identified on a scrutiny; and a
                    mark on the register shows that the voter has received a ballot paper. The voter
                    folds up the paper so as to conceal his mark, but to show the stamp to the
                    officer, and deposits it in the box, which is locked and sealed, and so
                    constructed that papers cannot be withdrawn without unlocking it. Papers
                    inadvertently spoiled by the voters may be exchanged, the officer preserving
                    separately the spoiled papers. If a voter is incapacitated from blindness, or
                    other physical cause, or <pb break="no"

                    inability to read, or when the poll is on a Saturday declares himself a Jew, the
                    officer causes the paper to be marked as the voter directs, and keeps a record
                    of the transaction. A. voter who claims to vote after another has voted in
                    respect of the same qualification, obtains a (green) paper which is not placed
                    in the box, but preserved apart as a “tendered” paper. He must, however, declare
                    his identity, and that he has not already voted. The presiding officer, at the
                    close of the poll, has to account to the returning officer for the papers
                    entrusted to him, the number being made up by—(1) papers in the box, (2) spoiled
                    papers, (3) unused papers, and (4) tendered papers. During the voting (for which
                    schoolrooms and other public rooms are available, and for which a separate
                    compartment must be provided for every 150 electors entitled to vote at a
                    station) agents of candidates are allowed to be present in the polling-station,
                    but they, as well as the officials, are sworn to secrecy as regards who have
                    voted, and for whom; and they are prohibited from interfering with the voter,
                    inducing him to show his vote, or attempting to ascertain the number on the back
                    of the paper. These agents are also present with the returning officer when he
                    counts the papers and the votes, rejecting those papers—(1), which want the
                    official mark on <hi rend="italic">the, back;</hi> (2), on which votes are given
                    for more candidates than the voter is entitled to vote for; (3), on which
                    anything except the number on the back is marked or written by which the voter
                    can be identified; (4), which are unmarked, or so marked that it is uncertain
                    for whom the vote is given. The counted and rejected papers, and also the
                    “tendered” papers, counterfoils, and marked register (which have not been
                    opened), are, in parliamentary elections, transmitted by the returning officer
                    to the clerk of the Crown in Chancery in England, or the sheriff-clerk in
                    Scotland, who destroys them at the end of one year, unless otherwise directed by
                    an order of the House of Commons, or of some court having jurisdiction in
                    election petitions. Such petitions either simply dispute the accuracy of the
                    return on the ground of miscounting, or wrongous rejection or wrongous admission
                    of papers, in which case the court examines the counted and rejected papers; or
                    make allegations of corruption, &amp;c., on which it may be necessary to refer
                    to the marked counterfoils and ascertain how bribed voters have voted. Since the
                    elections of 1874 much discontent has been expressed, because judges have
                    rejected papers with trifling (perhaps accidental) marks other than the X upon
                    them, and because elections have been lost through the failure qf the officer to
                    stamp the papers. For this purpose the use has been suggested of a perforating
                    instead of an embossing stamp, while a dark ground paper with white
                    voting-spaces would make <hi rend="italic">misplaced</hi> votes impossible. The
                    Ballot Act has introduced several new offences, such as forging or fraudulently
                    defacing or destroying a paper or the official mark; supplying a paper without
                    due authority; fraudulently putting into the box a non-official paper;
                    fraudulently taking a paper out of the station without due authority;
                    destroying, taking, opening, or otherwise interfering with a box or packet of
                    papers then in use for election purposes. These offences, and attempts to commit
                    them, are punishable in the case of officers and clerks with imprisonment for
                    two years, with or without hard labour. In other cases the term of imprisonment
                    is six months.</p>
                <p>The ballot being thus <hi rend="italic">un</hi><hi rend="italic">fait
                    accompli</hi> in the United Kingdom, it is now scarcely necessary to indicate
                    the arguments by which it was supported and opposed. It has been found possible
                    to render voting perfectly secret and to provide for a scrutiny. It would be
                    foolish to expect that secret voting will be a perfect security for independent
                    noting. Bribery, treating, and intimidation continue to be practised, but with
                    diminished effect. Bribery may still be made conditional on the briber’s
                    success, but the Act is felt to be an expression of national opinion against all
                    interference with individual judgment. The argument that the franchise is a
                    public trust, to the exercise of which a public responsibility should attach,
                    would be conclusive if the “selfish partialities” of the voter were the chief
                    evil. The ballot was declared to lead to universal hypocrisy and deception; and
                    Sydney Smith spoke of <hi rend="superscript"> ii</hi> voters, in dominos, going
                    to the poll in sedan-chairs with closely-drawn curtains.” The observed effect of
                    a secret ballot is, however, gradually to exterminate undue influence and
                    canvassing; and when the necessity for secrecy is removed, votes are not kept
                    secret. The alarm of “the Confessional” seems to be unfounded, as a Catholic
                    penitent is not bound to confess his vote, and if he did so, it would be a crime
                    in the confessor to divulge it.</p>
                <p>The ballot is used very largely in the British Colonies, and on the Continent. In
                    South Australia, under the Constitution Act of 1856 and the Electoral Act of
                    1858, both the Legislative Council and the House of Assembly are elected by
                    manhood suffrage under the ballot, the returning officer <hi rend="italic"
                    >putting his initials</hi> on the voting card, which the voter is directed,
                    under pain of nullity, to fold so that the officer may not see the vote which is
                    indicated by a cross. The cards are destroyed when the poll is announced; and
                    thus personation, though proved against certain voters for the purpose of
                    punishing them, would not void an election, for there can be no scrutiny before
                    the Court of Disputed Returns. Canvassing has almost disappeared. In Victoria,
                    under the Electoral Act of 1865 (29 Vict. c. 279), both the Legislative Council
                    and the Legislative Assembly are elected practically by manhood suffrage under
                    the ballot, which was introduced in 1856. The officer adds to his initials a
                    number corresponding to the voter’s number on the register, and the cards are
                    preserved till after the time for petitioning the Committee of Elections and
                    Qualifications has expired, so that a scrutiny may take place of challenged
                    votes. The important Road Boards under the Local Government Consolidation Act of
                    1869 are also elected by ballot. In Tasmania the chief peculiarity is that (as
                    in South Australia) the card is not put directly by the voter into the box, but
                    handed to the officer who puts it there (this being thought a security against
                    double voting or voting with a non-official card, and also against the voter
                    carrying away his card); here also the cards are destroyed immediately, while in
                    New South Wales, where, as in Victoria, the voting is by scoring out and not by
                    a cross, the cards are kept for five years. The vigorous municipal boards of
                    these colonies are also elected by ballot, which has diminished expense and
                    undue influence very greatly, but has not produced complete secrecy of
                    voting.</p>
                <p>In France, where from 1840 to 1845 the ballot, or <hi rend="italic">scrutin,</hi>
                    had been used for deliberative voting in the Chamber of Deputies, its use in
                    elections to the Corps Législatif was carefully regulated at the beginning of
                    the Second Empire by the Organic Decree of 2d February 1852. Under this law the
                    voting was superintended by a bureau consisting of the deputy returning officer
                    (called president of the section), four unpaid assessors selected from the
                    constituency, and a secretary. Each voter presents a polling card, with his
                    designation, date of birth, and <hi rend="italic">signature</hi> (to secure
                    identity), which he has previously got at the <hi rend="italic">Mairie.</hi>
                    This the president mutilates, and the vote is then recorded by a “bulletin,”
                    which is not official, but is generally printed with a candidate’s name, and
                    given to the voter by an agent outside, the only conditions being that the
                    bulletin shall be “sur papier blanc, sans signes extérieurs, et préparé en
                    dehors de l’assemblée.” The <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit03newyrich/page/n306/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0903-0306-0291"/> total number of votes given (there being only one
                    member in each electoral district) is checked by reference to “la feuille <hi
                    rend="italic">d</hi><hi rend="italic superscript"> ,</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >appel</hi> et inscription des votants,” the law still supposing that each voter
                    is publicly called on to vote. If the voter, when challenged, cannot sign his
                    polling card, he may call a witness to sign for him. The following classes of
                    bulletins are rejected:—“illisibles, blancs, ne contenant pas une désignation
                    suffisante; sur lesquels les votants se sont fait connaître; contenant le nom
                    d’une personne n’ayant pas prêté le serment prescrit” <hi rend="italic"
                    >(i.e.,</hi> of a person not nominated). Only the votes pronounced bad by the
                    bureau in presence of representative scrutineers are preserved, in case these
                    should be called for during the “Session pour vérification des Pouvoirs.”
                    Practically the French ballot did not afford secrecy, for you might observe what
                    bulletin the voter took from the agent, and follow him up the <hi rend="italic"
                    >queue</hi> into the polling-place; but the determined voter might conceal his
                    vote even from the undue influence of Government by. scratching out the printed
                    matter and writing his vote. This was always a good vote, and scrutiny of good
                    votes was impossible. The ballot is still used in the elections to the National
                    Assembly, but in the Assembly itself only in special cases, as, <hi
                    rend="italic">e.g.,</hi> in the election of a “rapporteur.” Under the law of
                    10th August 1871, the conseils généraux (departmental councils) are elected by
                    ballot. In Piedmont the ballot formed part of the free constitutional government
                    introduced by Charles Albert in March 1848; it was extended to Italy in 1861.
                    Voting for the Italian Chamber of Deputies takes place under the law of 20th
                    November 1859, and in public halls (not booths), to which admission is gained by
                    showing a certificate of inscription, issued by the mayor to each qualified
                    voter. A stamped blue official paper, with a memorandum of the law printed on
                    the back <hi rend="italic">(bolletino spiegato),</hi> is then issued to the
                    elector; on this he writes the name of a candidate (there being equal electoral
                    colleges), or, in certain exceptional cases, gets a confidential friend to do
                    so, and hands the paper folded up to the president of the bureau, who puts it in
                    the box <hi rend="italic">(urna),</hi> and who afterwards presides at the public
                    “squittinio dei suffragi.” No scrutiny is possible; canvassing and bribery are
                    rare; and Cavour thought the ballot had quite nullified the clerical power, at
                    least in Piedmont. Greece is the only European country in which the ball ballot
                    is used. The voting takes place in the churches, each candidate has a box, on
                    which his name is inscribed, one half (white) being also marked “Yes,” the other
                    half (black) “No.” The voter, his citizenship or right to vote in the eparchy
                    being verified, receives one ball or leaden bullet for each candidate from a
                    wooden bowl, which a clerk carries from box to box. The voter stretches his arm
                    down a funnel, and drops the ball into the “Yes” or “No” division. The vote is
                    secret, but there is apparently no check on “Yes” votes being given for <hi
                    rend="italic">all the candidates,</hi> and the ball or bullet is imitable. In
                    the United States a most imperfect ballot system prevails. In many states there
                    is no register, and therefore personation and double voting are practised.
                    Again, there is no official card, but, as in the Shanty system of New York,
                    candidates’ touts give out printed and designed cards, which sometimes
                    fraudulently imitate one another in design, so that ignorant voters are misled.
                    Again, the ballot is generally taken in an enginehouse, or shed open to the
                    street, so that mob-intimidation may be used, and votes, as in France, are not
                    practically secret. In Massachusetts, in 1851-2, the Know-nothing or Anti-Irish
                    party, anxious to prevent personation, introduced a secret ballot for state
                    elections, using the Manchester envelope and an official card, with the names of
                    the candidates printed. This led to fraud and was abandoned, a return being made
                    to the French system. The history of the ballot in Hungary is remarkable. Before
                    1848 secret voting was unknown there. The electoral, law of that year left the
                    regulation of parliamentary elections to the county and town councils, very few
                    of which adopted the ballot. The mode of voting was perhaps the most primitive
                    on record. Each candidate had a large box with his name superscribed, and
                    painted in a distinguishing colour. On entering the room alone the voter
                    received a rod from 4 <hi rend="italic">to</hi> 6 <hi rend="italic">feet in
                    length</hi> (to prevent concealment of non-official rods on the voter’s person),
                    which he placed in the box through a slit in the lid. By the electoral law of
                    1874,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Hungary is now
                    being divided into equal electoral districts.</p></note> the ballot in
                    parliamentary elections in Hungary is abolished, but is made obligatory in the
                    elections of town and county councils, where votes are given <hi rend="italic"
                    >for several persons at once,</hi><note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>On the other hand, by the 2d of the original bye-laws of the
                    Bank of England, it was provided that the ballot should be used in the general
                    courts “in any question <hi rend="italic">concerning only one person, matter, w
                    thing."</hi></p></note> This voting, however, carried on by party-lists on
                    differently coloured cards is practically open. There is a strong feeling in
                    Hungary that the ballot would be worked by the Catholic clergy through the
                    Confessional. As most of the electors are freeholders, there is little
                    intimidation. In Prussia, Stein, by his Städteordnung, or Municipal Corporation
                    Act of 1808, introduced the ballot in the election of the Municipal Assembly <hi
                    rend="italic">(Stadt verordneten Versammlung).</hi> Under the German
                    Constitution of 1867, and the New Constitution of 1st January 1871, the
                    elections for the Reichstag are conducted by universal suffrage under the ballot
                    in conformity with the Electoral Law of 31st May 1869, which also divided
                    Germany into equal electoral districts.</p>
                <p>To secure complete secrecy, and to avoid the possibility of fraud and the large
                    expense of printing and counting ballot papers, several ballot machines or
                    registers have been invented. In that of Vassie there was an arrangement of
                    confluent funnels, by which the voter was prevented from dropping more than one
                    ball into the box. In that of Chamberlain the number of votes given was
                    indicated by the ringing of a bell. In that of Sydserff,<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Letters-Patent, No. 63 of 1869.</p></note>
                    the ball was placed by the sheriff in the common duct, and the voter, by moving
                    a lever, guided it into a channel leading to the box of a particular candidate.
                    Generally, it may be said that these mechanical contrivances have been attempts
                    to make the ball-system secret and accurate, each voter depositing a ball, and
                    the accumulated balls showing the state of the poll. This in a large
                    constituency would become unwieldy, and no permanent record of the poll (except
                    the collocation of the balls) would be obtained. A considerable advance is made
                    in the invention of Mr James Davie, Edinburgh, which we select for detailed
                    description. Of this register an essential part is the wooden chamber (4 feet
                    square by 7 feet in height) which the voter, having received a metal ball from
                    the sheriff, enters by a spring-hinged door to which a lever is attached. On one
                    side of the chamber is a box, on the lid of which stand differently coloured
                    cups, marked each with a number and the name of a candidate. Inside the box is a
                    cylinder traversed lengthwise by a spindle, and having at one end a toothed
                    wheel. By a screw-nut the cylinder revolves on and moves along the spindle. On
                    the cylinder is paper divided into spaces, which correspond with the cups, and
                    above this a sheet of carbonised paper as a printing medium. A pinion connects
                    the cylinder with the door-lever, so that the opening of the door drives round
                    the paper one space. A steel type, suspended on an elastic card, is centred to
                    each cup. The voter having placed the ball in a cup, leaves the chamber by
                    another spring-hinged door, which in opening displaces <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit03newyrich/page/n307/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0903-0307-0292"/> the bottoms of the cups, and thus causes the ball
                    to drop on the head of the type, beneath which it presses against the recording
                    sheet on the cylinder. The ball immediately rolls down a groove to the sheriff’s
                    desk outside the chamber, where it is handed to the next voter, <hi
                    rend="italic">only one ball being used</hi> in connection with each register
                    (unless, of course, there are more votes than one to be given). The closing of
                    the exit door restores the bottoms to the cups. This simple and effectual plan
                    has the merit of secrecy, of immediate detection of fraud <hi rend="italic"
                    >(e.g.,</hi> the introduction of a non-official ball to the cup), of rapidity in
                    voting and in counting, and of leaving almost nothing to the voter’s presence of
                    mind. The voter can make only one well-defined mark on the paper, and this he
                    can do only in leaving the chamber before the next voter has entered. Mr Davie’s
                    invention, which in 1870 received a prize from the Royal Scottish Society of
                    Arts, is obviously not adapted to cumulative voting, but may be worked with any
                    number of candidates under single voting. Although the motion of the cylinder
                    would record in a diagonal direction the series of votes, it would be
                    practically impossible to identify votes from a numbered list of the voters. (w.
