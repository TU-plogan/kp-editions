                <p>Grinus, king of that island, had gone attended by Battus and others to consult
                    the oracle at Delphi, and was told by it to “found a city in Libya.” They knew
                    not where Libya was, and could take no action. Seven years after there fell a
                    drought on Thera, and the oracle, being again questioned, repeated the command
                    to found a town in Libya. Messengers were now sent to Crete to see if any one
                    there knew where this district was. They met a fisheπnan, Corobius, who said
                    that he had once been driven to Platea, an island of Libya, whither he agreed to
                    conduct them. To make sure, they went with him; and having landed on Platea,
                    they again, leaving Corobius there with provisions for some months, returned to
                    Thera to collect colonists, of whom as many as two 50 oared galleys could convey
                    set out with Battus as their leader. In Cyrene itself, however, a different
                    story of the origin of the colony was told. Etearchus, it was said, king of Axus
                    in Crete, having married a second wife, who persuaded him to get rid of
                    .Phronime, the daughter of his first wife, agreed with a merchant from Thera
                    that he should take her in his ship and let her down into the sea. The merchant,
                    true to the letteτ of his bargain, let her down, but with a rope about her by
                    which he drew her up again, and took her .to Thera, where she married <pb

                    bore him a son, who, because of his stuttering, was called Battus. On growing to
                    manhood, Battus inquired at the oracle of Delphi about his voice, aud when told
                    to “found a town in Libya,” was unable to understand the response. Afterwards,
                    owing to misfortunes, the Theraeans sent to Delphi for advice, and were again
                    ordered to send a colony to Cyrene, under Battus, which they now did, landing
                    first in Platea, and afterwards removing to Cyrene itself.</p>
                <p>Herodotus (iv. 155) thinks that the name of Battus, being the word for “king” in
                    Libya, had been applied to the leader of the colony after his arrival there, and
                    that it had no reference to his stuttering. Battus having ruled forty years
                    (about 630-590 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.)</hi> was succeeded by his son
                    Arcesilaus, who, after a reign of sixteen years, of which nothing is known, was
                    followed by Battus II. Of this dynasty, known as the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Battiadoe,</hi> the names were alternately Battus and Arcesilaus, there being,
                    as the oracle predicted, probably after the fact, four of each. Under Battus
                    II., surnamed the Prosperous, the population of Cyrene was increased by a large
                    number of colonists from all parts of Greece invited by a promise of land. To
                    find land for all it was necessary to dispossess many of the native Libyans, who
                    therefore sought and obtained the aid of an Egyptian army, which, however was
                    completely defeated. Amasis, the next king of Egypt, proved friendly to Cyrene.
                    The reign of Arcesilaus II. (about 554-544 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi>) is
                    known only for the disastrous battle with the Libyans, who had been stirred to
                    revolt by his brothers, in which he lost 7000 hoplites. He himself soon after
                    fell ill, and was strangled by his brother Learchus. The disgrace of the ruling
                    family being increased by the fact that the next heir, Battus III., was lame,
                    the oracle at Delphi was consulted, and advised that affairs should be placed in
                    the hands of Demonax of Mantinea, who distributed the people into three tribes,
                    and arranged a form of self-government for them. Battus, retaining the royal
                    lands and sacred offices of a king, acquiesced. Not so his wife Pheretime and
                    son Arcesilaus, who bestirred themselves,—the former in Cyprus, the latter in
                    Samos,—to raise forces to recover the sovereignty, and ultimately succeeded; but
                    in his success Arcesilaus III. forgot the commands of the oracle <hi
                    rend="italic">(Herod.,</hi> iv. 163), and, among other cruelties to the
                    vanquished, burned alive a number of them who had escaped to a tower. To avoid
                    the consequences he retired to the town of Barca, but was there slain in the
                    market-place by some fugitives from Cyrene. His mother, Pheretime, who had been
                    regent in his absence, now obtained from Aryandes, the Persian satrap of Egypt,
                    an army to take vengeance on the people of Barca. After a fruitless siege of
                    nine months <hi rend="italic">(Herod..</hi> iv. 200) a treaty of peace was
                    solemnly sworn to by the Persian general, and was instantly broken in spirit,
                    though not in letter, when the gates of Barca were thrown open. Pheretime,
                    ruthless in her cruelties towards those who had been connected with her son’s
                    murder, herself died soon after, a wretched death, in Egypt. Of Battus IV.
                    nothing is known. Arcesilaus IV., with whom the dynasty ended (about 460—445 <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi>), obtained twice the victory in the chariot race at
                    the Pythian games, and for this was celebrated by Pindar in two odes <hi
