                    troops on a campaign as winter quarters, or when for any length of time in
                    “standing camp,”—they being accommodated when in the field under other
                    circumstances in tents, or else, if not provided with tents, bivouacing without
                    cover.</p>
                <p>In time of peace barracks were formerly only provided for troops in fortified
                    places termed “garrisons,” soldiers elsewhere being provided with quarters by
                    being billeted on public-houses. The apprehension of disturbances, and risk of
                    the troops being too much mixed up with the populations of the localities in
                    which they might be stationed, mainly led to the construction of barracks in or
                    near towns in England about the year 1792. In the first instance the
                    Deputy-adjutant-general was charged with the building and fitting up of
                    barracks. In 1793 the same officer was appointed “Superintendent-general of
                    barracks,” and subsequently “Barrack-master-general.” In 1806 the barrack
                    establishment was placed under the direction of a board of four commissioners,
                    of whom one was generally a military man. About the year 1825 the duke of
                    Wellington arranged for the construction and maintenance of barracks to be given
                    over to the corps of Royal Engineers. The custody and equipment of barracks,
                    with the supply of fuel and light to the troops quartered in them, were then
                    made and remained, until recently, the duty of the “barrack department,” which
                    consisted of barrack-masters and barrack-sergeants.</p>
                <p>The duties connected with barracks in the British service are now arranged as

                <p>The duties connected with the construction of barracks are under the supervision
                    of the Inspector-general of Fortifications, who is also Director of Works to the
                    War Department. He is assisted in these duties by a Deputy and two
                    Assistant-directors of Works, and a professional staff.</p>
                <p>The arrangement and composition of barracks vary according to the arm of the
                    service to be accommodated in them; thus for the cavalry, horse and field
                    artillery, Royal Engineer train, and transport branch of the army service corps,
                    stables are required; and it is usual to provide for the unmarried
                    non-commissioned officers and men over their horses, a troop of cavalry or a
                    division of field artillery being placed in a separate block of two stories in
                    height. Horse and field artillery also require gunsheds and workshops for
                    artificers, such as collarmakers, wheelers, &amp;c. All mounted troops require
                    forge and shoeing accommodation as well as saddlers’ shops. Garrison artillery
                    and companies of Royal Engineers can be accommodated in similar barracks to
                    those for infantry, but the latter require an ample provision of workshops for
                    artificers, with store accommodation for materials,. &amp;c.</p>
                <p>Not fifty years since, in the West Indies, men slept in barracks in hammocks
                    touching each other, only 23 inches of lateral space being allowed for each man.
                    At the same time in England the men slept in wooden beds, with two tiers, like
                    the berths of a ship, and not unfrequently each bed held four men. Now, each
                    soldier has an iron bedstead which turns up in the middle, forming a seat for
                    the day-time, and only two rows of beds are allowed in barrackrooms, and the
                    principle of providing one window for every two beds is carried out in all new
                    barracks.</p>
                <p>The best size for a barrack-room is now considered to bo 60 or 62 feet long, by
                    20 feet wide, and about 12 feet, high. The number of men each room is to contain
                    is painted on the door; and in barracks of modern construction each barrack-room
                    has attached to it—</p>
                <p>(1.) A small (single) sergeant’s room, with fire-place, cupboard, and. small
                    window looking into the men’s room.</p>
                <p>(2.) An ablution room, with basins, water-taps, and a fixed pan in which the feet
                    can be washed.</p>
                <p>(3.) A night urinal, with water for flushing laid on.</p>
                <p>Barracks are washed once a week, and on intermediate days the rooms are
                    dry-scrubbed. The walls and ceilings are limewashed by the troops twice a year.
                    The general periodical painting of all barrack buildings is performed twice
                    externally and once internally in every eight years. Formerly, barrack buildings
                    were placed on very limited areas, and even a whole regiment was lodged in one
                    house built in the form of a square, with the quarters of the officers on one
                    side for the better supervision of the men; but the Barrack and Hospital
                    Improvement Commission recommended that the men should be divided in numerous
                    detached buildings, so placed as to impede as little as possible the movement of
                    air and the action of the sun’s rays.</p>
                <p>For barracks, as a general rule, buildings of two stories in height are preferred
                    to those of three stories, but three-story buildings may be adopted where space
                    is limited and land very costly. Buildings of two stories are less expensive
                    than those of only one story in height, and the general arrangement, when the
                    former mode of construction is adopted, is more compact. The selection of a site
                    for a barrack requires great care and circumspection. This duty is performed in
                    the first instance by the Commanding Royal Engineer of the district, or an
                    officer appointed by him; but the ground proposed is also reported on by an Army
                    medical officer as well as subsequently by the General Officer commanding the
                    district, the final approval resting with the Secretary of State for War.</p>
                <p>The following important points have to be considered in the selection of a site,
                    viz. :—(1.) That the ground is suitably situated; (2.) That it is sufficient for
                    the number and nature of troops to be placed in the barracks; (3.) That it is
                    not commanded by higher ground within range of rifle fire; (4.) That the subsoil
                    is good and healthy; (5.) That water can be easily obtained for drinking,
                    washing, and cooking; (6.) That drainage and sewerage can be carried out; (7.)
                    That gas can be laid on.</p>
                <p>A barrack should not as a rule be placed in the midst of a populous town, nor
                    should it be too far distant from one. If in the midst of a town it would not be
                    likely to be healthy or well placed in respect to keeping up discipline; if too
                    far off the men quartered in it may become dissatisfied, with the service. A
                    barrack should be surrounded with a defensible wall; there should be as few
                    entrances as possible, and these should be provided with strong, well-barred
                    gates.</p>
                <p>In the new barracks now under construction for brigade depots, the armouries are
                    generally placed in defensible “keeps,” the outer or boundary walls being
                    flanked by <hi rend="italic">caponnières.</hi> In arranging the position of
                    buildings on a design for a barrack, the axis of each of those intended for
                    occupation by troops should be north and south, so as to allow the sun’s rays to
                    fall on both sides. One building should in no case obstruct the light from
                    another. The distance of buildings should not be less than their own height from
                    each other. The position selected for any new building or buildings in an
                    existing or a proposed barrack is reported on by a board of officers, consisting
                    of the head of the department, officer commanding a regiment, or other
                    responsible officer who is to occupy the building when erected, an officer not
                    under the rank of captain, and the commanding Royal Engineer or other engineer
                    officer, a medical officer attending to advise the board. On the completion of a
                    new building orbarrack, it is also reported on by a board of officers before
                    being taken over for occupation.</p>
                <p>In 1854-55 public attention was called to the necessity for sanitary improvement
                    in the barracks belonging to Great Britain, and an inquiry was instituted by the
                    Barrack and Hospital Improvement Commission, which was succeeded by the Army
                    Sanitary Committee. The result of the inquiries so made has been a great
                    improvement of the quarters of the troops, which has tended largely to decrease
                    the sickness previously prevalent among them.</p>
                <p>The principal improvements have been as follows, viz. :—At least 600 cubic feet,
                    and from 56 to 60 superficial feet, are now allotted to every single
                    non-commissioned officer and man in permanent barracks, it being considered as
                    important that a soldier should have his full ration of air as of food. In
                    wooden huts 400 cubic feet are reckoned sufficient. At least 1000 cubic feet are
                    allotted to every single non-commissioned officer and man in hot climates. About
                    1600 cubic feet are allotted to every horse, and since the introduction of
                    ventilation, as well as proper sanitary arrangements in stables, glanders have
                    almost entirely disappeared from the army. Married non-commissioned officers and
                    men have special accommodation, with one or two rooms each, according to the
                    size of the rooms or rank of the occupant. In the latest buildings small
                    washing-rooms have been provided, in addition to two rooms for each family. A
                    laundry and infant school are provided for every compound of married soldiers’
                    quarters. The principal medical officer is now charged with seeing that the
                    regulations for protecting the health of troops in barracks are carried out.
                    Each regimental medical officer has also to see to this matter, as well as that
                    every soldier has a separate bed; that the beds are placed at a proper distance
                    from the wall, and are well aired; and that the windows are opened every
                    morning. Barrack-rooms are warmed in two ways, viz., by radiant heat from an
                    open fire, and by warm air obtained from an air chamber behind, and heated by
                    the fire. Much attention has been paid of ιate years to the improvement of the
                    means of cooking the meals of soldiers. Either steel boilers and Deane’s ovens
                    or “Warren’s” apparatus are now ordinarily provided for this purpose. Every
                    headquarter barrack now has a gymnasium and also a chapel school, as well as a
                    sergeants’ mess establishment. Besides a canteen with <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit03newyrich/page/n407/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0903-0407-0392"/> a separate bar for the sale of groceries, one
                    room is provided for recreation, with a coffee bar attacheα, and another room
                    for reading, with a small book-room attached to it, where the library is stored,
                    and from which books are issued. Where there are several barracks at the same
                    station, the sick are usually treated in a garrison hospital; but where there is
                    only one barrack, a regimental hospital forms a part of it. 1200 cubic feet are
                    allowed at home for each patient treated in military hospitals, and about 1800
                    cubic feet in those constructed in hot climates. The proportion of hospital
                    accommodation now allowed at home stations is 6 per cent, on the accommodation
                    of the barrack or barracks to which such hospital is attached. A surgery, store
                    accommodation, a separate infection ward, hospital sergeant’s quarters,
                    sick-orderly’s rooms, and a mortuary, are provided as part of an hospital
                    establishment. There is also, whenever practicable, a garden, where the
                    convalescents can sit out, or take exercise in fine weather. At the main
                    entrance to every barrack a regimental guard-room is-placed, which, besides a
                    good room for the guard, provided with a wooden bed on an iron frame, contains a
                    prisoners’ room, and also a few separate cells for the detention of such
                    prisoners as require to be kept apart. A proportion of “provost cells” are also
                    constructed in large barracks, where soldiers are confined when ordered or
                    sentenced to imprisonment for short periods. In headquarter cavalry barracks a
                    riding school, ordinarily 150 feet long and 50 feet wide, is provided; also one
                    or more maneges for out-door training. In smaller barracks, for mounted troops
                    only, manèges are provided for equitation exercise. Rifle ranges are now
                    considered to be necessary adjuncts to all except small barracks, but sometimes
                    the troops have to be moved to a distance for this purpose, owing to local
                    difficulties preventing practice being carried on. In barracks of modern
                    construction, a separate house or quarter containing about six rooms is provided
                    for a commanding officer,and two rooms with a kitchen (or servant’s room) for
                    each field officer, or officer holding relative rank as such, and for each
                    quarter-master. Other officers have one room each, with a compartment screened
                    or curtained off for sleeping and dressing, a servant’s room for brushing and
                    cleaning being provided for every two or three officers. A mess establishment is
                    attached to every officers’ barrack, which is constructed in proportion to the
                    numbers to be quartered in the barracks. Where the headquarters of a regiment
                    are stationed, a billiard-room is usually allowed as part of the mess
                    establishment. A good supply of water is one of the first requisites in a
                    barrack, and it is preferable to obtain it, if possible, from the water-works of
                    the locality, rather than from wells, which are liable to become polluted from
                    soakage, leakage of drains, or other causes. Barracks should have high-level
                    tanks, to contain one or two days’ supply of water, as a reserve, or in case of
                    fire, and fire-cocks should be fixed in suitable places. Fire-engines, with an
                    ample supply of hose and also ladders, are always supplied for use in barracks.
                    The sewers or drains of a barrack should, if possible, discharge into the main
                    or branch sewers of the locality, but if none such exist, irrigation of land may
                    be resorted to, or earth closets can be adopted, and the liquid drainage only be
                    disposed of by irrigation, or such other means as may be practicable. All drains
                    should be properly trapped and ventilated. Soil-pipes of water-closets should
                    also be ventilated by means of small pipes carried up above the roof of the main
                    building; pipes of the size of ordinary gas-pipes will suffice for this purpose,
                    allowing the escape of foul gas into the outer air. Overflow or other
                    water-pipes should on no account be connected directly with a drain, but should
                    discharge into an open or surface channel, cr over a trap or grating. Gas is
                    ordinarily laid on to barracks both externally and internally, the quantity
                    consumed being checked by a meter or meters. It is usually obtained by agreement
                    from any public gas-works in the locality, but at certain large stations the W
                    ar Department have their own gas-works. At certain large stations where large
                    bodies of troops are quartered, churches are provided in addition to or in place
                    of chapel schools. Γhe latter are used for the services of the men of different
                    persuasions in succession; the former are sometimes similarly used, but are more
                    generally restricted to the Church of England or other specific religious
                    persuasion. Sometimes military cemeteries are provided, but more generally the
                    soldiers are buried in those of the localities where they may be quartered.
                    Wherever there is sufficient ground about or near a barrack, as at Eastney, near
                    Portsmouth, soldiers may have portions for gardening allotted them.</p>
