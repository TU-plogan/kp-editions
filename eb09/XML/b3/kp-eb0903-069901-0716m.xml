                <p>ANATOMY OF BIRDS.</p>
                <p>IN the consideration of the Anatomy of Birds, classification will be quite a
                    secondary matter, and merely employed for the elucidation of internal structure.
                    Some sort of grouping, however, is indispensable; and that is accordingly
                    adopted, as the most convenient for the morphologist, which was first proposed
                    by Professor Huxley,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>“On
                    the Classification of Birds; and of the taxonomic value of the modifications of
                    certain of the cranial bones observable in that class,” <hi rend="italic"
                    >Proceedings of the Zoological Society,</hi> April 11, 1867, pp. 415-472. This
                    classification is somewhat modified in a later paper by the same author, in
                    which a very masterly description is given of the Gallinaceous group <hi
                    rend="italic">(Alectoromorphae,</hi> Huxley), “On the Classification and
                    Distribution of the <hi rend="italic">Alectoromorphae</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >Heteromorphoe,”</hi><hi rend="italic">ibid.,</hi> May 14, 1868, pp. 293-319.
                    The same author repeats, in essentially the same form, tho original
                    classification in his <hi rend="italic">Anatomy of the Vertebrated Animals</hi>
                    (1871, p. 272). The materials from which the modified views here given have been
                    taken are in a series of contributions by Mr Parker to the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Transactions of the Linnean and Zoological Societies</hi> now (1875) passing
                    through the press. For figures of the skeleton see Mr Eyton’s <hi rend="italic"
                    >Oi&gt;tcologιa Avium.</hi></p></note> with the introduction of certain
                    modifications rendered necessary by the present writer’s own
                    researches—researches, it may be added, which have been carried on in constant
                    communication with that investigator.</p>
                <p>A little examination will show that the groups made by consideration of any, even
                    the most important, morphological modifications, cannot be <hi rend="italic"
                    >superimposed upon</hi> groups made by reference to the whole sum of the
                    characters of the Bird. This may be easily explained. About half the known
                    Birds, 5000 or thereabouts, belong, according to G. R. Gray, to Professor
                    Huxley’s group, the <hi rend="italic">Coraco-</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >morphoe.</hi> These birds undergo a peculiar metamorphosis of the naso-palatal
                    structures, and are called by Professor Huxley the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Aegithognathae</hi> on that account. Now all the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Coracomorphae</hi> have the aegithognathous palate, but so also have the <hi
                    rend="italic">Cypselidae,</hi> or Swifts, which are placed by this author with
                    the Humming-birds and Goatsuckers, both of which groups are simply
                    schizognathous. Moreover, below the Passerine types, and only next above the
                    Semi-struthious Tinamous, we find the Hemipods, <hi rend="italic"
                    >Turnicidoe,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Tumicimorphoe,</hi> and these have an
                    aegithognathous palate. So also has another type, <hi rend="italic"
                    >Thinocorus,</hi> which lies on the same low zoological level as the Hemipods.
                    This latter bird is essentially a small Geranomorph, but it is below the true
                    Cranes, and unites in its palate characters belonging to the Ostriches below it
                    and the Passerines which ascend, zoologically, far above it.</p>
                <p>The difficulty of applying this very valuable morphological grouping, and making
                    it fit in with one that is more general and distinctively zoological (that is,
                    having reference to every character, external, and internal), does not take away
                    anything of real value from it. To the anatomist such a mode of viewing the
                    various types is perfectly natural, however hard it may be to satisfy the pure
                    zoologist as to its great value. Certainly, the structures of the skull and face
                    govern the whole body, as it were; every other part of the organism corresponds
                    to what is observable there. Nor must it be forgotten that the true mode of
                    studying any kind of creature is that of its <hi rend="italic">development;</hi>
                    and the head undergoes the most remarkable morphological changes.</p>
                <p>In the following scheme we have added one new morphological group to Professor
                    Huxley’s classification. This group includes the Woodpeckers and Wrynecks, <hi
                    rend="italic">Picidoe</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Yungidoe.</hi> Zoologically it
                    forms the family <hi rend="italic">Celeo-</hi><hi rend="italic">morphoe</hi>
                    (Huxley); its morphological term is <hi rend="italic">Saurognathoe</hi>
                    (Parker).</p>
                <p>Every one who has laboured at the anatomy of this class must have been struck by
                    its marvellous uniformity; almost countless numbers of species are found passing
                    insensibly into one another, and differing in the slightest manner. The best
                    modern zoologists are at times almost at their wits’ end to know by what
                    characters they may distinguish their genera and species. This has been well put
                    by Professor Huxley <hi rend="italic">(Anat. of Vert. Anim.)</hi> He says (p.
                    272)—“Though this class contains a great number of specific forms, the
                    structural modifications which they present are of comparatively little
                    importance; any two birds which can be selected differing from one another far
                    less than the extreme types of the <hi rend="italic">Lacertilia,</hi> and hardly
                    more than the extreme forms of the <hi rend="italic">Chelonia,</hi> do. Hence
                    the characters by which the following groups” (see subjoined table) “are
                    separated appear almost insignificant when compared with those by which the
                    divisions of the <hi rend="italic">Reptilia</hi> are indicated.”</p>

                <p>The above scheme is a nail in a sure place; and on it, for the present, we may
                    hang all that we know, or are learning, of the anatomical structure of this
                    class of Vertebrates. That which relates to the <hi rend="italic">Carinatoe</hi>
                    must, however, be regarded merely as a <hi rend="italic">list</hi> of Birds
                    having a similar facial structure.</p>
                <p>For the general ornithologist it is very suggestive and helpful, and will save
                    him from looking merely on outward appearances; for the study of structure and
                    development is looking into the heart of the matter.</p>
                <p>The Skull.</p>
                <p>To both the zoologist and the palaeontologist an explanation of the <hi
                    rend="italic">skeleton</hi> will be of the greatest value, for the framework
                    must of necessity be correlated to the nervous system, and also govern the
                    development of the muscles. It will here form the first and the largest part of
                    our work. And as all things in the skeleton are conformed to the modifications
                    of the skull, and, moreover, as the skull is the most knotty problem to the
                    morphologist, it will receive the attention due to its superior importance.</p>
                <p>Instead of describing the adult skull, and then showing how it develops, it would
                    seem to be better to follow the stages of its growth, and thus see the meaning
                    of the parts, and what metamorphic changes take place to give it its adult
                    characters. Space will not permit any detail of the general embryology of the
                    Bird, but the skull will be described from the time when the rudiments of the
                    chondro-cranium are first fairly visible, that is, about the fifth day of
                    incubation.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>The whole

                    being imperfectly soldered together. The head of the skull at this stage still
                    shows the “visceral clefts;” and it is bent upon itself by what is called the

                    of tissue (fig. 1, <hi rend="italic">comp.</hi> fig. 4, <hi rend="italic"
                    >i.v.)</hi> which is passing rapidly from the condition of stellate cells into
                    proper hyaline cartilage.</p>
                <p>This plate is divided at the midline by a straight, somewhat beaded rod of soft
                    indifferent tissue, which does not chondrify; it is rounded at its fore - end.
                    This truly azygous part is the notochord <hi rend="italic">(n.c.), QT</hi>
                    primary axis of the skeletal parts of the embryo; it lies directly beneath the
                    neural axis, and is one of the parts earliest visible to the embryologist. The
                    broad plate on each side is seen to be hollow, and to contain a pear-shaped
                    diverticulum of the primordial ear-sac <hi rend="italic">(cl.),</hi> which is
                    planted, as it were, in the veιy substance of the basal plate, at its middle.
                    The outer granular covering of the ear-sac becomes cartilage, and so does the
                    basal plate—the “investing mass” of Rathke, the “parachordal cartilage” of
                    Huxley.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>See Huxley on

                <p>But the process by which these two separate morphological territories become
                    converted into solid cheese-like cartilage is carried on blindly, as it were,
                    and no distinction of parts is at present traceable; evident differentiation of
                    morphological territories is often <hi rend="italic">late</hi> in the higher
                    types of vertebrata. The tissue which surrounds the spinal chord where this part
                    passes into the brain is still soft; it -will chondrify soon to form the
                    occipital arch. The bulbous end of the notochord ends a little behind an oval
                    membranous space or fontanelle in the skull-floor—the <hi rend="italic"
                    >pituitary space (pt.s.).</hi> Near the end of the notochord, on each side, the
                    cartilage suddenly narrows, for here we are in front of the impacted ear-sacs;
                    at this part a bending of the narrow anterior end of the parachordal rounded
                    notch (5) is formed, over which the trigeminal nerve passes. The anterior margin
                    of the notch (afterwards formed into the <hi rend="italic">foramen ovale)</hi>
                    is formed by the cartilage; its actual extremity looks forward and outward,
                    towards the eyeball. At present the bands which are continued forward,
                    surrounding the pituitary space, are superimposed upon, and indistinct from, the
                    ends of the parachordal cartilages; in the next stage they will be seen more
                    distinctly. These flat bands of dense granular tissue are the <hi rend="italic"

                <p>The inter-nasal plate is arched and winged—the rudi mentary condition of the
                    nasal sacs, the apertures of which are seen beneath the arched part below (fig.

                <p>On the sides of the face behind the mouth are seen slits (fig. 2, 1, 2, 3); these
                    are the “visceral clefts,” which are always developed in embryonic vertebrata.
                    Between these clefts the tissue of the “mesoblast” is thickening into
                    cartilaginous rods; these rods are the post-oral visceral arches, the rudiments
                    of the lower jaw and hyoid bone. But beneath the eye is seen an arcuate bar of
                    tissue more solid than its surroundings; this is the pterygopalatine rod. It is
                    developed in the maxillo-palatine process of the mandibular or first post-oral
                    arch; it represents the bar of cartilage which, in the Frog, connects the
                    mandibular suspensorium with the ethmoidal region.<note anchored="true"

                    suspensory part of the lower jaw. But this early division of a visceral arch
                    into an antero-superior and a postero-inferior bar is very constant in the next
                    or <hi rend="italic">second</hi> visceral arch from the <hi rend="italic"

                <p>At present the subocular pterygo-palatine bar is very little denser than the
                    tissue in which it is imbedded, but the mandible itself is fast passing into
                    cartilage. Already it is in two pieces, a suspensory piece (figs. 1 and 2, <hi
                    rend="italic">q.),</hi> and a free rod <hi rend="italic">(mk.);</hi> the upper
                    piece becomes the quadrate, and the lower, longer part the articulo-Meckelian
                    bar. The processes of the tuberous upper piece are indistinct, but it is sinuous
                    below where it articulates with the thick end of the free bar. These bars
                    nearly, but not quite, meet in the rudimentary chin, the ventral end of the
                    lower jaw. Properly speaking, the hyoid arch is composed of <hi rend="italic"
                    >two</hi> visceral arches; but the term is now applied strictly to the first of
                    these, namely, the second visceral, or the arch of the tongue. At present this
                    arch has, with the one in front of it, its <hi rend="italic"
                    >antero-superior</hi> piece quite soft; it, too, is <hi rend="italic">late</hi>
                    in its development. The two lower pieces (fig. 2, <hi rend="italic">c.h.)</hi>
                    form the skeleton of the tongue. They are the ceratohyals, and between these is

                    The third post-oral arch is very similar, but it is larger, and its upper piece
                    is already fast chondrifying. That corresponds to the first epi-branchial of a

                    beginning of the sixth day of incubation, the chondro-cranium of the chick has
                    undergone sundry and notable changes. A sectional view (fig. 3)</p>
                <p>shows that the hinder and front cartilages, parachordal and trabecular, are
                    applied to each other unconformably, the parachordal tracts rising high between
                    the second and third cerebral vesicles, and forming the posterior pituitary
                    wall, a shelving structure in which the axial skeleton ends.</p>
                <p>A bird’s-eye view of the hinder skull-floor at this stage (fig. 4) shows that the
                    dorsal or hinder ends of the trabeculae have opened out, like a pair of
                    callipers, and that the out-turned ends of the parachordal cartilages are fused
                    with the inner margin of these apices. The bud-shaped process, which has almost
                    freed itself from the rest, opposite the bulbous end of the notochord, is the
                    true apex of the first visceral bar, or trabecula; in the next stage it is far
                    more distinct and instructive. Turning again to the vertical section (fig. 3),
                    we see that the commissure of the trabeculae, or inter-nasal plate,<note

                    frontonasal process; it is about to become the axis of the beak, and will turn
                    forwards and upwards. This is the prenasal or basi-trabecular cartilage, a
                    notable morphological element <hi rend="italic">up</hi> here, amongst the Birds,
                    and <hi rend="italic">down</hi> amongst the lower or cartilaginous types of
                    Fishes. At the present it corresponds exactly to the state of the Green Turtle’s
                    skull (chondrocranium) at the time of hatching, and in that type it stops at
                    this stage, not raising itself into a forth-standing rostrum.</p>
                <p>The mouth, which in the first stage was a large four-sided cleft, with produced
                    corners, and clean beneath the head, as in a Skate, is now a space, the axis of
                    which points more forward than downward, a good step towards its eventual
                    direction. The further development of the facial arches will be best studied in
                    older specimens at the end of this, the second stage; but at its commencement
                    there is wanted the condition of the <hi rend="italic">anterosuperior</hi>
                    segment of the hyoid, or second post-oral arch. This has not been worked out in
                    the Fowl’s chick, but in an embryo of the House Martin <hi rend="italic"

                    to development.</p>
                <p>In this instance the quadrate and articular Meckelian cartilages have acquired
                    very nearly their proper form (fig. 5, g., <hi rend="italic">ar., mk.),</hi> the
                    suspensorial part having a free forward and inward looking process, the

                    continuous by the upturned end of its handle with the very substance of the
                    ear-capsule. The solid sickle-shaped cartilage behind this is the “tympanic
                    wing” of the exoccipital <hi rend="italic">∖</hi><hi rend="italic">t.e.o.)</hi>
                    Here we have the wanting upper and anterior segment of the hyoid arch,
                    corresponding to the separately developed pterygo-palatine bar, its “serial
                    homologue.” The blade or free end of the trowel is concave on the under side,
                    and is thick above and at its margin on the outside; it is pointed above and
                    below. A ligament connects the upper point with the ear-capsule behind the
                    quadrate, and another tract of soft <hi rend="italic">indifferent tissue</hi>
                    reaches downwards to a small bar of cartilage, which looks backwards and a
                    little downwards. This little cartilage <hi rend="italic">(st.h.)</hi> is only
                    connected with the distal piece <hi rend="italic">(c.hy.)</hi> by fibrous
                    tissue; it is the stylohyal, and corresponds to what is permanent in the

                    away with it an oval piece of the periotic wall; that oval part is the true

                    appeared, save in the sides of the mandible. The roof of the skull never

                    which marks the fore-end of the cranial cavity, and the groove on each side
                    below this is for the nerve of smell (1). The oval pituitary space has become a
                    neat round opening, through which the internal carotid arteries enter; it never
                    chondrifies below, and has to be floored afterwards by secondary bone. The upper
                    hyoid element <hi rend="italic">(st.)</hi> has now freed itself from the
                    periotic cartilage, bringing away so much as serves for the dilated dorsal end,
                    and thus leaving an open window <hi rend="italic">(fenestra</hi><hi

                    almost its adult form, and the double lower condyle fits into a sinuous

                    free bar—the mandible—sends backwards a posterior, and inwards an internal

                    internally of small thinwalled spheroidal, and externally of fusiform, cells of

                    the cartilage of the pituitary ring, causing it also to ossify. On each side,

                    The super-occipital region (β.o.) is still soft, and the exoccipitals do not

                    substance the diminishing notochord (n.c.), which, however, is better seen in
                    the partial upper view (fig. 7, n.c.) This figure shows that the notochord has
                    tried, as it were, to break up into three fusiform segments. The hinder of these
                    is enclosed in an ectosteal sheath, which will affect with bony growth the
                    neighbouring cartilage, right and left, to form the basi-occipital. The
                    fore-part is narrower, and lies in an open space, the counterpart of the
                    membranous floor (“posterior basi-cranial fontanelle ”— Rathke), which lies
                    behind the pituitary space in the Snake’s embryo. On each side of the middle

                    seen creeping through the pituitary hole, and on each side the ossification has
                    been set up, which forms the true endo-skeletal basi-sphenoid. On each side of
                    the posterior pituitary or clinoid wall, the cartilage is pinched in to let the
                    great trigeminal nerves pass over; but two parts of intensest interest are seen
                    on each side of these shallow notches. These are the apices of the trabeculae

                    cells in their interior, and fixed to the out-turned anterior ends of the
                    parachordal cartilages, just where the new bony matter is seen. The meaning of
                    these parts that make the pituitary region was not seen at the time by the
                    author of the paper we are quoting (Parker “On the Fowl’s Skull”); further
                    research was needed, and his figures are of much greater value than his

                    When every investing bone has been removed, we get such a structure as is shown
                    (from above) in fig. 9. Here the cranial basin has a short and fenestrate floor,
                    and doubly-winged sides, which are gently scooped above, and form a pair of
                    symmetrical ledges on which the widest part of the brain rests; whilst the floor

                    side of the prenasal, spatula in front, and the cartilage at this part forms a
                    coiled, valvular nose-lid — the “alinasal region.” From this, in its inside,

                    the “alinasal turbinal.” It curves towards the septum, and then turns upwards

                    between the Ratite and Carinate types—the Tinamou— the metamorphic processes are

                    olfactory groove (1.); whilst in front of the cranio-facial fenestra (c.∕.c.),
                    the orbito-nasal nerve <hi rend="italic">(n.n.)</hi> grooves the septum, gets
                    bridged over by it, and creeps down to its own proper facial bar—the trabeculae.
                    And the result of the metamorphosis in this Carinate bird is the formation of a
                    pear-shaped fenestra <hi rend="italic">(i.o.f.)</hi> between the eyeballs. This
                    window waβ not cut out by Nature in a fit of economy (as the mere teleologists
                    vainly speak), but is a fairly commenced separation of the common crest of the

                <p>The notch behind the cartilaginous frame of this window is formed by membrane

                    bird’s-eye view (fig. 9.), we see that the notochord is now enclosed in a
                    spearhead-shaped bone, the basi-occipital (δ.o.) It is ridged above by the
                    enclosed notochord, and, behind, the swelling halves of the condyle (o.c.) are
                    seen. This basal bone is truncated in front, and forms the hinder margin of the
                    wide rounded “posterior basicranial fontanelle” <hi rend="italic">(p.b.f.)</hi>
                    On each side are the exoccipitals (e.o.), and, above, the perfected occipital
                    arch has a pair of super-occipitals (s.o.) as in man. The outer occipital region
                    is grooved to receive the investing bones, and has tympanic wings to enlarge and
                    protect that cavity. On each side of the fore-part of the basi-occipital is seen
                    the cochlea (cZ.); and in the ledge above the main periotic bone, the prootic
                    <hi rend="italic">(pro.)</hi> is largely spreading (the two lesser ossicles are
                    appearing, but will be better shown in the next stage). The foramen ovale (5) is
                    very large; it is bounded behind by the prootic, and in front by the alisphenoid
                    <hi rend="italic">(a.s.)</hi> This “great wing” has a large central fenestra,
                    round which the bone has crept. In somewhat younger specimens this bony matter
                    was in <hi rend="italic">two patches,</hi> one above and another below the

                    ones are in good liking” as soon as they appear; hence they are strong in bone
                    and sinew very early, the growth-processes taking place rapidly.</p>
                <p>The under view (fig. 13) shows, behind the orbits, a strong cranial box.
                    Synchondroses of the remainder of the chondrocranium divide the endo-skeletal
                    bone-territories; and that organic attraction which causes the perfect
                    correlation of the shallow with the deeper layers of the mesoblast, has given us
                    here bony encasements, that not only fill in what was wanting in the
                    chondro-cranium, but also overlie and double the strength of the ossified
                    cartilage itself. All is neat and finished now, and now is the nick of time in
                    which can be seen most of the sutures, so soon to be obliterated by the almost
                    universal ankylosis that takes place afterwards—a process by which Nature, in
                    the Bird, rapidly fills in nearly all her footprints. Here she is as hard to
                    bind as Proteus himself; and the morphological worker is often sore bestead to
                    catch all the transformations. If the chick were to retain throughout life its
                    present form of face, it would much resemble a Hemipod. We have seen how its
                    skull becomes metamorphosed from a lower into a higher and a still higher type
                    day by day.</p>
                <p>This basal view shows that the bony pieces of the occipital arch are fast forming
                    a strong ring, after the manner of a vertebra. The keystone piece (s.o.) is now
                    one bone, with the remains of the suture above. The notochord still exists in
                    the basal piece <hi rend="italic">(b.o.),</hi> and is seen in the condyle, the
                    dimple of which is caused by it. The basi-temporal plate (6.i.) is now a low
                    triangle, with its base behind; the base is, as it were, gnawed, the jagged edge
                    joining the overlying spheno-occipital by a squamous suture. This thick plate is
                    emarginate in front, below the meeting of the eustachian tubes (ew.), and this
                    notch is the mark of the original symmetry of this double bone. Grooved gently
                    at the mid-line, the basi-temporal is mammillate on each side, these elegant
                    swellings being due to the cochleae that are encysted in the ossifying cartilage
                    above. Behind, it is eared, and over these ears the internal carotids creep as
                    they seek the pituitary space ready to form the “circle of Willis.” The bone
                    above and in front of the basi-temporal is a compound of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >rostral</hi> parasphenoid and the proper basi-sphenoid. Altogether, this is a
                    very extensive and multiform element. -Directly in front of the basi-temporal it
                    is scooped at the meeting of the eustachian tubes— diverticula of the first
                    visceral cleft. In front of that part the rostrum'is soon a free structure,
                    grooved for the interorbital septum; but behind and above the basi-temporal the
                    bony mass is all one, and it has an upper and a lower wing on each side behind
                    the strong wall which it has built around the pituitary well. The upper of these
                    wings are ossifications of that cartilage which we saw was formed by coalescence
                    of the <hi rend="italic">sub-apical</hi> part of the trabeculae with the
                    fore-end of the parachordal plates.</p>
                <p>The large posterior basi-cranial fontanelle has now become the deep chink which
                    exists as a ditch between these post-pituitary banks (fig. 14, <hi rend="italic"
                    >p.b.f.)</hi> On the upper surface the chink reaches the basi-occipital; in the
                    horizontal section (fig. 14) it is cut away behind.</p>
                <p>The lower and outer pair of wings of the basi-sphenoid are very large (figs. 13
                    and 14); they build, on each side, the anterior tympanic recess (α.i.r.), and
                    their starting point of growth is from the free apices of the trabeculae, which
                    are thus <hi rend="italic">feathered</hi> with these large coiled laminae of
                    periosteal bone that enclose another diverticulum of the first visceral cleft,
                    which lies over the eustachian passage.</p>
                <p>Close in front of the eustachian groove the soldered part of the rostrum widens
                    into a pair of projections, and, upon these, obliquely placed facets of
                    cartilage are attached for articulation with counterpart cartilages on the
                    pterygoid bones <hi rend="italic">(pg.)</hi></p>
                <p>These perfectly distinct cartilages are the result of a peculiar metamorphosis of
                    the outstanding (basi-pterygoid) spurs of the trabeculae. In the <hi

                    Mammals on the other, these <hi rend="italic">external pterygoid</hi> plates or
                    processes are a direct outgrowth of cartilage, the posterior conjugational spurs
                    that grow out for union with the pterygo-palatine arcade.<note anchored="true"

                    subdivision of the ethmo-trabecular wall, this segmentation of originally
                    continuous cartilage is of the highest morphological importance. Several other
                    things of this kind will be found in this class, where the Vertebrate pattern
                    has been specialized and metamorphosed to its highest degree, as if to produce
                    types that should be as <hi rend="italic">imagines</hi> in relation to the forms
                    beneath them. The remainder of the rostrum just runs, pointed, to the edge of
                    the cranio facial cleft (fig. 16, <hi rend="italic">r.b.s.</hi> to <hi
                    rend="italic">a.p.)</hi> In front of this notch the septum nasi is seen, narrow
                    and rounded, and it terminates below in the starving prenasal <hi rend="italic"
                    >(s.n.,p.n.)</hi> Around and in front of that rod the now single premaxillary
                    clings; it has its under surface grooved to the end, where that rod lay, its
                    sides developed into the sharpdentary region (fig. 13, <hi rend="italic"
                    >d.px.),</hi> and its under part growing backwards as two nearly parallel bands,
                    the palatine processes <hi rend="italic">(p.px.),</hi> that articulate with the
                    palatine bones (<hi rend="italic">pa.)</hi> These latter bones run backwards in
                    the same gently diverging manner, and then curve inwards to be tied the one to
                    the other, before they bend outward again, foot-like, to articulate with the
                    pterygoids (<hi rend="italic">pg. )</hi> These palatines are very simple; they
                    give off from their main bars merely a scooped lamina, growing towards the skull
                    base, becoming the ethmo-palatine in front; and this part articulates with a
                    splint of the trabecular arch, the small styliform vomer (v.), which is notched
                    behind, bluntly pointed in front, and primarily azygous.</p>
                <p>The pterygoids <hi rend="italic">(pg.)</hi> are stout little bony mallets, with a
                    pad, as if of leather—the cartilaginous articular meniscus. Where each bone
                    glides on the similarly padded trabecular region these facets look upwards and
                    inwards. The end of the palatine is articulated by strong fibres to a sinuous
                    notch on the fore-end of the pterygoid. This notch is bounded by the
                    basi-pterygoid facet below, and by a stunted <hi rend="superscript"> ti</hi>
                    meso-pterygoid process” above, which rides over the palatine. It is arrested in
                    the <hi rend="italic">Gallinaceae,</hi> and never becomes segmented off (see
                    below). The hinder end of the pterygoid is scooped below to articulate with the
                    counterpart knob on the front face of the quadrate. A joint cavity is formed
                    here. Above that joint, and looking upwards and forwards, is a very stunted <hi
                    rend="superscript"> a</hi> epi-pterygoid” process, which clings to, and is
                    strongly strapped upon, the quadrate by fibrous tissue.</p>

                <p>The large quadrate bone (figs. 13 and 15, <hi rend="italic">q.)</hi> has its free
                    pedicle or orbital process still soft above. Its otic process has a larger
                    rounded head for the squamosal <hi rend="italic">(sq.),</hi> and a lesser
                    rounded head for the prootic within. In front of the otic process is a sort of
                    trochanter or spur. Below, the articular facet is somewhat divided, by a shallow
                    fossa, into an outer larger and an inner lesser facet. The otic process passes
                    through the front of the tympanic cavity (first cleft), and becomes involved in
                    the membrane thereto attached, namely, the membrana tympani. It was mistaken by
                    anatomists of the last generation for the true tympanic bone. Behind this bone
                    (see fig. 13) there are seen two holes, the inner of them leads to the auditory
                    fenestrae (ovalis and rotunda), and the outer is the opening into a gallery
                    which communicates, by means of diploe, with one on the other side. These are
                    the “upper tympanic recesses,” and have their counterparts in the Crocodile.
                    Besides the pterygoid and palatine, in that part of the mandibular arch which i§
                    folded over the mouth, —for the first post-oral enfolds itself to make all the
                    lower and much of the upper jaw,—there are in the outer part of the
                    maxillo-palatine process three bones formed on each side, as we have seen.</p>
                <p>The first of these is the bony <hi rend="italic">ichihyic</hi> maxillary (».),
                    with a bony foot, that grows inwards and backwards in a falcate manner, to
                    articulate with the sides of the fore-end of the vomer. These are the
                    maxillo-palatine processes <hi rend="italic">(mx. p.</hi><hi rend="italic

                    its jugal process, is the styloid jugal (j.); and behind this, and overlapping
                    it, the quadrato-jugal, which is hooked to fit in the side of the base of the
                    quadrate behind <hi rend="italic">(qj., qi)</hi> There is a small joint cavity
                    at this place.</p>
                <p>The side view (fig. 15) illustrates the above description; but .it also shows
                    much that is not visible below. The section (fig. 16) helps us still
                    further.</p>
                <p>. The roofing bones are now well seen; the largest of these are the frontals
                    (∕.), which form the upper crescent of the Large circle of the eye. They flatten
                    in front, where they are overlapped by the nasals and nasal processes of the
                    premaxillaries <hi rend="italic">(n.px.)—</hi> a peculiarly ornithic character
                    amongst the higher vertebrata. The orbital rim is very neat and perfect; the
                    main part of the bone, covering the <hi rend="italic">hemisphere,</hi> is a
                    convex radiating scale. Inside the orbit the bone sends inwards a thin scooped
                    orbital process (∕.), on whose convex surface the sloping brain rests. This
                    fails to invest the fontanelle, and the orbito-sphenoids, as yet, are not. The
                    somewhat oblong and also convex parietals (/&gt;.) stop up the gap as far as to
                    the occipital arch; they are much smaller than the frontals. Both the parietals
                    and frontals are flanked and in some degree overlapped by the squamosals (s7.),
                    which are more irregular in shape than, but are fully as large as, the
                    parietals. Half the inner face is seen within (fig. 16, <hi rend="italic"
                    >sq.)∙,</hi> the whole upper edge behind is hidden in this view, and much of the
                    lower part, which forms a strong eave over the huge ear-mass. The lower edge has
                    a cup for the quadrate main head. On the outside (fig. 15) there is to be
                    noticed a variable cartilaginous tract; it takes in all the elegant crescentic
                    tympanic wing of the exoccipitals (i.^.o.), and also runs in front of and
                    between the ex-and super-occipitals (e.o., <hi rend="italic">s.o.)</hi> Between
                    the two bones is the posterior opisthotic region; in front of the exoccipital is
                    the epiotic region. From the inside the imbrication of the cranial and auditory
                    bones is seen to be very regular and remarkable. Running round and across,
                    behind and below the posterior margin of the frontal, we see the fenestrate
                    alisphenoid <hi rend="italic">(a.s.)</hi> underskirting the orbital plate of the
                    frontal, then the hollowed inner face of the squamosal, and behind and above
                    that the scooping of the parietal. Below the same, and also behind it, we
                    have—above, two bones, the prootic in front <pb break="no"

                    takes in all the breadth behind, whilst below the prootic are two, the upper the
                    smaller; the lesser bone is the opisthotic, the larger, rounding the foramen
                    magnum at its sides, is the exoccipital <hi rend="italic">(op., e.o.)</hi> These
                    are infero-lateral elements. Below the whole are the basi-sphenoid and the
                    basi-occipital, both of them underfloored by the basi-temporal <hi rend="italic"
                    >(b.o.,b.t.)</hi> So much tilted backwards is the auditory mass that the crown
                    of the anterior canal (α.s.c.) is imbedded in the super-occipital. In a Lizard,
                    Snake, or Turtle that part would be first enclosed in a separate epiotic bone,
                    which would be soon confluent with the super-occipital. But in these high <hi
                    rend="italic">Sauropsida</hi> the epiotic is a small, <hi rend="italic"
                    >late</hi> centre, formed behind the commencement of the anterior canal in the
                    front part of the recess in which the “flocculus” lies. Also the opisthotic is
                    small, but is distinct for three or four months; it is a wèdge of bone,
                    flat-faced within, forming a straight suture with the hind edge of the prootic,
                    and externally runs as a fine thread of bone between the two fenestrae of the
                    labyrinth. We do not see this bone behind until afterwards, and it soon
                    coalesces with the exoccipital, first with it and afterwards with the prootic,
                    as in Lizards and Snakes. <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi> After the elements of

                    cochleae burrow into the parachordal region, the semicircular canals find room

                    have been found by Mr Parker at the top and the bottom, as it were, of the

                    maxillo-palatines are united across the middle line, either directly or by
                    intermediation of ossifications in the nasal septum. The posterior ends of the

                    ankylosed to this hard palate, and in the Goose, where it remains free.</p>

                    where the maxillo-palatine plates are united by harmony-suture and not by

                    plates has a large obliquely-ascending process; the vomer lies on the groove
                    formed by the union of the maxillo-palatines; the more or less ossified septum,
                    in old age, coalesces, by its outstanding processes, with those plates. The
                    internal, but especially also the posterior angle of the mandible is largely
                    developed, and sσ also is the transpalatine angle of the palatine. The
                    glossohyal is very large and spatulate, and the thyro-hyals are flat and broad

                    an ossicle on each side between the palatines, and stretching towards the
                    maxillo-palatine plate: these bones are the “interpalatines;” they tend to carry
                    on the hard palate.</p>

                    can be ranged with neither of these groups, but must stand as the type of a
                    division by itself. Thus the skull has the long lachrymo-nasal region, the basi
                    pterygoid facets [not so; see <hi rend="italic">op. dt.,</hi> p. 437, where they
                    are truly said to be rudimentary—they are the merest prickles], the prolonged
                    and recurved angles of the mandibles, the laminated horny-sheath of the <hi

                    omne</hi> of the Anserines and Anatines], and the general structure of the
                    rostrum is quite similar to that found in the Storks and Herons.” The nasals are
                    thoroughly Anserine, having their crura separated by a rounded notch; their
                    palatines are quite Anserine, but are broader behind, being exactly like those
                    of the Screamer; and yet they cut off the meso-pterygoid, which coalesces with
                    the palatine. This the Storks and their allies do; the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Chenomorphae</hi> do not. The pterygoids are like those of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Thresciornis</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Platalea,</hi> but the vomer is
                    intermediate between that of the Goose and the SpoonbilP. The orbital processes
                    of the palatines, or “ethmo-palatines,” run together as arched laminae from the
                    body of the bone to the maxillo-palatine floor. They are very shelllike at
                    first, and are attenuated in front. They coalesce together, and send down a bony
                    keel of exquisite thinness in their hinder part. There is a part separate from
                    the rest in front, just where they begin to narrow; this is obviously the median
                    septo-maxillary. Behind, where the palatines shoot below the rostrum of the
                    sphenoid, each bone sends down a lamella; each of these is bound to its fellow
                    by fibrous tissue, and between these the vomer is wedged; the thin plate belongs
                    mutually to the palatines and the azygous vomer. In all the ordinary <hi
                    rend="italic">Chenomorphae</hi> the ethmo-palatine spurs are long; in <hi
                    rend="italic">Phoenicopterus</hi> enormously so; in the Screamer they are very
                    short. Hence the palato-vomerine structures of tlιe <hi rend="italic"
                    >Amphimorphae</hi> are Anserine, but much modified. So also in the hyoid
                    apparatus; and the huge glosso-hyal is, although cartilaginous, the true
                    counterpart of that of a Swan.</p>

                    keel, and those keels run parallel at first and then run into each other in
                    front; above, the two halves form a deep fossa, in which the sub-carinate
                    parasphenoid glides. The edges of this trough are roughly tuberculated and
                    turned over, like the rim of a cup; the primary suture between the halves is
                    retained behind for half the length of the bone. In several <hi rend="italic"

                    In the Cormorant an oblong ossicle lies on the commencement of the zygoma. It is
                    large in <hi rend="italic">P. carbo,</hi> and small in <hi rend="italic"
                    >P.</hi><hi rend="italic">graculus.</hi> A still larger ossicle has heightened

                    Behind each moiety there is a largo oval opening, not far in front of the
                    occipital condyle; this exposes the loose diploë within. The small eustachian
                    tubes open at a little distance from each other, in a wide shallow fossa, on the
                    part where the three elements of the parasphenoid meet. In both the Pelican and
                    the Cormorant there is an elegant, crescentic, lipped, free margin to the very
                    Ardeine basi-temporal plate. In <hi rend="italic">Sula alba</hi> the columella
                    auris is very long and bent. It has a small cartilaginous extra-supra-stapedial
                    process, and a long attenuated cartilaginous infra-stapedial, terminated by a
                    bony fusiform stylo-hyal. The hinge for the mandible is very far back in <hi

                <p>The vomer in this group is of great interest, being extremely variable, and often

                    possesses an “os uncinatum,” propping up the para plana, as in the Gull,

                    figured (fig. 25) was a half-developed nestling. Its round occipital condyle,
                    and the various foramina (8, 9), are shown in the occipital region, and outside
                    and above this arch are seen the hinder face of the opisthotic (qp.), and in
                    front of the tympanic ala of the exoccipital (e.o.) there is an uncinate bone in
                    relation with the prootic, opisthotic, squamosal, and exoccipital, where they
                    all meet together. This is the “pterotic” (ρto.), a huge bone in Osseous Fishes,
                    and walling-in much of the labyrinth. In Serpents only a film of ectosteal bone
                    represents it, and in Lizards such a plate appears, overlapping cartilage which
                    has begun to calcify. It develops and becomes part of the parotic process. The
                    basi-temporal plate (δ.i.), the rostrum, with its arrested basi-pterygoids <hi
                    rend="italic">(b.pg.),</hi> are shown, and on each side the double condyle of
                    the quadrate (i∙), characteristically placed transversely. The zygoma is

                    process of the maxillary is, behind, bound up with the jugal and quadrato-jugal,

                    and superiorly into an elegant shell-like mass.</p>
                <p>The right and left plates lie edge to edge, as in the adult Cariama, and are
                    imperfectly direct in their desmognathism. The palatine processes of the
                    premaxillaries bind the fore-ends of the palatines, which in turn bind under the
                    maxillo-palatine plates. The gap in front is filled with the fast ossifying
                    septum nasi; it is pedate in front, and behind sends out a process on each side;
                    these spurs ankylose afterwards with the maxillo-palatine plates, and they with
                    each other. The palatine bones (pα.), straplike, widen backwards, and then
                    gently narrow to the end, leaving no sharp postero-external angle. The wedge of
                    bone which has been fretted off from the fore-end of each of the rod-like
                    pterygoids <hi rend="italic">(pg.)</hi> binds on the postero-superior edge of
                    each palatine, and the inner plate of these bones covering the under surface of
                    the sphenoidal rostrum imperfectly, allows part of these bony wedges—the
                    “meso-pterygoids” <hi rend="italic">(m. pg.)—</hi> to be seen from below. The

                    uniformity of this group of <hi rend="italic">Desmognathoe</hi> is as remarkable
                    as the variability of the last, and yet it is potent in genera and species. “The
                    rostrum (see <hi rend="italic">op. cit.,</hi> p. 465) is arched and hooked at
                    the extremity, and is regularly articulated with the frontal region of the
                    skull.” Therefore we find that the craniofacial cleft is complete—a state of
                    things not often occurring. The development of this type has not been observed,
                    yet we can interpret the metamorphic results by other <pb break="no"

                    wanting. The palatines are vertically elongated posteriorly, while anteriorly
                    they are horizontally flattened, and movably united with the rostrum. The
                    maxillo-palatines are spongy. The lachrymal and post-orbital bend towards one
                    another, and frequently unite below the orbit.” This is by the intervention of a
                    large “03 uncinatum,” which is best seen in small types, such as <hi
                    rend="italic">Psephotis multicolor,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Agapσmis

                    &amp;c., the temporal fossa is also bridged over by junction of the zygomatic
                    process of the squamosal with the os uncinatum. “The orbital process of the
                    quadrate bone is very small, and its distal presents only one facet (which is
                    compressed from side to side, and convex from before backwards) for the
                    mandible. The rami of the latter are deep, and pass into one another by a
                    rounded symphysis.” The glosso-hyal is spatulate, and the basi-hyal is alate
                    behind. In the fore-face are some things worth noting. The septum nasi is a
                    thick wall of bone; the alae nasi are soft in <hi rend="italic">Psephotis

                    In one small kind we saw the trace of a small medio-palatine. The pars plana is
                    narrow and ossified, and is ankylosed to the lachrymal; the inferior turbinal is
                    soft.</p>

                    another polymorphic group, and is not in any sense, either zoologically or
                    morphologically, the equivalent of the last. Yet it is almost impossible to
                    separate the families by auy character of importance. If the <hi rend="italic"

                    Huxley makes four sub-groups, and then remarks (p. 467): “It appears to me not
                    improbable that it may hereafter be desirable to divide this group into four.”
                    The characters of the skull are thus given (p. 466): “The rostrum presents very
                    various forms, and may be movably articulated with the skull. Basi-pterygoid

                    remember that these types are actually the highest, the most metamorphosed, and
                    the most specialized; not so high in some respects as the Mammal, yet no Mammal
                    comes near them in adaptive modification, not even the one which has the taste
                    to admire, and the wit to describe them. We learn from no less an authority than
                    Mr G. R. Gray that of the 10,000 known birds half belong to this group; the Old

                    but the nasals and nasal processes of the premaxillaries are thin splints set

                    their classification. Mr Parker’s proposed morphological term for these birds is
                    <hi rend="italic">Saurognathae,</hi> and the two terms can be superimposed, <hi
                    rend="italic">Celeomorphae</hi> being their zoological name. Professor Huxley
                    saw that these birds were not desmognathous; that their vomerine moieties
                    remained distinct; that their maxillo-palatines are but little developed; and
                    that supernumerary bones on the inner edge of the palatines in <hi rend="italic"
                    >Picus</hi><hi rend="italic">minor</hi> corresponded to the curious bars that
                    are seen in the larger kinds. He also, with quick insight, says that their
                    palate exhibits a “degradation and simplification of the Aegithognathous
                    structure.” This is strictly true; the elementary parts are the same, but in the
                    Woodpeckers they retain a very <hi rend="italic">Reptilian</hi> distinctness,
                    and even arrest of growth. Yet w ith that arrest there is combined a
                    modification and metamorphosis of certain parts, such as is undergone by no
                    other type. They are in some respects the most simple and embryonic, and in
                    others the most highly specialized birds in the whole class. Their
                    basi-pterygoids are arrested; their basi-temporal region large and wide. Two or
                    three tympanies on each side help to form their remarkable <hi rend="italic"
                    >cowrie-shaped</hi> ear-drum, which is mainly built up by the basi-temporals and
                    exoccipitals. The lower end of the quadrate has the usual form: the bone itself
                    is short; the pterygoids are long, slender, angular, and forked; the lower and
                    foremost fork is the meso-pterygoid element, which does not become segmented
                    off, and thus their pterygoids answer to that of a Snake or Lizard, and reach to
                    the vomer.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>See Günther

                    it is a separate ossification—a perfectly unique thing, as far as the writer’s
                    knowledge goes. The broad main part of the palatine suddenly narrows at its
                    first third, the remaining two-thirds being the long splintery prepalatine,
                    opposite the beginning of which the inner lip runs into an “inter-palatine”
                    spike (i,pα.) The ethmo-palatine processes are extremely long in the nestling of

                    the most marked medio-palatine <hi rend="italic">(m.ρa.)</hi> seen in the class.
                    The prepalatine band passes between the dentary and palatine spurs of the

                    hinder end of the other process are broad, and the two unite by suture. In the
                    higher birds the processes overlap on either side, but orderly as to natural
                    groups. The free end of the premaxillary palatine process looks backward to the
                    free inter-palatine spur in the young (fig. 27); but in old birds, as may well
                    be seen in <hi rend="italic">Gecinus</hi><hi rend="italic">viridis, Picus

                    delicate bridges of bone, which also are thrown along to the ethmo-palatines.
                    This is done by the vomerine series. The “septo-maxillaries * are not single
                    conchoidal plates of bone, as in the Snake and Lizard; but are broken up into
                    grains, which melt into each other again. Even the vomer itself is double on
                    each side in <hi rend="italic">Gecinus</hi><hi rend="italic">viridis,</hi>
                    whilst in <hi rend="italic">Hemilophus</hi><hi rend="italic">fulvus</hi> there
                    are three septo-maxillaries on the left side and five on the right. These
                    ossicles lie on the inner side of the palatines, and are normally connected
                    behind by means of the vomer to the ethmo-palatine; where <hi rend="italic"
                    >normal ornithic ankylosis</hi> takes place in adult birds, there these curious
                    length-wise bridges are formed. Yet this is only part of their complexity, for
                    median septo-maxillaries appear, two of them in <hi rend="italic">Gecinus,</hi>
                    and these are found in the substance of long, right and left, <hi rend="italic"

                    >IIemilophus,</hi> but unite at the mid-line; in <hi rend="italic">Gecinus</hi>
                    they overlap largely to gain the mid-line. In the same species, to add to the
                    complexity, a large shell of bone, from the <hi rend="italic">inturned alinasal
                    wall,</hi> becomes more or less free of its own origin, and unites to the
                    vomerine series. All this has been seen and explained by writing and by

                    it makes less than a single turn, whilst the alinasal turbinal of that bird has
                    two turns, and that of <hi rend="italic">Gecinus</hi> one. <hi rend="italic"
                    >Gecinus</hi> is in all respects the most specialized, <hi rend="italic"

                    >Yunx</hi> least. In <hi rend="italic">Gecinus</hi> the “columella auris” has
                    two supra-stapedial spurs and two infra-stapedial bands, which have united with
                    the tongueshaped stylo-hyal: this has in it a bony centre. The small
                    cerato-hyals early coalesce into one arrowheadshaped bone, and then comes a very
                    long, highly ossified, and elastic basi-hyal, with no uro-hyal behind it. Joined
                    to this are a pair of lower thyro-hyals, half its length; but the upper pieces
                    are four times the length of the lower, and they, passing first down the sides
                    of the upper part of the neck, again turn gently upwards and forwards, ploughing
                    themselves a furrow on the skull top, and deflecting gently to the right nasal
                    roof, wnere they end.</p>
                <p>All these things being considered, it will seem contradictory now to assert the
                    great uniformity of the skulls of Birds, and indeed of the Birds themselves. Yet
                    so it is; and the countless modifications that offer themselves for observation
                    are gentle in the extreme. One form often is seen to pass into another by almost
                    insensible gradations. One thing is certain, namely, that an anatomist not
                    familiar with this class, and coming to its study fresh from the Reptiles, would
                    find himself at fault at every turn; for he would see changes altogether as
                    great as if he had passed from the Helminthoid types, and from mere <hi
                    rend="italic">larvae</hi> and <hi rend="italic">pupae</hi> of the Insects to the
                    (to him supposably) unthought-of <hi rend="italic">imagines</hi> that spring
                    from those low and worm-like stages.</p>
                <p>In the rest of the Birds’ organization abundant evidence of the same
                    specialization will be seen. The mind fails to desire more beauty or to
                    contemplate more exquisite adaptations. An almost infinite variety of Vertebrate
                    life is to be found in this class. Of its members some dig and bury their germs,
                    which rise again in full plumage, whilst others watch and incessantly feed their
                    tender brood in the shady covert or “on the crags of the rock and the strong
                    place.” In locomotion some walk, others run, or they may wade, swim, plunge, or
                    dive, whilst most of them “fly in the open firmament of heaven.”</p>

                <p>The spinal column of birds contains numerous and well-ossified vertebrae, a
                    considerable number of which (more than six) are ankylosed together to form a
                    sacrum. Of the vertebrae which enter into the composition of this complex bone,
                    however, not more than from three to five can be regarded as the homologues of
                    the sacral vertebrae of a Crocodilian or Lacertilian Reptile. The rest are
                    borrowed, in front, from the lumbar and dorsal regions; behind, <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit03newyrich/page/n735/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0903-0735-0718"/> from the tail. The cervical region of the spine
                    is always long; and its vertebrae, which are never fewer than eight, and may be
                    as many as twenty-three, are, for the most part, large in proportion to those of
                    the rest of the body.</p>
                <p>The atlas is a relatively small, ring-like bone; and the transverse ligament may
                    become ossified and divide its aperture into two—an upper for the spinal cord,
                    and a lower for the odontoid process of the axis vertebra. The <hi rend="italic"
                    >os odontoideum</hi> is always ankylosed with the second vertebra, and
                    constitutes a peg-like odontoid process.</p>
                <p>The spines of the succeeding cervical vertebrae are often obsolete, and are never
                    very prominent in the middle region of the neck. The anterior faces of their
                    elongated vertebral centra are <hi rend="italic">convex from above
                    downwards,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">concave from side to side;</hi> whilst the
                    posterior faces are cylindrical, slightly excavated <hi rend="italic">from,
                    above downwards,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">convex from side to side.</hi> (The
                    contrary of this is stated in Professor Huxley’s <hi rend="italic">Verteb.
                    Anim.,</hi> p. 276, where the author, by a <hi rend="italic">lapsus
                    memoriae,</hi> puts it <hi rend="italic">vice versa.)</hi> Hence, in vertical
                    section the centra appear <hi rend="italic">opisthocoelous</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >;</hi> in horizontal section, <hi rend="italic">procoelous,</hi> and not the
                    contrary, as is stated by our author; and the structure is exceedingly
                    characteristic of birds. The under surfaces of the centra frequently give off
                    median inferior processes. In the <hi rend="italic">Ratitoe</hi> it is obvious
                    that the cervical vertebrae have short transverse processes and ribs, disposed
                    very much as in the <hi rend="italic">Crocodilia.</hi> For, in young birds, the
                    anterior end of the lateral face of each vertebra bears two small processes, an
                    upper and a lower; and this expanded head of a styliform rib is articulated with
                    these by two facets, which represent the capitulum and the tuberculum (Huxley,
                    <hi rend="italic">op. cit.,</hi> p. 276). In the chicken of the Emeu <hi
                    rend="italic">(Dromoeus novoe-hollandioe)</hi> the writer, in 1843, carefully
                    worked out and figured these parts. Of the twenty cervical vertebrae only the
                    atlas and axis were devoid of distinct ribs; this individual was six weeks old.
                    These riblets were bony wedges, with a sharp point; but that was free, and the
                    thick upper end was jammed in between upper and lower transverse processes <hi
                    rend="italic">(diapophysis</hi> and <hi rend="italic">parapophy sis).</hi> The
                    last but one of the ribs became suddenly larger, and the last was two-thirds the
                    size of its successor—the first dorsal. Then followed six large ribs on each
                    side, the last two floating. The vertebra bearing the last of these, and twenty
                    more, are closely embraced by the fore-and-aft growth of the ilium, and form the
                    so-called sacrum. Of the twenty vertebrae between the first overlapped bone with
                    a floating rib and the nine <hi rend="italic">ribless</hi> caudals, there are
                    five with free ribs, small, and hatchet-shaped, quite like those in the neck of
                    the Crocodile. These, from being attached to a parapophysial cup near the
                    fore-end of the centrum, get more forward, and wedge in between their own
                    vertebra and the one in front. The next four vertebrae, which give exit to the
                    sacral plexus (or at least to most of it), have no ribs, and are very broad and
                    short. They develop lamellar upper transverse processes, but theiι spines are
                    aborted. Then come eleven vertebrae, in front of the free caudal, that have
                    short ribs; the first two pairs are ankylosed already, then <hi rend="italic"
                    >four pairs</hi> are distinct, and the remaining five have their ribs ankylosed,
                    and then becoming shorter and more pedate externally, get further backwards on
                    the centrum. Thus, in a Bird as old as six weeks after hatching, there are
                    eighteen pairs of cervical, and nine pairs of so-called sacral ribs still
                    distinct. Moreover, the ribs are quite aborted on the first and second cervical,
                    on the four <hi rend="italic">true</hi> sacral,—perchance, the next after this
                    is also sacral,—and on all the caudal vertebrae which have only papilliform
                    transverso processes. There are fifty-five vertebrae in all in the Emeu, thus
                    :—cervical, twenty; dorsal, five; dorso-lumbar (the first with a large rib and
                    really the sixth dorsal), six; sacral (proper), four; uro-sacral, eleven;
                    caudal, nine. We shall return to these data in describing the sacrum of the
                    Fowl.</p>
                <p>With age the cervical ribs (of the <hi rend="italic">Ratitoe)</hi> may become
                    completely ankylosed. In <hi rend="italic">Apteryx australis</hi> one, below,
                    remains free; in <hi rend="italic">Struthio camelus,</hi> two; and in <hi
                    rend="italic">Dromoeus novoe-hollandioe,</hi> three; and then they appear like
                    transverse processes, perforated at the base by a canal, which, as in the <hi
                    rend="italic">Crocodilia,</hi> contains the vertebral artery and vein, and the
                    main trunk of the sympathetic nerve. The cervical ribs and transverse processes
                    are similarly disposed in very young <hi rend="italic">Carinatae;</hi> but in
                    these birds their form frequently becomes much modified in the adult, and they
                    develop prolongations which extend downwards and inwards, and protect the
                    carotid artery or arteries. The neural arches have well-developed pre-and
                    post-zygapophyses. The ribs of one or two of the posterior cervical vertebrae
                    become elongated and freely movable in the <hi rend="italic">Carinatae,</hi> as
                    in the <hi rend="italic">Ratitoe.</hi></p>
                <p>The first dorsal vertebra is defined as such by the union of the ribs with the
                    sternum by means of a sternal rib, which not only, as in the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Crocodilia,</hi> becomes articulated with the vertebral rib, but is converted
                    into complete bone, and is connected by a true articulation with the margin of
                    the sternum. The number of the dorsal vertebrae (reckoning under that head all
                    the vertebrae, after the first dorsal, which possess distinct ribs, whether they
                    be fixed or free) varies. The centra of the dorsal vertebrae either possess
                    cylindroidal articular faces, like those of the neck, as is usually the case; or
                    more or fewer of them may have their faces spheroidal, as in the Penguins
                    [Plovers (and their kin <hi rend="italic">Vanellus</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >cristatus,</hi><hi rend="italic">Totanus</hi><hi rend="italic">fuscus,</hi>
                    &lt;fcc.), Gulls, Cormorants, and Parrots], In this case the convex face is
                    anterior, the concave, posterior. They may, or may not, develop .inferior median
                    processes [which may be simple, as in the Cormorant, where they exist on several
                    lower cervical, on all the dorsal, and in five sacro-lumbar; <hi rend="italic"
                    >or</hi> they may bifurcate into two broad, bony leaves, as in <hi rend="italic"
                    >Colymbus].</hi> They usually possess well-marked spinous processes [which begin
                    in the two or three lower cervicals]. Sometimes they are slightly movable upon
                    one another [bound strongly, in many cases, by ossified tendons of great
                    strength and elasticity]; sometimes they become ankylosed together into a solid
                    mass. [When this takes place the last cervical is ankylosed to the three first
                    dorsal, as in the fowl, the fourth remaining free, and the fifth coalescing with
                    the lumbar; or, as many as <hi rend="italic">five</hi> may ankylose together,
                    leaving one free, and the last ankylosed to the lumbar, as in <hi rend="italic"
                    >Falco cesalon.</hi> But this number often differs with age, as may be seen in
                    different individuals of <hi rend="italic">Psophia crepitans,</hi> and other,
                    more typical, Cranes.]</p>
                <p>It is characteristic of the dorsal vertebrae of Birds that the posterior, no less
                    than the anterior, vertebrae present a facet or small process on the body, or
                    lover part of the arch, of the vertebra for the capitulum of the rib, while the
                    upper part of the neural arch gives off a more elongated process for the
                    tuberculum. Thus, the transverse processes of all the dorsal vertebrae of a Bird
                    resemble those of the two anterior dorsals of a Crocodile, and no part of the
                    vertebral column of a Bird presents transverse processes with a step for the
                    head of the rib. like those of the <pb break="no"

                    >Pterosauria.</hi> [The triangular facets for the tubercular processes are
                    scarcely scooped; those for the capitular are neat, round, shallow cups.] The
                    discrimination of the proper lumbar, sacral, and anterior caudal vertebrae, in
                    the ankylosed mass which constitutes the so-called “sacrum” of the Bird, is a
                    matter of considerable difficulty. The general arrangement is as follows :—The
                    most anterior lumbar vertebra has a broad transverse process, which corresponds
                    in form and position with the tubercular transverse process of the last dorsal.
                    In the succeeding lumbar vertebrae the process extends downwards; and in the
                    hindermost [the <hi rend="italic">third]</hi> it is continued from the centrum,
                    as well as from the arch of the vertebra, and forme a broad mass which abuts
                    against the ilium.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>It
                    would be more proper to say that ossification extends into and from the centrum
                    as well as from the neural arch. The process, like other processes, exists
                    before the centrum is differentiated from the arch by ossification
                    (Huxley).</p></note> This process might well be taken for a sacral rib, and ,its
                    vertebra for a proper sacral vertebra. But, in the first place, I find no
                    distinct ossification in it [there are <hi rend="italic">five</hi> of these
                    lumbar vertebra in the Emeu, two more than in the Fowl, and they all have
                    distinct ribs; and the <hi rend="italic">ribless</hi> vertebrae are five in the
                    Fowl and four in the Emeu]; and, secondly, the nerves which issue from the
                    intervertebral foramina in front of and behind the vertebra enter into the
                    lumbar plexus, which gives origin to the crural and obturator nerves, and not
                    into the sacral plexus, which is the product of the nerves which issue from the
                    intervertebral foramina of the proper sacral vertebrae in other <hi
                    rend="italic">Vertebrata.</hi> Behind the last lumbar vertebra follow, at most,
                    five vertebrae which have no ribs; but their arches give off horizontal,
                    lamellar processes, which unite with the ilia. [In the Emeu these <hi
                    rend="italic">four</hi> vertebrae show not the least trace of ribs, and are flat
                    bricks of bone, below, jammed together like the cervical centra of a <hi
                    rend="italic">Cetacean.]</hi> The nerves which issue from the intervertebral
                    foramina of these vertebrae unite to form the sacral plexus, whence the great
                    sciatic nerve is given off; and I [Professor Huxley] take them to be the
                    homologues of the sacral vertebrae of the <hi rend="italic">Reptilia.</hi> The
                    deep fossae between the centra of these vertebrae, their transverse processes,
                    and the ilia, are occupied by the middle lobes of the kidneys. If these be the
                    true sacral vertebrae, it follows that their successors are anterior caudal.
                    They have expanded upper transverse processes, like the proper sacral vertebrae;
                    but, in addition, three or four of the most anterior of these vertebrae possess
                    ribs, which, like the proper sacral ribs of Reptiles, are suturally united, or
                    ankylosed proximally, with both the neural arches and the centra of these
                    vertebrae; while, distally, they expand and abut against the ilium. The
                    ankylosed caudal vertebrae may be distinguished as <hi rend="italic"

                <p>We now give a table showing the number of bones in the so-called sacrum of
                    Birds—so many vertebrae as are covered by the ilia and ankylosed together. Here
                    the distinction between <hi rend="italic">dorsal</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >lumbar</hi> is, that the former p03se33 elongated ribs; and the table will show

                    >shortness,</hi> for a Bird; and also, as in the Fowl, of a medium type. Most of
                    the instances are derived from the sacral bones of young Birds.</p>

                <p>In both the Hoopoe and the Swift the first of these sacrais has an outstanding
                    rib-process. In the Swift the rib on the second of the enclosed dorsals is very
                    long, and its flanking rib nearly reaches the sternum. The next or third
                    vertebra, the lumbar, has <hi rend="italic">below</hi> it, neither reaching to
                    it above, nor by its sternal piece to the sternum below, another rib; it is
                    two-thirds the size of its predecessor, and only occurs on the <hi rend="italic"
                    >right</hi> side. This will show how, by gradations the most gentle, the
                    vertebrae and their ribs are specialized in each particular type, and also how
                    very arbitrary is our nomenclature.</p>
                <p>The Swan has eight free vertebrae behind the <hi rend="italic">uro-sacral,</hi>
                    and as the last of these is in these types composed of ten vertebrae originally,
                    there are primarily twenty-seven vertebrae in the Swan’s tail. The caudal
                    vertebrae which succeed the <hi rend="italic">uro-sacral</hi> may be numerous
                    and all distinct from one another, as in <hi rend="italic">Archaeopteryx,</hi>
                    or few and distinct, as in <hi rend="italic">Rhea;</hi> but more generally, only
                    the anterior caudal vertebrae are distinct and movable, the rest being ankylosed
                    into a ploughshare-shaped bone or <hi rend="italic">pygostyle,</hi> which
                    supports the tail feathers and the uropygial gland, and sometimes, as in the
                    Woodpecker and some other Birds expands below into a broad polygonal disk.</p>
                <p>The centra of the movable presacral vertebrae of Birds are connected together by
                    fibro-cartilaginous rings, which extend from the circumference of one to that of
                    the next. Each ring is continued inwards into a disk, with free anterior and
                    posterior faces—the <hi rend="italic">meniscus.</hi> The meniscus thins towards
                    its centre, which is always perforated. The synovial space between any two
                    centra is, therefore, divided by the meniscus into two very narrow chambers,
                    which communicate by the aperture of the meniscus. Sometimes the meniscus is
                    reduced to a rudiment; while, in other cases, it may be united, more or less
                    extensively, with the faces of the centra of the vertebrae. In the caudal region
                    the union is complete, and the meniscus altogether resembles an ordinary
                    intervertebral cartilage.</p>
                <p>A ligament traverses the centre of the aperture of the meniscus, and in the Duck
                    contains the intervertebral portion of the notochord. As Jäger<note

                <p>The sternum in Birds is a broad plate of cartilage which is always more or less
                    completely replaced in the adult by membrane bone.<note anchored="true"

                    >Carinatoe</hi> it usually begins to ossify by five centres, of which one is
                    median for the keel, and two are in pairs for the lateral parts of the sternum.
                    Thus the sternum of a Chicken is at one time separable into five distinct bones,
                    of which the central keel-bearing ossification (fig. 30) is termed the <hi

                    the ribs, <hi rend="italic">pleurosteon,</hi> and the postero-lateral bifurcated

                <p>[In <hi rend="italic">Tur nix</hi> there are two more centres, mesiad of the

                    rend="italic">Dicholophus</hi> the median part suddenly dilates, behind, into a
                    heart-shaped flap of cartilage, which has an endosteal patch, the <hi

                <p>Though the sternum, in most Birds, seems to differ very much in form from that of
                    the <hi rend="italic">Reptilia,</hi> it is rhomboidal in the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Casuariidoe,</hi> where it differs from the Reptilian sternum chiefly in the
                    greater proportional length of its posterior sides, the absence of median
                    backward prolongations, and the convexity of its ventral surface. But in other
                    birds, and notably in many <hi rend="italic">Carinatae,</hi> the antero-lateral
                    edges, which are grooved to receive the coracoids, form a much more open angle
                    than in the <hi rend="italic">Reptilia,</hi> while the postero-lateral edges
                    become parallel or diverge; and a wide, straight, or convex transverse edge
                    takes the place of the posterior angle. Two, or four, membranous fontanelles may
                    remain in the posterior moiety of the sternum when ossification takes place, and
                    give rise to as many holes, or deep notches, separating slender processes in the
                    dry skeleton. All these correspond with so many divisions of the xiphoid process
                    of the sternum in <hi rend="italic">Mammalia,</hi> and hence are called <hi
                    rend="italic">middle, internal,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">external xiphoid
                    processes.</hi> Sometimes a median process, <hi rend="italic">rostrum</hi> or
                    <hi rend="italic">manubrium</hi> (figs. 30, 31), is developed from the anterior
                    angle of the sternum, and its antero-lateral angles are developed into <hi

                    in the <hi rend="italic">Coracomorphce,</hi> or Passerine Birds.</p>
                <p>The extent to which the keel of the lophosteon is developed in the Carinate birds
                    varies very much. In <hi rend="italic">Strigops</hi> it is rudimentary; in birds
                    of powerful flight, as well as in those which use their wings for swimming, it
                    is exceedingly large.</p>

                    in the anterolateral edge of the sternum. The inner ends of the coracoids often

                    usually completely ossified, and presents no fontanelle. There is no distinct
                    epicoracoid. The two bones take nearly equal shares in the formation of the
                    glenoidal cavity, and usually remain unankylosed and distinct in this
                    region.</p>
                <p>In the <hi rend="italic">Ratitae</hi> the long axis of that part of the scapula
                    which lies near the glenoidal cavity is parallel or coincident with that of the
                    coracoid, and the two bones become completely ankylosed. But in all the <hi
                    rend="italic">Carinatae</hi> the long axis of the scapula forms an acute, or
                    only slightly obtuse angle <hi rend="italic">[Ocydrom/us,</hi><hi rend="italic"

                <p>In the <hi rend="italic">Carinatae</hi> the glenoidal end of the scapula is
                    divided into two portions: a <hi rend="italic">glenoidal</hi> process, which
                    expands to form the upper part of the glenoidal cavity, and to unite with the
                    coracoid; and an <hi rend="italic">acromial</hi> process, which gives attachment
                    to the outer end of the clavicle. The glenoidal end of the coracoid is in like
                    manner divided into two portions: a <hi rend="italic">glenoidal</hi> process,
                    which unites with the scapula, and a <hi rend="italic">clavicular</hi> process,
                    which articulates with the outer surface of the clavicle near its outer end. The
                    clavicular process of the coracoid does not represent the procoracoid of <hi
                    rend="italic">Lacertilia;</hi> rudiments of that bone unite with the clavicle.
                    In the <hi rend="italic">Ratitae</hi> there is no distinct clavicular process;
                    but the anterior part of the coracoid, near the glenoid cavity, may be produced
                    and separated by a notch or fontanelle from the rest, or developed down to the
                    sternum (in <hi rend="italic">Struthio)</hi> as a lacertilian procoracoid. There
                    is no trace of clavicles in <hi rend="italic">Apteryx, Rhea,</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Struthio,</hi> and some Parrots; but in the latter there is
                    generally an ossified, distinct, short procoraoid. In the Emeu and in some <hi

                    remain distinct from one another, or connected only by fibrous tissue; but in
                    the majority of Birds they are very early ankylosed together, and with the

                    relation to the exertion required of the wings in flight or in natation. In the
                    Passerine Birds the scapular end of the clavicle is enlarged by a procoracoid
                    rudiment of cartilage, which ossifies separately, producing the expansion above

                <p>A median process <hi rend="italic">[hypocleιdium)</hi> is frequently developed
                    from the inter-clavicular part of the furculum, and this may be united with the

                <p>The fore-limb of a Bird, when in a state of rest (fig. 33), exhibits a great
                    change of position, if it be compared with that of an ordinary Reptile; and the
                    change is of a character similar to, but in some respects greater, than that
                    which the arm of a man presents when compared with the fore-limb of a
                    quadrupedal Mammal. The humerus lies parallel with the axis of the body, its
                    proper ventral surface looking outwards. The fore-arm is in a position midway
                    between pronation and supination, and the manus is bent back upon the ulnar side
                    of the fore-arm in a position not of flexion but of abduction.</p>
                <p>In ordinary Birds the proximal end of the humerus is expanded, and its articular
                    head transversely elongated. Its ventral face is convex, and provided with a
                    strong preaxial ridge, which gives attachment to the pectoral muscle. The proper
                    dorsal face is concave from side to side, especially towards the postaxial
                    margin, where the pneumatic aperture occurs in those birds which have the
                    humerus hollow. The distal end is expanded, and the articular surface for the
                    radius is a convex facet, directed obliquely inwards on its ventral face. In
                    this respect the Bird’s humerus exaggerates a feature of that of the
                    Lizard’s.</p>
                <p>In the <hi rend="italic">Ratitae</hi> these peculiarities are very feebly, or not
                    at all, marked, the humerus being a slender, cylindrical, slightly-curved bone.
                    In the <hi rend="italic">Casuariidae, Dinornithidae,</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >Apterygidae,</hi> the fore-limb is extraordinarily reduced, and may become

                    becomes flattened from side to side, the proximal end is singularly modified,
                    and at the narrow distal end the articular surface for the radius lies
                    completely in front of, and rather above, that for the ulna.</p>
                <p>The ulna, which often presents a series of tubercles, indicating the attachment
                    of the secondary quill feathers, is usually a stronger and a longer bone than
                    the radius. There are only two carpal bones, one radial and one ulnar. There is
                    one exception to this, namely, in the Screamer <hi rend="italic">(Chauna
                    chavaria),</hi> which has three carpals on the left side, the lower arcuate bone
                    having two representatives.</p>
                <p>In the <hi rend="italic">Apterygidoe</hi> and in the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Casuariidae</hi> there is but one complete digit in the manus. It appears to
                    answer to the second of the pentadactyle limb, and is provided with a claw. In
                    the <hi rend="italic">Struthionidoe</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Rheidoe,</hi> and
                    in all the <hi rend="italic">Carinatae,</hi> there are three digits in the
                    manus, which answer to the pollex and the second and third digits of the
                    pentadactyle fore-limb; and the metacarpal bones of these digits are ankylosed
                    together. As a rule the metacarpal of the pollex is much shorter than the other
                    two; that of the second digit is strong and straight; that of the third is more
                    slender and bowed, so as to leave an interspace between itself and the second,
                    which is often filled up by bony matter. The pollex has two phalanges, and the
                    second of them is, in many birds— <hi rend="italic">Rhea,</hi> the Screamer,
                    &amp;c.—pointed, curved, and ensheathed in a horny claw. The second digit has
                    two and sometimes three phalanges, as in the Swan; and the terminal phalanx is
                    similarly provided with a claw in sundry birds, <hi rend="italic">e.g.,</hi> the
                    Swan and <hi rend="italic">Rhea.</hi> In the Ostrich both the pollex and the
                    second digit are unguiculate. The third digit possesses one phalanx, besides its
                    ankylosed metacarpal, and is always devoid of a claw.</p>
                <p>It is a singular circumstance that the relative proportions of the humerus and
                    the manus should present the most marked contrast in two groups of birds which
                    are alike remarkable for their powers of flight. These are the Swifts and
                    Humming-birds, in which the humerus is short and the manus long, and the
                    Albatrosses, in which the humerus is long and the manus relatively short.</p>
                <p>In the Penguins the pollex has two free phalanges, and its metacarpal bone (which
                    is distinct in the young birds) ankyloses with that of the second digit. The
                    third metacarpal is slender and straight. The bones of the manus are singularly
                    elongated and flattened.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">pelvis</hi> of a Bird (fig. 34) is remarkable for the great
                    elongation, both anteriorly and posteriorly, of the iliac bones (iZ.), which
                    unite with the whole length of the edges of the sacrum, and even extend forwards
                    over the posterior ribs of the dorsal region. Below, each iliac bone forms a
                    wide arch over the acetabulum <hi rend="italic">(am.),</hi> the centre of which
                    is always closed by fibrous tissue, so that in the dry skeleton the bottom of
                    the acetabulum is always perforated by a wide foramen. An articular surface on
                    the ilium, on which the great trochanter of the femur plays, is called the <hi
                    rend="italic">antitrochanter.</hi> In all ordinary birds the ischium <hi
                    rend="italic">(is.),</hi> which broadens towards its hinder end, extends back
                    nearly parallel with the hinder part of the ilium, and is united with it by
                    ossification posteriorly. The ischiosciatic interval is thus converted into a
                    foramen. The pubis <hi rend="italic">(pb.)</hi> enters by its dorsal or
                    acetabular end into the formation of the acetabulum, and then passes backwards
                    and downwards as a comparatively slender, curved bone, nearly parallel with the
                    ischium. It is united with its fellow only by fibrous tissue. Very few birds
                    present any important variation from this structure of the pelvis. In <hi

                    among Birds, do the pubes unite in a median ventral symphysis (see Mivart, <hi

                    the 31st to the 35th vertebrae inclusively (counting from the atlas) develop
                    five lateral tuberosities. The three middle tuberosities are large, and abut
                    against the pubis and the ischium. In these vertebrae, as in the dorsal
                    vertebrae of the <hi rend="italic">Chelonia,</hi> the neural arch of each
                    vertebra shifts forward, so that half its base articulates with the centrum of
                    the next vertebra in front, and the tuberosities in question are outgrowths,
                    partly of the neural arch, and partly of the juxtaposed vertebral centra between
                    which it is wedged. Hence in young Ostriches the face of each tuberosity
                    exhibits a triradiate suture. A small bone is sometimes found on the ventral
                    edge of the pubis, at its middle; this has been supposed to represent a <hi

                <p>The upper articular head of the <hi rend="italic">femur</hi> is rounded, and its

                    The shaft is relatively short and thick, and the two terminal condyles are large
                    and elongated antero-posteriorly. A prominent ridge, which plays between the
                    proximal ends of the tibia and fibula, is apparent upon the posterior and
                    inferior surface of the outer condyle. A similar ridge is faintly developed in
                    some <hi rend="italic">Lacertilia,</hi> and is well marked in the Dinosaurian
                    Reptiles. A patella is usually present, but it is sometimes absent, and may be

                    decidedly shorter than the tibia, but it has the same length as that bone in

                    is a highly characteristic bone. Its proximal end is expanded, and produced

                    is terminated by a well-marked pulley-like articular surface, which is inclined
                    somewhat forwards as well as downwards. Not unfrequently there is an oblique bar
                    of bone on the anterior face, just above the pulley, beneath which the long

                    fourth metatarsals are ankylosed together, and by their proximal ends, with a
                    bone, which is a distinct cartilage in the foetus, and represents the distal
                    division of the tarsus. Thus a <hi rend="italic">tarso-metatarsus</hi> is formed
                    (fig. 37). The distal ends of the metatarsals remain separate, and offer convex
                    articular surfaces to the proximal phalanges of the digits.</p>
                <p>In the Penguins, large apertures lie between the several metatarsals of the adult
                    <hi rend="italic">tarso-metatarsus;</hi> and in other birds more or less
                    considerable passages persist between the middle and lateral metatarsals
                    proximally, and the middle and outer distally. In most birds the middle
                    metatarsal does not remain parallel with the others, but its proximal end
                    inclines a little backward, and its distal end a little forward. Hence the two
                    apertures on each side of its proximal end may lie at the bottom of a fossa, or
                    run into one in front, while they remain distinct behind.</p>
                <p>Again, in most Birds the posterior face of the proximal end of the middle
                    metatarsal, and the adjacent surface of the tarsal bone, grow out into a process
                    which is commonly, but improperly, termed “calcaneal.” The inferior surface of
                    this <hi rend="italic">hypo-tarsus</hi> is sometimes simply flattened, sometimes
                    traversed by grooves or canals for the flexor tendons of the digits.</p>
                <p>When a hallux exists, its metatarsal bone is usually incomplete above, and is
                    united to the ligament by the inner or the posterior surface of the
                    tarso-metatarsus. In the Frigate-bird <hi rend="italic">(Phaethon),</hi> and in
                    <hi rend="italic">Steatornis,</hi> the hallucal metatarsal is remarkably long.
                    The genus <hi rend="italic">Phaethon</hi> stands alone, as far as we know, in
                    having the hallucal metatarsal ankylosed with the others.</p>
                <p>In many of the <hi rend="italic">Alectoromorphoe</hi> a spur <hi rend="italic"
                    >(calcar),</hi> con sisting of a bony core ensheathed in horn, is developed on
                    the inner side of the metatarsus, and becomes ankylosed with the metatarsal of
                    the second digit; in some there are two spurs. In a few birds, similar spurs
                    (Palamedea), or osseous excrescences <hi rend="italic">(Pezophaps),</hi> are
                    developed in relation with the metacarpus.</p>
                <p>The normal number of the pedal phalanges in Birds is (as in ordinary <hi
                    rend="italic">Lacertilia)</hi> two, three, four, five, reckoning from the hallux
                    to the fourth digit. Among the few Birds which constitute exceptions to the rule
                    are the Swifts, in which the third and fourth toe have only three phalanges each
                    (2, 3, 3, 3), and the Goatsuckers, in which the fourth toe only has the number
                    reduced (2, 3, 4, 4)—not 2, 3, 4, 3, as Professor Huxley <hi rend="italic"
                    >(op.</hi> α⅛.)puts it for <hi rend="italic">Caprimulgus.</hi> Mr Parker has
                    figured the fourth toe of the Sand-grouse <hi rend="italic">(Syrrhaρtes')</hi>

                    toe.</p>
                <p>Many Birds have only three toes by suppression of the hallux. In the Ostrich, not
                    only the hallux, but the phalanges of the second digit, are suppressed, and the
                    distal end of the second metatarsal is reduced to a mere <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit03newyrich/page/n741/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0903-0741-0724"/> rudiment. Hence the Ostrich has only two toes
                    (which answer to the third and fourth of the pentadactyle foot), with four
                    phalanges in the inner and five in the outer, though the inner toe is far the
                    longer and the stronger.</p>
                <p>In most four-toed Birds the hallux is turned more or less completely backwards,
                    and the other three digits forwards. But in many <hi rend="italic"
                    >Aetomorphae</hi> (especially the Owls) the outer toe can be turned outwards, or
                    even backwards, at will. And in the Parrots, Toucans, Cuckoos, Woodpeckers, and
                    other so-called “Scansorial” Birds, the outer toe is permanently reversed. Under
                    these circumstances the distal end of the outer metatarsal may be divided into
                    two distinct articular surfaces. In the Trogons there are two toes in front and
                    two behind, as in the Parrots; but it is the second toe which is turned
                    backwards. Lastly, in the Swifts, the <hi rend="italic">Dysporomorphoe,</hi> and
                    the <hi rend="italic">Spheniscomorphce,</hi> the hallux is directed more or less
                    forwards, so that all four toes are turned to the front.</p>
                <p>As a general rule, the osseous tissue of Birds is remarkably dense and hard.
                    Before hatching, the bones are solid and filled with vascular medulla; but after
                    birth, more or fewer of the bones are always excavated by prolongation of
                    cavities containing air, which lie in their neighbourhood. Such air cavities are
                    always found in the skull, in connection with rhe nasal and auditory passages,
                    and they may extend through all parts of the skull, with the exception of the
                    jugal arch, which, however, is pneumatic in the Toucan and Hornbill. In many
                    birds, <hi rend="italic">Apteryx,</hi> Penguin, Divers (and Gulls, according to
                    Professor Huxley; but this is a mistake, their spinal column far into the sacrum
                    is pneumatic; <hi rend="italic">Larus canus</hi> shows this well), and the
                    smaller Song-birds, no other bones than those of the skull are pneumatic; but in
                    most birds the air-sacs of the lungs send prolongations into the bones of the
                    rest of the trunkskeleton, seldom into the caudal vertebrae, as in <hi
                    rend="italic">Bal&lt;εniceps,</hi> the Adjutant, Hornbill, &amp;c. In the
                    Hornbills the whole skeleton is pneumatic; in a large number of birds the
                    humerus alone of the limb-bones contains air; in the diurnal <hi rend="italic"
                    >Raptores,</hi> the femur also. It is proper to remark that the amount of
                    pneumaticity of bones by no means follows the development of the powers of
                    flight. In the Ostrich, for example, the bones are far more extensively
                    pneumatic than in the Gull.</p>
                <p>In some cases, prolongations of the air-sacs extend beneath the integument.</p>
                <p>The Muscles.</p>
                <p>In the space allotted to the writer, there is merely room for justice to be done
                    to one category of organs; and as the skeleton, and especially the skull, is of
                    most direct importance to the zoologist and palaeontologist, and as its form
                    determines, as it were, all other organs, they being correlated with it and
                    answering to it, it seemed to be that on which election should fall for the

                <p>The cutaneous muscles of Birds are well developed, and form broad expansions in
                    various parts of the body. Special bundles of muscular fibres pass to the great

                <p>In Birds, as in Reptiles, the cerebro-spinal axis is angu-lated at the junction
                    of the spinal cord with the medulla oblongata, the latter being bent down

                    and relatively large prosencephalic hemispheres, which attain a considerable
                    size but never conceal the optic lobes. The transverse fissures of the

                <p>Birds possess nasal glands, which attain a large size, and lie more usually upon
                    the frontal bone, or in the orbits, than in the nasal cavity. In the Snakes and
                    Lizards these bones lie between the septo-maxillaries above and the vomers
                    below. In Birds, w <hi rend="superscript"> ι</hi> herever placed, the duct opens
                    near the same region as in the Reptiles. In many kinds, especially Passerines,
                    the bones that should cover them are really present, but are rudimentary and
                    attached to the vomer. These are the septo-maxillaries.</p>
                <p>The eye in many Birds, as in the extinct <hi rend="italic">Lchthyosauria,</hi>
                    attains very great absolute and relative dimensions. Birds possess, like many
                    Reptiles, a nictitating membrane.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    text.</p></note> In the Lizards a short, thick muscle <hi rend="italic"
                    >(bursalis)</hi> is attached to the inner and posterior wall of the orbit, and
                    ends in a fibrous sheath. A tendon, one end of which is attached to the
                    presphenoidal region of the inner wall of the orbit, passes backwards through
                    the sheath, and then forwards, to be attached to the nictitating membrane. When
                    the muscle contracts, it necessarily pulls the latter over the eye. A Harderian
                    gland is always developed, and a lachrymal gland very generally, but not always.
                    In the <hi rend="italic">Chelonia,</hi> muscular fibres (forming the so-called
                    <hi rend="italic">pyramidalis</hi> muscle) arise from the inner side of the
                    eyeball, and, arching over it at the optic nerve, are inserted partly into the
                    outer edge of the nictitating membrane, partly into the lower eyelid. The <hi
                    rend="italic">Crocodilia</hi> have a <hi rend="italic">pyramidalis</hi> muscle
                    taking the same origin and course; but it sends no fibres to the lower eyelid,
                    its tendon being inserted altogether into the nictitating membrane. The third
                    arrangement, which in a manner brings together the first and the second, is that
                    seen in Birds. A <hi rend="italic">pyramidalis</hi> muscle, arising from the
                    inner and under surface of the eyeball, soon ends in a tendon which sweeps round
                    the upper and outer surfaces of the sclerotic to the nictitating membrane, as in
                    the Crocodiles. But there is also a <hi rend="italic">bursalis</hi> muscle,
                    which however arises, not, as in Lizards, from the wall of the orbit, but from
                    the upper surface of the sclerotic itself, whence it passes backwards and ends
                    in a fibrous sheath which encloses the tendon of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >pyramidalis.</hi> The contraction of the muscle necessarily tends to draw the
                    tendon of the <hi rend="italic">pyramidalis</hi> away from the optic nerve. A
                    tubercle is sometimes developed from the sclerotic above the entrance of the
                    optic nerve, and prevents the tendon of the <hi rend="italic">pyramidalis</hi>
                    from shifting forwards and inwards. The eyeball is always turned by four <hi
                    rend="italic">recti</hi> and two <hi rend="italic">obliqui</hi> muscles. The
                    superior oblique does not pass over a pulley. The <hi rend="italic"
                    >Chelonia</hi> and most <hi rend="italic">Lacertilia</hi> have a more or less
                    completely developed retractor or choanoid muscle. A ring formed of bony plates
                    is developed in the fore-part of the sclerotic in <hi rend="italic">Lacertilia,

                    sclerotic is cartilaginous.</p>

                <p>Only <hi rend="italic">Crocodilia</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Aves</hi> possess a

                    rend="italic">Amphisboenoidea</hi> have no tympanic cavity. In some <hi

                    Chameleons, the tympanic membrane is covered by integument, but a tympanic
                    cavity exists. In <hi rend="italic">Lacertilia</hi> the tympanic cavities
                    communicate by wide openings with the pharynx; but in <hi rend="italic"
                    >Chelonia, Crocodilia,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Aves,</hi> the communicating
                    passages, reduced in size, become eustachian tubes. In the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Chelonia</hi> these curve backwards, downwards, and inwards, round the quadrate
                    bones, and open separately on the roof of the mouth. In the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Crocodilia</hi> there are three eustachian tubes—one median, and two lateral.
                    In <hi rend="italic">Aves</hi> there is but one eustachian aperture, answering
                    to the median of the <hi rend="italic">Crocodilia;</hi> and, as in the latter
                    group, each eustachian tube usually traverses the osseous base of the skull to

                <p>The stapes is a columelliform bone, the outer end of which is attached to the
                    tympanic membrane when the latter is developed, but lies among the muscles when
                    there is no tympanic cavity (Snakes and <hi rend="italic">Amphisboenoe).</hi>
                    All <hi rend="italic">Sauropsida</hi> possess a <hi rend="italic">fenestra

                    Three semicircular canals, an anterior and a posterior vertical and an external

                <p>Well-developed sub-lingual, sub-maxillary, and parotid glands appear in Birds,
                    and the sub-lingual glands attain an immense size in the Woodpeckers (Macg., <hi
                    rend="italic">Brit. Birds,</hi> vol. iii. plate 15). The tongue varies greatly,
                    being sometimes obsolete (as in the Crocodile). It is small in the <hi
                    rend="italic">Totipalmatae</hi> and in <hi rend="italic">Baloeniceps.</hi> It is
                    generally sagittiform and papillate at the base; but it is thick, and even
                    emarginate in the <hi rend="italic">Rapaces</hi> (Macg., <hi rend="italic">Brit.
                    Birds,</hi> vol. iii. plates 19, 20). In the <hi rend="italic">Picidoe</hi><hi

                    small and large, and the last always terminates in a cloaca. It is invested by a
                    peritoneal coat, which follows the curvatures of the intestine. In most Birds,
                    as in the Crocodiles, the pyloric and cardiac apertures are approximated. In

                    radiate from a central tendon or aponeurosis.. The thickening of the muscular
                    tissue of the stomach attains its maximum in the Graminivorous Birds; and it is
                    accompanied by the development of the epithelium into a dense and hard coat,
                    adapted for crushing the food of these animals. Birds commonly aid the
                    triturating power of this gastric mill by swallowing stones; but the habit is
                    not confined to them, Crocodiles having been observed to do the same thing.<note

                <p>The Heart.</p>
                <p>In Birds, the venous and arterial blood currents communicate only in the
                    pulmonary and systemic capillaries. The auricular and ventricular septa are
                    complete (see Owen, “Aves,” p. 330), as in the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Crocodilia;</hi> but the right ventricle only gives off the pulmonary artery,
                    the left aortic arch has disappeared, and the right arch (the 4th of that side
                    in the embryo) becomes the most important of all the arches. The septum of the
                    <hi rend="italic">cavum</hi><hi rend="italic">pulmonale</hi> becomes a great
                    muscular fold, and takes· on the function of an auriculo-ventricular valve. At
                    the origin of the pulmonary artery, and at that of the aortic arch, three
                    semilunar valves are developed</p>
                <p>In <hi rend="italic">Aves</hi> there is no renal portal system, and the anterior
                    abdominal vein opens into the inferior vena cava, close to the heart.
                    Nevertheless, a median trunk, which is given off from the caudal vein, carries a
                    considerable proportion of its blood directly into the hepatic portal system.
                    The pericardium of the Bird is thin, but of a firm texture, and adheres by its
                    external surface to the surrounding air-cells. (Owen, “Aves,” p. 330.)</p>

                <p>“In Birds there are distinct thyroid, cricoid, and aιytenoid cartilages, which
                    may be more or less completely ossified. Sometimes an epiglottis is added.<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>For a clear description of

                    before and behind; and alternate ridges allow a marvellous amount of
                    overlapping, the edges being well bevelled; each ring is an ellipse.</p></note>
                    The voice of Birds, however, is not formed, in the larynx, but in the <hi
                    rend="italic">syrinx</hi> or lower larynx, which may be developed in three
                    positions :—1. At the bottom of the trachea, from the trachea alone; 2. At the
                    junction of the trachea and bronchi, ami out of both; 3. In the bronchi alone.
                    The syrinx may be altogether absent, as in the <hi rend="italic">Ratitoe</hi>
                    and the <hi rend="italic">Cathartidoe</hi> or American Vultures. The commonest
                    form of syrinx is the second mentioned above, or the <hi rend="italic"
                    >bronchi-tracheal</hi> syrinx. It is to be met with in all our common Song
                    Birds, but is also completely developed in many Birds, such as the Crows, which
                    have no song. In its commonest condition this form of syrinx presents the
                    following characters: The hindermost rings of the trachea coalesce, and form a
                    peculiarly formed chamber, the <hi rend="italic">tympanum.</hi> Immediately
                    beyond this the bronchi diverge, and from their posterior wall, where one
                    bronchus passes into the other, a vertical fold of the lining membrane rises in
                    the middle line towards the tympanum, ana forms a vertical <hi rend="italic"
                    >septum</hi> between the anterior apertures of the two bronchi. The anterior
                    edge of this septum is a free and thin <hi rend="italic">membrana</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">semilunaris,</hi> but in its interior a cartilaginous or osseous
                    frame is developed, and becomes united with the tympanum. The base of the frame
                    is broad, and sends out two cornua, one along the ventral, and the other along
                    the dorsal edge of the inner wall of the bronchus of its side, which in this
                    part of its extent is membranous and elastic, and receives the name of the <hi
                    rend="italic">membrana</hi><hi rend="italic">tympaniformis interna.</hi></p>
                <p>‘ ‘ The bronchial ‘ rings ’ opposite this are necessarily incomplete internally,
                    and have the form of arches embracing the outer moiety of the bronchus. The
                    second and third of these bronchial arcs are freely movable, and elastic tissue
                    accumulated upon their inner surfaces gives rise to a fold of the mucous
                    membrane, which forms the outer boundary of a cleft, bounded on the inner side
                    by the <hi rend="italic">membrana</hi><hi rend="italic">semilunaris.</hi></p>
                <p>“The air forced through these two clefts from the lungs sets these elastic
                    margins vibrating, and thus gives rise to a musical note, the character of which
                    is chiefly determined by the tension of the elastic margins and the length of
                    the tracheal column of air. The muscles, by the contraction of which these two
                    factors of the voice are modified, are extrinsic and intrinsic. The former are
                    possessed by Birds in general, and are usually two pairs, passing from the
                    trachea to the furcula and to the sternum (Macg., vol. ii. plate 12, fig. 8, <hi
                    rend="italic">d.d., e.e.;</hi> and vol. iii. plate 15, <hi rend="italic">m.m.,

                    muscles. Most others have one pair, attached on one side to the rings of the
                    trachea above, and to the tympanum, or the proximal bronchial arcs below (Macg.,
                    vol. ii. plate 12, figs. 1, 2; and vol. iii. plate 19). The majority of the <hi
                    rend="italic">Coracomorphoe</hi> (Macg., vol. ii. plates 10, 11) have five or
                    six pairs of intrinsic syringeal muscles, which pass from the trachea and its
                    tympanum to the movable bronchial arcs.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    These rings are excessively delicate, so that the part of the trachea is in

                <p>“In <hi rend="italic">Aves</hi> the lungs are firmly fixed on each side of the
                    vertebral column, the dorsal surface of each lung being moulded to the
                    superjacent vertebrae and ribs. The muscular fibres of the diaphragm arise from
                    the ribs outside the margins of the lungs, and form the vertebral column, and
                    end in an aponeurosis upon the ventral surface of the lungs. Each bronchus
                    enters its lung nearer the centre than the anterior edge, and, immediately
                    losing its cartilaginous or bony rings, dilates, and then traverses the lung,
                    gradually narrowing to the posterior edge of that viscus, where it terminates by
                    opening into the posterior air-sac, which generally lies in the abdomen. From
                    the inner side of the bronchus canals are given off, one near its distal end,
                    and others near its entrance into the lung, which pass directly to the ventral
                    surface of the lung, and there open into other air-sacs. Of these there are
                    four. Two, the <hi rend="italic">anterior</hi> and the <hi rend="italic"
                    >posterior thoracic,</hi> lie in the ventral face of the lung in the thorax. The
                    other two are situated in front of its anterior end, and are extra-thoracic. The
                    external and superior is the cervical; the internal and inferior the <hi
                    rend="italic">inter-clavicular</hi> (Macg., vol. ii., p. 17, fig. 107). This
                    last unites into one cavity with its fellow of the opposite lung. Thus there are
                    altogether nine air-sacs; two posterior or abdominal, four thoracic, two
                    cervical, and one inter-clavicular. Other large canals given off from the
                    bronchus do not end in air-sacs, but those which pass from the inner side of the
                    bronchus run along the ventral surface, and those on the outer side along the
                    dorsal surface of the lung. Here they give off at right angles a series of
                    secondary canals, and these similarly emit still smaller tertiary canals, and.
                    thus the whole substance of the lung becomes inter-penetrated by tubuli, the
                    walls of the finest of which are minutely sacculated. The different systems of
                    tubuli are placed in communication by perforations in their walls. In most birds
                    these air-sacs (except the anterior and posterior thoracic, which never
                    communicate with any cavity but that of the lungs) are in communication with a
                    more or less extensively ramified system of air passages, which may extend
                    through a great many of the bones, and even give off subcutaneous sacs. Thus the
                    inter-clavicular air-sac generally sends a prolongation into each axilla, which
                    opens into the proximal end of the humerus, and causes the cavity of that bone
                    to be full of air. When the sternum, the ribs, and the bones of the pectoral
                    girdle are pneumatic, they also receive their air from the inter-clavicular
                    air-sacs. The cervical air-sacs may send prolongations along the vertebral canal
                    of each side; which supply the bodies of the cervical vertebrae, and communicate
                    with elongated air-chambers in the spinal canal itself. When the dorsal
                    vertebrae are pneumatic they communicate with the system of the cervical
                    air-sacs. The abdominal air-sacs send prolongations above the kidneys to the
                    sacral vertebrae and to the femora, whence these bones, when they are pneumatic,
                    receive their air. The pulmonary air-sacs and their prolongations do not
                    communicate with the air cavities of the skull, which receive their air from the
                    tympana and the nasal chambers. In some Birds <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Passerinoe)</hi> the air is conducted from the tympanum to the articular piece
                    of the mandible by a special bony tube, the <hi rend="italic">siphonium</hi>
                    [the largest of the tympanic chain, and having the general anatomical relations

                <p>Renal and Reproductive Organs.</p>
                <p>The kidneys of Birds are composed of a number of lobules of unequal sizes, and
                    these are packed in the concavities of the pelvis, in the same manner as the
                    lungs are packed in the regular intercostal spaces of the upper part of the
                    thorax. The ureters, as in the Reptiles, open directly into the cloaca; but
                    there is no urinary bladder. The <hi rend="italic">bursa</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Fabricii</hi> opens into the cloaca above its hinder part.</p>
                <p>The testes lie on each side the foremost lobes of the kidneys. They are very
                    small in mid-winter, and largest by the middle of April. In the embryo Bird
                    there are two oviducts. “The duct of Müller on the right side (that on the left
                    side with the corresponding ovary generally disappearing) remains in the female
                    as the oviduct. In the male it is almost entirely obliterated on both sides”

                    ossifications, unless the spurs, which are developed upon the legs and wings of
                    some species, may be regarded as such.</p>

                    relation to the barbs as the barbs do to the rachis. The barbules themselves may
                    be laterally serrated and terminated by little hooks, which interlock with the
                    hooks of the opposed barbules. In very many Birds each quill bears two vexilla;
                    the second, called the <hi rend="italic">after-shaft {hypo-rachis),</hi> being
                    attached on the underside of the first close to the superior umbilicus. The
                    after-shaft is generally much smaller than the chief vexillum; but in some
                    Birds, as the <hi rend="italic">Casuariidoe,</hi> the two are of equal size, or
                    nearly so. Muscles pass from the adjacent integuments to the feather sac, and by
                    their contraction erect the feather. The other kinds of feathers differ from the
                    pennae, in having the barbs soft and free from one another, when they constitute
                    <hi rend="italic">pennoplumoe,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">plumuloe</hi> (down),
                    according as the scapus is much or little developed. When the scapus is very
                    long, and the vexillum very small or rudimentary, the feather is termed a <hi
                    rend="italic">filopl·uma.</hi></p>
                <p>The contour feathers are distributed evenly over the body only in a few Birds, as
                    the <hi rend="italic">Ratitae,</hi> the Penguins, and some others. Generally,
                    the pennae are arranged in definitely circumscribed patches or bands, between
                    which the integument is either bare or covered only with down. These series of
                    contour feathers are termed <hi rend="italic">pteryloe,</hi> and their

                <p>The integument of Birds is, for the most part, devoid of glands; but many Birds
                    have a peculiar sebaceous gland developed in the integument which covers the
                    coccyx. This <hi rend="italic">uropygial</hi><hi rend="italic">gland</hi>
                    secretes an oily fluid, which the Bird spreads over its feathers by the
                    operation of “preening.” The excretion passes out by one or two apertures,
                    commonly situated upon an elevation, which may or may not be provided with a
                    special circlet of feathers.</p>
                <p>In various Birds (e.y., the Turkey) the integument about the head and neck
                    develops highly vascular and sometimes erectile processes <hi rend="italic"

                    abstract of most of our present ornithotomical knowledge can be given. A mere
                    list of the published works on the subject would fill most of the space allotted
                    to the writer. We will conclude by giving Professor Huxley’s masterly comparison
                    of the Bird class and that of the Reptiles below with the Mammalia above them
                    (see <hi rend="italic">Proc. Zool. Soc.,</hi> April 11, 1867). The writer has
                    modified some assertions from later papers by the same author :—</p>

                    taxonomy can be, appeal’s to me to be proved by an enumeration of the principal

                <p>Footprints, or casts of footprints, at the time of their discovery and long
                    afterwards supposed to be those of Birds, were found about the year 1835 in the
                    Triassic formation of the valley of the Connecticut in New England, and were
                    described by Messrs Deane and Marsh. Subsequently Professor Hitchcock and Mr
                    Warren contributed to the elucidation of these tracks, which were ascribed to
                    various genera of the Class that received the names of <hi rend="italic"

                    palaeontologists are now inclined to attribute them rather to Dinosaurian

                    some very important parts—such as the head and nearly all the sternal
                    apparatus—it has others in excellent preservation. It was about the size of a

                    with the greater portion of the skeleton, impressions of many of its feathers,
                    particularly the quills, are plainly visible. Its most obvious peculiarity is
                    the presence of a long Lizard-like tail, composed of twenty vertebrae; but from
                    each of these springs a pair of well-developed rectrices. A scarcely less
                    remarkable feature is that afforded by the extremity of the wings, whereitwould
                    appear that there was a free digit answering to the <hi rend="italic"

                    noticed in this treatise, though their value must be fully admitted; but since
                    the appearance of Professor Owen’s description of the specimen <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Phil. Trans.</hi> 1863, p. 33), nobody has hesitated to receive it as a true
                    Bird, though one which exhibits an extraordinary dissimilarity from all other
                    known members of the Class. To make any suggestion as to the more immediate
                    affinities and habits of <hi rend="italic">Archäopteryx</hi> were vain. It at

                    latter respect is, that the form of its feet indicates a bird given to a more or
                    less arboreal life. It is not easy to imagine the use in the bearer’s economy of
                    its singular tail, which one would think must have been a clumsy appendage, and
                    this notion is perhaps justified by the certainty that similar tails had gone
                    out of fashion when the next birds known to have existed flourished.</p>
                <p>These are from the Cretaceous formation, and as in that freshwater-deposits are
                    few in number, it is not surprising that true ornithic remains are in them
                    exceedingly rare. Many fossils that were formerly thought to have been the
                    remains of Birds have since been determined as belonging to Reptiles
                    (Pterodactyls),—among them the <hi rend="italic">Cimoliornis diomedea,</hi> from

                    those of a real Bird, having some resemblance to a Penguin. Belonging to the
                    same epoch also Bird-fossils have been found by Professor Marsh in the United
                    States of America, and they have been referred to at least six genera— <hi

                    these were about as large as a Pigeon, or larger, are from the Cretaceous shale
                    of Kansas, and differ from all known Birds in having biconcave vertebrae and,
                    possibly, teeth, whence the latter has been made the type of a distinct
                    Subclass, to which the name of <hi rend="italic">Odontornithes</hi> is applied.
                    The second belongs to the <hi rend="italic">Steganopodes;</hi> the third seems
                    to have been related to the <hi rend="italic">Colymbidoe.</hi> The affinities of
                    the fifth have not yet been determined; it was nearly as large as a Swan, and
                    its remains were discovered in the Middle Marl of New Jersey. The sixth was
                    apparently one of the <hi rend="italic">Limicoloe;</hi> and the seventh was
                    probably allied to the <hi rend="italic">Rallidoe.</hi></p>
                <p>The Eocene period furnished a still greater number of ornitholites. First,

                    beneath the Plastic Clay of Bas-Meudon. Much difference of opinion obtains as to
                    the affinities of this Bird, which was at least as large as an Ostrich; but Μ.

                <p>The fossils of the Paris Basin and its coeval deposits deserve, however, fuller
                    notice. First brought to light at Montmartre towards the end of the last
                    century, many of the remains fell under the notice of Cuvier, and were by him
                    determined in a manner more or less exact. Following his investigations, the
                    labours of MM. Gervais, Blanchard, and Desnoyers considerably added to our
                    knowledge of these ornitholites, till finally Μ. Alphonse Milne-Edwards, having
                    carefully gone over all the specimens discovered, refers them to the genera <hi

                    the fifth, a Ralline form; and the eighth and ninth, belonging to the diurnal
                    Birds-of-prey and the <hi rend="italic">Gallinoe</hi> respectively. The
                    footprints of at least seven more species of birds have also been recognised in
                    the same beds, so famed for the remains of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Anoplotherium,</hi><hi rend="italic">Paloeotherium,</hi> and their
                    contemporaries, which were resuscitated by the great Cuvier. The marl-beds of
                    Aix in Provence, belonging to this epoch, have yielded fossil eggs and feathers,
                    but as yet no bones of Birds; and to the same period must probably also be
                    assigned the lacustrine calcareous deposits of Armissan, in Languedoc, whence Μ.
                    Gervais has recovered the remains of a <hi rend="italic">Tetrao.</hi> Near Apt,
                    also in Provence, some traces of birds 3eem to have been found, but their bad
                    condition has hindered their determination. In the marls of Ronzon, in Auvergne,
                    several ornitholites have been found by Μ. Aymard, who refers them to the genera
                    <hi rend="italic">Camascelus, Dolichopterus, Elomis</hi> (3 spp.), and <hi
                    rend="italic">Teracus. Of</hi> these the first was declared to be allied to the
                    Plovers <hi rend="italic">{Charadriidce),</hi> the second to the Gulls, the
                    third to the Flamingoes, and the fourth to be a Falconine; but Μ. A.
                    Milne-Edwards considers the first and second to be probably identical. From the
                    same beds Μ. Gervais has eggs and imprints of feathers, as well as a pelvis,
                    referred by him to <hi rend="italic">Mergus,</hi> but regarded by Μ. A.
                    Milne-Edwards as a <hi rend="italic">Sula;</hi> while Dr Fraas has found remains
                    of a Harrier and a Cormorant on the top of the Swabian Alp. Finally, in North
                    America Professor Marsh has described the remains of no less than five species
                    of birds, varying in size from a Flamingo to a small Woodcock, but all referred
                    by him to a genus <hi rend="italic">Alet-omie,</hi> from the Eocene deposits of
                    Wyoming <hi rend="italic">{Am. Joum. Sc.</hi> ser. 3, iv. p. 256).</p>
                <p>The Miocene formation has yielded by far the greatest number of ornitholites,
                    especially in France, and for want of space they can be barely named here. From
                    lacustrine deposits in Bourbonnais and Auvergne, the remains of nearly fifty
                    species of birds have been distinguished. Besides <hi rend="italic"
                    >Paloeortyx,</hi> already mentioned (3 spp.), <hi rend="italic">Palcelodus</hi>
                    (5 spp.), <hi rend="italic">Pelargopsis, Ibidopodia, Elomis, Hydromis,</hi>-and
                    <hi rend="italic">Colymboides</hi> are extinct genera to which these fossils are
                    referred. <hi rend="italic">Palcelodus</hi> is perhaps the most remarkable of
                    them—a generalized form, unquestionably allied to the Flamingoes, but presenting
                    some characters of the <hi rend="italic">Limicolae,</hi> and at least one
                    feature now only found in <hi rend="italic">Podiceps</hi> and <hi rend="italic"

                    while many ornitholites, whether fossil bones, foot-prints, or impressions of
                    feathers, are supplied by freshwater formations near Berne, and in Provence and
                    Languedoc, belonging to this epoch. The bone-beds of Sanson, in Gascony, are

                    of the most characteristic forms of the New World. From the Lower Tertiary of
                    the same continent he has also described a <hi rend="italic">Bubo</hi> and an

                <p>The Pliocene epoch is far less rich than the preceding in ornitholites, and what
                    have been found are less well determined. In France, the existence of a

                    very many ornitholites, while such as are known have been insufficiently
                    studied. A <hi rend="italic">Gallus,</hi> however, seems to have been found at
                    Paris by Μ. Gervais, and other portions of the same bird have been recognized
                    from the caves of Aquitaine by Μ. A. Milne-Edwards. Near Quedlinburg, remains
                    referred to Crows, Sparrows, Swallows, a Bustard, and a Gull, have been
                    recognized, as well as an apparent Vulturine from Magdeburg. Hermann von Meyer
                    has indicated from the valley of the Lahn, Crows, Thrushes, Partridges, and
                    Ducks, as well as a <hi rend="italic">Numida</hi> from Salzbach. A small Owl,
                    too, has been found at Kostritz. In England, remains of a Swan and a Cormorant
                    have occurred in the diluvial beds of Grays in Essex, and an Owl of middle size
                    in the Norwich Crag, which may, however, be of Pliocene age; while in France the
                    celebrated gravels of St Acheul have supplied a bone believed by Μ. A.
                    Milne-Edwards to belong to the Grey Lag-Goose <hi rend="italic">(Anser

                <p>A great number of Birds’ bones have been discovered in caves, and among them some
                    bearing marks of human workmanship. In France we have first a large and extinct
                    species of Crane <hi rend="italic">{Grus</hi><hi rend="italic">primigenia),</hi>
                    but more interesting than that are the very numerous relics of two species, the
                    concomitants even now of the Reindeer, which were abundant in that country at
                    the period when this beast flourished there, and have followed it in its
                    northward retreat. These are the Snowy Owl <hi rend="italic">{Nyctea

                    rend="italic">albus).</hi> But here it seems unnecessary further to
                    particularize the genera, much less the species, hitherto discovered in the
                    caves of Europe generally, though doubtless they deserve far greater attention
                    than they have yet received. One exception, however, must be made in the case of
                    <hi rend="italic">Cygnus falconeri,</hi> a gigantic Swan from the Zebug cavern
                    in Malta <hi rend="italic">{Trans. Zool. Soc.</hi> vi. plate 30). The caves of

                    thirty-four species of Birds, of which the greater part are identical with those
                    now existing in the same country; but some have become extinct, and of these the
                    most notable are a large <hi rend="italic">Crax</hi> and a large <hi

                <p>SUBFOSSIL BIRDS.</p>
                <p>The next ancient Birds’ bones known to us in the northern hemisphere are probably
                    those of the Danish kitchen-middens. These reveal the existence (very likely,
                    the abundance) of two species, long since banished from the spots where their
                    remains are found—the Capercally <hi rend="italic">{Tetrao urogallus),</hi> and
                    the Great Auk or Gare-fowl <hi rend="italic">{Alca impennis).</hi> Just as the
                    <hi rend="italic">Lagopus</hi><hi rend="italic">albus</hi> in the south of
                    France indicates a subarctic or subalpine country with its normal fauna and
                    flora, so does the former of these shew the coexistence with it of pine-forests
                    in Denmark, though on other evidence it is plain that such forests cannot have
                    existed there for many centuries. The latter, of which more must be said
                    hereafter, does not perhaps prove more than that the surrounding seas, though
                    cold, were free from ice in summer time.</p>
                <p>The Birds’ bones hitherto recovered from the ruins of the lake-dwellings in
                    Switzerland are all of species which now occur more or less commonly in the same
                    neighbourhoods, and are therefore of comparatively little interest.</p>
                <p>On the other hand, the Fens of East Anglia have yielded proofs of a form now
                    extinct not only in England, but even in Northern Europe. This is the Pelican,
                    of which two humeri, one from Norfolk and the other most likely from the Isle of
                    Ely, are preserved in the museums of the University of Cambridge. Whether the
                    species be identical with either of those which now inhabit some parts of
                    Southern Europe is undetermined; but it was undoubtedly a true <hi rend="italic"

                <p>At an uncertain but (geologically speaking) recent epoch in Madagascar, there
                    flourished huge birds of Struthious affinities. The first positive evidence of
                    their former existence was made known in 1851 by Μ. Is. Geoffroy St.- Hilaire,
                    who gave the name of <hi rend="italic">Aepyornis</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >maximus</hi> to the species which had laid an enormous egg, sent to Paris a
                    short time before; and the discovery of some bones of corresponding magnitude
                    soon after proved to all but the prejudiced the kinship of the producer of this
                    wonderful specimen, which not unnaturally recalls the mythical Roc that figures
                    so largely in Arabian tales. Three, if not four, well-marked species of this
                    genus have now been characterized from remains found in the drifted sands of the
                    southern part of that island.</p>
                <p>Next we must turn to our antipodes. In New Zealand birds’ bones of gigantic size
                    seem to have been first heard of from native report by Mr W. Cυlenso in 1838,
                    and next year Mr R. Taylor obtained “part of a fossil toe” <hi rend="italic"
                    >{Ann. Nat. Hist.</hi> xiv. p. 82). In the same year, however, and before news
                    of this discovery was published, Mr Rule placed in Professor Owen’s hands the
                    fragment of a bird’s femur, which the latter exhibited and described at a
                    meeting of the Zoological Society, 12th November 1839. Other examples soon came
                    to England, and at a meeting of the same society, 24th January 1843, that
                    learned anatomist applied the name of <hi rend="italic">Dinomis</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">novoe-zealandioe</hi> to the newly-found monster <hi rend="italic"
                    >{Proc. Zool. Soc.</hi> 1843, p. 8). A few months later he was able to pronounce
                    that he had distinguished the remains of five species of the genus <hi
                    rend="italic">{tom. cit.</hi> p. 144); and the memoir subsequently published in
                    the Society’s <hi rend="italic">Transactions</hi> proved to be the first of a
                    series unrivalled in its kind and fortunately still in progress. Bones
                    innumerable have since been obtained, together with portions of the skin,
                    showing the scales of the tarsus and the feathers of the body, to some of which
                    adhered the tendons and bits of dried muscle, stones from the crop, and eggs, a
                    few of the last containing remains of the embryo. At least eleven good species
                    seem to have been discovered; and these, according to one of the latest
                    authorities, Dr Haast <hi rend="italic">{Addr. Phil. Inst. Canterb.</hi> 5th
                    March 1874, p. 6), may be grouped in two families— <hi rend="italic"
                    >Dinomithidoe</hi> proper, having the back-toe obsolete, and comprising the
                    restricted genus <hi rend="italic">Dinomis</hi> (spp. 5) and <hi rend="italic"
                    >Mionomis</hi> (spp. 2); and <hi rend="italic">Palapterygidoe,</hi> possessing a
                    hallux, and including the genera <hi rend="italic">Palapteryx</hi> (spp. 2) and
                    <hi rend="italic">Euryapteryx</hi> (spp. 2). It used to be taken as proved that
                    all these birds flourished within quite recent times, and sanguine naturalists
                    have even hoped that explorations would shew that all of them were not extinct;
                    but, though there is abundant evidence to prove that they were the
                    contemporaries of man in New Zealand, Dr Haast most strongly urges that the race
                    of man who hunted and fed upon the “Moa ”—for such name was applied to its bones
                    by the natives—lived long before the Maori settlement of the islands. Here there
                    is no room for his arguments (<hi rend="italic">Trans. N. Zeal. Inst.),</hi> and
                    prudence will perhaps suggest a suspension of judgment on this point. In the
                    same formation as those which hold the relics of these wonderful birds have been
                    found, but far more seldom, remains of others not less interesting. First there
                    is <hi rend="italic">Harpagomis,</hi> a Bird-of-prey, of stature sufficient to

                    <hi rend="italic">Cereopsis,</hi> with <hi rend="italic">Aptornis</hi> and <hi

                    >Ocydromus,</hi> and the last, which has survived to our own day, though most
                    likely extirpated within the last fifteen years, much resembling <hi

                    No specimen is known to have been brought· to Europe for more than eighty years,
                    and only one is believed to exist—namely, in the museum at Vienna <hi
                    rend="italic">{Ibis,</hi> 1873, p. 44, plate 10). Recent enquiries, made at the
                    present writer’s request, have failed to furnish any result. The bird is
                    doubtless extinct. <hi rend="italic">{Cf.</hi> Rowley, <hi rend="italic"
