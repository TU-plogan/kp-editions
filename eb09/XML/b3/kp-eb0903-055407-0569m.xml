                    country is remarkably level, with numerous deep ravines in the calcareous
                    conglomerate. This substratum when burnt affords good lime, and forms an
                    excellent material for roads in its natural state. The soil is a clayey or a

                    impregnated with soda, nitre, and other salts.</p>

                    town of Benares to the Sikrol cantonment, and thence towards Jaunpur; (3), from
                    Ghazi pur to Mirzapur by Sikrol; and (4), from Benares city to Chanar. The East
                    Indian Bailway passes through the district, and the Ganges is navigable all the
                    year round. Gross revenue in 1870—71, £140,617, of which £89,286, or 63 per
                    cent., was derived from land. In 1872-73 the district contained 542 schools,
                    attended by 12,782 pupils. Only two towns in the district contain above 5000
                    inhabitants, viz., Benares and Ramnagar. The climate of Benares is cool in
                    winter, but very warm in the hot season. Mean temperature in 1872, 77’6° Fahr.;
                    average annual rainfall for the nine years ending 1872, 34 ’ 03 inches.</p>
                <p>From a very remote period Benares formed the seat of a Hindu kingdom, said to
                    have been founded by one Kâsi Râjâ, 1200 years <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi>
                    Subsequently it became part of the kingdom of Kanauj, which in 1193 A.D. was
                    conquered by Muhammad of Ghor. On the downfall of the Pathân dynasty of Dehli,
                    about 1599, it was incorporated with the Mughul empire. On the dismemberment of
                    the Dehli empire it was seized by Safdar Jang, the Nawâb Vazir of Oudh, by whose
                    grandson it was ceded to the East India Company by the treaty of 1775. The
                    subsequent history of Benares contains two important events,—the rebellion of
                    Chait Sinh, occasioned by the unjust demands of Warren Hastings for money to
                    carry on the Marhattâ war; and the mutiny of the Native regiments in 1857, on
                    which occasion the energy and coolness of the European officials (chiefly of
                    General Neill) carried the district successfully through the storm.</p>

                    Provinces, and the headquarters of the commissioner of the division, is situated

                    to the census of 1872, the population amounted to 175,188, viz., 89,763 males,
                    and 85,425 females,—133,549, or 76’23 per cent, being Hindus; 41,374, or 23’77

                <p>The town of Benares—the religious centre of Hinduism —is one of the most ancient
                    cities on the globe. The Rev. Mr Sherring, in his <hi rend="italic">Sacred City
                    of the Hindus</hi> (1868), states—“Twenty-five centuries ago, at the least, it
                    was famous. When Babylon was struggling with Nineveh for supremacy, when Tyre
                    was planting her colonies, when Athens was growing in strength, before Rome had
                    become known, or Greece had contended with Persia, or Cyrus had added lustre to
                    the Persian monarchy, or Nebuchadnezzar had captured Jerusalem and the
                    inhabitants of Judea had been carried into captivity, she had already risen to
                    greatness, if not to glory. Nay, she may have heard of the fame of Solomon, and
                    have sent her ivory, her apes, and her peacocks to adorn his palaces; while
                    partly with her gold he may have overlaid the temple of the Lord.” Hiouen
                    Thsang, the celebrated Chinese pilgrim, visited Benares in the 7th century <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">a.d.,</hi> and described it as containing thirty Buddhist
                    monasteries, with about 3000 monks, and about a hundred temples of Hindu gods.
                    Even after the lapse of so great a time the city is still in its glory, and as
                    seen *rom the river it presents a scene of great picturesqueness and grandeur.
                    The Ganges here forms a fine sweep of about 4 miles in length, the city being
                    situated on the outside of the curve, on the northern bank of the river, which
                    is the most elevated. It is about 3 miles in length, by 1 in breadth, rising
                    from the river in the form of an amphitheatre, and is thickly studded with domes
                    and minarets. The bank of the river is entirely lined with stone, and there are
                    many very fine <hi rend="italic">ghats</hi> or landing-places built by pious
                    devotees, and highly ornamented. These are generally crowded with bathers and
                    worshippers. Shrines and temples line the bank. The internal streets are so
                    winding and narrow that there is not room for a carriage to pass, and it is
                    difficult to penetrate them even on horseback. Their level is considerably lower
                    than the ground-floors of the houses, which have generally arched rows in front,
                    with little shops behind them; and above these they are richly embellished with
                    verandahs, galleries, projecting oriel windows, and very broad overhanging eaves
                    supported by carved brackets. The houses are built of Chanâr stone, and are
                    lofty—none being less than two stories high, most of them three, and several of
                    five or six stories. The Hindus are fond of painting the outside of their houses
                    a deep red colour, and of covering the most conspicuous parts with pictures of
                    flowers, men, women, bulls, elephants, and gods and goddesses in all the
                    multiform shapes known in Hindu mythology. The number of temples is very great;
                    they are mostly small, and are placed in the angles of the streets, under the
                    shadow of the lofty houses. Their forms are not ungraceful, and many of them are
                    covered over with beautiful and elaborate carvings of flowers, animals, and palm
                    branches, rivalling in richness and minuteness the finest specimens of Gothic or
                    of Grecian architecture.</p>
                <p>Benares, having from time immemorial been a holy city, contains a vast number of
                    Brâhmans, who either subsist by charitable contributions, or are supported by
                    endowments in the numerous religious institutions of the city. Hindu religious
                    mendicants, with every conceivable bodily deformity, literally line the
                    principal streets on both sides. Some have their legs or arms distorted by long
                    continuance in one position; others have kept their hands clenched until the
                    finger nails have pierced entirely through their hands. But besides an immense
                    resort to Benares of poor pilgrims from every part of India, as well as from
                    Thibet and Burmah, numbers of rich Hindus, in the decline of life, retire
                    thither to pass the remainder of their days, or temporarily to wash away their
                    sins in the sacred water of the Ganges. These devotees lavish large sums in
                    indiscriminate charity, and it is the hope of sharing in such pious
                    distributions that brings together the concourse of religious mendicants from
                    all quarters of the country.</p>
                <p>Besides its religious interest, Benares is important as a wealthy city and a
                    place of considerable trade; the bâzârs are filled with the richest goods, and
                    there is a constant bustle of business in all the principal streets. A large
                    trade is carried on in the sugar, saltpetre, and indigo which are produced in
                    the district. Silk and shawls are manufactured in the city; and Benares is
                    especially famous for its gold embroidered cloths, called <hi rend="italic"
                    >Kinkdb</hi> (Kincob), and for its gold filagree work. A large quantity of
                    English piece goods here finds a market, being either sold for consumption in
                    the neighbourhood, or sent to other parts of the country. The principal English
                    institution in Benares is the Government or Queen’s College, as it is called,
                    conducted by a staff of professors from England. There are two distinct and
                    separate departmezιts in the college—Sansknt and English. The Sanskrit college
                    was founded by Government in 1791. There are three missions in Benares—the
                    Church of England, the London, and the Baptist Missionary Society. The mission
                    in connection with the Church of England was established in 1817. The mission
                    has a church capable of holding between 300 and 400 persons, two normal schools
                    for training Christian teaehers, a large college, and several girls’ schools.
                    The mission of the London Missionary Society was inaugurated in 1821, and is
                    situated in the suburbs of the city. A substantial church was erected <pb
                    break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit03newyrich/page/n571/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0903-0571-0556"/> about 1846. The mission of the Baptist Missionary
                    Society was founded in 1817, originally as an outpost of the Serampur mission.
                    It maintains an orphanage for the support and education of native children. With
                    regard to the civil station, which is situated a short distance from the town,
                    Mr Sherring says,—</p>
                <p>“The foreign residents of Benares live chiefly at Sikrol, an exten- 've suburb on
                    the north-west side of the city. This station is divided by the Barna River, to
                    the south of which the greater portion of the military cantonments, and
                    buildings connected therewith, are situated, and likewise the English church,
                    Government college, medical hall, the old mint, the residence of the Maharaja of
                    Benares, the missionaries of the Church of England and of the London and the
                    Baptist Societies, the courts of the civil and sessions judge, the deputy-judge,
                    and the judge of small causes. To the north of the river are the houses of the
                    civil officers of Government, the courts of the commissioner of the division,
                    and of the collector and other magistrates of the district; several bungalows
                    inhabited by deposed Rajas and other natives; the Wards’ Institution, for the
                    residence of sons of native noblemen under special charge of Government, and
                    while pursuing their studies at Queen’s College; the beautiful public gardens,
                    supported by subscription; the swimming bath; the jail, in which as many as 1700
                    prisoners are sometimes confined; the lunatic asylum, with 110 patients; the
                    blind and leper asylum, with 130 inmates, founded in 1825 by Raja Kâli Sankàr
                    Glioshâl; and the cemetery. A hospital and four dispensaries are situated in
                    various Sarts of the city, and afford gratuitous relief to numerous patients
                    aily.” ..· -</p>
