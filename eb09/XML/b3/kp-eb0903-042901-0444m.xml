                    command of Charles V., changed it into a regular bastille or fort by the
                    addition of six others of massive structure, the whole united by thick walls and
                    surrounded by a ditch 25 feet wide. Various extensions and alterations were
                    afterwards effected; but the building remained substantially what it was made by
                    the vigorous provost, a strong and gloomy structure, with eight stern towers. As
                    the ancient fortifications of the city were superseded, the use of the word
                    bastille as a general designation gradually died out, and it became restricted
                    to the castle of Saint Antoine, the political importance of which made it
                    practically, long before it was actually, the only bastille of Paris. The
                    building had originally a military purpose, and it appears as a fortress on
                    several occasions in French history. When Charles VII. retook Paris from the
                    English in 1436, all his opponents in the city took refuge in the Bastille,
                    which they were prepared to defend with vigour, but the want of provisions
                    obliged them to capitulate. In 15S8 the duke of Guise took possession of the
                    Bastille, gave the command of it to Bussy-Leclerc, and soon afterwards shut up
                    the whole parliament within its walls, for having refused their adherence to the
                    League. When Henri IV. became master of Paris he committed the command of the
                    Bastille to Sully, and there he deposited his treasures, which at the time of
                    his death amounted to the sum of 1,870,000 livres. On the 11th of January 1649,
                    the Bastille was invested by the forces of the Fronde, and, after a short
                    cannonade, capitulated on the 13th of that month. The garrison consisted of only
                    twenty-two men. The Frondeurs concluded a peace with the court on the 11th of
                    March; but it was stipulated by treaty that they should retain possession of the
                    Bastille, which, in fact, was not restored to the king till the 21st of October
                    1651. In that year took place the famous fight of the Porte St Antoine between
                    Condé and Turenne, on which occasion the forces of Condé owed their safe retreat
                    into Paris to the cannon of the Bastille.</p>
                <p>At a very early period, however, the Bastille was employed for the custody of
                    state prisoners, and it was ultimately much more of a prison than a fortress.
                    According to the usual account, which one is tempted to ascribe to the popular
                    love of poetical justice, the first who was incarcerated within its walls was
                    the builder himself, Hugues Aubriot. Be this at it may, the duke of Nemours
                    spent thirteen years there in one of those iron cages which Louis XI. called his
                    <hi rend="italic">fillettes</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> and Jacques d’
                    Armagnac, Poyet, and Chabot were successively prisoners. It was not till the
                    reign of Louis XIII. that it became recognized as a regular place of
                    confinement; but from that time till its destruction it was frequently filled to
                    embarrassment with men and women of every age and condition.</p>
                <p>Of the treatment of prisoners in the Bastille very various accounts have been
                    given even by those who speak from personal experience, for the simple reason
                    that it varied greatly in different cases. The prisoners were divided into two
                    main classes, those who were detained on grounds of precaution or by way of
                    admonitory correction, and those who lay under presumption or proof of guilt.
                    The former were subject to no investigation or judgment, and the length of their
                    imprisonment depended on the will of the king; the latter were brought to trial
                    in the ordinary courts or before special tribunals, such as that of the
                    Arsénal,—though even in their case the interval between their arrest and their
                    trial was determined solely by the royal decree, and it was quite possible for a
                    man to grow old in the prison without having the opportunity of having his fate
                    decided. Until guilt was established, the prisoner was registered in the king’s
                    name, and—except in the case of state prisoners of importance, who were kept
                    with greater strictness and often in absolute isolation—he enjoyed a certain
                    degree of comfort and freedom. Visitors were admitted under restrictions; games
                    were allowed; and, for a long time, at least, exercise was permitted in open
                    parts of the interior. Food was both abundant and good, at least for the better
                    class of prisoners; and instances were not unknown of people living below their
                    allowance and, by arrangement with the governor, saving the surplus. When the
                    criminality of the prisoner was established, his name was transferred to the
                    register of the “commission,” and he became exposed to numerous hardships and
                    even barbarities, which, however, belonged not so much to the special
                    organization of the Bastille as to the general system of criminal justice then
                    in force.</p>
                <p>Among the more distinguished personages who were confined in this fortress during
                    the reigns of Louis XIV., XV., and XVI., were the famous <hi rend="italic">Man
                    of the Iron Mask,</hi> Fouquet, the Marshal Richelieu, Le Maistre de Sacy, De
                    Renneville, Voltaire, De Latude, Le Prévost de Beaumont, Labourdonnais, Lally,
                    Cardinal Rohan, Linguet, and La Chalotais. While no detestation is too great for
                    that system of “royal pantheism” which led to the unjust and often protracted
                    imprisonment of even men of great ability and stainless character, it is
                    unnecessary to give implicit credence to all the tales of horror which found
                    currency during the excitement of the Revolution, and which historical evidence,
                    as well as <hi rend="italic">a priori</hi> considerations, tends to strip of
                    their more dreadful features, and even in many cases to refute altogether.
                    Within the last twenty or thirty years much light of an unexpected kind has been
                    shed on the history of the Bastille from the pages of its own records. These
                    documents had been flung out into the courts of the building by the
                    Revolutionary captors, and after suffering grievous diminution and damage were
                    finally stored up and forgotten in the vaults of the library of the (so-called)
                    Arsénal. Here they were discovered in 1840 by François Ravaisson, who has since
                    devoted himself, with rare patience, learning, and ability, to their
                    arrangement, elucidation, and publication. Of the extent and value of his
                    investigations some idea may be formed from the fact that the six volumes
                    published cover only the interesting period from 1659 to 1681.</p>
                <p>At the breaking out of the Revolution the Bastille was attacked by the Parisians;
                    and, after a vigorous resistance, it was taken and razed to the ground on the
                    14th July 1789. At the time of its capture only seven prisoners were found in
                    it. A very striking account of the siege will be found in Carlyle’s <hi
                    rend="italic">French Revolution,</hi> vol. i. The site of the building is now
                    marked by a lofty column of bronze, dedicated to the memory of the patriots of
                    July 1789 and 1830. It is crowned by a gilded figure of Mercury spreading his
                    pinions in the act of flight.</p>
