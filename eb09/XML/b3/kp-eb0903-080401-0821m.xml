                    design, which his father appears to have had sufficient intelligence to
                    recognize and assist by every means in his power. At the age of ten the boy was
                    sent to a drawing school kept by Mr Pars·</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit03newyrich/page/n822/mode/1up"

                <p>in the Strand, and at the same time he was already cultivating his own taste by
                    constant attendance at the different art sale rooms, where he was known as the
                    “little connoisseur.” Here he began to collect prints after Michel Angelo, and
                    Raphael, Durer, and Hemskerk, while at the school in the Strand he had the
                    opportunity of drawing from the antique. After four years of this preliminary
                    instruction Blake entered upon another branch of art study. In 1777 he was
                    apprenticed to James Basire, an engraver of repute, and with him he remained
                    seven years. His apprenticeship had an important bearing on Blake’s artistic
                    education, and marks the department of art in which he was made technically
                    proficient. In 1778, at the end of his apprenticeship, he proceeded to the
                    school of the Royal Academy, where he continued his early study from the
                    antique, and had for the first time an opportunity of drawing from the living
                    model.</p>
                <p>This is in brief all that is known of Blake’s artistic education. That he ever,
                    at the academy or elsewhere, systematically studied painting we do not know; but
                    that he had already begun the practice of water colour for himself is
                    ascertained. So far, however, the course of his training in art schools, and
                    under Basire, was calculated to render him proficient only as a draughtsman and
                    an engraver. He had learned how to draw, and he had mastered besides the
                    practical difficulties of engraving, and with these qualifications he entered
                    upon his career. In 1780 he exhibited a picture in the Royal Academy Exhibition,
                    conjectured to have been executed in water colours, and he continued to
                    contribute to the annual exhibitions up to the year 1808. In 1782 he married
                    Catherine Boucher, the daughter of a market-gardener at Battersea, with whom he
                    lived always on affectionate terms, and the young couple after their marriage
                    established themselves in Green Street, Leicester Fields. Blake had already
                    become acquainted with some of the rising artists of his time, amongst them
                    Stothard, Flaxman, and Fuseli, β,nd he now began to see something of literary
                    society. At the house of the Rev. Henry Mathew, in Rathbone Place, he used to
                    recite and sometimes to sing poems of his own composition, and it was through
                    the influence of this gentleman, combined with that of Flaxman, that Blake’s
                    first volume of poetry was printed and published in 1783. From this time forward
                    the artist came before the world in a double capacity. By education as well as
                    native talent, he was pledged to the life of a painter, and these <hi
                    rend="italic">Poetical Sketches,</hi> though they are often no more than the
                    utterances of a boy, are no less decisive in marking Blake as a future poet.</p>
                <p>For a while the two gifts are exhibited in association. To the close of his life
                    Blake continued to print and publish, after a manner of his own, the inventions
                    of his verse illustrated by original designs, but there is a certain period in
                    his career when the union of the two gifts is peculiarly close, and when their
                    service to one another is unquestionable. In 1784 Blake, moving from Green
                    Street, set up in company with a fellow-pupil, Parker, as print-seller and
                    engraver next to his father’s house in Broad Street, Golden Square, but in 1787
                    this partnership was severed, and he established an independent business in
                    Poland Street. It was from this house, and in 1787, that the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Songs of Innocence yfoxQ</hi> published, a work that must always be remarkable
                    for beauty both of verse and of design, as well as for the singular method by
                    which the two were combined and expressed by the artist. Blake became in fact
                    his own printer and publisher. He engraved upon copper, by a process devised by
                    himself, both the text of his poems and the surrounding decorative design, and
                    to the pages printed from the copper plates an appropriate colouring was
                    afterwards added by hand. The poetic eenius already discernible in the first
                    volume of <hi rend="italic">Poetical Sketches</hi> is here more decisively
                    expressed, and some of the songs in this volume deserve to take rank with the
                    best things of their kind in our literature. In an age of enfeebled poetic
                    style, when Wordsworth, with more weighty apparatus, had as yet scarcely begun
                    his reform of English versification, Blake, unaided by any contemporary
                    influence, produced a work of fresh and living beauty; and if the <hi
                    rend="italic">Songs of Innocence</hi> established Blake’s claim to the title of
                    poet, the setting in which they were given to the world proved that he was also
                    something more. For the full development of his artistic powers we have to wait
                    till a later date, but here at least he exhibits a just and original
                    understanding of the sources of decorative beauty. Each page of these poems is a
                    study of design, full of invention, and often wrought with the utmost delicacy
                    of workmanship. The artist retained to the end this feeling for decorative
                    effect; but as time went on, he considerably enlarged the imaginative scope of
                    his work, and decoration then became the condition rather than the aim of his
                    labour.</p>
                <p>Notwithstanding the distinct and precious qualities of this volume, it attracted
                    but slight attention, a fact perhaps not very wonderful, when the system of
                    publication is taken into account. Blake, however, proceeded with other work of
                    the same kind. The same year he published <hi rend="italic">The Book of
                    Thel,</hi> more decidedly mystic in its poetry, but scarcely less beautiful as a
                    piece of illumination; <hi rend="italic">The Marriage of Heaven and Hell</hi>
                    followed in 1790; and in</p>
                <p>1793 there are added <hi rend="italic">The Gates of Paradise, The Vision of the
                    Daughters of A lbion,</hi> and some other “Prophetic Books,” It becomes
                    abundantly clear on reaching this point in his career, that Blake’s utterances
                    cannot be judged by ordinary rules. The <hi rend="italic">Songs of
                    Experience,</hi> put forth in</p>
                <p>1794 as a companion to the earlier <hi rend="italic">Songs of Innocence,</hi> are
                    for the most part intelligible and coherent, but in these intervening works of
                    prophecy, as they were called by the author, we get the first public expression
                    of that phase of his character and of his genius upon which a charge of insanity
                    has been founded. The question whether Blake was or was not mad seems likely to
                    remain in dispute, but there can be no doubt whatever that he was at different
                    periods of his life under the influence of illusions for which there are no
                    outward facts to account, and that much of what he wrote is so far wanting in
                    the quality of sanity as to be without a logical coherence. On the other hand,
                    it is equally clear that no madness imputed to Blake could equal that which
                    would be involved in the rejection of his work on this ground. The greatness of
                    Blake’s mind is even better established than its frailty, and in considering the
                    work that he has left we must remember that it is by the sublimity of his
                    genius, and not by any mental defect, that he is most clearly distinguished from
                    his fellows. With the publication of the <hi rend="italic">Songs of
                    Experience</hi> Blake’s poetic career, so far at least as ordinary readers are
                    concerned, may be said to close. A writer of prophecy he continued for many
                    years, but the work by which he is best known in poetry are those earlier and
                    simpler efforts, supplemented by a few pieces taken from various sources, some
                    of which were of later production. The body of Blake’s intelligible verse is now
                    made accessible to the public, in Mr W. Rossetti’s edition of his works,
                    published in the Aldine series, and to this volume those readers may be referred
                    who desire to know the foundation upon which the poet’s fame has been built. But
                    although Blake the poet ceases in a general sense at this date, Blake the artist
                    is only just entering upon his career. In the <hi rend="italic">Songs of
                    Innocence</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Experience,</hi> and even in some of the
                    earlier <hi rend="italic">Books of Prophecy,</hi> the two gifts worked together
                    in perfect balance and harmony; but at this point the supremacy of the artistic
                    faculty <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit03newyrich/page/n823/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0903-0823-0806"/> asserts itself, and for the remainder of his life
                    Blake was pre-eminently a designer and engraver. The labour of poetical
                    composition continues, but the product passes beyond the range of general
                    comprehension; while, with apparent inconsistency, the work of the artist gains
                    steadily in strength and coherence, and never to the last loses its hold upon
                    the understanding. It may almost be said without exaggeration that his earliest
                    poetic work, <hi rend="italic">The Songs of Innocence,</hi> and nearly his
                    latest effort in design, the illustrations to the <hi rend="italic">The Book of
                    Job,</hi> take rank among the sanest and most admirable products of his genius.
                    Nor is the fact, astonishing enough at first sight, quite beyond a possible
                    explanation. As Blake advanced in his poetic career, he was gradually hindered
                    and finally overpowered by a tendency that was most serviceable to him in
                    design. His inclination to substitute a symbol for a conception, to make an
                    image do duty for an idea, became an insuperable obstacle to literary success.
                    He endeavoured constantly to treat the intellectual material of verse as if it
                    could be moulded into sensuous form, with the inevitable result that as the
                    ideas to be expressed advanced in complexity and depth of meaning, his poetic
                    gifts became gradually more inadequate to the task of interpretation. The
                    earlier poems dealing with simpler themes, and put forward at a time when the
                    bent of the artist’s mind was not strictly determined, do not suffer from this
                    difficulty; the symbolism then only enriches an idea of no intellectual
                    intricacy; but when Blake began to concern himself with profounder problems the
                    want of a more logical understanding of language made itself strikingly
                    apparent. If his ways of thought and modes of workmanship had not been developed
                    with an intensity almost morbid, he would probably have been able to distinguish
                    and keep separate the double functions of art and literature As it is, however,
                    he remains as an extreme illustration of the ascendency of the artistic faculty.
                    For this tendency to translate ideas into image, and to find for every thought,
                    however simple or sublime, a precise and sensuous form, is of the essence of
                    pure artistic invention. If this be accepted as the dominant bent of Blake’s
                    genius, it is not so wonderful that his work in art should have strengthened in
                    proportion as his poetic powers waned; but whether the explanation satisfies all
                    the requirements of the case or not, the fact remains, and cannot be overlooked
                    by any student of Blake’s career.</p>
                <p>In 1796 Blake was actively employed in the work of illustration. Edwards, a
                    bookseller of New Bond Street, projected a new edition of Young’s <hi
                    rend="italic">Night Thoughts,</hi> and Blake was chosen to illustrate the work.
                    It was to have been issued in parts, but for some reason not very clear the
                    enterprise failed, and only a first part, including forty-three designs, was
                    given to the world. These designs were engraved by Blake himself, and they are
                    interesting not only for their own merit but for the peculiar system by which
                    the illustration has been associated with the text. Quite recently it has been
                    discovered that the artist had executed original designs in water colour for the
                    whole series, and these drawings, 537 in number, form one of the most
                    interesting records of Blake’s genius. Mr Gilchrist, the painter’s careful and
                    sympathetic biographer, in commenting upon the engraved plates, regrets the
                    absence of colour, “the use of which Blake so well understood, to relieve his
                    simple design and give it significance,” and an examination of the original
                    water colour drawings fully supports the justice of his criticism. Soon after
                    the publication of this work Blake was introduced by Flaxman to the poet Hayley,
                    and in the year 1801 he accepted the suggestion of the latter, that he should
                    take up his residence at Felpham in Sussex. The mild and amiable poet had
                    planned to write a life of Cowper, and for the illustration of this and other
                    works he sought Blake’s help and companionship. The residence at Felpham
                    continued for three years, partly pleasant and partly irksome to Blake, but
                    apparently not very profitable to the progress of his art. One of the annoyances
                    of his stay was a malicious prosecution for treason set on foot by a common
                    soldier whom Blake had summarily ejected from his garden; but a more serious
                    drawback was the increasing irritation which the painter seems to have
                    experienced from association with Hayley. In 1804 Blake returned to London, to
                    take up his residence in South Moulton Street, and as the fruit of his residence
                    in Felpham, he published, in the manner already described, the prophetic books
                    called the <hi rend="italic">Jerusalem, The Emanation of the Giant Albion,</hi>
                    and <hi rend="italic">Milton.</hi> The first of these is a very notable
                    performance in regard to artistic invention. Many of the designs stand out from
                    the text in complete independence, and are now and then of the very finest
                    quality.</p>
                <p>In the years 1804-1805 Blake executed a series of designs in illustration of
                    Blair’s <hi rend="italic">Grave,</hi> of much beauty and grandeur, though
                    showing stronger traces of imitation of Italian art than any earlier production.
                    These designs were purchased from the artist by an adventurous and unscrupulous
                    publisher, Cromek, for the paltry sum of £21, and afterwards published in a
                    series of engravings by Schiavonetti. Despite the ill treatment Blake received
                    in the matter, and the other evils, including a quarrel with his friend Stothard
                    as to priority of invention of a design illustrating the Canterbury Pilgrims,
                    which his association with Cromek involved, the book gained for him a larger
                    amount of popularity than he at any other time secured. Stothard’s picture of
                    the Canterbury Pilgrims was exhibited in 1807, and in 1809 Blake, in emulation
                    of his rival’s success, having himself painted in water colour a picture of the
                    same subject, opened an exhibition, and drew up a <hi rend="italic">Descriptive
                    Catalogue,</hi> curious and interesting, and containing a very valuable
                    criticism of Chaucer.</p>
                <p>The remainder of the artist’s life is not outwardly eventful. In 1813 he formed,
                    through the introduction of George Cumberland of Bristol, a valuable friendship
                    with Mr John Linnell and other rising water colour painters. Amongst the group
                    Blake seems to have found special sympathy in the society of Varley, who,
                    himself addicted to astrology, encouraged Blake to cultivate his gift of
                    inspired vision; and it is probably to this influence that we are indebted for
                    several curious drawings made from visions, especially the celebrated “ghost of
                    a flea” and the very humorous portrait of the builder of the Pyramids. In 1821
                    Blake removed to Fountain Court, in the Strand, where he died 1827. The chief
                    work of these last years was the splendid series of engraved designs in
                    illustration of the book of Job. Here we find the highest imaginative qualities
                    of Blake’s art united to the technical means of expression which he best
                    understood. Both the invention and the engraving are in all ways remarkable, and
                    the series may fairly be cited in support of a very high estimate of his genius.
                    None of his works are without the trace of that peculiar artistic instinct and
                    power which seizes the pictorial element of ideas, simple or sublime, and
                    translates them into the appropriate language of sense; but here the double
                    faculty finds the happiest exercise. The grandeur of the theme is duly reflected
                    in the simple and sublime images of the artist’s design, and in the presence of
                    these plates we are made to feel the power of the artist over the expressional
                    resources of human form, as well as his sympathy with the imaginative
                    significance of his subject.</p>
                <p>A life of Blake, with selections from his works by Alexander Gilchrist, was
