                    delivering battle are at root in all ages the same. It is no doubt true that, in
                    the circumstances under which battles are fought, there is nothing invariable;
                    on the contrary, it is scarcely possible to suppose two cases alike in every
                    particular, or even resembling each other in all their leading features. From
                    the very nature of things, the minor data of the problem are variable; but the
                    grand principles—those which depend on moral elements—continue immutably the
                    same. On the other hand, the material elements which enter into the calculations
                    of a general are constantly changing; and it is this circumstance which affords
                    scope for the exercise of his genius, his sagacity, and his military science.
                    But it would be manifestly absurd to maintain that, because the lesser
                    conditions are so frequently altered, the great principles of the art are
                    changed with them. The issue of battle is indeed always uncertain,—because the
                    calculations of the general may be defective, his combinations unscientific, his
                    foresight limited, or his temperament rash and impetuous; and because, even
                    where none of these causes of failure exist, events which no human sagacity
                    could have divined or provided against may occur to defeat the wisest plans. But
                    all this implies that if every contingency could have been foreseen and properly
                    met, the result would not have been doubtful, and that the grand chances are
                    always on the side of him who, being provided with sufficient means for his end,
                    forms his plan with the greatest sagacity, and executes it with corresponding
                    vigour and ability. For, variable as the results of battles appear, decisive
                    success has in all ages followed the combinations of great commanders; and
                    victory in the long-run has seldom failed to pay homage to science. And this is
                    because those principles which science has established as universally applicable
                    depend on certain fixed laws in <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0903-0459-0444"/> human nature, which ages have not changed since
                    history was first written. That undisciplined forces, for example, are easily
                    shaken by panic arising out of any such sudden disaster as the fall of their
                    general, was as true in the day when Ahab, for this reason, disguised himself at
                    Ramoth-Gilead as it is now. That infantry, thoroughly broken up and exposed on
                    open ground, may be taken or destroyed by a very inferior number of cavalry, was
                    illustrated no less by Hannibal at Cannae than by Murat’s charge round the
                    allied right at Dresden. The feeling that there was no safe retreat open in case
                    of disaster w as as fatal to the Persians at Marathon as to the French at
                    Leipsic. The crushing effect of heavy columns pressing against a line (which, as
                    only the outer part of the column can act, is purely moral) was quite as
                    conspicuous in the victory of Epaminondas at Mantinea as when Napoleoncut his
                    enemy's centre through at Austerlitz. Above all, military history, from the
                    earliest times, proves two facts of prime importance to commanders in every
                    action: the one, that the best troops become unsteady when their flank is
                    gained, just as a single man in a struggle desires to face fairly the adversary
                    about to rush on him; the other, that a comparatively small body coming fresh
                    into action with troops exhausted by the exertions and nervous tension of a
                    battle, has an advantage over much larger numbers. And being thus fixed, these
                    principles obviously yield certain general rules, to which every prudent
                    commander of any age strives to conform. Circumstances may lead him to violate
                    them, but the examples of Leipsic and Waterloo are there to prove that, even
                    with the greatest of generals, the result may be ruinous. In the first case, the
                    French were forced to fight with their backs to a river; in the second, by a
                    combination they were not prepared for their flank was struck by the Prussians
                    when they were fully engaged with Wellington in front; and total defeat ensued
                    in both.</p>
                <p>A battle is not only the most imposing, but also the most important event in war.
                    It is the consummation to which all previous combinations necessarily tend; it
                    is that grand act which may decide the fate of empires as w ell as armies. The
                    highest and dearest interests of nations, nay, even of humanity itself, may be
                    involved in its issue. It cannot, therefore, be uninstructive to look briefly at
                    the theory of those received principles by the skilful application of which the
                    fate of battles has in all ages been determined.</p>
                <p>All the methods in which a battle can be fought may be reduced to three for
                    abstract purposes, each governed by a distinct principle The first, the purely
                    defensive, consists in waiting for the enemy, in a position chosen for the
                    purpose, the object being simply that of maintaining it successfully against
                    him. Theorists almost universally condemn this, and that with good apparent
                    reason; for there is something peculiarly trying to the moral endurance of even
                    the best troops in feeling that they are pinned to one spot to await the
                    assaults of the enemy without any prospect of retaliation. But the rule is not
                    without exceptions, as is plainly proved by comparing the two great examples of
                    purely defensive actions fought during the campaigns of 1862—63 in
                    America,—Fredericksburg and Gettysburg. The defender in each case was perfectly
                    successful, beating off his assailant with tremendous loss; but the results were
                    very opposite. Lee’s victory at Fredericksburg stopped, indeed, the advance upon
                    Richmond for the time, but did not seriously affect the course of the war.
                    Meade, on the other hand, by beating the Confederates off at Gettysburg,
                    completely turned the tide of the campaign, and compelled Lee to abandon all
                    idea of invading the North and commence a difficult retreat to Virginia; while
                    thenceforth Washington was saved from all danger of being separated from the
                    states that supported the union. This was because the position maintained at
                    Fredericksburg was no more than one point on a single line of advance direct
                    upon Richmond, whereas that of Gettysburg was so completely the key to the whole
                    of the campaign of Maryland, that, whilst it was held by Meade, it was
                    impossible for Lee to advance beyond it or any part of the northeastern states.
                    The failure to carry it therefore paralyzed the whole scheme of the Confederates
                    for transferring the burden of the struggle to hostile soil. And from a
                    comparison of the varying consequences of these actions, so similar in their
                    course, it will be seen that the defensive battle is justified only when the
                    position to be maintained is one of vital consequence for the enemy to seize in
                    order to carry on further operations with success. Lee has been fairly condemned
                    by even friendly critics for not turning his defensive attitude at
                    Fredericksburg into an offensive on the repulse of the enemy’s attack. No one
                    blames Meade for the like conduct at Gettysburg, because his holding his ground
                    fully accomplished all that it was necessary for him to do. But such an instance
                    as this last, it should be added, can but rarely occur.</p>
                <p>The second system is the entirely - offensive,—in plain words, the attacking the
                    enemy wherever found, with all force available. As it carries with it the moral
                    power w hich in all ages is found to accompany, until some decided check occur,
                    bodies of disciplined men moving freely forward to the assault, and as it gives
                    the leader the power of choosing the Λveaker points of his adversary’s line on
                    which to concentrate his blows, so it has ever been the favourite with bold and
                    skilful generals leading good troops. Frederick and Napoleon alike preferred it,
                    and won some of their chiefest victories by using it freely. Wellington employed
                    it with marked success in the latest phases of the Peninsular War in 1813-14.
                    Grant adopted it avowedly in his great struggle with Lee in Virginia in 1864.
                    And the Prussians fought on this principle throughout the two great wars of 1866
                    and 1870-71. History, however, shows that it is only fully justified when the
                    attacking general has a force decidedly superior either in numbers or in moral
                    power; or when, as in the famous case of Frederick at Leuthen,he possesses such
                    extraordinary skill in manoeuvring as to give him all the advantages of long
                    odds, although engaged against superior numbers. It has the serious defect that
                    if the defence prove more successful than was expected, the assailant may have
                    to bring up successively and exhaust all his forces, and thus leave himself
                    without any reserve to meet a sudden onset from the opposite side. In such case
                    defeat probably entails the complete wreck of the hitherto offensive army, and
                    with it possibly the loss of the campaign.</p>
                <p>It is for this reason that prudent commanders are wont, where the choice lies
                    with them, to select the third mode, the defensive-offensive, or a combination
                    of the two preceding. This consists in taking up a position with the design of
                    awaiting the adversary’s attack on it, but also of watching the opportunity
                    afforded by the exhaustion of his army in its assaults, or by his extending it
                    too widely in choosing the best points from which to make them, in order to pass
                    suddenly to the offensive. Wellington is justly famous for the success with
                    which he employed this form of action. But it is one of the highest tests of
                    generalship to know exactly when most fitly to use either. And as Napoleon won
                    three at least of his most striking victories, —Marengo, Austerlitz, and
                    Dresden,—by passing at the right moment suddenly from an apparently passive
                    attitude of defence to a vigorous offensive, so Wellington, after all the world
                    had come to regard him as great only on the defensive, used the strictly
                    offensive form, with the like success, at Vitoria, Orthez, and Toulouse, the
                    last of these three actions being one of such apparent temerity as can hardly be
                    paralleled in modern history, and yet perfectly <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit03newyrich/page/n460/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0903-0460-0445"/> justified by his instinctive knowledge of the
                    demoralized state of the enemy whose position he undertook to force.
                    Marlborough, who as a fighter of great battles has never been surpassed, and
                    who, like Wellington, led a mixed army of English and allies, appears to have
                    always had a decided preference for the offensive;—so little does nationality
                    supply any just rule for selecting either. Marlborough's choice, in all
                    probability, was adopted from the comparatively passive attitude of his various
                    adversaries at Blenheim, Bamillies, and Malplaquet, which tempted a bold
                    offensive on his part. Lee, though certainly addicted to the strictly defensive,
                    which was suited to his inferiority of numbers and to the strong nature of the
                    ground he usually occupied, had the true instinct (as was especially shown in
                    his great victory at Chancellorsville) of seizing any special opportunity
                    offered by the carelessness of an adversary who brought against him apparently
                    overwhelming forces. And in the late war, although the German generals elsewhere
                    continually took that bold offensive which was justified at first by superior
                    numbers, and later by the increasingly high spirits of their troops, yet in the
                    most important and bloodiest action of the whole. Mars-la-Tour, they were
                    content, after it had been well begun by their own attack, to pass to the
                    completely defensive,—it being evident that by merely maintaining the position
                    they had taken up across the French line of retreat from Metz, all the immediate
                    advantage possible from victory would be won.</p>
                <p>On the whole, therefore, it may be affirmed that no theory is sound which
                    prescribes or forbids the use of any of the three methods, or lays down strict
                    rules for the application of any of them. Defence is, however, the natural
                    attitude of the weaker party, as Clausewitz, the greatest of all theoretical
                    writers on war, has carefully pointed out Under what conditions it is to be
                    accepted, or how long adhered to when once assumed, are problems which it
                    requires true genius to grapple with successfully; for they can only be solved
                    rightly according to the circumstances of the hour, perhaps of the moment. To
                    see a crucial instance illustrated by a failure, we may look at Gravelotte.
                    There Bazaine was forced by the case to fight on the defensive. An opportunity
                    occurred in the day, on the decided repulse of the German right-wing under
                    Steinmetz, of striking such a counterblow as, from Napoleon’s hand, would
                    probably have forced a victory over even the great odds possessed by the German
                    commander. But Bazaine had no spark of the instinctive genius needed. He lost
                    the opportunity, and with it the battle,—the loss entailing the last hope of
                    rescuing his host from the dangerous and indeed ignominious position in which
                    previous errors of judgment had placed it.</p>
                <p>In conclusion, in order to demonstrate the undying truth of the main principle of
                    battle, which is that, the general conditions being equal, the moral advantage
                    is invariably at the outset with the offensive rather than the defensive,— with
                    the army that feels itself moving forward rather than that which.stands
                    still,—it is well to refer to the recent discussion on the effect of
                    breech-loading arms. It was almost universally assumed by theorists, especially
                    by those of Prussia herself, when she first put the needle-gun into her
                    soldiers’ hands, that the power of the new weapon would be most perceptible in
                    defence, for which its more rapid fire seemed so specially adapted. The Prussian
                    instructions, drawn up before 1866, avowedly followed this view Those who
                    compiled them overlooked the fact that the moral power of the weapon would of
                    itself tend to carry those who bore it forward, and add an additional advantage
                    to those the assailant had before in his greater show of vigour and activity,
                    and his power of searching out the weaker parts of his enemy’s position and
                    throwing his troops in force upon them. History has reversed the Prussian
                    theory, and proved afresh how powerful for victory is the moral element in the
                    soldiers’ character. For, out of the opening events of 1866, and the vast
                    encouragement the Prussians experienced in their first collisions with Benedek’s
                    army, has been evolved the most audacious and aggressive series of actions any
                    nation ever fought. Certain Prussian writers have since the war of 1870-71 gone
                    almost to the opposite extreme, and claimed absolute superiority for the
                    offensive under all circumstances, forgetting that, against a stronger army, or
                    even one perfectly equal in all other respects and well posted, it must
                    inevitably be as dangerous as it proved when confidently tried by Napoleon’s
                    marshals against British troops under Wellington.</p>
                <p>The various so-called “orders of battle” of which theoretical writers treat,
                    believing that they see a close similarity in the dispositions of well-led
                    armies from the days of the Grecians down to our own, are, so far as such
                    similarity really exists, founded entirely on one or other of the moral elements
                    already mentioned, above all, on the desire to gain the enemy’s flank. The late
                    General Winfield Scott, one of the few commanders who could boast that he had
                    more than once seen the back of English infantry in fair fight, declared that
                    this desire is so instinctive that it is impossible to array two bodies of
                    disciplined troops against each other without one at least soon striving for
                    this advantage. But so far as this and other like universal principles are
                    applied to the actual drawing up of an army at any period in a special order of
                    battle, the arrangements must in practice vary with the arms and discipline.
                    This subject, in fact, forms part of that special art which treats of the
                    handling of troops in the presence of the enemy, and falls under the head of
                    “tactics,” for which see the article <hi rend="smallcaps">War.</hi> The
                    mechanism of battles must vary continually; the great leading principles we have
