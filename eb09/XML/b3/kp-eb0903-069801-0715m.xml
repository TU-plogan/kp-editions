                    and biographical writer, and one of the early trustees and benefactors of the
                    British Museum, was born in London, November 23, 1705. He was the son of a
                    coffee-mill maker, and was to have followed his father’s business; but his
                    active mind and ambition of higher pursuits led him into the paths of
                    literature. His parents were members of the Society of Friends, and therefore he
                    had not the advantages of a university training. But by persevering application
                    to study and to teaching he qualified himself for the ministry of the Church of
                    England. In 1728 he obtained a curacy, and in the same year he married. His wife
                    died in the following year. He was ordained priest in December 1731, and was
                    soon after recommended to the favour of Philip Yorke, then attorney-general,
                    afterwards Lord Chancellor and earl of Hardwicke, to whom he owed his successive
                    preferments in the church. His first benefice was the vicarage of Ulting in
                    Essex. In 1734 he was appointed domestic chaplain to the earl of Kilmarnock, who
                    was beheaded for his share in the rebellion of ’45. He afterwards held
                    successively benefices in Pembrokeshire, Gloucestershire, and the city of
                    London. His last church preferment was to the rectory of Depden in Essex, to
                    which he was presented in February 1761. In his latter years he was appointed
                    chaplain to the princess Amelia. His literary attainments procured him election
                    as a fellow of the Royal Society in February 1735, and in the following December
                    he was chosen a member of the Society of Antiquaries. He held the office of
                    Secretary to the Royal Society for thirteen years 1752-1765. From the university
                    of Aberdeen he received the degrees first of M.A., and afterwards (1753) of D.D.
                    The degree of D.D. was also conferred on him about the same time by the
                    archbishop of Canterbury. Dr Birch was engaged in a large number of literary
                    undertakings. His appetite and his capacity for hard work were extraordinary.
                    Besides his diversified labours of compilation and editing, he transcribed many
                    volumes in the library of Lambeth Palace, and carried on an extensive
                    correspondence with literary men. He was an early riser; and amidst all his
                    labours he found time to take part in social enjoyments. He was only in his
                    sixty-first year when he was killed by a fall from his horse in Hampstead Road,
                    January 9, 1766. He bequeathed his books and manuscripts, with part of his
                    pictures and prints, to the British Museum. The rest of his property, in value
                    about £500, he gave to be invested in Government securities, the interest to be
                    applied in augmenting the salaries of the three assistant librarians.</p>
