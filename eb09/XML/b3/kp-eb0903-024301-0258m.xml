                    Agnes to London, where their brother, the celebrated Dr Matthew Baillie, was
                    settled. The two sisters were left a small competence by their uncle, Dr William
                    Hunter, and took up their residence at Hampstead, on the outskirts of London,
                    where they passed the remainder of their lives. Miss Baillie died on the 23d
                    Feb. 1851, at the advanced age of 89, her faculties remaining unimpaired to the
                    last. Her gentleness and sweetness of disposition made her a universal
                    favourite, and her little cottage at Hampstead was the centre of a brilliant
                    literary society. Miss Baillie had received' an excellent education, and
                    probably cultivated very early her faculty of poetical composition, but it was
                    not till 1798 that she published the first volume of her <hi rend="italic">Plays
                    on the Passions.</hi> Her design, founded on a careful study of the nature of
                    dramatic poetry, was to illustrate each of the deepest and strongest passions of
                    the human mind, such as Hate, Jealousy, Fear, Love, by a tragedy and a comedy,
                    in each of which should be exhibited the actions of an individual under the
                    influence of these passions. The success of the first volume was very
                    considerable, and a second edition was soon called for. A second volume followed
                    in 1802, a third in 1812, and three more in 1836. Some miscellaneous dramas were
                    published in 1804, and the <hi rend="italic">Family Legend</hi> appeared in
                    1810. Miss Baillie herself intended her plays not for the closet but for the
                    stage. The <hi rend="italic">Family Legend,</hi> brought out at Edinburgh under
                    the enthusiastic patronage of Sir Walter Scott, had a brief though brilliant
                    success; <hi rend="italic">De Monfort</hi> had a short run in London, mainly
                    through the acting of Kemble and Mrs Siddons; <hi rend="italic">Henriquez</hi>
                    and <hi rend="italic">The Separation</hi> were coldly received. The popular
                    verdict has thus been given against the dramas as good stage plays, and the
                    almost universal decision of readers has confirmed this judgment. With very few
                    exceptions, they are unsuited for stage exhibition. Not only is there a flaw in
                    the fundamental idea, that, viz., of an individual who is the embodiment of a
                    single passion, but there is a want of incident, and a narrowness, consequent
                    upon the attention being too much directed on a single point, that present
                    insuperable obstacles to their success as acting pieces. The plot is generally
                    well constructed, but the very consciousness of aim with which it is wrought out
                    gives to the whole a morbid and unnatural aspect; there is rarely, if ever, any
                    progress in the play; the whole is apparent from the outset, and the action
                    never heightens the spectators’ interest. It must be confessed, also, that Miss
                    Baillie had no very adequate notion of what is required in a stage drama, and
                    that her experience was too limited. This is apparent in her comedies, which are
                    very inferior productions. In short, her want of success is a clear proof of the
                    impracticability of that analytic or psychological method, which she expounds
                    and defends in her preliminary dissertations. The plays, however, are admirably
                    adapted for reading; they show remarkable powers of analysis and acute
                    observation, and are written in a pure and vigorous style, rising occasionally
                    into strains of high poetic feeling and expression. The best of the tragedies
                    are undoubtedly <hi rend="italic">Henriquez, The Separation, De Monfort,</hi>
                    and <hi rend="italic">Count Basil,</hi> the first of which might perhaps be made
                    into a good acting play. Miss Baillie’s reputation does not rest entirely on her
                    dramas: she is the authoress of some poetical pieces and songs of great beauty,
                    and in all probability great portion of her .fame will be found to rest on these
                    minor works. The best of them are the <hi rend="italic">Innes to Agnes Baillie
                    on her Birthday, The Kitten, To a Child,</hi> and some of her adaptations of
                    Scotch songe, such as <hi rend="italic">Woo'd and Married ari a’.</hi> Scattered
                    throughout the dramas are also some lively and beautiful songs, such, <hi
