                    cloth; and at the upper end, which is rounded, there are nine holes or cups,,

                <p>Into these holes ivory balls are driven by a cue in all respects similar to the
                    instrument used in <hi rend="smallcaps">Billiards,</hi> which see. The sides and
                    circular end of the table are furnished with elastic cushions; and in some of
                    the newer tables there is also a pocket on each side. Nine balls— eight white,
                    and one red or black (sometimes four white, four red, and one black)—are used in
                    the most popular of the several bagatelle games.</p>
                <p>The ordinary game is played according to the following rules :—</p>
                <p>1. Any number of persons may play, whether singly or in sides. 2. Each player
                    strings for lead, and he who lodges his ball in the highest hole begins. In the
                    case of partners, one only on each side need string for the lead. 3. The player
                    who wins the lead takes the nine balls and plays them one after the other up the
                    table from baulk, first striking at the red ball which is placed on the spot
                    about a foot below the 1 hole. The object of the player is to lodge his own, or
                    the coloured ball, or both balls, in the holes. 4. The red ball counts double
                    when it is played into a hole; and for each white ball lodged or holed, a
                    corresponding number of points is scored to that marked <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit03newyrich/page/n245/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0903-0245-0230"/> in the cup. (Sometimes two coloured balls are
                    used, in which case both count double.) <hi rend="italic">5</hi> The red ball
                    must be first struck, and the remainder of the balls are played up to the
                    holes—the sum total of the holes made being the striker’s score. 6. Any number
                    of rounds may be played for the game, as agreed on at the commencement; and the
                    player (or side) obtaining the highest aggregate score wins. 7. Any ball that
                    rebounds beyond the baulk line, or is forced over the table, is not re-used in
                    that round.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Sans Egal,</hi> or the French Game, is the next most generally
                    play·d game on the bagatelle table. It is governed by the following laws :—1.
                    The player who takes the lead (which is decided as in bagatelle) makes choice of
                    four balls of either colour, and placing the black one on the spot, commences by
                    striking it with a ball from baulk. 2. The other player then strikes up one of
                    his balls, and so on alternately, 3. He who holes the black ball counts it
                    towards his game, together with any number made by the whito. 4. If either
                    player hole his adversary’s ball, the number scored by such ball, or balls, is
                    marked to the other side. 5. The player who makes the greatest number of points
                    in each round wins the game, and takes the lead in the next. The rule as to
                    balls rebounding beyond the baulk line, or being forced off the table, is the
                    same as in the preceding game.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">The Cannon Game,</hi> sometimes played on a table without
                    holes, consists entirely of cannons, that is to say, two balls struck in
                    succession by the cue-ball. This game is played 50, 100, or 150 up, and the
                    holes into which the balls fall are sometimes counted in addition to the cannon.
                    Three balls only are used—a white, a spot-white, and a black ball. At starting
                    the latter is placed on the spot, and the adversary’s ball on a point
                    equi-distant between the first and centre holes, 1 and 9, If the striker make a
                    cannon, he goes on as long as he can score, but no hole can be counted without
                    first making the cannon. To miss the white involves the loss of 1 point; and to
                    miss the black ball, 5 points. The striker’s break is ended when he fails to
                    cannon, and then the other player goes on,—he who first gains the required
                    number winning the game. When there are pockets to the table, two points are
                    taken for every white ball pocketed, and three points for the red. Should the
                    player’s ball fall into a pocket before he make the cannon, the score is taken
                    by the opponent. In the <hi rend="italic">Irish Cannon Game</hi> the holes do
                    not count, except by way of penalty; all points made by holing the balls being
                    added to the score of the adversary. Sometimes, in both the cannon games two
                    points are taken for a cannon from white to white and then to red, and three for
                    a cannon from white to red and then to white; or, when two coloured balls are
                    used, three points are taken for a cannon from the black to the red. Lately,
                    bagatelle tables as much as 14 feet long by 6 feet wide have been made for the
                    cannon game.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Mississippi</hi> is a game played on a bagatelle table with a
                    bridge pierced with arches, each arch bearing a certain number—say, from 1 to 10
                    or 12. The balls are first played from the baulk against the cushion on to the
                    bridge, which is placed just in front of the lowermost hole. The rules are —1.
                    If the ball pass through the bridge, all the points indicated on the arch are
                    counted towards the player’s score, in addition to any points made by the ball
                    falling into a hole beyond the bridge. The game may be played by two or more
                    persons, and he who first makes the number of points agreed on—100, 200, 500,
                    &amp;c.—wins. A modification of this game is called <hi rend="italic"
                    >Trou</hi><hi rend="italic">Madame.</hi> In this the balls are played from the
                    baulk straight up to the bridge without touching the cushion, and only the
                    points marked upon the arches score,— all points made by the balls dropping into
                    <hi rend="superscript"> i</hi> the holes beyond being scored to the opponent.
                    Another variety, called <hi rend="italic">Cockamaroo,</hi> or Russian Bagatelle,
                    is played on a table prepared with a number of pins, holes, arches, and bells,
                    up to and through which the ball is played from the baulk end of the table. It
                    is a childish amusement, requiring little skill, and therefore needing only the
                    barest mention.</p>
                <p>In playing the bagatelle games a much less degree of force is required for the
                    stroke than is necessary for billiards. Some adepts are able to fill all the
                    holes at one essay; first, by striking the red ball on the side, making a double
                    hazard, say, into the 7 and the 8 holes, and then, either by playing direct at
                    the holes or at the cushion, lodging each successive ball till the whole nine
                    are pocketed. In this way, counting double for the red, as many as 54 points can
                    be scored in a single round of the balls. When two coloured balls are used, of
                    course a proportionally larger score is made. The cue should be held lightly
                    between the fingers and thumb, not grasped in the palm of the hand; and much use
                    may be made of the various strokes employed in billiards,—as the side, the
                    screw, the twist, and the drag; for which terms see the article <hi
