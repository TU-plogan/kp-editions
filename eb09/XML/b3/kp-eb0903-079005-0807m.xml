                    the older metallurgical writers, it having been first noticed by Agricola, who
                    speaks of it as a form of lead, and describes the method of separating it from
                    its associated minerals by liquation. Mathesius in his <hi rend="italic"
                    >Eergpostilla,</hi> written between 1553-1562, describes it as white like
                    pyrites, and occasionally cubical like marcasite, easily overcome by the fire
                    when melted, and running together with the tin, which thereby is rendered
                    brittle and unsound,— the last remark referring to its occurrence with tin ores
                    in Saxony. It was considered by the miners as a hopeful indication of silver,
                    and even in certain cases is said to have been transformed gradually into that
                    metal, as portions of the ore which had lain for some time exposed were found
                    afterwards to be partly or wholly changed into silver. This remark is
                    interesting, as the same belief seems to have come up again in our own time. The
                    name <hi rend="italic">Wismuth</hi> is a miner’s term, whose origin is
                    completely lost; but Mathesius assigns it a fanciful derivation from <hi
                    rend="italic">Wisse</hi><hi rend="italic">= Wiese,</hi> a meadow, because in the
                    mine it is found covered with flowers or incrustations of various colours,
                    resembling a meadow covered with brilliantly coloured flowers,—an obvious
                    confusion with thβ minerals known as nickel and cobalt bloom, derived from the
                    oxidation of arsenides of nickel and cobalt, with which native bismuth is
                    commonly associated in Saxony. It is to this association with cobalt and arsenic
                    that must be ascribed the statements that its principal use was to produce a
                    blue colour, and that it gave off a very poisonous furnace smoke. The chief use
                    of the metal at that time seems to have been by pewterers, who added it to their
                    alloy in small proportions for the purpose of rendering their wares hard and
                    sonorous when struck.</p>
                <p>The principal minerals containing bismuth are:—1. Native bismuth, essentially <hi
                    rend="italic">the pure metal,</hi> having all the properties described below.
                    This, the most important ore, occurs in connection with nickel and cobalt ores
                    at Schneeberg, Saxony, at Wheal Sparnon in Cornwall, similarly associated, and
                    with tin ores in the mines of the St Just district. It is also found in some
                    quantity in Bolivia. 2. Tetradymite, or telluric bismuth, a compound in variable
                    proportions with the isomorphous element tellurium. This contains from 60 to 80
                    per cent, of bismuth, 15 to 35 per cent, of tellurium, and from 3 to 5 per cent,
                    of sulphur. It occurs usually in association with gold ores; the principal
                    localities are Schemnitz and Retzbanya in Hungary, the gold mining district of
                    Virginia and North Carolina, California, and other western states of America. It
                    was also found at the Merionethshire gold mines as a rarity. 3. Bismuth silver,
                    found at Schapbach in Baden, and near Copiapo in Chili. The mineral from the
                    former locality contains 27 of bismuth to 15 of silver, with some lead and
                    sulphur, and a little iron; and that from the latter 60 of silver to 10 of
                    bismuth, the remainder being copper and arsenic. 4. Bismuthine, or bismuth
                    glance, a sulphide of bismuth, of the composition Bi <hi rend="subscript">
                    2</hi> S <hi rend="subscript"> u</hi>, containing 81 ’ 6 per cent, bismuth and
                    !8 ’ 4 per cent, sulphur, crystallizing in acicular rhombic prisms isomorphous
                    with antimony glance. It occurs with tin ore at Botallack and other mines near
                    St Just in Cornwall, and in the Saxon localities given above. 5. Bismuth ochre,
                    an earthy oxide of bismuth, containing 90 per cent, bismuth and 10 per cent,
                    oxygen, which is derived from the oxidation both of the native metal and of the
                    sulphide. 6. Bismutite, a hydrated carbonate of bismuth, containing 90 per cent,
                    bismuth oxide, 6 ’ 56 per cent, carbonic acid, and 3 <hi rend="superscript">
                    -</hi> 44 per cent, water, another product of atmospheric action upon native
                    bismuth. It is found principally in Saxony and South Carolina. Besides the above
                    there is also a silicate described, but this is an exceedingly rare mineral, as
                    is also Hypochlorite, a hydrated silicate mixed with phosphate of alumina.
                    Practically the only ore is the native metal, and of late years, from the supply
                    not keeping pace with the demand, the price has risen very considerably. The
                    bismuth of commerce<pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit03newyrich/page/n808/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0903-0808-0791"/> usually contains both gold and silver, often in
                    considerable quantity, which circumstance has probably given rise to the story
                    current about its transmutation into these metals.</p>
                <p>Bismuth may be readily obtained in crystals by pouring it when melted into a
                    heated iron ladle, and cooling it until a crust is formed on the surface, which
                    must then be pierced by a red-hot iron rod, and the liquid metal poured off. The
                    solidified portion adhering to the ladle is found to be covered with
                    hopper-shaped crystals, which are usually beautifully irised, owing to the
                    formation of a thin film of oxide on the surface, showing the colours of thin
                    plates. This colouring is only obtained when the metal is quite free from
                    arsenic. It may be purified by melting with about 10 per cent, of nitre, and
                    keeping it constantly stirred at a temperature not much above its melting point,
                    whereby the more oxidizable metals are removed, and form a slag at the surface.
                    Another method of purifying it from arsenic is by fusing it with from 3 to 5 per
                    cent, of zinc, covering the surface with charcoal to prevent oxidation of the
                    zinc, which takes off the whole of the arsenic, and is subsequently removed by
                    treatment with hydrochloric acid, the purified bismuth remaining insoluble. When
                    prepared by any of these processes, Bismuth is a hard, brittle metal, and the
                    fracture is highly crystalline and white, with a perceptible red tinge by
                    reflected light. The crystalline form is rhombohedral, the angle of the primary
                    rhombohedron being 87° 40', or very close to a cube. The specific gravity is 9
                    <hi rend="superscript"> -</hi> 83, but when subjected to great pressure the
                    density is reduced to 9 <hi rend="superscript"> -</hi> 6. The melting point is
                    264° C. (507° Fahr.) (Rudberg), or 268°∙3 (515°) (Riemsdijk). Like water it may
                    be cooled 6° or 7° C. below its freezing point; but when solidification sets in
                    the temperature rises to 480° Fahr., and continues until the mass is completely
                    solidified. Like ice it expands about ⅛ of its volume in solidification, a
                    property which is communicated to its alloys, rendering them valuable for taking
                    casts of incised or relief surfaces for reproduction, as printing-blocks by
                    electrotype or other processes. It may be distilled by heating to a higher
                    temperature in hydrogen. Despretz volatilized it by subjecting it to the current
                    from 600 Bunsen elements. The spectrum of the vapour in the voltaic arc shows
                    numerous brilliant green lines, one strong and one fainter line on the red, and
                    a faint line on the orange field (Masson). The coefficient of expansion by heat
                    is ‘001341, calorific conductibility 61, silver being 1000 (Calvert and
                    Johnson), and specific heat 0 0305 (Kopp). The electric conductivity is 1T9 at
                    14° C., silver being 100 at 0° (Matthiesen). According to Matteuci the
                    conductivity varies in the crystals according to the direction of the cleavages.
                    It is the most strongly diamagnetic of all metals.</p>
                <p>The atomic weight is 208 (Schneider) or 210 (Dumas). Like phosphorus and arsenic
                    it is both triatomic and pentatomic, the latter state being represented only by
                    a very unstable acid; there are also several diatomic compounds, including BiBr
                    <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi>, BiCl <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi>, and Bil <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 2</hi>. The triatomic compounds are the most numerous and
                    stable. Unlike the elements chemically similar,—phosphorus, tellurium, arsenic,
                    antimony, &amp;c.,—it does not form a gaseous compound with hydrogen. Bismuth
                    does not change in dry air, but in moist air it oxidizes superficially, and by
                    long exposure may be converted into carbonate. When melted at a red heat it
                    oxidizes, and the oxide (whose formula is Bi <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> O <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 3</hi>), by a higher temperature, melts to a glassy substance,
                    in which property it resembles lead, the oxide, like litharge, exerting a very
                    corrosive action upon eaιthern crucibles, or substances containing silica, at a
                    red heat. At a red-white heat it slowly decomposes water with the production of
                    oxide. The higher oxide Bi <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> O <hi rend="subscript">
                    5</hi> corresponds to arsenic acid; it is a very unstable compound, and of no
                    practical 'value. An intermediate oxide is known which is generally regarded as
                    a compound of the other two, Bi <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> O <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 3</hi>, Bi <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> O <hi rend="subscript"
                    > 5</hi>. Bismuth unites directly with chlorine, bromine, and iodine, and when
                    fused with sulphur forms a sulphide of the form Bi <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi>
                    S <hi rend="subscript"> 3</hi>, corresponding to bismuth glance, and isomorphous
                    with the corresponding sulphide of antimony. The same sulphide is produced when
                    sulphuretted hydrogen is passed through a solution containing bismuth.</p>
                <p>Bismuth is but slightly acted upon by hydrochloric or sulphuric acids in the
                    cold; but the latter dissolves it more readily when heated. The best solvent is
                    nitric acid, which attacks it readily, producing a nitrate which crystallizes
                    from the concentrated solution in colourless transparent crystals belonging to
                    the triatomic system, whose composition is Bi. 3NO <hi rend="subscript">
                    3</hi>.5H <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> O. These crystals are soluble in nitric
                    acid, but, like all neutral salts of the metal, are decomposed by· water, with
                    the formation of an insoluble basic nitrate and an acid liquor. These basic
                    salts are very numerous and complex in constitution, the most important one
                    being that represented by the formula BLNO <hi rend="subscript"> 3</hi>.H <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 2</hi> O, which is known as pearl-white, <hi rend="italic"
                    >blanc de fard.</hi> This, which is largely used as a medicine, is prepared by
                    adding to a concentrated solution of bismuth dissolved in nitric acid from 40 to
                    50 times its weight of water, which precipitates a considerable proportion in
                    the form of a white powder; the remainder, which is retained by the acid liquor,
                    may be separated by neutralizing the excess of acid with ammonia, when a rather
                    more acid salt than the first precipitate is obtained. Under the name of
                    pearl-white the sub-nitrate is used as a cosmetic, but it has the disadvantage
                    of being readily blackened by sulphuretted hydrogen.</p>
                <p>Bismuth unites readily with other metals, the alloys being remarkable for their
                    ready fusibility, and by their property of expanding on solidification. An alloy
                    with potassium is obtained by calcining 20 parts of bismuth with 16 parts of
                    cream of tartar in a crucible, and heating the mixture to a very strong red
                    heat. On cooling, a button of metal is found, of a silvery white colour and
                    lamellar fracture, which fuses easily, and remains for a long time in a pasty
                    condition before solidification; it is brittle, can be easily powdered, and is
                    readily decomposed by water. The alloy with sodium is obtained in a similar
                    manner, with a sodic tartrate. With silver, gold, and metals of the platinum
                    group, bismuth forms brittle alloys. With mercury it forms a liquid amalgam; but
                    when equal weights of the two metals are heated together, there is a separation
                    on cooling of octahedral crystals, which may be a solid amalgam. The copper
                    alloy is brittle, and of a pale red colour. The ternary alloys of lead, tin, and
                    bismuth, are the most interesting of these compounds, from their low fusibility,
                    which is much below that of any of the components taken separately. This
                    property was known to Sir Isaac Newton; the alloy named after him, Newton’s
                    fusible metal, melts at 94 <hi rend="superscript"> o-</hi> 5 C. (202° Fahr.); it
                    contains 8 parts of bismuth, 5 of lead, and 3 of tin. Darcet’s fusible metal,
                    containing 2 of bismuth, 1 of lead, and 1 of tin, melts at 93° (199° <hi
                    rend="superscript"> -</hi> 4 Fahr.) Another, with 5 of bismuth, 2 of tin, and 3
                    of lead, melts at 91° ’ 6 (197° Fahr.) Rose’s fusible metal, containing 420
                    parts of bismuth, 236 of lead, and 207 of tin, a composition corresponding to
                    the formula Bi <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> Sn <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> Pb,
                    fuses below 100° (212°), and remains pasty for a considerable range of
                    temperature below that point. The expansion of this alloy by heat proceeds
                    regularly from 0 <hi rend="superscript"> t</hi> to 35° C., but by further
                    heating it contracts up to 55°, from which point up to 80° the rate of expansion
                    is more rapid than at the lower temperatures. Above 80° the normal rate is
                    resumed. The fusibility of these alloys is increased by an addition of cadmium.
                    Thus Wood’s fusible metal, containing 1 to 2 parts of cadmium, 2 of tin, 2 of
                    lead, and 7 to 8 of bismuth, melts between 66° and 71° C. Another, described by
                    Lipowitz, containing 8 parts of lead, 15 of bismuth, 4 of tin, and 3 of cadmium,
                    is silvery white, and lias a specific gravity of 9 <hi rend="superscript">
                    -</hi> 4. It softens at about 55°, and is completely liquid at a little above
                    60°.</p>
                <p>Fusible alloys containing bismuth are used to some extent as safety plugs for
                    steam boilers, as an accessory to the safety-valve,—a hole in the boiler being
                    plugged by a disc of the metal, which in the event of the temperature of the
                    water rising through excessive pressure is melted, and the steam passes through
                    the aperture in the same manner as through an opened safety-valve. It is found,
                    however, that this method is not trustworthy, owing to the liquation of the more
                    fusible components of the mass, when subjected to continued heating near but
                    below the melting point, leaving a more refractory alloy behind. The alloy known
                    as Britannia metal, consisting chiefly of tin, antimony, and copper, often
                    contains a little bismuth.</p>
                <p>In analysis bismuth is usually separated from solution as carbonate by
                    precipitation with carbonate of ammonia, which is then converted into oxide by
                    calcination at a gentle heat, in which form it is weighed and estimated. The
                    oxide Bi <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> O <hi rend="subscript"> 3</hi> contains 89
                    ’ 74 per cent, of bismuth. It is readily precipitated as sulphide by passing
                    sulphuretted hydrogen through an acid solution, but the precipitate cannot be
                    weighed, as it usually contains an excess of sulphur, and cannot be completely
                    freed from water below 200°, so that it must be redissolved in nitric acid and
                    precipitated as carbonate as above described. It may be precipitated in the
                    metallic state by zinc, cadmium, copper, iron, or tin. A plate of copper
                    introduced into a boiling solution of a bismuth salt, even when very weak, is
                    readily covered with a coating of the reduced metal of a steel-gray colour.</p>
                <p>Bismuth may be employed instead of lead for the assay of gold and silver by
                    cupellation, as the melted oxide is absorbed by bone ash in exactly the same
                    manner as litharge.</p>
                <p>The separation of bismuth from solutions in which it is associated with silver,
                    copper, mercury, cadmium, and lead, may be effected by cyanide of potassium; by
                    digesting the solution with an excess of this reagent the cyanides of bismuth
                    and lead remain in the insoluble portion, while those of the other metals are
                    contained in the filtrate. On redissolving, the lead may be precipitated as
                    sulphate, or by hydrochloric acid and alcohol, which renders the chloride of
                    lead insoluble. The bismuth is finally precipitated from the filtrate by
                    sulphuretted hydrogen. From copper it is readily separated by carbonate of
                    ammonia, bismuth being precipitated, and copper remaining in solution. Another
                    method is by heating in a current of chlorine, when chloride of bismuth is
                    volatilized.</p>
                <p>The metallurgical processes for the extraction of bismuth are very simple, being
                    mainly comprised in liquation out of contact with the air, and subsequent fusion
                    of the liquated product of the firs*, operation. At Schneeberg, in Saxony, the
                    liquation is effected m cast-iron tubes placed transversely over a fire-grate
                    which runs the whole length of the furnace. The tubes are inclined, the higher

                    xml:id="kp-eb0903-0809-0792"/> end being open for charging, and the lower
                    stopped, with the exception of a small hole for the passage of the separated
                    metal, which is received in a cast-iron pot placed in front and heated with
                    charcoal. The charge, about half a cwt. of ore, broken into pieces about half
                    inch cube, occupies about half of the length and rather more than half the area
                    of each tube. When all the tubes are charged the upper ends are stopped by
                    sheet-iron doors, and heat is applied by means of a wood fire upon the grate.
                    The liquid metal soon commences to flow, and is received in the pots in front.
                    If the flow ceases through any obstruction the passage is cleared by an iron rod
                    introduced through the aperture at the lower end. When the operation, which
                    usually lasts about an hour, has terminated, the residues in the tubes are
                    removed and thrown into a water trough placed behind the furnace on the charging
                    side, and a fresh supply of ore is introduced. The bismuth collected in the pots
                    is ladled out and cast into ingots of from 25 to 50 tt&gt; weight. In a furnace
                    containing 11 tubes about 20 cwts. of ore may be heated daily with a consumption
                    of 63 cubic feet of wood. In Plattner’s modification the furnace is of the
                    reverberatory form, the tubes being placed with their inclined axes in the
                    direction of the flame, an arrangement •which allows the use of a smaller
                    fire-grate and a proportionate saving of fuel. At Joachimsthal, ores containing
                    from 10 to 30 per cent, of bismuth are heated in a finely-ground state with
                    scrap-iron, carbonate of soda, and a little lime and fluor-spar in earthen
                    crucibles, which are heated until the mixture is completely fused, when the
                    contents are poured into iron moulds of a sugar-loaf form. The bismuth collects
                    in the point of the mould, and is covered with a cake of speiss, containing all
                    the nickel and cobalt of the ore with about 2 per cent, of bismuth, which is
                    reserved for further treatment; the slag filling the upper part of the mould is
                    thrown away. If the bismuth is sufficiently rich in silver it is cupelled, and
                    the oxide formed is subsequently reduced or revived by fusion with carbon. When
                    argentiferous lead containing bismuth is subjected to cupellation the former
                    metal is oxidized more rapidly than the latter, which accumulates to such an
                    extent that it may often form a notable proportion of the litharge produced
                    towards the end of the process, although not existing in sufficient amount to be
                    appreciable by the ordinary processes of analysis in the original lead. This
                    property has recently been utilized to recover a small quantity of bismuth
                    existing in the silver ores smelted at Freiberg. The last portion of the
                    litharge, and the hearth or test bottom from the silver refining furnace, are
                    heated in quantities of 80 or 100 lb in earthenware pots with hydrochloric acid
                    until complete solution of the bismuth oxide takes place, the proportion of acid
                    and water being regulated to prevent the formation of insoluble salts. When the
                    liquid is clear it is siphoned off to the precipitating tubs, where it is thrown
                    down as an insoluble oxyehloride by the addition of a large quantity of water.
                    By redissolving and reprecipitating, a purer material is obtained, which is then
                    dried and reduced by fusion in iron crucibles with carbonate of soda and
                    charcoal. The production of bismuth annually in Saxony is about 22 tons, and in
                    Austria about 17 cwt.</p>
                <p>The principal properties and reactions of bismuth and its compounds were
                    described in 1739 by Pott, who gave a summary of the information contained in
                    the earlier writers. Our more exact knowledge of the subject is due to Neumann,
                    Hellot, Geoffrey (1753), John Davy (1812), Lagerhjelm (1815), Stromeyer, and,
                    more recently, Schneider and Nicklès. (H. B.)</p>
