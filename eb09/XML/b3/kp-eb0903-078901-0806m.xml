                    was followed within two years by several others, of which <hi rend="italic"
                    >Caradacus,</hi> a pantomimic ballet, written for Drury Lane, may be named. In
                    1809 his first opera, <hi rend="italic">The Circassian's Bride,</hi> was
                    produced at Drury Lane; but by a singular misfortune the theatre was burned down
                    after one performance, and the score of the work perished in the flames. His
                    next work of importance, the opera of <hi rend="italic">The Maniac,</hi> written
                    for the Lyceum in 1810, established his reputation, and probably secured for him
                    the appointment of composer for Covent Garden theatre. The numerous
                    works—operas, burlettas, cantatas,incidental music to Shakespeare’s plays,
                    &amp;c.—which he composed while in this position, are now in great part
                    forgotten. The most successful were— <hi rend="italic">The Virgin of the
                    Sun</hi> (1812), <hi rend="italic">The Miller and his Men</hi> (1813), <hi
                    rend="italic">Guy Maη-nering</hi> and <hi rend="italic">The Slave</hi> (1816),
                    <hi rend="italic">Maid Marian</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Clari,</hi> introducing
                    the air of “Home, Sweet Home” (1822). His English adaptations, or rather mangled
                    versions, of Mozart’s <hi rend="italic">Eon Giovanni</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >Figaro,</hi> and Rossini’s <hi rend="italic">ll</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Barbiere</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Guillaume Tell,</hi> were certainly no true
                    service to art. It seems almost incredible that a man of Bishop’s undoubted
                    genius should have been so misguided as to suppress the incomparable <hi
                    rend="italic">Figaro</hi> overture of Mozart in favour of one of his own. In
                    1824 Bishop was induced by Elliston to transfer his services from Covent Garden
                    to the rival house in Drury Lane, for which he wrote with •unusual care the
                    opera of <hi rend="italic">Aladdin,</hi> intended to compete with Weber’s <hi
                    rend="italic">Oberon,</hi> commissioned by the other house. As was to be
                    expected the result was a failure, and with <hi rend="italic">Aladdin</hi>
                    Bishop’s career as an operatic composer may be said to close. On the formation
                    of the Philharmonic Society (1813) Bishop was appointed one of the directors,
                    and he took his turn as conductor of its concerts during the period when that
                    office was held by different musicians in rotation. In 1841 he was appointed to
                    the “Reid” chair of music in the University of Edinburgh, but he resigned the
                    office in 1843. He was knighted by the queen in 1842, being the first musician
                    who ever received that honour. In 1848 he succeeded Dr Crotch in the chair of
                    music at Oxford. The music for the ode on the occasion of the installation of
                    Lord Derby as chancellor of the university (1853) proved to be his last work. He
                    died on the 30th April 1855 in impoverished circumstances, though few composers
                    ever made more by their labours. Bishop’s name will live in connection with his
                    numerous glees, songs, and smaller compositions, rather than with his larger
                    works, which are now seldom or never performed in their entirety. His Shake <pb

                    with all vocalists, and genius is discernible in not a few of them. His melodies
                    are clear, flowing, appropriate, and often charming; and his harmony is always
                    pure, simple, and sweet. He was a prominent example of both the strength and the
                    weakness of the native English school, in which the name of Purcell alone stands
                    unquestionably higher than his.</p>
