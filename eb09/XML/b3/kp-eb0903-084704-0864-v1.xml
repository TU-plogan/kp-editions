                    celebrated German astronomer, born January 19, 1747, at Hamburg, where his
                    father kept a commercial academy. From his earliest years he was devoted to the
                    mathematical sciences, especially astronomy. In the garret of his father’s
                    house, with the aid of a telescope constructed by himself, he eagerly made
                    observations of the heavens; and at eighteen years of age he had acquired so
                    great a knowledge of astronomy, that when Dr Reimarus visited his father, young
                    Bode was found occupied in calculating an eclipse of the sun. This incident was
                    the means of introducing him to the notice of Professor Büsch, who at once
                    afforded him every facility for prosecuting his labours with success. Shortly
                    afterwards Bode gave the first public proof of his knowledge by a short work on
                    the solar eclipse of August 5, 1766; and this was followed by his <hi
                        rend="italic">Anleitung zur</hi><hi rend="italic">Kenntniss</hi><hi
                        rend="italic">des gestirnten Himmels,</hi> an elementary treatise on
                    astronomy, which was eminently successful, and has since gone through numerous
                    editions. In 1772, being called to Berlin by Frederic II., he was made
                    astronomer to the Academy of Sciences, and afterwards a member of that
                    institution. The well-known periodical work entitled <hi rend="italic"
                        >Astronomische Jahrbücher,</hi> which is continued to the present day, was
                    commenced by Bode in 1774; but that on which his fame chiefly rests is the <hi
                        rend="italic">Eranographia,</hi> published in 1801, in which the industrious
                    author has given observations of 17,240 stars, or 12,000 more than are to be
                    found in any older charts. This veteran observer, who may justly be said to have
                    been the first to diffuse a general taste for astronomy in Germany, died at
                    Berlin, Nov. 23, 1826. For the curious empirical law which bears Bode’s name,
