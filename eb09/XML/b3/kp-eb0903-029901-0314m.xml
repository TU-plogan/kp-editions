                <p><label type="entry">BALUCHISTAN</label>, a maritime country of Asia, whose coast
                    is continuous with that of the north-western part of the Indian Peninsula. It is
                    bounded on the N. by Afghanistan, on the E. by Sindh, on the S. by the Arabian
                    Sea, and on the W. by Persia. The frontier between. Persia and Baluchistan has
                    been drawn by an English commission, sent out in 1870 under Sir F. Goldsmid,
                    from Gwadur Bay (about 61° 36' E. long.) northwards, to lat. 26° 15' N., when it
                    turns eastward to the Nihing River, following which N. and E. to its sources, it
                    passes on to about 63° 12' E. long., when it resumes a northerly direction to
                    Jalk. As thus determined, Baluchistan has an area of about 106,500 sq. miles. It
                    extends from lat. 24° 50' to 30° 20', and from long. 61° 10' to 68° 38'; its
                    extreme length from E. to W. being 500 miles, and its breadth 370.</p>
                <p>The outline of the sea-coast is in general remarkably regular, running nearly due
                    E. and W., a little N. of lat. 24° 46' from Cape Monze, on the border of Sindh,
                    to Cape Jewnee, near the River Dustee. It is for the most part craggy, but not
                    remarkably elevated, and has in some places, for considerable distance, a low
                    sandy shore, though almost everywhere the surface becomes much higher inland.
                    The principal headlands, proceeding from E. to W., are Cape Monze or Ras
                    Moarree, which is the eastern headland of Sonmeanee Bay; Goorab Sing; Bas
                    Arubah; Ras Noo, forming the western headland of Gwadel Bay; Ras Jewnee, forming
                    the eastern point of Gwadur Bay, and Cape Zegin at its western extremity. There
                    is no good harbour along the coast, though it extends about 600 miles; but there
                    are several roadsteads with good holding-ground, and sheltered on several
                    points. Of these the best are Sonmeanee Bay, Homara, and Gwadur. On the latter
                    are situated a small town and a fort of the same name, and also a telegraph
                    station of the Indo-European line.</p>
                <p>Of the early history of this portion of the Asiatic continent little or nothing
                    is known. The poverty and natural strength of the country, combined with the
                    ferocious habits of the natives, seem to have equally repelled the friendly
                    visits of <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit03newyrich/page/n315/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0903-0315-0300"/> inquisitive strangers and the hostile incursions
                    of invading armies. The first distinct account which we have is from Arrian,
                    who, with his usual brevity and severe veracity, narrates the march of Alexander
                    through this region, which he calls the country of the Oritae and Gadrosii. He
                    gives a very accurate account of this forlorn tract, its general aridity, and
                    the necessity of obtaining water by digging in the beds of torrents; describes
                    the food of the inhabitants as dates and fish; and adverts to the occasional
                    occurrence of fertile spots, the abundance of aromatic and thorny shrubs and
                    fragrant plants, and the violence of the monsoon in the western part of Mekran.
                    He notices also the impossibility of subsisting a large army, and the consequent
                    destruction of the greater part of the men and beasts which accompanied the
                    expedition of Alexander. At the commencement of the 8th century this country was
                    traversed by an army of the caliphate.</p>
                <p>The country derives its name from the Baluches, but the Brahoes are considered
                    the dominant race, from which the ruler of the country is always selected. From
                    whatever quarter these may have arrived, they eventually expelled, under their
                    leader Kumbur, the Hindu dynasty, which at that time governed the country, and
                    conquered Baluchistan for themselves. The Baluches are a quite distinct race,
                    and must have arrived in the country at a subsequent period, probably in small
                    bodies, some of which may have come from Syria or from Arabia; in proof of this
                    the Kyheree, for instance, possess a remarkably handsome breed of horses showing
                    unmistakable Arab blood. Anyhow, so marked is the social distinction between
                    Baluch and Brahoe, that when the khan assembles his forces for war the latter
                    tribes demand, as their right, wheaten flour as a portion of their daily
                    rations, while the Baluch tribes are only entitled to receive that made from a
                    coarse grain called jowar. There is also a Persian colony known as the Dehwars;
                    and a considerable number of Hindus, who appear to have been the first settlers
                    in the Brahoe mountains on their expulsion from Sindh, Lus, and Mekran by the
                    caliphs of Baghdad.</p>
                <p>Taking a general view on the subject of the original inhabitants of Baluchistan,
                    we may conclude that they have, from a very early date, been reinforced by
                    emigration from other countries, and from stragglers dropped from the hosts of
                    the numerous conquerors, from Alexander to Nadir Shah, who have passed and
                    repassed through Baluchistan or its neighbourhood on their way to and from
                    India. Thus we find the Saka tribe located on the plains of Gressia, on the
                    borders of Mekran, the ancient Gedrosia, and still further to the west, the
                    Dahoe. These tribes are on the direct line of Alexander’s march; and we know
                    that tribes of this name from the shores of the Caspian accompanied his army. In
                    Sarawan we find the Sirperra, and Pliny tells us that a tribe called Saraparae
                    resided near the Oxus. Further, on the Dushti-be-doulets, a plain at the
                    northern entrance of the Bolan Pass, we find the Kurds, a name, again, familiar
                    as that of a celebrated and ancient nation. The names of numerous other tribes
                    might be cited to support this view, but it would require too much space to
                    follow up the subject. Both Brahoes and Baluches are Mahometans of the Suni
                    persuasion.</p>
                <p>The precise period at which the Brahoes gained the mastery cannot be accurately
                    ascertained; but it was probably about two centuries ago. The last rajah of the
                    Hindu dynasty found himself compelled to call for the assistance of the mountain
                    shepherds, with their leader, Kumbur, in order to check the encroachments of a
                    horde of depredators, headed by an Afghan chief, who infested the country, and
                    even threatened to attack the seat of government. Kumbur successfully performed
                    the service for which he had been engaged; but having in a few years quelled the
                    robbers, against whom he had been called in, and finding himself at the head of
                    the only military tribe in the country, he formally deposed the rajah and
                    assumed the government.</p>
                <p>The history of the country after the accession of Kumbur is as obscure as during
                    the Hindu dynasty. It would appear, however, that the sceptre was quietly
                    transmitted to Abdulla Khan, the fourth in descent from Kumbur, who, being an
                    intrepid and ambitious soldier, turned his thoughts towards the conquest of
                    Cutch-Gundava, then held by different petty chiefs, under the authority of the
                    Nawabs of Sindh.</p>
                <p>After various success, the Kumburanees at length possessed themselves of the
                    sovereignty of a considerable portion of that fruitful plain, including the
                    chief town, Gundava. It was during this contest that the famous Nadir Shah
                    advanced from Persia to the invasion of Hindustan; and while at Kandahar, he
                    despatched several detachments into Baluchistan, and established his authority
                    in that province. Abdulla Khan, however, was continued in the government of the
                    country by Nadir’s orders; but he was soon after killed in a battle with the
                    forces of the Nawabs of Sindh. He was succeeded by his eldest son, Hajee
                    Mohummud Khan, who abandoned himself to the most tyrannical and licentious way
                    of life, and alienated his subjects by oppressive taxation. In these
                    circumstances Nusseer Khan, the second son of Abdulla Khan, who had accompanied
                    the victorious Nadir to Delhi, and acquired the favour and confidence of that
                    monarch, returned to Khelat, and was hailed by the whole population as their
                    deliverer. Finding that expostulation had no effect upon his brother, he one day
                    entered his apartment and stabbed him to the heart. As soon as the tyrant was
                    dead, Nusseer Khan mounted the <hi rend="italic">musnud,</hi> amidst the
                    universal joy of his subjects; and immediately transmitted a report of the
                    events which had taken place to Nadir Shah, who was then encamped near Kandahar.
                    The shah received the intelligence with satisfaction, and despatched a firman,
                    by return of the messenger, appointing Nusseer Khan beglerbey of all
                    Baluchistan. This event took place in the year 1739.</p>
                <p>Nusseer Khan proved an active, politic, and warlike prince. He took great pains
                    to re-establish the internal governmentof all the provinces in his dominions,
                    and improved and fortified the city of Khelat. On the death of Nadir Shah in
                    1747, he acknowledged the title of the king of Cabul, Ahmed Shah Abdulla. In
                    1758 he declared himself entirely independent; upon which Ahmed Shah despatched
                    a force against him, under one of his ministers. The khan, however, raised an
                    army and totally routed the Afghan army. On receiving intelligence of this
                    discomfiture, the king himself marched with strong reinforcements, and a pitched
                    battle was fought, in which Nusseer Khan was worsted. He retired in good order
                    to Khelat, whither he was followed by the victor, who invested the place with
                    his whole army. The khan made a vigorous defence; and, after the royal troops
                    had been foiled in their attempts to take the city by storm or surprise, a
                    negotiation was proposed by the king, which terminated in a treaty of peace. By
                    this treaty it was stipulated that the king was to receive the cousin of Nusseer
                    Khan in marriage; and that the khan was to pay no tribute, but only, when called
                    upon, to furnish troops to assist the armies, for which he was to receive an
                    allowance in cash equal to half their pay. The khan frequently distinguished
                    himself in the subsequent wars of Cabul; and, as a reward for his services, the
                    king bestowed upon him several districts in perpetual and entire sovereignty.
                    Having succeeded in quelling a dangerous rebellion, headed by his cousin Beheram
                    Khan, this able prince at length died in extreme old age, in the month of June
                    1795, leaving three sons and five daughters. He <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0903-0316-0301"/> was succeeded by his eldest son Muhmood Khan,
                    then a boy of about fourteen years. During the reign of this prince, who has
                    been described as a very humane and indolent man, the country was distracted by
                    sanguinary broils; the governors of several provinces and districts withdrew
                    their allegiance; and the dominions of the khans of Khelat gradually so
                    diminished, that they now comprehend only a small portion of the provinces
                    formerly subject to Nusseer Khan.</p>
                <p>In 1839, when the British army advanced through the Bolan Pass towards
                    Afghanistan, the conduct of Mehrab Khan, the ruler of Baluchistan, was
                    considered so treacherous and dangerous, as to require “the exaction of
                    retribution from that chieftain,” and “the execution of such arrangements as
                    would establish future security in that quarter.” General Willshire was
                    accordingly detached from the army of the Indus with 1050 men to assault Khelat.
                    A gate was knocked in by the field-pieces, and the town and citadel were stormed
                    in a few minutes. Above 400 Baluches were slain, among them Mehrab Khan himself;
                    and 2000 prisoners were taken. Subsequent inquiries have, however, proved that
                    the treachery towards the British was not on the part of Mehrab Khan, but on
                    that of his vizier, Mahomed Hassein, and certain chiefs with whom he was in
                    league, and at whose instigation the British convoys were plundered in their
                    passage through Cutch-Gundava and in the Bolan Pass. The treacherous vizier,
                    however, made our too credulous political officers believe that Mehrab Khan was
                    to blame,—his object being to bring his master to ruin and to obtain for himself
                    all power in the state, knowing that Mehrab’s successor was only a child. How
                    far he succeeded in his object history has shown. In the following year Khelat
                    changed hands, the governor established by the British, together with a feeble
                    garrison, being overpowered. At the close of the same year it was reoccupied by
                    the British under General Nott. In 1841, Nusseer Khan, the youthful son of the
                    slain Mehrab Khan, was recognized by the British, who soon after evacuated the
                    country.</p>
                <p>From the conquest of Sindh by the British troops under the command of the late
                    General Sir Charles Napier in 1843 up to 1854, no diplomatic intercourse
                    occurred worthy of note between the British and Baluch states. In the latter
                    year, however, under the governor-generalship of the late marquis of Dalhousie,
                    the late General John Jacob, C.B., at the time political superintendent and
                    commandant on the Sindh frontier, was deputed to arrange and conclude a treaty
                    between the Khelat state, then under the chieftainship of Meer Nusseer Khan, and
                    the British Government. This treaty was executed on the 14th of May 1854, and
                    was to the following effect :—</p>
                <p>“That the former offensive and defensive treaty, concluded in 1841 by Major
                    Outram between the British Government and Meer Nusseer Khan, chief of Khelat,
                    was to be annulled.</p>
                <p>“That Meer Nusseer Khan, his heirs and successors, bound themselves to oppose to
                    the utmost all the enemies of the British Government, and in all cases to act in
                    subordinate co-operation with that Government, and to enter into no negotiations
                    with other states without its consent.</p>
                <p>, “That should it be deemed necessary to station British troops in any part of
                    the territory of Khelat, they shall occupy such positions as may be thought
                    advisable by the British authorities.</p>
                <p>“That the Baluch chief was to prevent all plundering on the part of his subjects
                    within, or in the neighbourhood of, British territory.</p>
                <p>“That he waβ further to protect all merchants passing through his territory, and
                    only to exact from them a transit duty, fixed by schedule attached to the
                    treaty; and that, on condition of a faithful performance of these duties, he was
                    to receive from the British Government an annual subsidy of 50,000 rupees
                    (£5000).”</p>
                <p>The provisions of the above treaty were most loyally performed by Meer Nusseer
                    Khan up to the time of his death in 1856. He was succeeded by his brother, Meer
                    Khodadad Khan, the present ruler, a youth of twelve years of age, who, however,
                    did not obtain his position before he had put down by force a rebellion on the
                    part of his turbulent chiefs, who had first elected him, but, not receiving what
                    they considered an adequate reward from his treasury, sought to depose him in
                    favour of his cousin Shere dil Khan. In the latter part of 1857, the Indian
                    rebellion being at its height, and the.city of Delhi still in the hands of the
                    rebels, a British officer (Major Henry Green) was deputed, on the part of the
                    British Government, to reside, as political agent, with the khan at Khelat, and
                    to assist him by his advice in maintaining control over his turbulent tribes.
                    This duty was successfully performed until 1863, when, during the temporary
                    absence of Major Malcolm Green, the then political agent, Khodadad Khan was, at
                    the instigation of some of his principal chiefs, attacked, while out riding, by
                    his cousin, Shere dil Khan, and severely wounded. Khodadad fled in safety to a
                    residence close to the British border, and Shere dil Khan was elected and
                    proclaimed khan. His rule was, however, a short one, for, early in 1864, when
                    proceeding to Khelat, he was murdered in the Gundava Pass; and Khodadad was
                    again elected chief by the very men who had only the previous year caused his
                    overthrow, and who had lately been accomplices to the murder of his cousin.
                    Since the above events Khodadad has maintained his precarious position with
                    great difficulty; but owing to his inability to govern his unruly subjects
                    without material assistance from the British Government, which they are not
                    disposed to give, his country has gradually fallen into the greatest anarchy;
                    and, consequently, some of the provisions of the treaty of 1854 having been
                    broken, diplomatic relations have been discontinued with the Khelat state since
                    the end of 1874.</p>
                <p>The territories of Baluchistan are now comprised under the following
                    divisions—Jalawan, Sara wan, Khelat, Mekran, Lus, Cutch-Gundava, and
                    Kohistan.</p>
                <p>The most remarkable features of this extensive country are its rugged and
                    elevated surface, its barrenness, and its deficiency of water. The mass of
                    mountains which forms the eastern boundary of that division of Baluchistan
                    called the Kohistan, or mountain territory, lying between the capital, Khelat
                    (lat. 29° 1' 38"N., long, about 66° 39'E.), and the plain country to the east of
                    it, designated Cutchee, or Cutch-Gundava, is composed of several parallel ranges
                    of limestone rock, in close proximity to each other, having a general strike of
                    N.N.E. to S.S. W. and a breadth of about 55 miles. This range originates in
                    Afghanistan, and enters Baluchistan north of the Bolan Pass in about 30° N. lat.
                    and about 60° 30' E. long, under the name Herbooe; and, after throwing out a
                    branch to the eastward, which touches the River Indus at Sehwan, terminates
                    under the designation of the Ξala Mountains, at Cape Monze on the coast of the
                    Arabian Sea, W. of Kurrachee, in about 25° N. lat and 66° 68' E. long., thus
                    having a total length of upwards of 300 miles. The highest mountain of this
                    range is the Chehil Tan, bearing about N. by E., 85 miles from Khelat, and
                    attaining an altitude of 12,000 feet above the sea. The western range of the
                    Herbooe Mountains in this portion of Baluchistan are barren and without timber,
                    and scantily peopled with pastoral tribes of Brahoes, who emigrate to the plains
                    of Cutchee on the approach of the winter months.</p>
                <p>North of the Bolan River and Pass tne Herbooe Mountains are met, in about lat. N.
                    30°, by confused ranges <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0903-0317-0302"/> of rough precipitous mountains, which extend to
                    the eastward with a strike nearly E. and W. to the Sooliman range, in about 29°
                    <hi rend="italic">5'</hi> N. lat. and about 69° 30' E. long. This tract is
                    almost entirely inhabited by Murrees, Boogtees, and other tribes of Baluch
                    plunderers, and is bounded on the N. by the province of Sewestan. South of these
                    ranges lies the desert country, which touches the Sindh frontier in 28" 27' N.
                    lat.</p>
                <p>The two principal water-courses which drain the Kohistan portion of Baluchistan
                    E. of Khelat are the rivers Bolan and Moola, the former rising about 60 miles
                    N.E. of Khelat, the latter at Anjeera, lat. 28° 19' N., long, about 66° 29' E.,
                    about 45 miles south of that city. They both discharge themselves into the
                    plains of Cutchee, the former at Dadur, lat. about 29° 28' 5Γ <hi
                    rend="superscript"> ,</hi> N., long, about 67° 26' E,, and the latter at Kotra
                    near Gundava, lat. 28° 33' 47" N., long, about 67° 26' E. There is at all
                    seasons a plentiful supply of clear running water in these streams, which is
                    entirely used up for irrigational purposes on issuing into the plains. They are
                    subject to dangerous floods from sudden storms in the neighbouring mountains
                    during the rainy season. The two easiest and safest passes from Central Asia
                    into India take their names from these streams. South of the Moola the Gaj River
                    issues into the plains, and its waters are also absorbed in cultivation. The
                    Nara issues into the plains near Kujjuk, N.W. corner of Cutch-Gundava, in lat.
                    about 29° 36' N., and long, about 68° 2' E.; ordinarily its water is utilized
                    entirely for cultivation in its course through the Afghan province of Seebee;
                    but at periods of heavy rains in the mountains it is liable to burst its banks,
                    and then inundates immense tracts in the Cutchee desert to the south.</p>
                <p>West of Khelat, as far as about 65° 30' E. long., the mountain ranges have much
                    the same strike, and are of the same nature as those to the eastward, but the
                    ranges are much narrower, more defined, and of a lower altitude. The valleys
                    between them vary from 5 to 15 miles in breadth; they are quite devoid of trees.
                    The water-courses generally follow the direction of the hills from N. to S. and
                    in some instances during heavy rains their waters reach the Arabian Sea; but as
                    a general rule they are absorbed long before they reach the coast, partly in
                    cultivation, but principally by the sandy arid nature of the soil and excessive
                    dryness of the atmosphere,—due, probably, to tho proximity of the great desert
                    west of Kharan, which extends to the confines of Persia. The most important of
                    these watercourses is the Dustee or Mooleanee.</p>
                <p>The climate of Baluchistan is extremely various in the different provinces. The
                    soil in general is exceedingly stony. In the province of Cutch-Gundava, however,
                    it is rich and loamy, and so very productive, that, it is said, were it all
                    properly cultivated, the crops would be more than sufficient for the supply of
                    the whole of Baluchistan. Gold, silver, lead, iron, tin, antimony, brimstone,
                    alum, sal-ammoniac, and many kinds of mineral salts, and saltpetre, are found in
                    various parts of the country. The precious metals have only been discovered in
                    working for iron and lead, in mines near the town of Nal, about 150 miles S.S.W.
                    of Khelat. The different other minerals above enumerated are very plentiful. The
                    gardens of Khelat produce many sorts of fruit, which are sold at a very moderate
                    rate, such as apricots, peaches, grapes, almonds, pistachio-nuts, apples, pears,
                    plums, currants, cherries, quinces, figs, pomegranates, mulberries, plantains,
                    melons, guavas, &amp;c. All kinds of grain known in India are cultivated in the
                    different provinces of Baluchistan, and there is abundance of vegetables.
                    Madder, cotton, and indigo are also produced; and the latter is considered
                    superior to that of Bengal. Great attention is given to the culture of the date
                    fruit in the province of Mekran.</p>
                <p>The domestic animals of Baluchistan are horses, mules, asses, camels, buffaloes,
                    black-cattle, sheep, goats, dogs, and cats, besides fowls and pigeons; but there
                    are neitheι geese, turkeys, nor ducks. The wild animals are tigers, leopards,
                    hyenas, wolves, jackals, tiger-cats, wild dogs, foxes, hares, mangooses,
                    mountain goats, antelopes, elks, red and moose deer, wild asses, &amp;c. Of
                    birds they have almost every species to be met with either in Europe or
                    India.</p>
                <p>The principal towns in Baluchistan are as follows :— <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Khelat</hi> is the capital of the whole country; <hi rend="italic"
                    >Mustoong,</hi> of the province of Sarawan; <hi rend="italic">Kozdar</hi><hi
                    rend="italic subscript"> i</hi> of Jalawan; <hi rend="italic">Beyla,</hi> of
                    Beyla; <hi rend="italic">Kej,</hi> of Mekran; <hi rend="italic">Bagh,</hi> of
                    Cutch-Gundava; and Dadur and Gundava are towns in the last-mentioned
                    province.</p>
                <p>The capital stands on an elevated site 7000 feet above the sea, on the western
                    side of a well-cultivated plain or valley, about eight miles long and two or
                    three broad, a great part of which is laid out in gardens and other enclosures.
                    The town is built in an oblong form, and on three sides is defended by a mud
                    wall, 18 or 20 feet high, flanked, at intervals of' 250 yards, by bastions,
                    which, as well as the wall itself, are pierced w ith numerous loopholes for
                    matchlock-men. The defence of the fourth side of the city has been formed by
                    cutting away perpendicularly the western face of the hill on which it is partly
                    built. On the summit of this eminence stands the palace, commanding a distinct
                    view of the town and adjacent country. That quarter of the hill on which the
                    khan’s residence is erected has been enclosed by a mud wall, with bastions; the
                    entrance to it is on the south-western side; and here, as well as at the city
                    gates, which are three in number, there is constantly a guard of matchlock-men.
                    Both town and citadel are, however, completely commanded by the surrounding
                    hills, and are incapable of offering any resistance against artillery. Within
                    the walls there are upwards of 2500 houses, and the number of these in the
                    suburbs probably exceeds one-half of that amount. The houses are mostly built of
                    half-burnt brick or wooden frames, and plastered over with mud or mortar. In
                    general, the streets are broader than those of native towns, and most of them
                    have a raised pathway on each side for foot-passengers, and have also an
                    uncovered kennel in the centre, which is a nuisance, from the quantity of filth
                    thrown into it, and the stagnant rain-water that lodges there. The upper stories
                    of the houses frequently project across the street, and thereby render the part
                    beneath them gloomy and damp. This seems a very rude attempt to imitate the
                    bazaars of Persia and Cabul. The bazaar of Khelat is extensive, well furnished
                    with every kind of goods; all the necessaries of life may be purchased there at
                    a moderate price. The town is supplied with delicious water from a spring in the
                    face of a hill on the opposite side of a plain, whence it meanders nearly
                    through its centre, having the town and suburbs on one side, and on the other
                    the gardens. It may be remarked of this spring, that the waters, at their
                    immediate issue from the smaller channels, possess a considerable degree of
                    tepidity until after sunrise, when they suddenly become exceedingly cold, and
                    remain so during the day.</p>
                <p>We have no data from which we can form an accurate computation of the population
                    of Baluchistan, but it may be estimated at about 400,000. The two great races of
                    Baluch and Brahoe, each subdivided into an infinite number of tribes, are
                    clearly distinguished from each other by their language and appearance. The
                    Baluch, or Baluchekee, language partakes considerably of the idiom of the modern
                    Persian, although greatly disguised under a singularly corrupt pronunciation.
                    The Brahoekee, on the other hand, has nothing analogous to Persian, but appears
                    to contain a <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit03newyrich/page/n318/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0903-0318-0303"/> great number of ancient Hinduwee words; and, as
                    it strikes the ear, bears a strong resemblance to the dialect spoken in the
                    Panjaub. The Baluches in general have tall figures, long visages, and raised
                    features; the Brahoes, on the contrary, have short, thick bones, with round
                    faces and flat lineaments.</p>
                <p>The Baluches are a handsome, active race of men, not possessing great physical
                    strength, but inured to changes of climate and season, and capable of enduring
                    every species of fatigue. In their habits they are pastoral and much addicted to
                    predatory warfare, in the course of which they do not hesitate to commit every
                    kind of outrage and cruelty. Notwithstanding their predatory habits, however,
                    they are considered to be a hospitable people. After the fashion of other
                    barbarous tribes in that part of the world, they will protect and kindly
                    entertain a stranger while their guest, but feel no scruple in robbing and
                    murdering him as soon as he has left their precincts. They are indolent, and
                    unless excited by amusement or war, or compelled to action by some urgent
                    motive, spend their time in idleness, rude dissipation, and the enjoyment of
                    such coarse luxuries a3 they can procure—in lounging, gambling, smoking tobacco
                    or hemp, and chewing opium. The tenets of their religion,—and still more,
                    perhaps, their poverty,—preserve them from the abuse of fermented liquors. Their
                    principal articles of food are milk in all its forms, the flesh of domestic
                    animals, not excepting that of the camel, and game, including wild asses, the
                    flesh of which is considered a delicacy. Their appetites are voracious; they
                    consume incredible quantities of flesh when it can be obtained, and prefer it in
                    a half-cooked state. They also use grain in the form of bread, and prepared
                    variously otherwise; but they enjoy most such articles of food or condiment as
                    possess a strong and stimulating flavour, as capsicum, onions, and garlic. Their
                    indolence prompts them to keep as many slaves as they can obtain and support.
                    Polygamy is universal. Some of the lower orders have as many as eight women,
                    either as wives or mistresses, and the number is increased in proportion to the
                    rank and means of the man. Wives are obtained by purchase, payment being made in
                    cattle or other articles of pastoral wealth. The ceremony of marriage is
                    performed by the moollah or priest; and on this occasion, as well as on some
                    others affecting females, practices similar to those of the Levitical law are
                    observed. For instance, in this country, as also among the Afghans, a man is
                    expected to marry the widow of a deceased brother. When a death takes place, the
                    body is watched for three successive nights by assembled friends and neighbours,
                    who spend their time in feasting, so that the ceremony seems intended rather to
                    furnish enjoyment to the living than to render honour to the dead.</p>
                <p>The common dress of the Brahoes is a coarse white or blue calico shirt, buttoned
                    round the neck, and reaching below the knee; their trousers are made of the same
                    cloth, or of a kind of striped stuff called soosee, and puckered round the
                    ankles. On their heads they wear a small silk or cotton quilted cap, fitted to
                    the shape of the skull, and a <hi rend="italic">kummurbund</hi> or sash, of the
                    same colour, round their waists. The Baluches wear a similar dress, but a turban
                    on the head and wide trousers unconfined at the ankle. In winter the chiefs and
                    their relatives appear in a tunic of chintz, lined and stuffed with cotton; and
                    the poorer classes, when out of doors, wrap themselves up in a surtout made of
                    cloth, manufactured from a mixture of goats’ hair and sheep’s wool. The women’s
                    dress is very similar to that of the men; their trousers are preposterously
                    wide, and made of silk, or a mixture of silk and cotton.</p>
                <p>The fluctuation of power renders it difficult to define precisely the nature of
                    the government of Khelat. During the reign of Nusseer Khan the whole kingdom
                    might be said to have been governed by a complete despotism; yet that ruler so
                    tempered the supreme authority by the privileges granted to the feudal chiefs
                    within their own tribes, that, to a casual observer, it bore the appearance of a
                    military confederation. The tribes all exercise the right of selecting their own
                    <hi rend="italic">sirdar,</hi> or head; and the khan has the power of confirming
                    or disapproving of their nomination; but this power is never exercised, and
                    appears to be merely nominal. The khan of Khelat declares war and makes treaties
                    connected with the whole of Baluchistan, and can order the sirdar of each tribe
                    to attend in person with his quota of troops. Agreeably to a code of regulations
                    framed by one of the earliest princes of the Kumburanee dynasty, the entire
                    administration of justice was vested in the person at the head of the
                    government. The sirdar, however, has the power of adjusting petty quarrels,
                    thefts, and disputed points of every description, among the inhabitants of a
                    kheil or society; but, in all cases of importance, an appeal lies in the last
                    instance to the khan at Khelat.</p>
                <p>The amount of revenue enjoyed by the khan of Khelat is inconsiderable, as the
                    ruling races, Baluch and Brahoe, pay no direct taxes, and their poverty and
                    simple habits prevent them from contributing much indirectly. His income is
                    therefore derived from his resources as a proprietor of lands or towns; from a
                    proportion of the produce paid in kind by the Afghan, Dehwar, and Jet
                    cultivators; from dues on direct and transit trade; and from arbitrary
                    exactions, a never-failing mode with Eastern potentates of recruiting an
                    exhausted treasury. Pöttinger estimated the amount at 350,000 rupees; Masson,
                    who had ample means of acquiring information through colloquial channels, at
                    300,000. At the present date (1875) it is 300,000 rupees or £30,000 at the
                    utmost. With such a revenue it is obvious that no standing army can be
                    maintained; and Masson, certainly very competent to the task of acquiring
                    information on this subject, states that Mehrab Khan, “nearly destitute of
                    troope in his own pay, was compelled, on the slightest cause for alarm, to
                    appeal to the tribes, who attended or otherwise as suited their whims or
                    convenience.” Pöttinger computed the number of available fighting men at 60,000.
                    Mehrab Khan could on no occasion assemble more than 12,000; and in his final
                    struggle for property, power, and life, the number of his troops did not amount
                    to 3000. At the present time (1875) about 40,000 would probably be available if
                    all attended the summons, but the utmost number the khan could collect would be
                    about 10,000. All depends upon the state of the treasury, the cause of the war,
                    and the power the khan may be able to exert over his chiefs. The Baluch soldier
                    is heavily encumbered with arms, carrying a matchlock, a sword, a dagger, and a
                    shield. Pöttinger considered them good marksmen, and states that in action they
                    trust principally to their skill in this respect, avoiding close combat; but
                    their readiness in general to close with the British troops shows that he is in
                    this instance mistaken. There were no Brahoes opposed to our forces at the
                    battle of Meanee, nor were there any Baluches from Baluchistan. The levies of
                    the Ameer of Sindh were principally composed of Sindee and Baluch tribes, who
                    had long been settled in Sindh. The greater part serve on foot; but a number,
                    not inconsiderable, have horses. Camels are only used by tribes on the western
                    borders of Baluchistan in their predatory excursions.</p>
