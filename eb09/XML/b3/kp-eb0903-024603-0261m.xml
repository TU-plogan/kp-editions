                    the following year he had the misfortune to fall into the hands of Hyder Ali, in
                    the Mysore chief’s perfidious attack on a handful of British troops at
                    Perambucum. The prisoners, it is well known, were most barbarously treated.
                    Baird survived his captivity; and on his release, visited his native country,
                    but returned to India in 1791 as a lieutenant-coloneL When Harris marched
                    against Tippoo Sahib, Baird, now a majorgeneral, served under him in that
                    campaign; and when it was resolved to storm Seringapatam, he solicited and
                    obtained the honour of leading the storming party to the breach. He made a
                    daring assault, and was soon a master of the stronghold in which he had long
                    been the prisoner. Through some misconception, Baird seems to have looked upon
                    the temporary appointment of Colonel Wellesley to hold the captured town as
                    permanently superseding him, and on this ground he judged himself to have been
                    treated with injustice and disrespect. He afterwards received the thanks of the
                    British Parliament and of the East India Company for his gallant bearing on that
                    important day, and a pension was offered him by the Company, which he declined,
                    apparently from the hope of receiving the order of the Bath from the Government.
                    General Baird commanded the Indian army which was sent in 1801 to co-operate
                    with Hutchinson in the expulsion of the French from Egypt. He landed at Kosseir,
                    conducted his army to Keneh on the Nile, and thence to Rosetta, where he arrived
                    just as the French were treating for the evacuation of Alexandria. On his return
                    to India in 1802 he was employed against Scindia, but irritated at some neglect
                    he had experienced, he relinquished his command and returned to Europe. In 1804
                    he was knighted, and in the following year commanded the expedition against the
                    Cape of Good Hope, and captured Cape Town; but here again his usual ill-luck
                    attended him, for he was recalled before he had organised his conquest, for
                    having sanctioned the expedition of Sir Home Popham against Buenos Ayres. He
                    served again in 1807 in the expedition against Copenhagen, and in the following
                    year commanded the considerable force which was sent to Spain to co-operate with
                    Sir John Moore. In the battle of Coruna, where, after the death of Moore, he
                    held supreme command, a grape-shot shattered his left arm, so that it had to be
                    amputated at the shoulder-joint. He again obtained the thanks of Parliament for
                    his gallant services, and was rewarded with the decoration of the order of the
                    Bath, and the rank of a baronet. Sir David married Miss Campbell Preston, a
                    Perthshire heiress, in 1810. In 1820 he was appointed commanderin-chief in
                    Ireland; but the post does not appear to have been suitable for him, and he was
                    removed in 1821. From that period he no more appeared in public life. He died on
                    the 18th August 1829. (See Hook’s <hi rend="italic">Life of Sir David
