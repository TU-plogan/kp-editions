                <p><label type="entry">BERNOULLI, or <hi rend="smallcaps">Bernouilli</hi></label>, a
                    name illustrious in the annals of science, belonging to a family of
                    respectability, originally of Antwerp. Driven from their country during the
                    oppressive government of Spain for their attachment to the Reformed religion,
                    the family sought first an asylum at Frankfort (1583), and afterwards at Basel,
                    where they ultimately obtained the highest distinctions. In the course of a
                    century eight of its members successfully cultivated various branches of
                    mathematics, and contributed powerfully to the advance of science. The most
                    celebrated of the family were James, John, and Daniel; but, for the sake of
                    perspicuity they may be considered as nearly as possible in the order of family
                    succession.</p>
                <p>I. <hi rend="smallcaps">James Bernoulli</hi> was born at Basel on the 27th
                    December 1654. He was educated at the public school of Basel, and also received
                    private instruction from the learned Hoffmann, then professor of Greek. At the
                    conclusion of his philosophical studies at the university, soma <pb break="no"

                    excited in him a passion for mathematical pursuits, and in spite of the
                    opposition of his father, who wished him to be a clergyman, he applied himself
                    in secret to his favourite science. In 1676 he visited Geneva on his way to
                    France, and subsequently travelled to England and Holland. While at Geneva he
                    taught a blind girl several branches of science, and also how to write; and this
                    led him to publish <hi rend="italic">A Method of Teaching Mathematics to the
                    Blind.</hi> At Bordeaux his <hi rend="italic">Universal Tables on Dialling</hi>
                    were constructed; and in London he was admitted to the meetings of Boyle, Hooke,
                    Stillingfleet, and other learned and scientific men.</p>
                <p>On his final return to Basel in 1682, he devoted himself to physical and
                    mathematical investigations, and opened a public seminary for experimental
                    physics. In the same year he published his essay on comets, <hi rend="italic"

                    rend="italic">Cometarum,</hi> which was occasioned by the appearance of the
                    comet of 1680. This essay, and his next publication, entitled <hi rend="italic"
                    >De Gravitate</hi><hi rend="italic">Aetheris,</hi> were deeply tinged with the
                    philosophy of Descartes, but they contain truths not unworthy of the philosophy
                    of the <hi rend="italic">Principia.</hi></p>
                <p>James Bernoulli cannot be strictly called an independent discoverer; but, from
                    his extensive and successful application of the calculus, he is well deserving
                    of a place by the side of Newton and Leibnitz. As an additional claim to
                    remembrance, he was the first to solve Leibnitz’s problem of the isochronous
                    curve, and to determine the catenary, or curve formed by a chain suspended by
                    its two extremities, which he also showed to be the same as the curvature of a
                    sail filled with wind. This led him on to another curve, which, being formed by
                    an elastic plate or rod fixed at one end and bent by a weight applied to the
                    other, he called the elastic curve, and which he showed to be the same as the
                    curvature of an impervious sail filled with a liquid. In his investigations
                    respecting cycloidal lines and various »spiral curves, his attention was
                    directed to the loxodromic and logarithmic spirals, in the last of which he took
                    particular interest from its remarkable property of reproducing itself under a
                    great variety of conditions.</p>
                <p>In 1696 he proposed the famous problem of isoperimetrical figures, and offered a
                    reward for its solution. This problem engaged the attention of British as well
                    as Continental mathematicians; and its proposal gave rise to a painful quarrel
                    between the brothers. John offered a solution of the problem; his brother
                    pronounced it to be wrong. John then amended his solution, and again offered it,
                    and claimed the reward. James still declared it to be no solution, and soon
                    after published his own. In 1701 he published also the demonstration of his
                    solution, which was accepted by De ΓHopital and Leibnitz. John, however, held
                    his peace for several years, and then dishonestly published, after the death of
                    James, another incorrect solution; and not until 1718 did he admit that he had
                    been in error. Even then he set forth as his own his brother’s solution
                    purposely disguised.</p>
                <p>In 1687 the mathematical chair of the University of Basel was conferred upon
                    James; and in the discharge of its duties he was so successful as to attract
                    students from other countries. Some of his pupils became afterwards professors
                    in the universities of Germany. He was once made rector of his university, and
                    had other distinctions bestowed on him. He and his brother John were the first
                    two foreign associates of the Academy of Sciences at Paris; and, at the request
                    of Leibnitz, they were both received as members of the Academy of Berlin. In
                    1684 he had been offered a professorship at Heidelberg; but his marriage with a
                    lady of his native city led him to decline the invitation. Intense application
                    brought on infirmities and a slow fever, of which he died on the 16th of August
                    1705, with the resignation of a Christian and the firmness of a philosopher.
                    Like another Archimedes, he requested that, as a monument of his labours and an
                    emblem of his hope of a resurrection, the logarithmic spiral should be engraven
                    on his tombstone, with these words, <hi rend="italic">Eadem mutata
                    resurgo.</hi></p>
                <p>James Bernoulli wrote elegant verses in Latin, German, and French; but although
                    these were held in high estimation in his own time, it is on his mathematical
                    works that his fame now rests. These are—(1.) <hi rend="italic">Jacobi Bernoulli

                <p>II. <hi rend="smallcaps">John Bernoulli,</hi> brother of the preceding, was born
                    at Basel on the 7th August 1667. His education was begun at six years of age;
                    and after finishing his literary studies he was sent to Neufchâtel to learn
                    commerce and acquire the French language. But at the end of a year he renounced
                    the pursuits of commerce, returned to the University of Basel, and was admitted
                    to the degree of bachelor in philosophy, and a year later, at the age of 18, to
                    that of master of arts. In his studies he was aided by his elder brother James.
                    Chemistry, as well as mathematics, seems to have been the object of his early
                    attention; and in the year 1690 he published a dissertation on effervescence and
                    fermentation. The same year he went to Geneva, where he gave instruction in the
                    differential calculus to Fatio de Duiller, and afterwards proceeded to Paris,
                    where he enjoyed the society of Malebranche, Cassini, De Lahire, and Varignon.
                    With the Marquis de l’Hôpital he spent four months at his country house in the
                    study of the higher geometry and the resources of the new calculus. His
                    independent discoveries in mathematics are numerous and important. Among these
                    were the exponential calculus, and the curve called by him the <hi rend="italic"
                    >linea</hi><hi rend="italic">brachistochrona,</hi> or line of swiftest descent,
                    which he was the first to determine, pointing out at the same time the beautiful
                    relation which this curve bears to the path described by a ray or particle of
                    light passing through strata of variable density, such as our atmosphere. On his
                    return to his native city he studied medicine, and in 1694 took the degree of
                    M.D. At this period he married into one of the oldest families in Basel; and
                    although he had declined a professorship in Germany, he now accepted an
                    invitation to the chair of mathematics at Groningen <hi rend="italic"
                    >{Commercium Philosophicum,</hi> epist. xi and xii.) There, in addition to the
                    learned lectures by which he endeavoured to revive mathematical science in the
                    university, he gave a public course of experimental physics. During a residence
                    of ten years in Groningen, his controversies were almost as numerous as his
                    discoveries. His dissertation on an electrical appearance of the barometer first
                    observed by Picard, and discussed by John Bernoulli under the name of mercurial
                    phosphorus, or mercury shining in vacuo <hi rend="italic">{Diss.</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Physica</hi><hi rend="italic">de Mercurio</hi><hi rend="italic"

                    royalty, and engaged him in controversy. Through Leibnitz he received from the
                    king of Prussia a gold medal for his supposed discoveries; but Hartsoeker and
                    some of the French academicians disputed the fact. The family quarrel about the
                    problem of isoperimetrical figures above mentioned began about this time. In his
                    dispute with his brother, in his controversies with the English and Scotch
                    mathematicians, and in his harsh and jealous bearing to his son Daniel, he
                    showed a temper mean, unfair, and violent. He had declined, during his residence
                    at Groningen, an invitation to Utrecht, but accepted in 1705 the mathematical
                    chair in the university of his native city, vacant by the death of his brother
                    James; and here he remained till his death. His inaugural discourse was on the
                    “new analysis,” which he so successfully applied in investigating <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0903-0623-0606"/> various problems both in pure and mixed
                    mathematics. At the request of the magistracy of Basel he applied himself to
                    correct the relaxed discipline of the university.</p>
                <p>He was several times a successful competitor for the prizes given by the Academy
                    of Sciences of Paris; and the subjects of his essays were, the laws of motion
                    <hi rend="italic">{Discours sur les Lois de la Communication du Mouvement,</hi>
                    1727), the elliptical orbits of the planets, and the inclinations of the

                    >Physique</hi><hi rend="italic">Céleste,</hi> 1735). In the last case his son
                    Daniel divided the prize with him. Some years after his return to Basel he
                    published an essay, entitled <hi rend="italic">Nouvelle Théorie de la Manoeuvre
                    des Vaisseaux.</hi> It is, however, his works in pure mathematics that are the
                    permanent monuments of his fame. D’Alembert acknowledges with gratitude, that
                    “whatever he knew of mathematics he owed to the works of John Bernoulli. " He
                    was a member of almost every learned society in Europe, and one of the first
                    mathematicians of a mathematical-age. He was as keen in his resentments as he
                    was ardent in his friendships; fondly attached to his family, he yet disliked a
                    deserving son; he gave full praise to Leibnitz and Euler, yet was blind to the
                    excellence of Newton. Such was the vigour of his constitution that he continued
                    to pursue his usual mathematical studies till the age of eighty. He was then
                    attacked by a complaint at first apparently trifling; but his strength daily and
                    rapidly declined till the 1st of January 1748, when he died peacefully in his
                    sleep.</p>
                <p>His writings were collected under his own eye by Cramer, professor of mathematics
                    at Geneva, and published under the title of <hi rend="italic">Johannis</hi><hi

                <p>III. <hi rend="smallcaps">Nicholas Bernoulli,</hi> the eldest of the three sons
                    of John Bernoulli, was born in 1695. His early indications of genius were
                    carefully cherished. At the age of eight he could speak German, Dutch, French,
                    and Latin. When his father returned to Basel he went to the university of that
                    city, where, at the age of sixteen, he took the degree of doctor in philosophy,
                    and four years later the highest degree in law. Meanwhile the study of
                    mathematics was not neglected, as appears not only from his giving instructions
                    in geometry to his younger brother Daniel, but from his writings on the
                    differential, integral, and exponential calculus, and from his father
                    considering him, at the age of twenty-one, worthy of receiving the torch of
                    science from his own liande. ( “Lampada nunc tradam filio meo natu maximo,
                    juveni xxi. annorum, ingenio mathematico aliisque dotibus satis instructo,” <hi
                    rend="italic">Com. Phil.</hi> ep. 223). With his father’s permission he visited
                    Italy and France, and during his travels formed friendship with Varignon and
                    with Riccati, one of the first mathematicians of Italy. The invitation of a
                    Venetian nobleman induced him again to visit Italy, where he resided two years,
                    till his return to be a candidate for the chair of jurisprudence at Basel. He
                    was unsuccessful, but was soon afterwards appointed to a similar office in the
                    University of Bern. Here he resided three years, his happiness only marred by
                    regret on account of his separation from his brother Daniel, with whom he was
                    united in sentiment and pursuits. Both were appointed at the same time
                    professors of mathematics in the Academy &lt;tf St Petersburg; but this office
                    Nicholas enjoyed for little more than eight months. At the end of July 1726 he
                    was cut off in the prime of life by a lingering fever. Sensible of the loss
                    which the nation had sustained by his death, the Empress Catherine ordered him a
                    funeral at the public expense. Some of his papers are published in his father’s
                    works, and others in the <hi rend="italic">Acta</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Eruditorum</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">Comment. Acad. Petropol.</hi></p>
                <p>IV. <hi rend="smallcaps">Daniel Bernoulli,</hi> the second son of JohnBernoulli,
                    was born 9th February 1700, at Groningen. He studied medicine and became a
                    physician, but his attention was early directed also to geometrical studies. The
                    severity of his father’s manner was ill calculated to encourage the first
                    efforts of one so sensitive; but fortunately, at the age of eleven, he became
                    the pupil of his brother Nicholas. He afterwards studied in Italy under
                    Michelotti and Morgagni. After his return, though only twenty-four years of age,
                    he was invited to become president of an academy then projected at Genoa; but,
                    declining this honour, he was, in the following year, appointed professor of
                    mathematics at St Petersburg. In consequence of the state of his health,
                    however, he returned to Basel in 1733, where he was appointed professor of
                    anatomy and botany, and afterwards of experimental and speculative philosophy.
                    In the labours of this office he spent the remaining years of his life. He had
                    previously published some medical and botanical dissertations, besides his <hi
                    rend="italic">Exercitationes</hi><hi rend="italic">quoedam</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Mathematicae,</hi> containing a solution of the differential equation proposed
                    by Riccati and now known by his name. In 1738 appeared his <hi rend="italic"
                    >Hydrodynamica,</hi> in which the equilibrium, the pressure, the reaction, and
                    varied velocities of fluids are considered both theoretically and practically.
                    One of these problems, illustrated by experiment, deals with an ingenious mode
                    of propelling vessels by the reaction of water ejected from the stern. Some of
                    his experiments on this subject were performed before Maupertuis and Clairaut,
                    whom the fame of the Bernoullis had attracted to Basel. With a success equalled
                    only by Euler, Daniel Bernoulli gained or shared no less than ten prizes of the
                    Academy of Sciences of Paris. The first, for a memoir on the construction of a
                    clepsydra for measuring time exactly at sea, he gained at the age of
                    twenty-four; the second, for one on the physical cause of the inclination of the
                    planetary orbits, he divided with his father; and the third, for a communication
                    on the tides, he shared with Euler, Maclaurin, and another competitor. The
                    problem of vibrating cords, which had been some time before resolved by Taylor
                    and D’Alembert, became the subject of a long discussion conducted in a generous
                    spirit between Bernoulli and his friend Euler. In one of his early
                    investigations he gave an ingenious though indirect demonstration of the problem
                    of the parallelogram of forces. His labours in the decline of life were chiefly
                    directed to the doctrine of probabilities in reference to practical purposes,
                    and in particular to economical subjects, as, for example, to inoculation, and
                    to the duration of married life in the two sexes, as well as to the relative
                    proportion of male and female births. He retained his usual vigour of
                    understanding till near the age of eighty, when his nephew James relieved him of
                    his public duties. He was afflicted with asthma, and his retirement was relieved
                    only by the society of a few chosen friends. In the spring of 1782, after some
                    days’ illness, he died, like his father, in the repose of sleep. Excluded by his
                    professional character from the councils of the republic, he nevertheless
                    received all the deference and honour due to a first magistrate. He was wont to
                    mention the following as the two incidents in his life which had afforded him
                    the greatest pleasure,—that a stranger, whom he had met as a travelling
                    companion in his youth, made to his declaration “I am Daniel Bernoulli” the
                    incredulous and mocking reply, “And I am Isaac Newton and that, while
                    entertaining König and other guests, he solved without rising from table a
                    problem which that mathematician had submitted as difficult and lengthy.</p>
                <p>Like his father, he was a member of almost every learned society of Europe, and
                    he succeeded him as foreign associate of the Academy of Paris. Several of his

                        law and mathematics, and, after travelling in France, was for five years
                        professor of eloquence in the university of his native city. On the death of
                        his father he succeeded him as professor of mathematics. He was thrice a

                        His prize subjects were, the capstan, the propagation of light, and the

                        while on his way to Berlin. He himself died in 1790. His two sons, John and

                        December 1744. He studied at Basel and at Neufchâtel, and when thirteen
                        years of age took the degree of doctor in philosophy. At nineteen he was
                        appointed astronomer royal of Berlin. Some years after, he visited Germany,
                        France, and England, and subsequently Italy, Russia, and Poland. On his
                        return to Berlin he was appointed director of the mathematical department of
                        the academy. Here he died on the 10th July 1807. His writings consist of
                        travels and astronomical, geographical, and mathematical works. In 1774 he
                        published a French translation of Euler’s <hi rend="italic">Elements of

                        October 1759. Having finished his literary studies, he was, according to
                        custom, sent to Neufchâtel to learn French. On his return he studied law and
                        took a degree. This study, however, did not check his hereditary taste for
                        geometry. The early lessons which he had received from his father were
                        continued by his uncle Daniel, and such was his progress in the exact
                        sciences that at the age of twenty-one he was called to undertake the duties
                        of the chair of experimental physics, which his uncle’s advanced years
                        rendered him unable to discharge. He afterwards accepted the situation of
                        secretary to Count de Brenner, which afforded him an opportunity of seeing
                        Germany and Italy. In Italy he formed a friendship with Lorgna, professor of
                        mathematics at Verona, and one of the founders of the Italian society for
                        the encouragement of the sciences. He was also made corresponding member of
                        the Royal Society of Turin; and, while residing at Venice, he was, through
                        the friendly representation of Fuss, admitted into the Academy of St
                        Petersburg. In 1788 he was named one of its mathematical professors. In the
                        following year he married a daughter of Albert Euler, son of the illustrious
                        Euler. </item>
