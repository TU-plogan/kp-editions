                    1816 at Sheffield, where his father was organist. Having lost his father at an
                    early age, he was brought up at Cambridge by his grandfather, from whom he
                    received his first musical education. In 1826 he entered the Royal Academy of
                    Music, and remained a pupil of that institution for the next ten years, studying
                    pianoforte and composition under Cipriani Potter, Dr Crotch, W. H. Holmes, and
                    C. Lucas. It was during this time that he wrote several of his most appreciated
                    works, not uninfluenced it seems by the contemporary movement of musical art in
                    Germany, which country he frequently visited during the years 1836-42. At one of
                    the Rhenish musical festivals in Dusseldorf he made the personal acquaintance of
                    Mendelssohn, and soon afterwards renewed it at Leipsic, where the talented young
                    Englishman was welcomed by the leading musicians of the rising generation. He
                    played at one of the celebrated Gewandhaus concerts his third pianoforte
                    concerto, which was received by the public in a manner flattering both to tho
                    pianist and the composer. We still possess an enthusiastic account of the event
                    from the pen of Robert Schumann, whose genial expansive nature was always open
                    to new impressions. He never tired of Bennett’s praise, whom he pronounced to be
                    “the most musical of all Englishmen,” and whom, in a private letter, he goes so
                    far as to call “an angel of a musician.” But even Schumann could not wholly
                    conceal from himself the influence which Mendelssohn’s compositions exercised on
                    Bennett’s mode of utterance, an influence which precluded the possibility of an
                    original development to a degree almost unequalled in the history of music,
                    excepting perhaps the case of the Danish composer Niels W. Gade, who like
                    Bennett was attracted to Leipsic by the fame of Mendelssohn, and who like him
                    offered his own artistic individuality at the shrine of the German composer’s
                    genius. According to a tradition, the late Professor Hauptmann, after listening
                    to a composition by Gade, is said to have pronounced the sarcastic sentence,
                    “This sounds so much like Mendelssohn, that one might <pb break="no"

                    Bennett/’ It would lead us too far on the present occasion to point out how, by
                    this subserviency of the leading English musician to a foreign composer, the
                    national development of English art was impeded in a deplorable manner. His
                    great success on the Continent established Bennett’s position in England. He
                    settled in London, devoting himself chiefly to practical teaching. For a short
                    time he acted as conductor of the Philharmonic Society, in which capacity,
                    however, he earned little success. He was made musical professor at Cambridge in
                    1856, and in 1868 principal of the Royal Academy of Music. In 1871 he received
                    the honour of knighthood. He died in 1875. Owing most likely to his professional
                    duties his latter years were not fertile, and what he then wrote was not
                    superior, scarcely equal, to the productions of his youth. The principal charm
                    of Bennett’s compositions (not to mention his absolute mastery of the musical
                    form) consists in the tenderness of their conception, rising occasionally to
                    sweetest lyrical intensity, but also bordering now and then on that excessive
                    sentimentalism from which his master Mendelssohn kept not always aloof. It must,
                    however, be acknowledged that Bennett’s was a thoroughly refined nature,
                    incapable of grand dramatic pathos, but also free from all inartistic pandering
                    to the taste of the vulgar. Barring the opera, Bennett tried his hand at almost
                    all the different forms of vocal and instrumental writing. As his best works in
                    various branches of art, we mention, for pianoforte solo, and with accompaniment
                    of the orchestra, his three sketches, <hi rend="italic">The Lake, the
                    Millstream, and the Fountain,</hi> and his 3d pianoforte concerto; for the
                    orchestra, his Symphony in G minor, and his overture <hi rend="italic">The
                    Naiads;</hi> and for voices, his cantata <hi rend="italic">The May Queen,</hi>
                    written for the Leeds festival in 1858. He also wrote a sacred cantata, <hi
                    rend="italic">The Woman of Samaria,</hi> first performed at the Birmingham
                    Musical Festival in 1867. Shortly before his death he produced a sonata called
                    the <hi rend="italic">Maid of Orleans,</hi> an elaborate piece of
                    programme-music, descriptive of the deeds and sufferings and the final triumph
                    of the French heroine according to Schiller’s tragedy.</p>
