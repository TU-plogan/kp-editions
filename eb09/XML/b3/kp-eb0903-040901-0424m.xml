                    (1431-1443), was the last of the three great reforming councils of the 15th
                    century, coming after the councils of Pisa (1409) and Constance (1414-18). In
                    these three councils the aim of the majority was to reform the church by
                    destroying the absolute supremacy of the Pope, and by curbing the rule of the
                    Roman curia; and the acts of these councils were all designed to re-establish
                    the power of the episcopate by asserting the supremacy of oecumenical councils.
                    At Pisa these aims were only indicated; at Constance they were so far successful
                    that schismatic popes were deposed, and the council practically showed its
                    superiority to the Pope by bestowing the papal chair on Martin V.; and although
                    the fathers of Constance were compelled to separate before they could do much
                    else in the way of reform, they practically laid the foundation by insisting
                    that councils should be held frequently, and by ordering a new council to be
                    called at the end of five years. The council summoned in obedience to this
                    command was the Council of Basel, but the results of its meeting were simply to
                    show the helplessness of the episcopate and the power of the Roman curia. At
                    Basel the labours of Pisa and Constance were undone, and after this council
                    thoughtful men began to see that the church could not be reformed without
                    destroying the Papacy.</p>
                <p>The Council of Basel was summoned by Martin V. (1431). He first appointed it to
                    meet at Pavia, then at Siena, but Basel was at last fixed upon. At the very
                    beginning Martin died, but his successor, Eugenius IV., sanctioned all his
                    decrees; and the council accordingly met at Basel on the 23d of July 1431, under
                    the presidency of Cardinal Julian Cesarini. At first all went well. The bishops
                    took care so to arrange the organization of the council and its method of
                    procedure as to make it a true and fair representative of the whole Catholic
                    Church. The members of the council were divided into four equal classes, each
                    consisting of about the same number of cardinals, archbishops, bishops, abbots,
                    &amp;c., and each completely organized, with its president, secretaries, and
                    other officers. This was done to neutralize the votes and prevent the intrigues
                    of the Italian bishops, who were very numerous, and for the most part under the
                    power of the Roman curia. To each of the four was assigned the investigation of
                    a special class of subjects. Each section met separately in its own hall thrice
                    a week. Each section elected three of its number to form a committee of
                    business. One-third of this committee was changed every month. All the business
                    had to pass through this committee, and it sent down special subjects to be
                    discussed in each of the sections. When the section had discussed the matter it
                    sent its decision with the reasons of it to each of the other sections, who then
                    discussed the matter and gave their opinion upon it. If three sections were
                    agreed upon it, the subject was brought before the whole council for general
                    discussion and a final decision.</p>
                <p>The three subjects which were specially assigned to this council were the reunion
                    of the Greek and Latin Churches, the reconciliation of the Bohemians, and the
                    reform of the church according to the resolutions come to at Constance. Soon
                    after the beginning of the council the Roman curia took alarm at the zeal and
                    determination of the assembled bishops, and by intrigues compelled the Pope, who
                    was really anxious for reform, to do all he could to hinder the work of the
                    fathers at Basel. Eugenius twice tried to dissolve the council; but it resisted,
                    maintaining that a council being superior to the Pope could not be dissolved,
                    and the Pope yielded. The bishops refused to admit the Pope’s legates until they
                    admitted the supremacy of the council and promised to obey its decrees.</p>
                <p>The first business to which the members addressed themselves was to curb the
                    power of the Pope and of the Roman curia. They tried to do this by attempting to
                    stop the flow of money from all parts of Europe to Rome. They abolished the
                    annates; they declared it illegal in a bishop to send the sum of money commonly
                    presented on his investiture, &amp;c.; and they passed many laws to restrain the
                    luxury and vice of the clergy. These proceedings so alarmed Eugenius that he
                    resolved either to bring the council within the reach of his influence or to
                    dissolve it. The occasion for interference arose out of a debate which the
                    subject of reunion with the Greek Church gave rise to. The Emperor John
                    Palaeologus, induced principally by fear of the Turks, had written both to the
                    Pope and to the council on the subject of the reunion of Christendom, and both
                    had entertained his proposals. The majority, however, of the bishops in the
                    council maintained that this subject could not properly be discussed in Italy,
                    and that the deliberations must take place in France, Savoy, or Basel, far from
                    the influence of the Pope. To this Eugenius would not agree; and when the
                    council decided against him, he resolved to assemble another council, which met
                    first at Ferrara and afterwards at Florence.</p>
                <p>The rest of the proceedings of the Council of Basel is simply a record of
                    struggles with the Pope. In 1437 the council ordered the Pope to appear before
                    them at Basel. The Pope replied by dissolving the council; the bishops, backed
                    by the emperor and the king of France, continued their deliberations, and
                    pronounced the Pope contumacious for not obeying them. When Eugenius tried to
                    take away the authority of the council by summoning the opposition Council of
                    Florence, the bishops at Basel deposed him. Eugenius replied by a severe bull,
                    in which he excommunicated the bishops, and they answered by electing a new
                    Pope, Amadeus, duke of Savoy, who assumed the name of Felix V. The greater part
                    of the church adhered to Eugenius, but most of the universities acknowledged the
                    authority of Felix and the Council of Basel. Notwithstanding the opposition of
                    Eugenius and his adherents, the Council of Basel continued to pass laws and
                    decrees until the year 1443; and when the bishops separated they declared
                    publicly that they would reassemble at Basel, Lyons, or Lausanne. In 1447
                    Eugenius died and was succeeded by Nicholas V., who tried to bring about a
                    reconciliation between the parties in the church. A compromise was effected, by
                    which Felix resigned the pontificate, and the fathers of Basel having assembled
                    at Lausanne, ratified the abdication of Felix, and directed the church to obey
