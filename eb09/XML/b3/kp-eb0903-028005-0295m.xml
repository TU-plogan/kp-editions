                    entered St John’s College, Cambridge, in 1702, graduated Bachelor of Arts in
                    1706, was ordained to the ministry in 1710, and soon after obtained the small
                    living of Lamesly and Tanfield in the county of Durham. He married in 1715. It
                    was the year in w hich Bishop Hoadley preached that famous sermon on <hi
                    rend="italic">The Kingdom of Christ,</hi> which gave rise to the long,
                    wearisome, and confused theological war known as the “Bangorian controversy;”
                    and Balguy, under the <hi rend="italic">nom</hi><hi rend="italic">de plume</hi>
                    of Silvius, began his career of authorship by taking the side of Hoadley in this
                    controversy against some of his High Church opponents. In 1726 he published <hi
                    rend="italic">A Letter to a Deist concerning the Beauty and Excellency of Moral
                    Virtue, and the support and improvement which it receives from the Christian
                    Religion,</hi> chiefly designed to show that, while a love of virtue for its own
                    sake is the highest principle of morality, religious rewards and punishments are
                    most valuable, and in some cases absolutely indispensable, as sanctions of
                    conduct. He supposed that a contrary opinion had been maintained by Lord
                    Shaftesbury in his <hi rend="italic">Inquiry concerning Virtue;</hi> but an
                    examination of that essay will prove him to have in this respect done
                    Shaftesbury injustice. In 1728 he was made a prebend of Salisbury by his friend,
                    Bishop Hoadley. He published in the same year the first part of a tractate
                    entitled <hi rend="italic">The Foundation of Moral Goodness,</hi> and in the
                    following year a second part, “illustrating and enforcing the principles
                    contained in the former.” The aim of the work is twofold— to refute the theory
                    of Hutcheson regarding the basis of rectitude, and to establish the theory of
                    Clarke. His objections to Hutcheson’s theory are,—(1.) That it represents virtue
                    as arbitrary and insecure by making it depend on two instincts, benevolent
                    affection and the moral sense; (2.) That if true, brutes, since they have kind
                    instincts or affections, must have some degree of virtue; (3.) That if such
                    affections constitute virtue, the virtue must be the greater in proportion as
                    the affections are stronger, contrary to the notion of virtue, which is the
                    control of the affections; and (4.) That virtue is degraded by being made a
                    result of instincts instead of being represented as the highest part of our
                    nature. Clarke’s fundamental ethical principle, that virtue is conformity to <pb

                    xml:id="kp-eb0903-0296-0281"/> reason,—the acting according to fitnesses which
                    arise out of the eternal and immutable relations of agents to objects,— is the
                    central and guiding thought in Balguy ’ s moral speculations, and even the
                    source of what is most distinctive in his theology. His exposition of it is
                    characterised by insight into its significance, and by ingenuity in disposing of
                    the objections which had been urged against it. In 1729 he became vicar of
                    Northallerton, in the county of York. His next work was an essay on <hi
                    rend="italic">Divine Rectitude; or, a Brief Inquiry concerning the Moral
                    Perfections of the Deity, particularly in respect of Creation and
                    Providence.</hi> It is an attempt to show that the same moral principle which
                    ought to direct human life may be perceived to underlie the works and ways of
                    God: goodness in the Deity not being a mere disposition to benevolence, but a
                    regard to an order, beauty, and harmony, which are not merely relative to our
                    faculties and capacities, but real and absolute; claiming for their own sakes
                    the reverence of all intelligent beings, and alone answering to the perfection
                    of the divine ideas. It is only, Balguy thinks, when the divine rectitude is
                    thus viewed as aiming at order no less than at happiness, as acting according to
                    the true reasons of things no less than from the affection of benevolence, that
                    such facts as the gift of freedom to man, the introduction and infliction of
                    natural evil, the inequalities of human fortune, the sufferings of the
                    righteous, and the prosperity of the wicked, can be satisfactorily explained.
                    There followed <hi rend="italic">A Second Letter to a Deist, concerning a late
                    book entitled</hi><hi rend="italic superscript"> lt</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Christianity as old as the Creation," more particularly that chapter which
                    relates to Dr Clarke.</hi> Here Balguy argues that Tindal had falsely inferred
                    revelation to be superfluous from the perfection of the law of nature and the
                    ability of reason to discover that law. He grants that the law of nature is
                    perfect and unchangeable, and that men can know whatever it is their duty to do,
                    but maintains that the light of reason may have, and has had, added to it by
                    revelation knowledge of great interest and value. This, he holds, is all that
                    Clarke had maintained, and Tindal had failed to show that he had fallen into any
                    self-contradictions. The same leading thoughts which we find in the tracts just
                    mentioned meet us again in <hi rend="italic">The Law of Truth, or the
                    Obligations of Reason essential to all Religion.</hi> In this essay it is
                    contended,— (1.) That reason binds or obliges, in the strictest sense of the
                    word, all moral agents; (2.) That, considering men in their intellectual and
                    moral capacity, the obligations of religion are entirely founded on the
                    obligations of reason; and (3.) That on this ground, religion, whether natural
                    or revealed, stands very firm and secure. Balguy collected these tracts and
                    published them in a single volume in 1734, the <hi rend="italic">Letter to a
                    Deist</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">Foundation of Moral Goodness</hi> having
                    previously passed through three editions. In 1741 he published an <hi
                    rend="italic">Essay on Redemption,</hi> containing somewhat peculiar views.
                    Redemption as taught in Scripture means, according to him, “the deliverance or
                    release of mankind from the power and punishment of sin, by the meritorious
                    sufferings of Jesus Christ,” but involves no <hi rend="italic">translation of
                    guilt, substitution of persons,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">vicarious
                    punishment.</hi> Freed from these ideas, which have arisen from interpreting
                    literally expressions which are properly figurative, the doctrine, he argues,
                    satisfies deep and urgent human wants, and is in perfect consistence and
                    agreement with reason and rectitude. His last publication was a volume of
                    sermons, pervaded by good sense and good feeling, and clear, natural, and direct
                    in style, but bearing few traces of the influence of the most distinctive and
                    potent Christian motives. He died at Harrowgate, September 21, 1748. A second
                    volume of sermons appeared shortly afterwards. The edition of his sermons most
                    commonly met with is the 3d, in 2 vols., published in 1760. The notice of his
                    life in the <hi rend="italic">Biographia Britannica</hi> was written by his son.

                    362-4, 454-6, iii. 87-9. Mr Hunt erroneously represents Shaftesbury and not
                    Hutcheson as the philosopher assailed in the <hi rend="italic">Foundation of
