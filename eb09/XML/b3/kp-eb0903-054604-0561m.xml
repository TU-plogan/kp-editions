                    their hands the art of Venice was developed from a condition more primitive and
                    archaic than that of any other school in Italy, and advanced to the final
                    perfection of Giorgione and of Titian. The first distinguished member of the
                    family was—</p>
                <p>1. <hi rend="smallcaps">Jacopo Bellini.</hi> When Gentile da Fabriano, one of the
                    most refined and accomplished of the religious painters of the Umbrian
                    Apennines, came to practise at Venice, where art was backward, several young men
                    of the city took service under him as pupils. Among these were Giovanni and
                    Antonio of Murano, and Jacopo Bellini. The Umbrian master left Venice for
                    Florence in 1422, and the two brothers of Murano stayed behind and presently
                    founded a school of their own. (See <hi rend="smallcaps">Vivaeini.)</hi> But
                    Jacopo Bellini followed his teacher to Florence in the capacity of <hi
                    rend="italic">famulus.</hi> It was the time when a new spirit had just broken
                    out in Florentine art, and when the leaders of that school—Ghiberti and
                    Donatello, Andrea del Castagno, Paolo Uccello, Masaccio—had made immense
                    progress in many ways at once,—in the sciences of anatomy and perspective, in
                    classical grace and style, in the truth and sincerity of nature,—so that from
                    them the young Venetian found much more to learn than even from his Umbrian
                    teacher as to the possible perfections of the art. The little evidence left us
                    proves that he made good use of his opportunities. But his works are as rare as
                    the events of his life, after his service in Florence with Gentile da Fabriano,
                    are uncertain. That service presently got him into trouble. The Umbrian, as a
                    stranger coming to paint in Florence, was jealously looked on. One day a group
                    of young Florentines took to throwing stones into his shop, and the Venetian
                    pupil ran out and put them to flight with his fists. Thinking this might be
                    turned against him, he went and took service on board the galleys of the
                    Florentine state; but, returning after a year, he found he had in his absence
                    been tried for assault and condemned in a heavy fine. He was arrested and put in
                    prison, but the matter was afterwards compromised upon a public act of penance
                    to which Jacopo submitted. Whether he accompanied his master to Rome in 1426 we
                    cannot tell, but there is evidence to show that he was practising on his own
                    account in Venice in 1430, and probably as soon as 1427. Neither can we fix the
                    date of his marriage; but it was probably about the time of his return to his
                    native state, for we know that he had grandchildren before 1458. The remainder
                    of his life was spent between Venice, Verona, and Padua. At Venice, besides
                    other work, he painted a great series from the lives of Christ and the Virgin in
                    the church of St John the Evangelist. This has entirely <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0903-0562-0547"/> perished. In the cathedral of Verona there was,
                    until it was destroyed by the barbarism of the 18th century, an important
                    Crucifixion from his hand. In the archbishop’s palace of the same city another
                    Crucifixion still remains, but greatly injured. At Padua Jacopo appears to have
                    lived several years, and to have founded there a school which became the rival
                    of the school of Squarcione. There his sons, Gentile and Giovanni, grew up;
                    there his daughter Niccolosia found a husband in Andrea Mantegna, the most
                    famous of the scholars of Squarcione. (See <hi rend="smallcaps">Mantegna.)</hi>
                    In Jacopo Bellini the Venetian school had not yet found its special and
                    characteristic manner. But he holds a position of great importance, as having
                    been the first to fertilize Venetian soil with the science and genius of
                    Florence. From no extant pictures of his can his manner be judged so well as
                    from the book of his sketches, which has become the property of the British
                    Museum. This, in spite of fading and decay, is a unique and invaluable
                    possession, containing a vast number of original studies tinted or drawn with
                    pen or ink, and including compositions from Scripture and the lives of the
                    saints, from classical fable, and from natural history in surprising
                    variety.</p>
                <p>2. <hi rend="smallcaps">Gentile Bellini</hi> was the elder of the two sons of
                    Jacopo. To the precise date of his birth we have no clue. Both he and his
                    brother Giovanni served together under their father Jacopo as his pupils as long
                    as he lived. After his death each of them practised his art independently in
                    their native city; but a warm and unbroken affection is recorded to have always
                    subsisted between the brothers. In 1464 Gentile was commissioned to paint the
                    doors of the great organ in St Mark’s with figures of the four saints—Mark,
                    Jerome, Theodore, and Francis. The next year he painted for the church of Sta
                    Maria dell’ Orto a picture of the apotheosis of Lorenzo Giustiniani, patriarch
                    of Venice. From 1465 until 1474 we cannot trace his occupations with precision,
                    though there are several extant works that can be assigned to the interval. On
                    the 21st of September 1474, he was appointed to restore and renew the existing
                    painted decorations in the hall of the Great Council in the Ducal Palace. These
                    were in part frescoes, the work of his father’s master, Gentile da Fabriano.
                    Some of them Gentile Bellini restored, and some were so ruined that he had to
                    destroy them and put in their place new work of his own. The practice of
                    painting in oil upon canvas had lately been brought to Venice by Antonello of
                    Messina. The new medium, besides yielding richer effects, resisted damp and salt
                    better than the old; and all the painters of Venice were eagerly learning its
                    use. Gentile adopted it in the hall of the Great Council. In 1479 the Sultan
                    Mahomet sent word to the Signoria of Venice that he desired the services at
                    Constantinople of a good painter of their state, at the same time inviting the
                    doge to the wedding of his son. The doge declined to go, but the Signoria chose
                    Gentile Bellini to be sent with two assistants at the expense of the state and
                    to paint for the Turk, first electing his younger brother Giovanni to fill his
                    place in the works at the Ducal Palace until he should return. He was admirably
                    received, and painted the portraits of the sultan and many of his officers,
                    besides that picture of the reception of a Venetian embassy by the grand vizier
                    which is now at the Louvre (No. 68). It is a well-known and doubtful story how
                    the sultan alleged that a picture of Gentile’s showed an imperfect knowledge of
                    the appearance of the muscles of the neck after decapitation, and to convince
                    the painter had a slave decapitated in his presence, and how this made Gentile
                    uncomfortable and anxious to get away. He returned at the end of 1480, bringing
                    gifts and honours; and from that time he and Giovanni were engaged together for
                    the state on the decoration of the great hall· Gentile painted there four great
                    subjects from the story of Barbarossa, which unhappily perished in the fire of
                    1577. It is recorded that in 1486 the young Titian entered his workshop as a
                    pupil. Three of the most important of his works date from the last five or six
                    years of the century, and were done for the school of St John the Evangelist at
                    Venice. They represent the cure of a sick Venetian by a relic of the cross, the
                    procession in honour of the same relic in the piazza of St Mark, and the miracle
                    of the recovery of the relic from the Grand Canal (Academy of Venice, Nos. 543,
                    555, 529). In 1506 Gentile was so busy as to write that he could not accept a
                    commission proposed by Francesco, marquis of Mantua. The next winter he fell
                    sick, and made his will, bequeathing his father’s sketch-book above described to
                    his brother John, on condition that the brother should finish the picture of the
                    Sermon of St Mark which the sick man had then on hand. He died on the 23d of
                    February 1507. It is by his science and spirit in the treatment of animated and
                    dignified processional groups, with many figures and architecture of masterly
                    perspective, that we chiefly know Gentile Bellini. He is a workman of infinite
                    precision, and a fine colourist, though his manner has some of the hardness of
                    the earlier times. To conduct the school of Venice to its final liberty and
                    splendour was the work of his younger brother, the great</p>
                <p>3. <hi rend="smallcaps">Giovanni Bellini.</hi> His birth it is no less impossible
                    to fix with accuracy than that of his brother. His earliest work, done at Padua,
                    shows strongly the stern influence of his brother-in-law Andrea Mantegna. The
                    National Gallery has a Christ on the Mount, painted by Giovanni, probably about
                    1455, and apparently in direct competition with a picture of the same subject by
                    Mantegna himself, similarly conceived, which belongs to the Baring Gallery. The
                    characteristics of the style formed at Padua by Mantegna and Giovanni Bellini,
                    and maintained by the former all his life, are a great intensity and vehemence
                    of expression, an iron severity and unmatched firmness and strength of
                    draughtsmanship; a tendency, in draperies, to imitate the qualities of
                    sculpture; a love of the difficulties of perspective; a leaning towards the
                    antique, which these masters learned to transform and reanimate with a more
                    passionate energy and an austerer strength of their own. Of the two, Bellini is
                    always the more reserved and simple, the more inclined to work from nature and
                    the less from the antique, and he has the richer choice in colour; but there are
                    works in which they are indistinguishable. The period when Bellini paiuted in
                    this first manner and in <hi rend="italic">tempera</hi> may be roughly fixed
                    (though there is often great uncertainy as to the dates of his pieces, and
                    though at all times he seems occasionally to have recurred to his early
                    practice) between 1455 and. 1472. It is probable that the famous picture of the
                    Circumcision now at Castle Howard, which was repeated more than once by the
                    master himself, and many times over by his pupils and assistants, was painted
                    before this date. The altar pieces on a great scale, which are the noblest
                    monument of his middle period, were certainly painted after it. Of these the
                    chief were the Virgin and Saints, in a chapel of the church of Saints Giovanni
                    and Paolo at Venice, which perished along with Titian’s Peter Martyr in the
                    fatal fire of 1867; a great Coronation of the Virgin, in the church of St
                    Dominic at Pesaro; a Transfiguration, now in the museum of Naples; a Virgin and
                    Saints, painted for the church of S. Giobbe, now in the Academy at Venice (No.
                    36). These, and the multitude of Madonnas and other devotional pictures painted
                    by Giovanni Bellini during the thirty years following his change of manner and
                    adoption of the oil medium, are among the noblest products of the religious art
                    of the world. They stand alone in their union of <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0903-0563-0548"/> splendour with solemnity; they have the manful
                    energy of Mantegna without his harshness, and the richness of Giorgione without
                    his luxury. Succeeding pictures show an increase of this richness, and a
                    character more nearly tender. An altar piece, painted for the church of San
                    Zaccaria, seems to indicate a transition, and that the venerable master is
                    acquiring all the softer splendour and keeping pace with Giorgione and Titian,
                    the young pupils of the school. Nay, at the very close of his career, Bellini
                    left the old devotional cycle in which he had produced works so moving and
                    august, and painted for Alphonso of Ferrara a mythology in the most gorgeous
                    manner of the ripe Venetian school. This is the Feast of the Gods, now at
                    Alnwick Castle, a picture to which Titian set the finishing touches, and to
                    which the companion, by Titian himself, is now at Madrid. Bellini died on the 29
                    th of November 1516, full of years and honours. We have seen that he was
                    associated with his brother in the decoration of the Great Hall of the Council
                    in 1479. In 1483 he was appointed Pittore del Dominio, and exempted from the
                    charges of his guild. All the painters of the state at one time or another were
                    associated with him or passed through his school. Among the most distinguished
                    of his scholars and assistants who will not need separate mention, we may name
                    Marco Basaiti and Vincenzo Catena, many of whose works pass for their master’s.
                    He was the honoured associate of statesmen and men of letters. In 1506, when
                    Albert Dürer visited Venice, where he was subject to some annoyances, he found
                    the noble old man not only the most courteous of the Venetian artists in his
                    reception of a stranger, but the best in his profession (“der best im gemeU
                    ”).</p>
                <p>Many pictures in various galleries pass as portraits of one or other of the
                    Bellini. But of those that are styled likenesses of Giovanni, none can be proved
                    authentic, while the only certain portrait of Gentile is a medal by Camelio.
