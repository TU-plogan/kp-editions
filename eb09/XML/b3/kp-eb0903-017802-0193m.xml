                    instruction in England, and specially endeavoured to supersede the Newtonian by
                    the Leibnitzian notation in the Calculus. With this object the three friends
                    translated, in 1816, Lacroix’s <hi rend="italic">Treatise on the Differential
                    and Integral Calculus,</hi> and added, in 1820, two volumes of examples. Mr
                    Babbage’s attention seems to have been very early drawn to the number and
                    importance of the errors introduced into astronomical and other calculations
                    through inaccuracies in the computation of tables. Ho contributed to the Royal
                    Society some notices on the relation between notation and mechanism; and in
                    1822, in a letter to Sir H. Davy on the application of machinery to the
                    calculation and printing of mathematical tables, he discussed the principles of
                    a calculating engine, to the construction of which he devoted many years of his
                    life. Government was induced to grant its aid, and the inventor himself spent a
                    portion of his private fortune in the prosecution of his undertaking. He
                    travelled through several of the countries of Europe, examining different
                    systems of machinery; and some of the results of his investigations were
                    published in the admirable little work, <hi rend="italic">Economy of Machines
                    and Manufactures,</hi> 1834, which Blanqui has called “a hymn in honour of
                    machinery.” The great calculating engine was never completed; the constructor
                    apparently desired to adopt a new principle when the first specimen was nearly
                    complete, to make it not a difference but an analytical engine, and Government
                    declined to accept the further risk. From 1828 to 1839 Babbage held the office
                    of Lucasian professor of mathematics at Cambridge. He contributed largely to
                    several scientific periodicals, and was instrumental in founding the
                    Astronomical and Statistical Societies. He only once endeavoured to enter public
                    life, when, in 1832, he stood unsuccessfully for the borough of Finsbury. During
                    the later years of his life he resided in London, and, surrounded by his
                    workshops, still continued to devote himself to the construction of machines
                    capable of performing arithmetical and even algebraical calculations. He died at
                    London, 20th October 1871. He gives a few biographical details in his <hi
                    rend="italic">Passages from the Life of a Philosopher,</hi> 1864, a work which
                    throws considerable light upon his somewhat peculiar character. His works,
                    pamphlets, and papers, were very numerous; in the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Passages</hi> he enumerates eighty separate writings. Of these the most
                    important, besides the few already mentioned, are, <hi rend="italic">Tables of
                    Logarithms,</hi> 1826; <hi rend="italic">Comparative View of the Various
                    Institutions for the Assurance of Lives,</hi> 1826; <hi rend="italic">Decline of
                    Science in England,</hi> 1830; <hi rend="italic">Ninth Bridgewater
                    Treatise,</hi> 1837; <hi rend="italic">The Exposition of 1851,</hi> 1851.</p>
