                        rend="italic">Quadrum,</hi> the beautiful square), a town of France,
                    department of Gard, and arrondissement of Nîmes. Lat. 43° 48' 32" N., long. 4°
                    38' 50" E. It is situated on the right bank of the Rhone, opposite Tarascon,
                    with which it is connected by a magnificent suspension-bridge of four spans and
                    1456 feet in length. The town is generally well built, but has no public
                    buildings worthy of notice, and the streets are narrow and crooked. Its ancient
                    castle of Bellicadro is now in ruins. It gives name to the canal which
                    communicates with the sea, and also connects it with the Languedoc canal,
                    forming part of the line of communication between the Rhone and the Garonne. It
                    is also connected with Nîmes and Alais by a railway opened iu 1839. The
                    manufactures are few and unimportant. The town derives its celebrity from the
                    great July fair, which has been held here annually since the 13th (or 14th)
                    century, and to which merchants come from all parts of Europe, and even from
                    Persia and Armenia. The extensive meadow, called Magdalen's, on the banks of the
                    Rhone, is set apart for the gathering, and almost every kind of article, whether
                    of convenience or luxury, is there exhibited. Though the fair is now less
                    frequented than formerly, it 13 said that still as many as 100,000 persons
                    attend. There are stone quarries in the neighbourhood of the town, and the
                    manufacture of linen and-woollen stuffs is carried on. Population in 1872,
                    7858.</p>
                <p>Bcaucaire occupies the site of the ancient <hi rend="italic">Ugernum,</hi> and
                    several remains of the Roman city have been discovered, as well as (in 1734) the
                    road that led from Nîmes. It was a fortress in the Middle Ages, and belonged in
                    succession to the counts of Arles, the archbishops of Arles, the counts of
                    Toulouse, and the viscounts of Narbonne. In the 12th century it is frequently
                    mentioned by the troubadours. Presented in 1215 to Simon de Montfort, it was
                    next year taken possession of by Count Raimund VI.; and in 1226 Louis VIII. made
                    himself master of it. In the wars of the League it suffered severely, and in
