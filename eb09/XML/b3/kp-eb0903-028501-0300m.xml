                    distinguished French philosopher of the theocratic school, was born at Lyons in
                    1776. His health from infancy was extremely delicate, his nervous system was
                    weak, and he was frequently subject to hallucinations and mental disorders. This

                    were compelled to take refuge in the country. His education seems never to have
                    been very complete; but he was early imbued with ideas on the construction of
                    society, which naturally sprang from the events of the revolutionary period. His
                    first literary effort was an epic poem, describing the occurrences at Lyons;
                    this he never published. In 1801 he wrote an essay <hi rend="italic">Du
                    Sentiment</hi><hi rend="italic">considéré dans la littérahire et dans</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">les Arts,</hi> a work which shows very well the defects as well as
                    the merits of his style and manner of thinking. It is essentially unsystematic;
                    and the few good ideas contained in it are expressed in language so figurative
                    that it costs an effort to discover what is really being said. Ballanche,
                    indeed, was essentially unsystematic and unscientific, and seems to have had no
                    conception of what is truly required in a philosophy. His style is not external
                    to the thinking, but is undissolubly connected with it; strange thoughts and <hi
                    rend="italic">bizarre</hi> expressions arise together.</p>
                <p>His next great work, the <hi rend="italic">Antigone,</hi> a prose poem, published
                    in 1814, was the fruit of long and quiet meditation, and was received with great
                    favour by the brilliant literary society surrounding Chateaubriand and Mme.
                    Récamier, into which Ballanche had been introduced. From this year, 1814, dates
                    his serious effort towards a speculative reconstruction of society, an
                    exposition of the <hi rend="italic">palingenesis</hi> of social order. He
                    transferred his residence to Paris, where he continued to live in communication
                    with the few thinkers who had like philosophical tendencies with himself. In
                    1817 appeared his <hi rend="italic">Essai sur</hi><hi rend="italic">les

                    >dans leur rapport avec les Idées nouvelles,</hi> which was intended to serve as
                    a prelude to his great tripartite social epic. The work is more intelligible
                    than any other of Ballanche’s; it advocates a moderate constitutional
                    government, and was, on this account, misjudged by many, who fancied it
                    recommended Bourbonism. A philosophical dialogue, <hi rend="italic">Le Vieillard
                    et le Jeune Homme,</hi> and a novel, <hi rend="italic">L'Homme sans Nom,</hi>
                    were written in 1819 and 1820. He then devoted himself to his great work, the
                    <hi rend="italic">Palingénésie</hi><hi rend="italic">Sodale.</hi> This, which
                    was to be a <hi rend="italic">Theodicoea,</hi> an exposition of the workings of
                    God in history, was divided into three parts: the first reconstructed that
                    period of the world which was before the rise of religion, which is prehistoric,
                    or mythical; the second endeavoured, from a study of known history, to deduce a
                    universal law or rule; the third sketched that state of things through and in
                    which humanity at last attains its final end and crowning glory. The works
                    representing these three parts were called <hi rend="italic">L'Orphée,</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">La</hi><hi rend="italic">Formule,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">La
                    Ville des Expiations;</hi> only the first was completed, but some fragments of
                    the others are in existence. To the whole a general introduction was prefixed,
                    which is the most valuable of all Ballanche’s works. His latest writing, <hi
                    rend="italic">Vision</hi><hi rend="italic">d'Hébal</hi> (Hebal being the chief
                    of a Scottish clan, and gifted with second sight), was evidently intended to
                    form portion of the third part of the <hi rend="italic">Palingénésie.</hi> In
                    mystical language it gives vague and semi-prophetic utterances on the future
                    course of worldhistory. It is by some considered his greatest production.
                    Ballanche, who in 1841 had received the distinguished honour of a seat in the
                    French Academy, died in 1847. He was much beloved by his friends, and seems to
                    have been a most amiable, warm-hearted man, enthusiastic and poetical in
                    temperament, whose intellect, however, was overshadowed by his imagination. A
                    collected edition of his works was set on foot in 1830, and was intended to
                    occupy nine vols. Only four appeared, and were republished in a smaller form in
                    1833.</p>
                <p>It is almost impossible to give a connected view of Ballanche’s fundamental
                    ideas. As has been said, he belonged to the theocratic school, who, in
                    opposition to the rationalism of the preceding age, emphasised the principle of
                    authority, placing revelation above individual reason, order above freedom and
                    progress. But Ballanche made a sincere endeavour to unite in one system what was
                    valuable in the opposed modes of thinking. He held with the theocratiste that
                    individualism was an impracticable view; man, according to him, exists only in
                    and through society. He agreed further with them that the origin of society was
                    to be explained, not by human desire and efforts, but by a direct revelation
                    from God. Lastly, with De Bonald, he reduced the problem of the origin of
                    society to that of the origin of language, and held that language was a divine
                    gift. But at this point he parts company with the theocratists, and in this very
                    revelation of language finds a germ of progress. Originally, in the primitive
                    state of man, speech and thought are identical; but gradually the two separate;
                    language is no longer only spoken, it is also written, and finally is printed.
                    Thus the primitive unity is broken up; the original social order which
                    co-existed with, and was dependent on it, breaks up also. New institutions
                    spring up, upon which thought acts, and in and through which it even draws
                    nearer to a final unity, a rehabilitation, a <hi rend="italic"
                    >palingenesis.</hi> The volition of primitive man was one with that of God, but
                    it becomes broken up into separate volitions which oppose themselves to the
                    divine will, and through the oppositions and trials of this world work onwards
                    to a second and completer harmony. The history of humanity is therefore
                    comprised in the fall from the perfect state, and in the return, after repeated,
                    trials, to a similar condition. In the dim, shadowy records of mythical times
                    may be traced the obscure outlines of primitive society and of its fall; and
                    this is attempted in the <hi rend="italic">Orphée.</hi> Actual history exhibits
                    the conflict of two great principles, which may be said to be realised in the
                    patricians and plebeians of Borne. Such a distinction of caste is regarded by
                    Ballanche as the original state of historical society; and history, as a whole,
                    he considers to have followed the same course as that taken by the Roman plebs
                    in its gradual and successful attempts to attain equality with the patriciate.
                    On the future events through which the human race shall achieve its destiny
                    Ballanche gives few intelligible hints. The sudden flash which disclosed to the
                    eyes of Hebal the whole epic of humanity cannot be reproduced in language
                    trammelled by time and space. Scattered throughout the works of Ballanche are
                    many valuable ideas on the connection of events which makes possible a
                    philosophy of history; but his own theory, so far as it can be understood and
                    judged, does not seem likely to find more favour than it has already met
                    with.</p>
