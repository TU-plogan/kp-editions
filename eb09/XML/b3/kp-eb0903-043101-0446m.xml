                    stretching from limb to limb on both sides of the body, enclosing the greatly
                    elongated digits of the hand, and in many cases extending beyond the posterior
                    limbs so as to include the tail. Their whole structure bears evidence of special
                    adaptation to the purpose of sustained flight, while their mode of progression
                    on the ground is as awkward as their aerial movements are graceful. The eyes of
                    the bat are usually small, but the organs of the other senses in most cases
                    attain extraordinary development. The external ear is generally large, as in the
                    Longeared Bat of Britain <hi rend="italic">{Plecotus</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >auritus),</hi> in which it is equal to the entire length of the body. In the
                    group to which the Horse-shoe Bats <hi rend="italic">{Rhinoloρhus ferrum
                    equinum)</hi> belong, the nose is surrounded with leaf-like appendages, the
                    purpose of which is by no means well determined, but which, probably, are as
                    useful to the organ of smelling as is the greatly elongated auricle to that of
                    hearing. In all bats the wing-membrane affords a vast expansion of the sense of
                    touch, which is of such exquisite delicacy that bats which have been deprived of
                    their sight, and as far as possible of hearing and smelling, are yet able by it
                    alone to fly about in perfect security, avoiding, with apparent ease, all the
                    obstacles that may be placed in their way. By Pliny and other early naturalists
                    the bat, although known to suckle its young, was placed among Birds, and was
                    generally regarded as a creature of ill omen, a superstitious feeling by no
                    means extinct at the present day. Virgil, in speaking of the Harpies, generally
                    understood to have been bats, describes them as “dirae obscenaeque volucres.”
                    Our English ancestors formed a more correct estimate of the zoological position
                    of these creatures as indicated by the name “flitter-mouse,” still given to the
                    bat in many parts of Britain. Bats are nocturnal or crepuscular in their habits,
                    remaining suspended by day in the darkest recesses of woods and caverns, or in
                    the most inaccessible parts of unfrequented buildings, and coming forth at
                    twilight in search of food, This in the species found in Europe and America
                    consists mainly of insects; while one species at least, the Vampire of America,
                    sucks the blood of other mammals, although its powers in this respect have
                    probably been much exaggerated. The Fruit-eating Bats <hi rend="italic"
                    >{Pteropτιs)</hi> are confined to the warmer regions of Asia and Africa, and
                    among these are to be found the largest members of the order, thus the Kalong of
                    Java <hi rend="italic">{Pteroρus jaυanicus)</hi> measures 5 feet between the
                    tips of its wings. In countries where the w inter cold is sufficiently severe to
                    cut off their usual sources of food, bats hibernate. Collecting in enormous
                    numbers in their usual retreats and suspending themselves by their hind limbs,
                    they become torpid, and remain so till the return of spring, bringing with it a
                    revival of insect life, restores them to their wonted activity. About 130
                    species of bats are known, and these are widely distributed over every quarter
                    of the globe, extending as far northward as latitude 60°; all the larger forms,
                    however, occur in the warmer regions of the earth. Bats are found in most of the
                    islands of the Indian and Pacific Oceans, forming in many of them the only
                    indigenous mammals, a fact readily explained when viewed in connection with
                    their remarkable power of flight. Fossil remains of insectivorous Cheiroptera
                    have been found in the Eocene and later Tertiary deposits. See <hi
