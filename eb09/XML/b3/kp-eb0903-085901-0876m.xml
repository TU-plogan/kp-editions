                    area of the district in 1870 was 2000 square miles, of which 1750 were returned
                    as under cultivation, 125 as cultivable but not actually cultivated, and 125 as
                    uncultivable waste. The census of 1872 returned the police area of the district
                    at 1500 square miles, and disclosed a population of 689,467 souls, of whom
                    556,620, or 80 per cent., were Mahometans; 130,644, or 19 per cent., Hindus; 22
                    Christians; and 2181 were classified as “others.” Density of population in the
                    census area, 59 per square mile. The district stretches out in a level plain,
                    intersected by numerous streams and dotted with patches of jungle. The Karatoyâ
                    River flows from north to south, dividing the district into two portions,
                    possessing very distinct characteristics. The eastern tract consists of rich
                    alluvial soil, well watered, and subject to fertilizing inundations, yielding
                    heavy crops of coarse rice, oilseeds, and jute. The western portion of the
                    district is high-lying and produces the finer qualities of rice. The principal
                    rivers are formed by the different channels of the Brahmaputra, which river here
                    bears the local names of the Konâi, the Dâokobâ, and the Jamunâ, the last
                    forming a portion of the eastern boundary of the district. Its bed is studded
                    with alluvial islands. The Brahmaputra and its channels, together with three
                    minor 6treams, the Bângâlï, Karatoyâ, and Alai, afford admirable facilities for
                    commerce, and render every part of the district accessible to native cargo boats
                    of large burden. The rivers swarm with fish,—the value of the fisheries being
                    estimated at .£45,000 a year. The principal products of the district are rice,
                    pease, pulses, oilseeds, jute, sugar-cane, mulberry, red pepper, and hemp for
                    smoking <hi rend="italic">(Cannabis</hi><hi rend="italic">indica).</hi> These
                    products, together with clarified butter and a little silk, form the chief
                    articles of export. The imports consist of salt, cloth, tobacco, areca-nuts,
                    copper and brass utensils, spices, iron and piece goods. The chief trading
                    markets are Bogrâ, Lakhmiganj, Buriganj, Dhupchâchiâ, &amp;c. A silk factory has
                    been established at Naodâpârâ, and is conducted with European capital, with an
                    annual outlay of about £4500. The revenue and expenditure of the district have
                    steadily increased of^ late years. In 1853 the total revenue of the district
                    amounted to £48,431, and the civil expenditure to £7282; in 1860, revenue
                    £57,744, and civil expenditure £11,013; in 1870- 71 the revenue had risen to
                    £59,979. In 1870-71 the district contained 1064 separate estates held by 2497
                    proprietors, paying a total Government land revenue of £44,347. The machinery
                    for protecting person and property consists of six magisterial and six civil
                    courts, with (1) a regular police force, numbering 54 officers and 252 men, and
                    costing Government £5975; (2), a rural constabulary or village watch, numbering
                    2552 men, and costing £6635, paid by the landholders and villagers; and (3),
                    municipal police, numbering 36 men, and costing £251. In 1871-72 there were 41
                    Government and aided schools in the district, attended by 1492 pupils, and
                    maintained at a total cost of £1398, of which £692 was contributed by the state.
                    The total number of aided and unaided schools in the district is returned in the
                    census of 1872 at 169, attended by 1685 pupils. The only town containing upwards
                    of 5000 inhabitants in the district is Bogrâ, the administrative headquarters,
                    situated on the Karatoyâ River; population in 1872, 5872; municipal income,
                    £282; expenditure, £208; rate of taxation per head, 1l⅜d. There is one other
                    municipality, Sherpur, formerly a place of importance when the East India
                    Company had silk filatures in its neighbourhood. A great part of this town is
                    now overgrown with jungle; the municipal income in 1869 was £246, the
                    expenditure £174. The climate of Bogra is mild during the winter, but sultry and
                    oppressive at other seasons. The average annual rainfall for the five years
                    ending 1869 was 82 inches, and the average annual temperature 77° Fahr.</p>
