                    and successfully conducted a campaign against them, until forced, by the
                    rashness of his soldiers, to join battle and suffer defeat in the following
                    year. Recalled to Constantinople, he married Antonina, a profligate, daring
                    woman. During-the sedition of the “green” and “blue” parties of the circus he
                    did Justinian good service, effectually crushing the rebels who had proclaimed
                    Hypatius emperor. In 533 the command of the expedition against the Vandal
                    kingdom in Africa, a perilous office, which the rest of the imperial generals
                    shunned, was conferred on Belisarius. With 15,000 mercenaries, whom he had to
                    train into Roman discipline, he took Carthage, defeated Gelimer the Vandal king,
                    and carried him captive, in 534, to grace the first triumph witnessed in
                    Constantinople. In reward for these services Belisarius was invested with the
                    consular dignity, and medals were struck in his honour. At this time the
                    Ostrogothic kingdom, founded in Italy by Theodoric the Great, was shaken by
                    internal dissensions, of which Justinian resolved to avail himself. Accordingly,
                    Belisarius invaded Sicily; and, after storming Naples and defending Rome for a
                    year against almost the entire strength of the Goths in Italy, he concluded the
                    war by the capture of <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0903-0551-0536"/> Ravenna, and with it of the Gothic king Vitiges.
                    So conspicuous were Belisarius’s heroism and military skill that the Ostrogoths
                    offered to acknowledge him Emperor of the West. But his loyalty did not waver;
                    he rejected the proposal and returned to Constantinople in 540. Next year he was
                    sent to check the Persian king Nushirvan; but, thwarted by the turbulence of his
                    troops, he achieved no decisive result. On his return to Constantinople the
                    intrigues of Antonina, whom he had confined on account of her illicit amours,
                    caused him to be stripped of his dignities and condemned to death, and he was
                    only pardoned by humbling himself before his imperious consort. The Goths having
                    meanwhile reconquered Italy, Belisarius was despatched with utterly inadequate
                    forces to oppose them. Nevertheless, during five campaigns his strategic'skill
                    enabled him to hold his enemies at bay, until he was removed from the command,
                    and the conclusion of the war entrusted to his rival Narses. Belisarius remained
                    at Constantinople in tranquil retirement until 559, when an incursion of
                    Bulgarian savages spread a panic through the metropolis, and men’s eyes were
                    once more turned towards the neglected veteran, who placed himself at the head
                    of a mixed multitude of peasants and soldiers, and repelled the barbarians with
                    his wonted courage and adroitness. But this, like his former victories,
                    stimulated Justinian’s envy. The saviour of his country was coldly received and
                    left unrewarded by his suspicious sovereign. Shortly afterwards Belisarius was
                    accused of complicity in a conspiracy against the emperor; his fortune was
                    confiscated, and himself flung into prison. His last years are shrouded in
                    uncertainty, as they are not dealt with in the circumstantial history of
                    Procopius; but he seems to have been liberated and reinstalled in the enjoyment
                    of his hard-won honours before his death in 565. The fiction of Belisarius
                    wandering as a blind beggar through the streets of Constantinople, which has
                    been adopted by Marmontel in his <hi rend="italic">Bélisaire,</hi> and by
                    various painters and poets, seems to have been invented by Tzetzes, a writer of
                    the 12th century. Gibbon justly calls Belisarius the Africanus of New Rome. But
                    for his successes, which were achieved with most insignificant means, the effete
                    Byzantine empire would have been dismembered among Vandals, Persians, and Goths.
                    He was merciful as a conqueror, stern as a disciplinarian, enterprising and wary
                    as a general; while his courage, loyalty, and forbearance seem to have been
                    almost unsullied. Like Corbulo, the faithful general of Nero, he was suspected
                    and persecuted by an ungrateful master; and, like him, he restored the old
                    discipline to the troops and the ancient lustre to the Roman arms in a corrupt
                    and nerveless age. <hi rend="italic">{Cf</hi> Mahon’s <hi rend="italic">Life of
