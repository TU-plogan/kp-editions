                <p><label type="entry">BACHELOR</label>, a word of various meaning, and of
                    exceedingly obscure origin. In modern times the most common significations of it
                    are—(1), an unmarried person; (2), one who has taken the lowest degree in any of
                    the faculties at a university. At various times, however, it has signified
                    either a young man in general, from which the first of the modern meanings was
                    easily developed; or a knight who was unable to lead a body of retainers into
                    the field, <hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> to use the technical phrase, was not
                    able <hi rend="italic">lever</hi><hi rend="italic">bannière</hi><hi
                        rend="italic">;</hi> or, finally, an ecclesiastic at the lowest stage of his
                    course of training. It has also been pointed out that <hi rend="italic"
                        >bacheleria,</hi> which meant the body of aspirants to knighthood, came to
                    be used as synonymous with <hi rend="italic">gentry.</hi></p>
                <p>Etymology gives little help in arranging these meanings so as to discover the
                    unity underlying them. In mediaeval Latin the word <hi rend="italic"
                        >baccdlaria</hi> (connected by Ducange with <hi rend="italic"
                        >vasseleria,</hi> by Stubbs with <hi rend="italic">bacca, i.e.,</hi><hi
                        rend="italic">vacca,</hi> a cow), which, according to Diez, is peculiar to
                    the south of France and the north of Spain, signified a certain portion of land,
                    the size and tenure of which imposed on the possessor certain feudal duties. The
                    possessor was called <hi rend="italic">baccalarius,</hi> and the name readily
                    acquired the signification of one who, from poverty or other cause, as youth,
                    was not able to take rank as a knight. As a third stage in the use of the word,
                    Diez marks out the application of it to denote the lowest degree in a
                    university. But though these transitions from the primitive meaning may perhaps
                    appear natural, there is no historic evidence of their having taken place. The
                    same applies to the five meanings given in Ducange.</p>
                <p>We look with more prospect of success to the old French words <hi rend="italic"
                        >bacelle,</hi><hi rend="italic">bacelote, bachelette, bachelerie,
                        bachelage,</hi> which have all the meaning of youth, apprenticeship. They
                    may possibly be connected with the Celtic or Welsh words, <hi rend="italic"
                        >bach,</hi> little, <hi rend="italic">bachgen,</hi> a boy. (See Wedgwood,
                        <hi rend="italic">s.v.,</hi> who is of opinion that the <hi rend="italic"
                        >baccalarius</hi> of the north of Spain is not in any way connected with our
                    word <hi rend="italic">bachelor.)</hi> It is very probable that this is truly
                    the root of the word. It has, however, been frequently connected with <hi
                        rend="italic">baculus,</hi> a stick, from which is supposed to have come <hi
                        rend="italic">baculari.us,</hi> as the word used often to be spelled. (See
                        <hi rend="italic">Promptoriuτn</hi><hi rend="italic">Parvulorum,</hi><hi
                        rend="italic">s.υ.)</hi> Whether the relation in this case is that of <hi
                        rend="italic">shooting forth or budding (cf.</hi> the Portuguese <hi
                        rend="italic">bacharel,</hi> a twig of vine, and Barbazan’s derivation from
                        <hi rend="italic">baccalia),</hi> or the more obvious one suggested by the
                    functions of the <hi rend="italic">bacularius,</hi> who appears to have acted as
                    . the monitor or praepostor at schools (see H. T. Riley, <hi rend="italic"

                        Albani),</hi> is very doubtful.</p>

                <p>Bachelors, or unmarried persons, have in many countries been subjected to penal
                    laws. The best-known examplea of such legislation are those of Sparta and Rome.
                    At Sparta, citizens who remained unmarried after a certain age were subjected to
                    a species of ατι∕√α. They were not allowed to witness the gymnastic exercises of
                    the maidens; and during winter they were compelled to march naked round the
                    market-place, singing a song composed against themselves, and expressing the
                    justice of their punishment. The usual respect of the young to the old was not
                    paid to bachelors (Plut., <hi rend="italic">Lyc.,</hi> 15). At Athens there was
                    no definite legislation on this matter; but certain minor laws are evidently
                    dictated by a spirit akin to the Spartan doctrine (see Schömann, <hi
                        rend="italic">Gr. Alterth.,</hi> i. 548). At Rome, though there appear
                    traces of some earlier legislation in the matter, the first clearly known law is
                    that called the Lex Julia, passed about 18 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> It
                    does not appear to have ever come into full operation; and in 9 <hi
                        rend="smallcaps">a.d.</hi> it was incorporated with the Lex Papia et
                    Poppaea, the two laws being frequently cited as one, Lex Julia et Papia Poppaea.
                    This law, while restricting marriages between the several classes βf the people,
                    laid heavy penalties on unmarried persons, gave certain privileges to those
                    citizens who had several children, and finally imposed lighter penalties on
                    married persons who were childless. In Britain there has been no direct
                    legislation bearing on bachelors; but, occasionally, taxes have been made to
                    bear more heavily on them than on others. Instances of this are the Act (6 and 7
                    Will. III.) passed in 1695; the tax on servants, 1785; and the income tax,
                    1798.</p>
