                    Hazârïbâgh, and on the W. by the districts of Monghir and Tirhut. Bhâgalpur is a
                    long and narrow district, divided into two unequal parts by the River Ganges. In
                    the southern portion of the district the scenery in parts of the hill-ranges and
                    the highlands which connect them is very beautiful. The hills are of the primary
                    formation, with fine masses of contorted gneiss. The ground is broken up into
                    picturesque gorges and deep ravines, and the whole is covered with fine forest
                    trees and a rich undergrowth. Within this portion also lie the lowlands of
                    Bhâgalpur, fertile, well planted, well watered, and highly cultivated. The
                    country north of the Ganges is level, but beautifully diversified with trees and
                    verdure. Three fine rivers flow through the district—the Ganges, Kusi, and
                    Ghagri. The Ganges runs a course of 60 miles through Bhâgalpur, is navigable all
                    the year round, and has an average width of three miles. The Kusi rises in the
                    Himâlayas and falls into the Ganges near Colgong (Kahlgâon), within Bhâgalpur.
                    It is a fine stream, navigable up to the foot of the hills, and receives the
                    Ghagri eight miles above its debouchure.</p>
                <p>The census of 1872 disclosed a population of 1,826,290 souls, inhabiting 2739
                    towns or villages; and 329,372 houses, giving an average of 422 per square mile,
                    667 per village, and <hi rend="italic">5'5</hi> per house. Of the total
                    population, 1,639,949, or 89 <hi rend="superscript"> -</hi> 8 per cent., are
                    Hindus; 169,426, or 9 ’ 3 per cent., Mahometans; 532 Christians; 19 Buddhists;
                    16,364, or ’ 9 per cent., of unspecified religions, chiefly of aboriginal
                    tribes, consisting of hillmen, Nats, Santals, &amp;c. In the early days of
                    British administration these hill people gave much trouble. They were the
                    original inhabitants of the country whom the Aryan conquerors had driven back
                    into the barren hills and unhealthy forests. This they avenged from generation
                    to generation by plundering and ravaging the plains. The efforts to subdue or
                    restrain these marauders proved fruitless, till Augustus Cleveland, the
                    collector of Bhâgalpur in the latter half of last century, won them by mild
                    measures, and successfully made over the protection of the district to the very
                    hill people who a few years before had been its scourge. Rice, wheat, barley,
                    oats, Indian corn, various kinds of millet, pulses, oil-seeds, tobacco, cotton,
                    indigo, opium, flax and hemp, and sugar-cane, are the principal agricultural
                    products of Bhâgalpur district. The jungles aiΓord good pasturage in the hot
                    weather, and abound in lac, silk cocoons, catechu, resin, and the <hi
                        rend="italic">mahud</hi> fruit, which is both used as fruit and for the
                    manufacture of spirits. Iron, gold, coal, and building stone are found, but no
                    iron or coal is at present smelted or worked. Gold is washed from the river sand
                    in small particles. Silk cloth, called <hi rend="italic">tasar,</hi> and pots
                    similar to Chinese ware, are the principal manufactures of Bhâgalpur. Principal
                    seats of trade—Bhâgalpur, Ghoghâ, Colgong (Kahlgaon), Pirpainti, and Sultânganj
                    on the East Indian Railway; Umarpur, Puraini, Chândpur, Belhar, Jaipur, Katariä,
                    Sabalpur, Panjwârâ, and Chandan, in the south of the district; and Bihpur,
                    Krishnaganj, Muraliganj, and Pratâpganj north of the Ganges. Besides nine
                    principal roads with a total length of 368 miles, which form the means of
                    external and internal communication, 62 miles of the East Indian Railway connect
                    Bhâgalpur with Calcutta and Upper India. For administrative purposes Bhâgalpur
                    district is divided into four magisterial subdivisions, viz., the headquarters
                    subdivision, and those of Bânki, Madhupurâ, and Supul; and for police purposes
                    into twelve <hi rend="italic">thdnds.</hi> A regular police, 600 strong, was
                    maintained in 1872 at a total cost of £9569, or an average of one man to every
                    7'06 square miles, and 2979 of the population. Besides the regular police there
                    were, in 1872, 3666 village watchmen, supported at an estimated cost of £5700,
                    paid by the landholders and villagers, exclusive of the service lands which they
                    enjoy rent free. The total net revenue of the district, in 1870-71, amounted to
                    £139,545, of which £72,161, or 51 ’ 71 per cent., was derived from the land;
                    expenditure, £82,570. For the education of the people there were, in 1872, 14
                    Government and aided schools, attended by 876 pupils, and maintained at a total
                    cost of £2313, of which Government contributed £929. The unaided schools
                    numbered 314, attended by 3593 pupils. The climate of Bhâgalpur partakes of the
                    character both of the deltaic districts of Bengal and of the districts of Behar,
                    between which it is situated. The hot season sets in about the end of March,
                    continues till the beginning of June, the temperature at this time rising as
                    high as 110° Fahr. The rains usually begin at the end of June and last till the
                    middle of September; average annual rainfall, 55 inches. The cold season
                    commences at the beginning of November and lasts till March. During December and
                    January the temperature falls as low as 41° Fahr. The average annual temperature
                    is 78°. Bhâgalpur formed a part of the ancient Sanskrit kingdom of Anga. In
                    later times it was included in the powerful Hindu kingdom of Magadha or Behar,
                    and in the 7th century <hi rend="smallcaps">a.d.</hi> it was an independent
                    state, with the city of Champâ for its capital. It afterwards formed a part of
                    the Mahometan kingdom of Gaur, and was subsequently subjugated by Akbar, who
                    declared it to be a part of the Dehli empire. Bhâgalpur passed to the East India
                    Company by the grant of the Emperor Shâh Alam in 1765. (W. W. H.)</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Bhâgalpur,</hi> the principal town of the district and
                    division of the same name, situated on the right bank of the Ganges, here seven
                    miles wide, in 25° 11' N. lat. and 87° E. long. The town is two miles in length
                    and a mile in width, but lies in a low, open valley, and consists of scattered
                    market-places meanly built. Its most interesting objects are two ancient round
                    towers, each about 70 feet high. Adjacent to the town are the two Cleveland
                    monuments, one erected by Government, and the other by the Hindus, to the memory
                    of the civilian, who, at the end of last century, “by conciliation, confidence,
                    and benevolence, attempted and accomplished the entire subjection of the lawless
                    and savage inhabitants of the Jungleterry of Râjmahal.” Bhâgalpur is the
                    headquarters of the commissioner of the division and of the judge and collector
                    of the district; it is also a station of the East Indian Railway. Its Government
                    school was attended by 361 pupils in 1872. In the same year the town contained a
                    population of 69,678 souls, of whom 50,673, or 72 per cent., are Hindus; 18,455,
                    or 26 per cent., Mahometans; 19 were Buddhists, 342 Christians, and 189
                    unclassified. Municipal income, in 1872, £2951, 6s.; expenditure, £3470,14s.;
                    incidence of municipal taxation, 10⅛d. per head of the town population.</p>
