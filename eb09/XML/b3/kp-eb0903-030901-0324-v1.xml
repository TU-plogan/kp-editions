                <p><label type="entry">BÄNDÄ</label>, a district of British India, in the Allâhâbâd
                    division, under the Lieutenant-Governor of the NorthWestern Provinces, lies
                    between 24° 59' 15* and 25° 55' 30* N. lat., and 80° 2' 45* and 81° 38' E. long.
                    It is bounded on the N. by the district of Fathipur, from which it is separated
                    by the River Jamnâ; on the N.E. by the districts of Fathipur and Allâhâbâd; on
                    the S.E. by the native state of Riwâ; on the S. and S.W. by some of the petty
                    states of Bundelkhand; and on the W. and N.W. by the district of Ξamirpur. Area,
                    3030 square miles, of which 1390 are under cultivation, 848 cultivable but not
                    cultivated, 108 revenue free, and 684 uncultivable waste. The census of 1872
                    took the area at 2908 <hi rend="superscript"> -</hi> 68 square miles, and
                    returned the district population at 697,610 souls,— viz., Hindus, 657,107;
                    Mahometans, 40,497; Christians, 6. Average density, 230 persons to the square
                    mile. Of the population in 1872, 2897 were landed proprietors, 42,230
                    agriculturists, and 63,644 non-agriculturists. In some parts the district rises
                    into irregular uplands and elevated plains, interspersed with detached rocks of
                    granite; in others it sinks into marshy lowlands, which frequently remain under
                    water during the rainy season. The sloping countιy on the bank of the Jamnâ is
                    full of ravines. To the S.E. the Vindhya chain of hills takes its origin in a
                    low range not exceeding 500 feet in height, and forming a natural boundary of
                    the district in that direction. The principal river of the district is the
                    Jamnâ, which flows from northwest to south-east, along the N.E. boundary of the
                    district for 125 miles. Its most important tributaries within the district are
                    the Ken, Bâgain, Paisuni, and Ohân, all of which take their rise in the Vindhya
                    hills. The principal towns and market villages in the district are Mau, Mâjhgâon
                    or Râjâpur, Markâ, Samgarâ, Augâsi, Chillâ, and Barâgâon, all situated on the
                    bank of the Jamnâ.</p>
                <p>The black soil of the district yields abundant crops of wheat, barley, maize,
                    millet of various sorts, rice, and pulses. Hemp, oil-seeds, sugar, and indigo
                    are also grown, but by far the most important crop is cotton, for which the
                    district is so celebrated that the produce is distinguished in commerce as
                    “Banda Cotton.” The estimated acreage under the principal crops—Gram <hi

                    126,198; cotton, 69,667; barley, 60,976; rice, 20,987; total, 550,737 acres, or
                    860 <hi rend="superscript"> -</hi> 52 square miles. The total cultivated area of
                    the district is returned at 1390 square miles. The manufactures of Banda consist
                    of coarse cottoncloth, sackcloth, and stone handles for knives. Iron and
                    building stone form the only mineral products. The revenue of the district
                    amounted in 1870-71 to £167,488, the expenditure being £63,425 Since the
                    acquisition of the country by the British, eight settlements of the land revenue
                    have been made at different periods. The last (1834-35) of these adjusted the
                    demand at £134,904, and the total collections amounted in 1870-71 to £131,275.
                    In 1871 the regular police force of 620 men was maintained at a cost of £8920,
                    while a rural constabulary of 2552 men was maintained at the cost of the
                    landholders and villagers. In 1871-72 there were 214 schools in the district,
                    with an average daily attendance of 4695 pupils; expenditure, £2194, of which
                    Government paid £754. Banda district has only two towns containing upwards of
                    5000 inhabitants, viz., Banda (27,746) and Girwân (6670). Banda, the
                    headquarters of the district, lies cn the right bank of the River Ken, in lat.
                    25° 28', long. 80° 23'. Thirty-six miles of the Jalalpur branch of the East
                    Indian Railway lie within the district, and eleven first-class roads afford good
                    means of communication— the most important road, both commercially and for
                    military purposes, being that from Mânikpur to Chillâ. The climate of Banda is
                    cold in the winter months, and terribly hot in summer. Frost is rare, except in
                    the moist land adjoining the rivers; the hot winds frequently cause deaths among
                    the natives from exposure to the mid-day heat. Rainfall in 1870-71, 51 <hi

                <p>Banda has formed an arena of contention for the successive races who have
                    struggled for the sovereignty of India. Kalinjar town, then the capital, was
                    unsuccessfully besieged by Mahmud of Ghazni in 1023 <hi rend="smallcaps"
                        >a.d.</hi>; in 1196 it was taken by Kutab-ud-din, the general of Muhammad
                    Ghori; in 1545 by Sher Shah, who, however, fell mortally wounded in the assault.
                    About the year 1735 the Râjâ of Kalinjar’s territory, including the present
                    district of Banda, was bequeathed to Bâji Râo, the Marhattâ Peshwâ; and from the
                    Marhattas it passed by the treaties of 1802-3 to the Company.</p>
