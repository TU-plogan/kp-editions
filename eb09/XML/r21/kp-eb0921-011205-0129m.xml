                    exceptional importance among the relics of late Roman literature. The poem was
                    in two books; the exordium of the first and the greater part of the second have
                    been lost. AA <hi rend="superscript">r</hi> hat remains consists of about 700
                    lines.</p>
                <p>The poet’s voyage took place in the late autumn of 416 (i. 135 <hi rend="italic"
                    >sq.),</hi> and the verses as we have them were evidently written at or very
                    near the time. The author is a native of southern Gaul, and belonged, like
                    Sidonius, to one of the great governing families of the Gaulish provinces. His
                    father, whom he calls Lachanius, had held high offices in Italy and at the
                    imperial court, had been governor of Etruria and Umbria <hi rend="italic"
                    >[consularis Tusciae)</hi> probably in 389, when a Claudius is named in the
                    Theodosian Code (2, 4, 5) as having held the office, then imperial treasurer <hi
                    rend="italic">[comes sacrarum largitionum),</hi> imperial recorder <hi
                    rend="italic">[quaestor),</hi> and governor of the capital itself ( <hi

                <p><hi rend="italic">urbis).</hi> Rutilius boasts his career to have been no less
                    distinguished than his father’s, and particularly indicates that he had been
                    secretary of state <hi rend="italic">[magister officiorum)</hi> and governor of
                    the capital (i. 157, 427, 467, 561). It is probable that a certain Namatius
                    named in the Theodosian Code (6, 27, 15) as <hi rend="italic">magister
                    officiorum</hi> of the year 412 is no other than our poet. The true literary man
                    is apt to be inordinately proud of political distinction, and Rutilius
                    celebrates his own praises in a style worthy of Cicero or Pliny. At all events,
                    he had lived long in the great world of the Western empire, and knew much of the
                    inner history of his time. After reaching manhood, he had passed through the
                    tempestuous period that stretches between the death of Theodosius (395) and the
                    fall of the usurper Attalus, which occurred near the date when our poem was
                    written. He had witnessed the chequered career of Stilicho as actual, though not
                    titular, emperor of the West; he had seen the hosts of Radagaisus rolled back
                    from Italy, only to sweep over the helpless provinces of Gaul and Spain, the
                    defeats and triumphs of Alaric, the three sieges and final sack of Rome,
                    followed by the marvellous recovery of the city, Heraclian's vast armament
                    dissipated by a breath, and the fall of seven pretenders to the Western diadem.
                    Undoubtedly the sympathies of Rutilius were with those who during this period
                    dissented from, and, when they could, opposed, the general tendencies of the
                    imperial policy. We know from himself that he was the intimate of distinguished
                    men who belonged to the circle of the great orator Symmachus,—men who had
                    scouted Stilicho’s compact with the Goths, and had led the Roman senate to
                    support the pretenders Eugenius and Attalus in the vain hope of reinstating the
                    gods whom Julian had failed to save.</p>
                <p>While making but few direct assertions about historical characters or events, the
                    poem, by its very texture and spirit and assumptions, forces on us important
                    conclusions concerning the politics and religion of the time, which are not
                    brought home to us with the same directness by any other authority. The attitude
                    of the writer towards paganism is remarkable. The whole poem is intensely pagan,
                    and is penetrated by the feeling that the world of literature and culture is and
                    must remain pagan, that outside paganism lies a realm of barbarism. The poet
                    wears an air of exalted superiority over the religious innovators of his day,
                    and entertains a buoyant confidence that the future of the ancient gods of Rome
                    will not belie their glorious past. Invective and apology he scorns alike, nor
                    troubles himself to show, with Claudian, even a suppressed grief at the
                    indignities put upon the old religion by the new. As a statesman, he is at pains
                    to. avoid offending those politic Christian senators over∙ whom pride in their
                    country had at least as great power as attachment to their new religion. Only
                    once or twice does Rutilius speak directly of Christianity, and then only to
                    attack the monks, whom the temporal authorities had hardly as yet recognized,
                    and whom, indeed, only a short time before, a Christian emperor had forced by
                    thousands into the ranks of his army. Judaism Rutilius could assail without
                    wounding either pagans or Christians, but he intimates, not obscurely, that he
                    hates it chiefly as the evil root whence the rank plant of Christianity had
                    sprung.</p>
                <p>We read in Gibbon that “Honorius excluded all persons who were adverse to the
                    catholic church from holding any office in the state,” that he “obstinately
                    rejected the service of all those who dissented from his religion,” and that
                    “the law was applied in the utmost latitude and rigorously executed.” Far
                    different is the picture of political life impressed upon us by Rutilius. His
                    voice is assuredly not that of a partisan of a discredited and over-borne
                    faction. We see by the aid of his poem a senate at Rome composed of past
                    office-holders, the majority of whom were certainly pagan still. We discern a
                    Christian section whose Christianity was political rather than religious, who
                    were Romans first and Christians afterwards, whom a new breeze in politics might
                    easily have wafted back to the old religion. Between these two sections the
                    broad old Roman toleration reigns. Some ecclesiastical historians have fondly
                    imagined that after the sack of Rome the bishop Innocent returned to a position
                    of practical predominance. No one who fairly reads Rutilius can cherish this
                    idea. The air of the capital, perhaps even of Italy, was still charged with
                    paganism. The court was far in advance of the people, and the persecuting laws
                    were in large part incapable of execution.</p>
                <p>Perhaps the most interesting lines in the whole poem are those in which Rutilius
                    assails the memory of “dire Stilicho,” as he names him. Stilicho, “fearing to
                    suffer all that had caused himself to be feared,” annihilated those defences of
                    Alps and Apennines which the provident gods had interposed between the
                    barbarians and the Eternal City, and planted the cruel Goths, his “skin-clad”
                    minions, in the very sanctuary of the empire. His wile was wickeder than the
                    wile of the Trojan horse, than the wile of Althaea or of Scylla. May Nero rest
                    from all the torments of the damned, that they may seize on Stilicho, for Nero
                    smote his own mother, but Stilicho, the mother of the world!</p>
                <p>We shall not err in supposing that we have here (what we find nowhere else) an
                    authentic expression of the feeling entertained by a majority of the Roman
                    senate concerning Stilicho. He had but imitated the policy of Theodosius with
                    regard to the barbarians; but even that great emperor had met with passive
                    opposition from the old Roman families. The relations, however, between Alaric
                    and Stilicho had been closer and more mysterious than those between Alaric and
                    Theodosius, and men who had seen Stilicho surrounded by his bodyguard of Goths
                    not unnaturally looked on the Goths who assailed Rome as Stilicho’s avengers. It
                    is noteworthy that Rutilius speaks of the crime of Stilicho in terms far
                    different from those used by Orosius and the historians of the lower empire.
                    They believed that Stilicho was plotting to make his son emperor, and that he
                    called in the Goths in order to climb higher. Rutilius holds that he used the
                    barbarians merely to save himself from impending ruin. The Christian historians
                    assert that Stilicho designed to restore paganism. To Rutilius he is the most
                    uncompromising foe of paganism. His crowning sin (recorded by our poet alone)
                    was the destruction of the Sibylline books—a sin worthy of one who had decked
                    his wife in the spoils of Victory, the goddess who had for centuries presided
                    over the deliberations of the senate. This crime of Stilicho alone is sufficient
                    in the eyes of Rutilius to account for the disasters that afterwards befell the
                    city, just as Merobaudes, a generation or two later, traced the miseries of his
                    own day to the overthrow of the ancient rites of Vesta.</p>
                <p>With regard to the form of the poem, Rutilius handles the elegiac couplet with
                    great metrical purity and freedom, and betrays many signs of long study in the
                    elegiac poetry of the Augustan era. The Latin is unusually clean for the times,
                    and is generally fairly classical both in vocabulary and construction. The taste
                    of Rutilius too is comparatively pure. If he lacks the genius of Claudian, he
                    also lacks his overloaded gaudiness and his large exaggeration, and the
                    directness of Rutilius shines by comparison with the laboured complexity of
                    Ausonius. It is common to call Claudian the last of the Roman poets. That title
                    might fairly be claimed for Rutilius, unless it be reserved for Merobaudes. At
                    any rate in passing from Rutilius to Sidonius no reader can fail to feel that he
                    has left the region of Latin poetry for the region of Latin verse.</p>
                <p>Of the many interesting details of the poem we can only mention a few. At the
                    outset we have an almost dithyrambic address to the goddess Roma, whose glory
                    has ever shone the brighter for disaster, and who will rise once more in her
                    might and confound her barbarian foes. The poet shows as deep a consciousness as
                    any modern historian that the grandest achievement of Rome was the spread of
                    law. Next we get incidental but not unimportant references to the destruction of
                    roads and property wrought by the Goths, to the state of the havens at the
                    mouths of the Tiber and the general decay of nearly all the old commercial ports
                    on the coast. Most of these were as desolate then as now. Rutilius even
                    exaggerates the desolation of the once important city of Cosa in Etruria, whose
                    walls have scarcely changed from that day to ours. The port that served Pisae,
                    almost alone of all those visited by Rutilius, seems to have retained its
                    prosperity, and to have foreshadowed the subsequent greatness of that city. At
                    one point on the coast the villagers everywhere were “soothing their wearied
                    hearts with holy merriment,” and were celebrating the festival of Osiris.</p>
                <p>All existing MSS. of Rutilius are later than 1494, and are copies from a lost
                    copy of an ancient MS. once at the monastery of Bobio <hi rend="subscript"
                    >1</hi> which disappeared about 1700. The <hi rend="italic">editiο princeps</hi>
                    is that by J. B. Pius (Bologna, 1520), and the principal editions since have
                    been those by Barth (1623), P. Burman (1731, in his edition of the minor Latin
                    poets), Wernsdorf (1778, part of a similar collection), Zumpt (1840), and the
                    critical edition by Lucian Miiller (Teubner, Leipsic, 1870). MiilIer writes the
                    poet’s name as Claudius Rutilius Namatianus, instead of the usual Rutilius
                    Claudius Namatianus-; but if the identification of the poet’s father with the
                    Claudius mentioned in the Theodosian Code be correct, Miiller is probably wrong.
                    Rutilius receives more or less attention from all writers on the history or
                    literature of the times, but a lucid chapter in Beugnot, <hi rend="italic"
                    >Histoire de lα Destruction du Paganisme en Occident</hi> (1835), may be
                    especially mentioned. It should be noted that in using the passage concerning
                    Stilicho we have ventured to read the line at ii. 45 thus— <hi rend="italic"
                    >Hiacae cladis détérioré dolo;</hi> the change from the MSS. reading <hi
                    rend="italic">Illatae cladis Hberiore dolo</hi> (preserved in all editions)
                    seems demanded by the context, as well as by the sense. (J. S. R.)</p>
