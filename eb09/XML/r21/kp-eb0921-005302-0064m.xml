                    of the Romans ”; and in 1576, after his father’s death, he became emperor. He
                    was of an indolent and melancholy disposition, and preferred the study of
                    astrology and alchemy to the responsibilities of government. He surrendered
                    himself absolutely to the control of the Jesuits, under whose influence he had
                    been brought up at the gloomy court of Spain; and in his hereditary lands they
                    laboured assiduously to destroy Protestantism. The Protestants were deprived of
                    the right of public worship in Vienna and other towns; their schools were
                    closed, and many of their preachers banished. Almost all public offices, too,
                    were placed in the hands of Roman Catholics. In the lands which Rudolph ruled,
                    not by hereditary right, but as emperor, his advisers could exercise less
                    authority; but there also they did what they could to foster the Catholic
                    reaction. In 1607 Maximilian, duke of Bavaria, was allowed to seize the imperial
                    city Donauwörth, the Protestant inhabitants of which had quarrelled with the
                    abbot. This and other high-handed proceedings alarmed the Protestants of
                    Germany, and in 1608, under the leadership of Frederick IV., elector of the
                    Palatinate, they formed a confederation called the Union for the protection of
                    their interests. The Catholic princes, guided by Duke Maximilian of Bavaria,
                    responded by forming the League. Civil war seemed inevitable, but it was
                    postponed by the murder of Henry IV. of France, who had promised to support the
                    Union, and by the death of the elector Frederick IV. Meanwhile, the greatest
                    confusion prevailed in Hungary, due in part to religious oppression, in part to
                    a war with the Turks. In 1601 the Hungarians rebelled, and peace was not
                    restored until 1606, when Matthias, the emperor’s brother, with the sanction of
                    his younger brothers, who acknowledged him as head of the family, came to terms
                    both with the Hungarians and with the sultan. Matthias allied himself with the
                    Protestants, and compelled Rudolph to give up to him Hungary, Moravia, and the
                    greater part of Austria. The emperor then tried to strengthen his position by
                    granting to the nobles, knights, and towns of Bohemia perfect religious freedom,
                    with the right to build Protestant churches and schools on their own and on the
                    royal lands. Even after they had obtained the letter of majesty in which these
                    *concessions were embodied, the Bohemians did not trust Rudolph; and, when at
                    his request the archduke Leopold appeared in their country with an army, they
                    invited Matthias to come to their aid. Matthias went, and the emperor had no
                    alternative but to resign tö him in 1611 the remainder of his hereditary
                    territories. Rudolph died on the 20th January 1612.</p>
