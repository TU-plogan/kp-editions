                    goal, was a game of the Greek pentathlon. It was diversified with the
                    διαυλοδρό/zoç, in which a distance mark was rounded and the starting and winning
                    points were the same, and also by the δρό/zoç οπλιτών, which might be compared
                    to the modern heavy marching order race. In ancient Italy running was practised
                    in circus exhibitions, as described by Virgil (√Λ7ι. v. 286 <hi rend="italic"
                    >sqj.</hi> In modern times it has been developed almost into a science by the
                    Anglo-Saxon race in Great Britain and North America, till the distances recently

                    end of the first half of the century. In all kinds of running the entire weight
                    of the body is thrown on the toes, from which light strides are taken with all
                    possible freedom of action from the hips. At starting the feet are placed about
                    a foot apart, the body being inclined slightly forward, with the weight of it on
                    the right or Iiindermost foot. A bent double position with the feet wide apart
                    is on no account advisable. The start cannot be made too quickly on the signal
                    being given. Two or three short steps are taken to get fairly into stride, after
                    which the runner should look straight before him, set his eyes steadfastly on
                    the goal, and run towards it at his longest and quickest stride, care being
                    taken not to swerve or get out of stride.</p>
                <p>Running is usually thus classified :—(1) sprinting includes all distances up to
                    400 yards; (2) medium distances range from one quarter to three quarters of a
                    mile; (3) long distances are those of one mile and upwards. The first-named is
                    the most popular, and is much practised in the north of England, especially at
                    Sheffield, which may be termed the home of sprint running. It is less fatiguing
                    than long distances and requires less arduous training, while strength to a
                    certain extent replaces wind. A great point in sprinting is to obtain a good
                    start, for which purpose incessant practice is required. A first-class sprinter
                    when at full sp.eed will clear from 8 to 9 feet in each stride, and his toes
                    leave the ground with inconceivable rapidity. When in good condition he will run
                    100 yards at top speed in one breath, and probably 150 yards without drawing a
                    second one. The quickest authenticated times in which short distances have been
                    run on perfectly level ground are as follows :—120 yards, 11⅜ sec.; 150 yards,
                    15 sec.; 200 yards, 19⅜ sec.; 300 yards, 30 sec.; and 400 yards, 43 j sec.</p>
                <p>Of medium distances the quarter mile race is by far the most difficult to run, as
                    a combination of speed and endurance is requisite. In fact a runner should be
                    able to sprint the whole way. Six hundred yards and half a mile are the other
                    chief distances in this class of running. The stride is slower than in
                    sprinting, and a man cannot maintain the same speed throughout as is possible up
                    to 300 yards. The best authenticated times are—quarter mile, 48J <hi
                    rend="superscript">sec</hi> ∙ &gt; 600 yards, 1 min. 11⅜ sec.; half mile, 1 min.
                    53⅛ sec.; 1000 yards, 2 min. 13 sec.; three quarter mile, 3 min. 7 sec.</p>
                <p>Light wiry men are best fitted for long-distance running, where stamina and wind
                    are more useful than speed. The strides must be long and light. After some miles
                    a runner is unable to keep the weight of the body on his toes any longer owing
                    to fatigue, puts his heels down, and runs flat-footed. The times accomplished of
                    late years by long-distance runners are most remarkable. Those for the chief
                    distances are as follows :—1 mile, 4 min. 16⅜ sec.; 2 miles, 9 min. 11⅜ sec.; 3
                    miles, 14 min. 36 sec.; 4 miles, 19 min. 36 sec.; 5 miles, 24 min. 40 sec.; 10
                    miles, 51 min. 6⅛ sec.; 20 miles, 1 h. 56 min. 38 sec.; 30 miles, 3 h. 15 min. 9
                    sec.; 40 miles, 4 h. 34 min. 27 sec.; 50 miles, 6 h. 8 min.; 100 miles, 13 h. 26
                    min. 30 sec.; 200 miles, 35 h. 9 min. 28 sec.; 300 miles, 58 h. 17 min. 6 sec.;
                    400 miles, 85 h. 52 min.; 500 miles, 109 h. 18 min. 20 sec.; 600 miles, 137 h.
                    25 min. 10 sec.; 610 miles, 140 h. 34 min. 10 sec.</p>
                <p>Nearly all running contests now take place on prepared cinder paths, which from
                    their springiness assist speed considerably. A runner’s dress should be as light
                    as possible, and consist merely of a thin jersey, a pair of drawers covering the
                    waist and loins and extending downwards to the top of the knee caps, and
                    heelless running shoes with a few short spikes in the soles just under the tread
                    of the foot. The spikes are longer for sprinting. Chamois leather socks for the
                    toes and ball of the foot may be added, since they diminish concussion as each
                    foot reaches the ground. Since the introduction of Athletic Sports (see vol.
                    iii. p. 12) into England and America commenced in 1860 the popularity of amateur
                    running races has vastly increased. These contests are governed by the rules of
                    the Amateur Athletic Association. At Sheffield a code of rules has been drawn up
                    for the regulation of the more important professional handicaps.</p>
