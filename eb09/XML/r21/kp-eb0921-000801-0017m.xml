                    1650. His family was of small means but of not inconsiderable station, and seems
                    to have had a kind of hereditary connexion with the magistracy of the town of
                    Dreux. He himself was “lieutenant particulier et civil,” a post not easy to
                    translate, but apparently possessing some affinity to a Scotch sheriffship
                    substitute. Rotrou, however, went very early to Paris, and, though three years
                    younger than Corneille, with whom he was intimately acquainted, began
                    play-writing before him. With few exceptions the only events recorded of his
                    life are the successive appearances of his plays and his enrolment in the band
                    of five poets who had the not very honourable or congenial duty of turning
                    Richelieu’s dramatic ideas into shape. Rotrou’s own first piece, <hi
                    rend="italic">HHypocondriaque,,</hi> appeared when he was only seventeen. His
                    second, <hi rend="italic">La Bague de VOubli,</hi> an adaptation in part from
                    Lope de Vega, was much better, much more suggestive, and much more
                    characteristic. It is the first of several plays in which Rotrou, following or
                    striking out for himself a way which did not lead to much for the time but which
                    was again entered at the Romantic revival, endeavoured to naturalize in France
                    the romantic comedy which had flourished in Spain and England instead of the
                    classical tragedy of Seneca and the classical comedy of Terence. Corneille, as
                    is known to readers of his early work, had considerable leanings in the same
                    direction, and yielded but slowly and unwillingly to the pressure of critical
                    opinion and the public taste. Rotrou’s brilliant but hasty and unequal work
                    showed throughout marks of a stronger adhesion to the Spanish (it is needless to
                    say that neither writer is likely to have known the English) model. <hi
                    rend="italic">Cleagenor et Doristee, Diane, Les Occasions Perdues, HHeureuse
                    Constance,</hi> pieces which succeeded each other very rapidly, were all in the
                    Spanish style. Then the author changed his school, and, in 1632, imitated very
                    closely the <hi rend="italic">Mensechrni</hi> of Plautus and the <hi
                    rend="italic">Hercules Oetaeus</hi> of Seneca. A crowd of comedies and
                    tragi-comedies followed, and by the time he was twenty-eight (when documents
                    exist showing the sale of two batches of them to the bookseller Quinet for the
                    sum of 220 livres tournois) Rotrou had written nearly a score of plays. He was
                    married in 1640, and had three children, a son and two daughters (none of vzhom,
                    however, continued the name), and it seems that he went to live at Dreux.
                    Previously, vague and anecdotic tradition describes him as having led rather a
                    wild life in Paris, and especially as having been much addicted to gambling.
                    Among his pieces written before his marriage were a translation of the <hi
                    rend="italic">Amphitryon</hi> under the title of <hi rend="italic">Les Deux
                    Sosies,</hi> which was not useless to Molière, <hi rend="italic">Antigone,</hi>
                    which was not useless to Racine, and <hi rend="italic">Laure Persecutee</hi> (in
                    the opposite style to these classical pieces), which has much merit. These were
                    followed by others until, in 1646 and 1647, Rotrou produced his three
                    masterpieces, <hi rend="italic">Saint Genest,</hi> a story of Christian
                    martyrdom containing some amusing by-play, one noble speech, and a good deal of
                    dignified action; <hi rend="italic">Don Bertrand de Cabrère,</hi> a comedy of
                    merit; and <hi rend="italic">Ven-ceslas,</hi> which is considered in France his
                    masterpiece, and which in a manner kept the stage till our own times. The
                    subject (in which a father, being constrained to choose between his duty as king
                    and his parental affection, pardons his son for a murder he has committed, but
                    immediately abdicates as feeling himself unworthy to reign) was taken from
                    Francisco de Rojas; the execution,</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit21newyrich/page/n18/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0921-0018-0009"/>
                <p>though unequal, is in parts very fine. Rotrou’s death and its circumstances are
                    known to many who never read a line of his plays. He was in Paris when the
                    plague broke out at Dreux; the mayor fled, and all was confusion. Rotrou,
                    reversing the conduct of Montaigne in somewhat similar circumstances, at once
                    went to his post, caught the disease, and died in a few hours.</p>
                <p>Rotrou’s great fertility (he has left thirty-five collected plays besides others
                    lost, strayed, or uncollected), and perhaps the uncertainty of dramatic plan
                    shown by his hesitation almost to the last between the classical and the
                    romantic style, have injured his work. He has no thoroughly good play, hardly
                    one thoroughly good act. But his situations are often pathetic and noble, and as
                    a tragic poet properly so called he is at his best almost the equal of Corneille
                    and perhaps the superior of Racine. His single lines and single phrases have a
                    brilliancy and force not to be found in French drama between Corneille and
                    Hugo.</p>
                <p>A complete edition of Rotron was edited in five volumes by Viollet Ie Due in
                    1820. In 1882 M. de Ronehaud published a handsome edition of six plays— <hi
                    rend="italic">Saint Genest, VenxeslosHon Bertrand de Cabrcre, Antigone, Hercule
                    Mourant,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Cosroes,—</hi> the latter Rotrou’s last play
                    and a remarkable one. <hi rend="italic">Venceslas</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >Saint Genest</hi> are also to be found in the <hi rend="italic">Chxfs-di oeuvre
                    Tragiques</hi> of the Collection Didot.</p>
