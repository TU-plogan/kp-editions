                    Himalaya Mountains, and of the Flora of Cashmere,</hi> in 2 vols. 4to, begun in

                    on such as are useful in the arts or as drugs. In addition to this work,
                    however, he wrote several others of repute, viz., <hi rend="italic">An Essay on

                    journals, for the most part published in India. Among these papers are included
                    three on geological subjects. A list of the whole will be found in the <hi
