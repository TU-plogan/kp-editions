                    (1670-1741), a poet of some merit and a wit of considerable dexterity, was born
                    at Paris on the IOth April 1670; he died at Brussels on the 17th March 1741. The
                    son of a shoemaker, he is said to have been ashamed of his parentage and
                    relations when he acquired a certain popularity, but the abundance of literary
                    quarrels in which he spent his life, and the malicious inventiveness of his
                    chief enemy, Voltaire, make any such stories of small account. He was certainly
                    well educated and early gained favour with Boileau, who did not regard many
                    people favourably; but authentic intelligence as to his youth is very scarce. He
                    does not seem to have attempted literature very young, and when he began he
                    began with the theatre, for which at no part of his life does he seem to have
                    had any aptitude. A one-act comedy, <hi rend="italic">Le Cafe,</hi> failed in
                    1694, and he was not much happier with a more ambitious play, <hi rend="italic"
                    >Les Flatteurs,</hi> or with the opera of <hi rend="italic">Venus and
                    Adonis.</hi> He would not take these warnings, and tried in 1700 another comedy,
                    <hi rend="italic">Le Capmcieujc,</hi> which had the same fate. By this time he
                    had already (it is not quite clear how) obtained influential patrons, such as
                    Breteuil and Tallard, had gone with Tallard as an attaché to London, and, in
                    days when literature still led to high position, seemed likely to achieve
                    success. To tell the whole story of his misfortunes would take far more space
                    than can be spared him here. They began with what may be called a club squabble
                    at a certain Café Laurent, which was much frequented by literary men, and where
                    Rousseau indulged in lampoons on his companions. A shower of libellous and
                    sometimes obscene verses was written by or attributed to him, and at last he was
                    practically turned out of the café. At the same time his poems, as yet only
                    singly printed or in manuscript, acquired him a great reputation, and not
                    unjustly, for Rousseau is certainly the best French writer of serious lyrics
                    between Racine and Chénier. He had in 1701 been made a member of the Académie
                    des Inscriptions; he had been offered, though he had not accepted, profitable
                    places in the revenue department; he had become a favourite of the libertine but
                    not Uninfluential coterie of the Temple; and in 1710 he presented himself as a
                    candidate for the Académie Française. Then began the second chapter (the first
                    had lasted ten years) of a history of the animosities of authors which is almost
                    the strangest though not the most important on record. A copy of verses, more
                    offensive than ever, was handed to the original object of Rousseau’s jealousy,
                    and, getting wind, occasioned the bastinadoing of the reputed author by a
                    certain La Faye or La Faille, a soldier who was reflected on. Legal proceedings
                    of various kinds followed, and Rousseau either had or thought he had ground for
                    ascribing the lampoon to Joseph Saurin. More law ensued, and the end of it was
                    that in 1712 Rousseau, not appearing, was condemned <hi rend="italic">par
                    contumace</hi> to perpetual exile. He actually suffered it, remaining for the
                    rest of his life in foreign countries except for a short time in 1738, when he
                    returned clandestinely to Paris to try for a recall. It should be said that he
                    might have had this if he had not steadfastly protested his innocence and
                    refused to accept a mere pardon. No one has ever completely cleared up the
                    story, and it must be admitted that, except as exhibiting very strikingly the
                    strange idiosyncrasies of the 18th century in France, and as having affected the
                    fortunes of a man of letters of some eminence, it is not worth much
                    attention.</p>
                <p>Rousseau’s good and ill luck did not cease with his exile. First Prince Eugene
                    and then other persons of distinction took him under their protection, and he
                    printed at Soleure the first edition of his poetical works. But by fault or
                    misfortune he still continued to quarrel. Voltaire and he met at Brussels in
                    1722, and, though Voltaire had hitherto pretended or felt a great admiration for
                    him, something happened which turned this admiration into hatred. Voltaire’s <hi
                    rend="italic">Le Pour et Le Contre</hi> is said to have shocked Rousseau, who
                    expressed his sentiments freely. At any rate the latter had thenceforward no
                    fiercer enemy than Voltaire. Rousseau, however, was not much affected by
                    Voltaire’s enmity, and pursued for nearly twenty years a life of literary work,
                    of courtiership, and of rather obscure speculation and business. Although he
                    never made his fortune, it does not seem that he was ever in want. When he died
                    his death had the singular result of eliciting from a poetaster, Lefranc de
                    Pompignan, an ode of real excellence and perhaps better than anything of
                    Rousseau’s own work. That work, however, has high merits, and is divided,
                    roughly speaking, into two strangely contrasted divisions. One consists of
                    formal and partly sacred odes and <hi rend="italic">cantates</hi> of the
                    stiffest character, the other of brief epigrams, sometimes licentious and always
                    or almost always ill-natured. In the latter class of work Rousseau is only
                    inferior to his friend Piron. In the former he stands almost alone. The
                    frigidity of conventional diction and the disuse of all really lyrical rhythm
                    which characterize his period do not prevent his odes and cantates from showing
                    true poetical faculty, grievously cramped no doubt, but still existing.</p>
                <p>Besides the Soleure edition mentioned above, Rousseau published (visiting England
                    for the purpose) another issue of his work at London in 1723. The chief edition
                    since is that of Amar in 1820. M. A. de Latour has published (Paris, Gamier,
                    1869) a useful though not complete edition, with notes of merit and a
                    biographical introduction which would have been better if the facts had been
                    more punctually and precisely stated.</p>
