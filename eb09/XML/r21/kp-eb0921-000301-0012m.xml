                    rend="smallcaps">Mayer Anselm</hi> (1743-1812), the son of Anselm Moses Bauer, a
                    small Jewish merchant of Frankfort-on-the-Main. His father wished him to become
                    a rabbi, but he preferred business, and ultimately set up as a money lender at
                    the sign of the “Red Shield” <hi rend="italic">[RothschilcV)</hi> in the
                    Frankfort Juden-gasse. He had already acquired some standing as a banker when
                    his numismatic tastes obtained for him the friendship of William, ninth
                    landgrave and afterwards elector of Hesse-Cassel, who in 1801 made him his
                    agent. In the following year Rothschild negotiated his first great Government
                    loan, ten million thalers for the Danish Government. When the landgrave was
                    compelled to flee from his capital on the entry of the French, he placed his
                    silver and other bulky treasures in the hands of Rothschild, who, not without
                    considerable risk, took charge of them and buried them, it is said in a corner
                    of his garden, whence he dug them up as opportunity arose for disposing of them.
                    This he did to such advantage as to be able afterwards to return their value to
                    the elector at 5 per cent, interest. He died at Frankfort 19 th September 1812,
                    leaving ten children, five sons and five daughters. Branches of the business
                    were established at Vienna, London, Paris, and Naples, each being in charge of
                    one of the sons, the chief of the firm always residing at Frankfort, where, in
                    accordance with the wish of the founder, all important consultations are held.
                    By a system of cooperation and joint counsels, aided by the skilful employment
                    of subordinate agents, they obtained unexampled opportunities of acquiring an
                    accurate knowledge of the condition of the financial market, and practically
                    embraced the whole of Europe within their financial network. The unity of the
                    interests of the several members of the firm has been preserved by the system of
                    intermarriages which has been the general practice of the descendants of the
                    five brothers, and the house has thus grown in solidity and influence with every
                    succeeding generation. Each of the brothers received in 1815 from Austria the
                    privilege of hereditary landowners, and in 1822 they were created barons by the
                    same country. The charge of the Frankfort house devolved on the eldest, <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Anselm Mayer</hi> (1773-1855), born</p>
                <p>12th June 1773, who was chosen a member of the royal Prussian privy council of
                    commerce, and, in 1820, Bavarian consul and court banker. The Vienna branch was
                    undertaken by <hi rend="smallcaps">Solomon</hi> (1774-1826), born 9th December
                    1774, who entered into intimate relations with Prince Metternich, which
                    contributed in no small degree to bring about the connexion of the firm with the
                    allied powers. The third brother, <hi rend="smallcaps">Nathan Mayer</hi>
                    (1777-1836), born 16th September 1777, has, however, generally been regarded as
                    the financial genius of the family, and the chief originator of the transactions
                    which have created for the house its unexampled position in the financial world.
                    He came to Manchester about 1800 to act as a purchaser for his father of
                    manufactured goods; but at the end of five years he removed to London, where he
                    found full scope for his financial genius. The boldness and skill of his
                    transactions, which caused him at first to' be regarded as rash and unsafe by
                    the leading banking firms and financial merchants, latterly awakened their
                    admiration and envy. By the employment of carrier pigeons and of fast-sailing
                    boats of his own for the transmission of news he was able to utilize to the best
                    advantage his special sources of information, while no one was a greater adept
                    in the art of promoting the rise and fall of tho stocks. The colossal influence
                    of the house dates from an operation of his in 1810. In that year Wellington
                    made some drafts which the English Government could not meet; these were
                    purchased by Rothschild at a liberal discount, and renewed to the Government,
                    which finally redeemed at par. From this time the house became associated with
                    the allied powers in the struggle against Napoleon, it being chiefly through it
                    that they were able to negotiate loans to carry on the war. Rothschild never
                    lost faith in the ultimate overthrow of Napoleon, his all being virtually staked
                    on the issue of the contest. He is said to have been present at the battle of
                    Waterloo, and to have watched the varying fortunes of the day with feverish
                    eagerness. Being able to transmit to London private information of the allied
                    success several hours before it reached the public, he effected an immense
                    profit by the purchase of stock, which had been greatly depressed on account of
                    the news of Blucher’s defeat two days previously. Rothschild was the first to
                    popularize foreign loans in Britain by fixing the rate in sterling money and
                    making the dividends payable in London and not in foreign capitals. Latterly he
                    became the financial agent of nearly every civilized Government, although
                    persistently declining contracts for Spain or the American States. He did not
                    confine himself to operations on a large scale, but on the contrary made it a
                    principle to despise or neglect no feasible opportunity of transacting business,
                    while at the same time his operations gradually extended to every quarter of the
                    globe. He died 28th July 1836, and was succeeded in the management of the London
                    house by his son <hi rend="smallcaps">Lionel</hi> (1808-1879), born 22d November
                    1808, whose name will always be associated with the removal of the civil
                    disabilities of the Jews. He was elected a member for the City of London in
                    1847, and again in 1849 and 1852, but it was not till 1858 that the joint
                    operation of an Act of Parliament and a resolution of the House of Commons,
                    allowing the omission from the oath of the words to which as a Jew he
                    conscientiously objected, rendered it possible for him to take his seat. He
                    continued to represent the city of London till 1874. <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Jacob</hi> (1792-1868), the youngest of the original brothers, was intrusted
                    with the important mission of starting the business in Paris after the
                    restoration of the Bourbons, for whom he negotiated large loans. I At the
                    Revolution of 1848 he was a heavy loser, and had also to be protected for a time
                    by a special guard. It was by his capital that the earliest railroads were con-,
                    structed in France; the profits he obtained from the speculation were very
                    large. He died 15th November 1868. The Naples branch was superintended by
                    another of the brothers, <hi rend="smallcaps">Karl</hi> (1780-1855). It was
                    always the least irμportant of the five, and after the annexation of Naples
                    to'Italy in 1860 it was discontinued.</p>
