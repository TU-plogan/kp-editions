                    The Hague and 44⅜ south of Amsterdam. As defined by its 17th-century
                    fortifications the town was an isosceles triangle with a base of I^ miles along
                    the river, but in modern times it has spread out in all directions beyond the
                    limits of its own commune (which was increased in 1869 by the island of
                    Fijenoord and part of the south bank of the river) into those of Delfshaven,
                    Kralingen, and Hillegersberg. A huge dyke on which stands Hoog Straat or High
                    Street divides the triangular portion into nearly equal parts—the inner and the
                    outer town; and the latter is cut up into a series of peninsulas and islands by
                    the admirable system of harbours to which Rotterdam owes so much of its
                    prosperity. The central part of the river frontage is lined by a broad quay
                    called the Boompjes from the trees with which it is planted. From the apex of
                    the triangle the town is bisected by a great railway viaduct (erected about
                    1870, and mainly constructed of iron), which is continued across the river to
                    Fijenoord and the south bank by a bridge on a similarly grand scale, the line
                    being the Great Southern Railway which connects Belgium and Holland and crosses
                    the Hollandsch Diep by the Moerdijk bridge. Parallel with the railwaybridge the
                    municipality, in 1873, built a road-bridge, and apart from tbeir ordinary
                    function these constructions have proved a sufficient barrier to prevent the
                    ice-blocks of the upper part of the river from descending so as to interfere
                    with the seaward navigation. Tramways, introduced in 1880, are being gradually
                    extended to various suburbs. While some nine or ten Protestant sects, the Roman
                    Catholics, the Old Roman Catholics, and the Jews are all represented in
                    Rotterdam, none of the ecclesiastical buildings are of primary architectural
                    interest. The Groote Kerk or Laurenskerk is a Gothic brick structure of the
                    fifteenth century with a tower 297 feet high; it has a fine rood screen and an
                    excellent organ, and contains the monuments of Lambert Hendriks-zoon, Egbert
                    Meeuweszoon Kortenaar, Witte Corneliszoon de Witt, Johan van Brakel, Johan van
                    Liefde, and other Dutch naval heroes. Among the more conspicuous secular
                    buildings are the Boymans Museum, the town-house (restored in 1823-1827), the
                    exchange (1723), the Delft Gate (1766), the court-house, the post and telegraph
                    office (1875), the corn exchange, the seamen’s home (1855), the hospital (1846),
                    and the theatres. The Boymans AIuseum is mainly a picture gallery, which became
                    the property of the town in 1847. When the building, originally erected in
                    1662-63 as the assembly house of Schieland, was burned down in 1864, most of the
                    pictures perished, but the museum was restored by 1867, and the collection,
                    steadily recruited, is again rich in the works of Dutch artists. The ground
                    floor also contains the city archives and the city library. The maritime museum,
                    established in 1874 by the Yacht Club, is a remarkable collection of ship
                    models, and the Society of Experimental Philosophy has a considerable collection
                    of instruments, books, and specimens. At the north-west corner of the town an
                    area of several acres is occupied by the zoological garden, which dates from
                    1857. Besides the Erasmus Gymnasium the <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0921-0019-0010"/>educational institutions comprise an academy of
                    art and technical science, a naval school, an industrial school, a deaf and dumb
                    asylum, &lt;fcc. In the Groote Markt (to the south of the Hoog Straat) stands
                    the bronze statue of Erasmus (Gerrit Gerrits), erected by his fellow-citizens in
                    1662; and his birth-house, now a tavern in Wijde Kerk-straat, is distinguished
                    by a Latin inscription. The statue by Grefs of Gijsbert Karel van Hogendorp
                    (1762-1834), a great Dutch statesman, gives his name to the Hogeudorpsplein,
                    formerly Boymansplein, behind the museum; in the “Park,” which extends west
                    along the bank of the Maas, is a marble statue by Strackée of Hendrik Tollens,
                    tho Dutch poet; and the Nieuwmarkt is adorned with a fountain in memory of the
                    jubilee (1863) of the restoration of Dutch independence (1813). Extensive works
                    for supplying the town with filtered water were constructed between 1870 and
                    187δ, the water in the river and - canals being rendered unwholesome by the
                    sewerage, the treatment of which naturally presents great difficulties in a city
                    lying in great part below high-water level. The most important industrial
                    establishment is that of the Netherlands Steamboat Company, who are shipowners,
                    shipbuilders, and engineers; there are also extensive sugar-refineries and a
                    great variety of smaller factories for the production of lead, iron, and copper
                    wares, white lead, varnishes, tobacco and cigars, beer and vinegar, chocolate
                    and confectionery, Ac. Rotterdam is, however, not so much a manufacturing as a
                    commercial city, and its commercial progress has been very striking since the
                    middle of the century. While in 1846 it had only 321,764 tons out of the total
                    of 1,024,705 tons which then represented the export trade of the Netherlands, in
                    1883 it had 1,940,026 tons out of a total of 3,953,009 tons. In 1850 it had only
                    27 ’ 9 per cent, of the outgoing vessels, and 35 <hi rend="superscript">,</hi>
                    77 per cent, of the tonnage; by 1870 it had 35 <hi rend="superscript">,</hi> 60
                    per cent, of the vessels and 50 <hi rend="superscript">-</hi> 37 of the tonnage,
                    and by 1883 43 <hi rend="superscript">-</hi> 75 per cent, of the vessels, and
                    49Ό8 of the tonnage. Rotterdam has thus become what Amsterdam formerly was—the
                    principal port in the country. For steamers it is now, since the opening of the
                    new waterway through the Hoek van Holland in 1872, only two hours distant from
                    the sea, and the channel is deep enough for vessels drawing 22 feet of water.
                    <note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Previously the only
                    direct way to the sea was by the Brielle (Brill) Channel, where in 1856 the
                    fairway had gradually diminished in depth to δ feet at low water and 11 or 12
                    feet at high water. In 1866 the works for the new waterway were commenced, and
                    by November 1868 the canal from the Scheur (or northern arm of the Maas) across
                    the Hoek had been dug. The seaward piers were completed to tho originally
                    proposed length of (together) 2800 metres, but in 1871 they were prolonged to a
                    total of 4300 metres, thus jutting out into the sea for more than a mile.
                    Contrary to expectations the scour was not strong enough to widen the fairway;
                    and works for this purpose were commenced in 1877, and at a later period the
                    width of 900 metres between the piers was reduced to 700 metres by constructing
                    an inner pier north of the south pier. The whole work has cost upwards of
                    23,000,000 guilders (£1,750,000)—15⅛ millions expended up to 1879, and 7∣
                    between 1881 and 1884. With the exception of a contribution of not more than
                    3,000,000 from the city of Rotterdam, the entire sum has been paid by the state.
                    </p></note> From 4471 vessels with a register tonnage of 1,688,700 tons in 1873,
                    the shipping clearing from the Netherlands by the new waterway had increased by
                    1884 to 8177 vessels with register tonnage of 4,382,100 tons. Upwards of 18,000
                    emigrants left Europe by Rotterdam in 1881. Besides its maritime trade Rotterdam
                    commands a most extensive river traffic, not only with the towns of the
                    Netherlands, but with those of Belgium and Germany. With Germany alone its Rhine
                    traffic amounted in 1883 to 1,706,587 tons, against 2,021,644 for all the other
                    ports of the Netherlands. On January 1, 1885, Rotterdam owned 43 sailing vessels
                    and 50 steam-ships with <hi rend="underline">a uni</hi> ted aggregate burden of
                    99,018 tons. Owing to the great increase of navigation and commerce tho berthing
                    accommodation of the port frequently proves too small, though by the works at
                    Fijenoord the length of tho quays has of late years been extended by about 8000
                    metres. This island, two-thirds of which was purchased by tho town in 1591 and
                    the remaining third in 1658, was dyked in 1795, and became the.seat of a
                    building which has been in succession a pest-house, a military hospital, a naval
                    college, and a private industrial school. The Netherlands Steamboat Company
                    established its workshops there in 1825; and in 1873 the Rotterdam Trading
                    Company began to construct the harbours and warehouses which have been purchased
                    by the city. The population of the commune of Rotterdam, which did not much
                    exceed 20,000 in 1632, was 53,212 in 1796, 72,294 in 1830, 88,812 in 1850,
                    105,858 in 1860, 132,054 in 1876, and 148,102 in 1879-80. In 1870 the city
                    contained 111,256 inhabitants, the suburbs 3341, and the ships 2478, and in 1884
                    the total, exclusive of the shipping, was 169,477.</p>
                <p>Rotterdam probably owes its origin to the ca6tles of Wena and Bulgei <hi
                    rend="superscript">-</hi> Stein, of which the former was laid in ruins by tho
                    Hoek party in 1426. In 1299 Count John I. granted the “good people of Rotterdam”
                    the same rights as the burghers of Beverwijk, and freedom from toll in all his
                    lands. In 1597 a sixth extension of the town’s area took place, and a seventh
                    followed in 1609. Francis of Brederodeseized the place in 1488, but had to
                    surrender it to tho emperor Maximilian in 1489. The Spaniards were in possession
                    from April 9th to July 31st 1572, Iiavinggained entrance partly by treachery and
                    partly by force (see Motley, <hi rend="italic">Dutch Repτιblie,</hi> ii.). It
                    was at a meeting of the states held at Rotterdam in June 1574 that the relief of
                    Leyden was determined on, though it was not till 1580 that the town obtained a
                    vote in the assembly.</p>
