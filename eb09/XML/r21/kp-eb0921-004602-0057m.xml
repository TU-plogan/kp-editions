                <p><label type="entry">RUBRUQUIS</label> the name which has most commonly been given
                    to William of Rubruk, a Franciscan friar and the author of a remarkable
                    narrative of Asiatic travel in the 13th century. Nothing is known of him save
                    what can be gathered from his own narrative, with the exception of a word from
                    the pen of Roger Bacon, his contemporary and brother Franciscan, indicating
                    personal acquaintance. The name of Rubruquis has adhered to him, owing to this
                    form ( <hi rend="superscript">u</hi> Willielmus de Rubruquis ”) being found in
                    the imperfect copy of the Latin original printed by Hakluyt in his collection,
                    and followed in his English translation, as well as in the completer issue of
                    the English by Purchas. Writers, again, of the 16th and 17th centuries have
                    called the traveller Risbroucke and Rysbrokius, for which there is no
                    authority,—an error founded on the too hasty identification of his name of
                    origin with Ruysbroeck in Brabant (a few miles south of Brussels). This error
                    was probably promoted by the fame of John of Ruysbroeck or Rysbroeck
                    (1294-1381), a Belgian mystic theologian, whose treatises have been reprinted as
                    late as 1848 (see vol. xvii. p. 133). Our traveller is styled “,Guillaume de
                    Rysbroeck” and “Ruysbroek” in the <hi rend="italic">Biographie Universelle</hi>
                    and in the <hi rend="italic">Nouv. Biog. Générale.</hi> It is only within the
                    last twenty years that attention has been called to the fact that Rubrouck is
                    the name of a village and commune in what was formerly called French Flanders,
                    belonging to the canton of Cassel in the department du Nord, and lying some 8⅜
                    miles north-east of St Omer. In the library of the latter city many mediaeval
                    documents exist referring expressly to</p>
                <p>Rubrouck, and to persons in the 12th and 13th centuries styled as “de Rubrouck.”

                    such documents was published by M. Edm. Coussemaker of Lille. See remarks by M.

                    pp. 569-570. </p></note> It may be fairly assumed that Friar William came from
                    this place; indeed, if attention had been paid to the title of the MS. belonging
                    to Lord Lumley, which was published by Hakluyt <hi rend="italic">(Itiuerarium

                    been no question as to the traveller’s quasi-French nationality; <note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>The country of Flanders was
                    at this time a fief of the French crown (see Natalis de Wailly, <hi
                    rend="italic">Notes on Joinville,</hi> p. 576). William’s mother-tongue may
                    probably have been Flemish. But this cannot be proved by his representation to
                    Mangu Khan (p. 361) that certain <hi rend="italic">Teutonici</hi> who had been
                    carried away as slaves by a Tartar chief were <hi rend="italic">nostroe
                    linguae,</hi> as Dr Franz Schmidt inclines to think. </p></note> but this
                    (erroneously) has always been treated as if it were an arbitrary gloss of
                    Hakluyt’s own.</p>
                <p>Friar William went to Tartary under orders from Louis IX. (St Louis). That king,
                    at an earlier date, viz., December 1248, when in Cyprus, had been visited by
                    certain persons representing themselves to be envoys from a great Tartar chief
                    Elchigaday (Ilchikadai), who commanded the Mongol hosts in Armenia and Persia.
                    The king then despatched a return mission consisting of Friar Andrew of Lonjumel
                    and other ecclesiastics, who cnrried presents and letters for both Ilchikadai
                    and the Great Khan. They reached the court of the latter in the winter of
                    1249-50, when there was in fact no actual khan on the throne; but in any case
                    they returned, along with Tartar envoys, bearing a letter to Louis, which was
                    couched in terms so arrogant and offensive that the king repented sorely of
                    having sent such a mission <hi rend="italic">(li rois se repenti fort quant il y
                    envoia,</hi> Joinville, § 492). These returned envoys reached the king when he
                    was at Caesarea, therefore between March 1251 and May 1252. It was, however, not
                    very long after that the zealous king, hearing that a great Tartar prince called
                    Sartak was a baptized Christian, felt strongly moved to open communication with
                    him, and for this purpose deputed Friar William of Rubruk with companions. But
                    it is evident that the former rebuff had made the king chary as to giving these
                    emissaries the character of his royal envoys, and Friar William on every
                    occasion, beginning with a sermon delivered in St Sophia’s (on Palm Sunday, <hi
                    rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> April 13, 1253), formally disclaimed that character,
                    alleging that, though he was the bearer of the king’s letters and presents, he
                    went simply in fulfilment of his duty as a Franciscan and preacher of the
                    gospel.</p>
                <p>Various histories of St Louis, and other documents which have come down to us,
                    give particulars of the despatch of the mission of Friar Andrew from Cyprus, but
                    none mention that of Friar William; and the first dates given by the latter are
                    those of his sermon at Constantinople, and of his embarkation from Sinope (May
                    7, 1253). He must therefore have received his commission at Acre, where the king
                    was residing from May 1252 to June 29, 1253; but he had travelled by way of
                    Constantinople, as has just been indicated, and there received letters to some
                    of the Tartar chiefs from the emperor, who was at this time Baldwin de
                    Courtenay, the last of the Latin dynasty.</p>
                <p>The narrative of the journey is everywhere full of life and interest, but we
                    cannot follow its details. The vast conquests of Jenghiz Khan were still in
                    nominal dependence on his successors, at this time represented by Mangu Khan,
                    reigning on the Mongolian steppes, but practically those conquests were
                    splitting up into several great monarchies. Of these the Ulûs of Jûjî, the
                    eldest son of Jenghiz, formed the most westerly, and its ruler was Bâtû Khan,
                    established on the Volga. Sartak is known in the history of the Mongols as
                    Bâtû’s eldest son, and was appointed his successor, though he died immediately
                    after his father (1255). The story of Sartak’s profession of Christianity may
                    have had some kind of foundation; it was currently believed among the Asiatic
                    <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit21newyrich/page/n58/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0921-0058-0047"/>Christians, and it is alleged by Armenian writers
                    that he had been brought up and baptized among the Russians.</p>
                <p>Rubruk and his party landed at Soldaia, or Sûdàk, on the Crimean eoast, a port
                    which was then the chief seat of the communication between the Mediterranean
                    states and what is now southern Russia. Equipped with horses and carts for the
                    steppe, they travelled successively to the courts of Sartak and of Batû,
                    respectively on the hither and further banks of the Volga, bandied from one to
                    the other, and then referred to the Great Khan himself, an order involving the
                    enormous journey to Mongolia. The actual travelling of the party from the Crimea
                    to the khan’s court near Karakorum cannot have been, on a rough calculation,
                    less than 5000 miles, and the return journey to Ayas in Cilicia would be longer
                    by 500 to 700 miles. The chief dates to be gathered from the narrative are as
                    follows :—embark on the Euxine, May 7, 1253; reach Soldaia, 21; set out thence,
                    June 1; reach camp of Sartak, July 31; begin journey from camp of Bâtû eastward
                    across steppe, September 16; turn south-east, November 1; reach Talas river, 8;
                    leave Cailac <note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Cailae,
                    where Rubruk halted twelve days, is undoubtedly the Kayalik of the historians of
                    the Mongols, the position of which is somewhat indefinite. The narrative of
                    Rubruk shows that it must have been near the modern Kopal. </p></note> (south of
                    Lake Balkash), 30; reach camp of Great Khan, December 27; leave camp of Great
                    Khan on or about July 10, 1254; reach camp of Bâtû again, September 16; leave
                    Sartak’s camp, November 1; at the Iron Gate (Derbend) 13; Christmas spent at
                    Nakhshivan (under Ararat); reach Antioch (from Ayas, <hi rend="italic">via</hi>
                    Cyprus), June 29, 1255; reach Tripoli, August 15.</p>
                <p>The camp of Batn was reached near the northernmost point of his summer marches,
                    therefore about Ukek near Saratoff (see <hi rend="italic">Marco Polo,</hi>
                    Prol., chap. iii. note 4). Before the camp was left they had marched with it
                    five weeks down the Volga. The point of departure would lie on that river
                    somewhere between 48° and 50° N. lat. The route taken lay eastward by a line
                    running north of the Caspian and Aral basins; then from about 70° E. long, south
                    (with some easting) to the basin of the Talas river; thence across the passes of
                    the Kirghiz Ala-tau and south of the Balkash Lake to the Ala-kul and the
                    Baratula Lake (Ebi-nûr). From this the travellers struck north across the
                    Barluk, or the Orkochuk Mountains, and thence, passing south of the modern
                    Kobdo, to the valley of the Jabkan river, whence they emerged on the plain of
                    Mongolia, coming upon the Great Khan’s camp at a spot ten days’ journey from
                    Karakorum and bearing in the main south from that place, with the Khangai
                    Mountains between.</p>
                <p>This route is of course not thus defined in the narrative, but is a laborious
                    deduction from the facts stated therein. The key to the whole is the description
                    given of that central portion intervening between the basin of the Talas and the
                    Lake Ala-kul, which enables the topography of that region, including the passage
                    of the Hi, the plain south of the Balkash, and the Ala-kul itself, to be
                    identified past question. <note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"

                    Schuyler points out the true identification of Rubruk’s river with the Hi,
                    instead of the Ctiu, which is a much smaller stream; and other amendments have
                    been derived from Dr F. M. Schmidt (see below). </p></note></p>
                <p>The return journey, being made in summer, after retraversing the Jabkan valley,
                    <note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>So the present writer
                    interprets what Rubruk says :—“Our going was in winter, our return in summer,
                    and that by a way lying very much farther north, only that for a space of
                    fifteen days’ journey in going and coming we followed a certain river between
                    mountains, and on these there was no grass to be found except close to the
                    river.” The position of the Chagan Takoi or upper Jabkan seems to suit these
                    facts best; but Mr Schuyler refers them to the upper Irtish, and Dr F. Schmidt
                    to the UHungur. </p></note> lay much farther to the north, and passed north of
                    the Balkash, with a tolerably straight course probably, to the mouths of the
                    Volga. Thence the party travelled south by Derbend, and so by Shamakhi to the
                    Araxes, Nakhshivan, Erzingan, Sivas, and Iconium, to the coast of Cilicia, and
                    eventually to the port of Ayas, where they embarked for Cyprus and Syria. St
                    Louis had returned to France a year before.</p>
                <p>We have alluded to Roger Bacon’s mention of Friar William of Rubruk. Indeed, in
                    the geographical section of the <hi rend="italic">Opus Majus</hi> (c. 1262) he
                    cites the traveller repeatedly and copiously, describing him as “frater
                    Wilhelmus quem dominus rex Franciae misit ad Tartaros, Anno Domini 1253 .... qui
                    perlustravit regiones orientis et aquilonis et Ioca in medio his annexa, et
                    scripsit haec praedicta illustri régi; quem Iibrum diligenter vidi et cum ejus

                    190-191). Add to this William’s own incidental particular as to his being (like
                    his precursor, Friar John of Pian Carpine, see vol. v. p. 132) a very heavy man
                    <hi rend="italic">(ponderosus valde),</hi> and we know no more of his
                    personality except the abundant indications of character afforded by the story
                    itself. These paint for us an honest, pious, stouthearted, acute, and most
                    intelligent observer, keen in the acquisition of knowledge, the author in fact
                    of one of the best narratives of travel in existence. His language indeed is
                    Latin of the most un-Ciceronian quality,—dog-Latin we fear it must be called;
                    but, call it what we may, it is in his hands a pithy and transparent medium of
                    expression. In spite of all the difficulties of communi-</p>
                <p>cation, and of the badness of his <hi rend="italic">turgcmannus</hi> or dragoman,

                    wonderfully true or near the truth, not only as to Asiatic nature, geography,
                    ethnography, and manners, but as to religion and language. Of his geography a
                    good example occurs in his account of the Caspian (eagerly caught up by Roger
                    Bacon), which is perfectly accurate, except that he places the hill country
                    occupied by the Mulahids, or Assassins, on the eastern instead of the southern
                    shore. He explicitly corrects the allegation of Isidore that it is a gulf of the
                    ocean: “non est verum quod dicit Ysidorus.....nusquam enim tangit oceanum, sed
                    undique circumdatur terra” (265). <note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    so far remote from Persia (281). The Yugurs (or Uigurs) of the country about
                    Cailac (see note above) had formed a language and character of their own, and in
                    that language and character the Nestorians of that tract used to perform their
                    office and write their books’ (281-2). The Yugurs are those among whom are found
                    the fountain and root of the Turkish and Comanian tongue (289). Their character
                    has been adopted by the Moghals. In using it they begin writing from the top and
                    write downwards, whilst line follows line from left to right (286). The
                    Nestorians say their service, and have their holy books, in Syriac, but know
                    nothing of the language, just as some of our monks sing the mass without knowing
                    Latin (293). The Tibet people write as we do, and their letters have a strong
                    resemblance to ours. The Tangut people write from right to left like the Arabs,
                    and their lines advance upwards (329). The current money of Cathay is of cotton
                    paper, a palm in length and breadth, and on this they print lines like those of
                    Mangu Khan’s <hi rend="italic">seal :— <hi rend="superscript">(i</hi> imprimunt
                    lineas</hi> sicut est Sigillum Mangu ”—a remarkable expression. They write with
                    a painter’s pencil and combine in one character several letters, forming one
                    expression :—“faciunt in una figura plures Iiteras compre-Iiendentes unam
                    dictionem,”—a still more remarkable utterance, showing an approximate
                    apprehension of the nature of Chinese writing (329).</p>
                <p>Yet this sagacious and honest observer is denounced as an ignorant and untruthful
                    blunderer by Isaac Jacob Schmidt (a man no doubt of useful learning, of a kind
                    rare in his day, but narrow and wrong-headed, and in natural acumen and candour
                    far inferior to the 13th-century friar whom he maligns), simply because the
                    evidence of the latter as to the Turkish dialect of the Uigurs traversed a pet
                    heresy, long since exploded, which Schmidt entertained, viz., that the Uigurs
                    were by race and language Tibetan. <note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                <p>The narrative of Rubruk, after Roger Bacon’s copious use of it, seems to have
                    dropped out of sight. It has no place in the famous collections of the 14th
                    century, nor in the earlier <hi rend="italic">Speculum Historiale</hi> of
                    Vincent of Beauvais, which gives so many others of the Tartarian ecclesiastical
                    itineraries. It first appeared imperfectly in Hakluyt (1600), as we have
                    mentioned. But it was not till 1839 that any proper edition of the text was
                    published. In that year the <hi rend="italic">Recueil de Voyages</hi> of the
                    Paris Geographical Society, vol. iv., contained a thorough edition of the Latin
                    text, and a collation of the few existing MSS., put forth by M. D'Avezac, with
                    the assistance of two young scholars, since of high distinction, viz.,
                    Francisque-Michel and Thomas Wright. But there is no commentary, such as M.
                    D’Avezac attached, in his own Incomparablefashion, to the edition of Friar John
                    of Pian Carpine in the same volume; nor has there ever been any properly
                    annotated edition of a traveller so worthy of honour. Richthofen in his <hi
                    rend="italic">China,</hi> i. 602-604, has briefly but justly noticed the
                    narrative of Rubruk. A French version with some notes, issued at Paris in 1877,
                    in the <hi rend="italic">Bibliothèque Orientale Elzevirienne,</hi> if named at
                    all, can only be mentioned as beneath contempt. The task is one which the
                    present writer has long contemplated, but now with but slender hope of
                    accomplishment. (Since this was in type the writer has received from Dr. Franz
                    Max Schmidt an admirable monograph by him, <hi rend="italic">Ueber Rubruk’s
                    Reise</hi> (Berlin, p. 93), extracted from vol. xx. of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Ztschr. Geog. Soc. Berl.,</hi> and has greatly profited by it in the revision
                    of the article in proof.) (H. Y.)</p>
