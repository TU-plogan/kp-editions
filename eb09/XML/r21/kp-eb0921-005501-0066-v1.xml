                        Toranus),</hi> the well-known contemporary of Jerome, was born at or near
                    Aquileia about the year 345. In early life he studied rhetoric, and while still
                    comparatively young he entered the cloister as a catechumen, receiving baptism
                    about 370. About the same time a casual visit of Jerome to Aquileia led to the
                    formation of a close and intimate friendship between the two students, and
                    shortly after Jerome’s departure for the East Rufinus also was drawn thither (in
                    372 or 373) by his interest in its theology and monasticism. He first settled in
                    Egypt, hearing the lectures of Didymus, the Origenistic teacher at Alexandria,
                    and also cultivating friendly relations with Macarius and other ascetics in the
                    desert. In Egypt, if not even before leaving Italy, he had become intimately
                    acquainted with Melania, a wealthy and devout Roman matron, who since the death
                    of her husband had devoted all her means to religious and charitable works; and
                    when she removed to Palestine, taking with her a number of clergy and monks on
                    whom the persecutions of Valens had borne heavily, Rufinus ultimately (about
                    378) followed her. While his patroness lived in a convent of her own in
                    Jerusalem, Rufinus, in close cooperation with her and at her expense, gathered
                    together a number of monks in a monastery on the Mount of Olives, devoting
                    himself at the same time with much ardour to the study of Greek theology. When
                    Jerome came to reside at Bethlehem in 386 the friendship formed at AquiIeia was
                    renewed. Another of the intimates of Rufinus was John, bishop of Jerusalem, and
                    formerly a Nitrian monk, by whom he was ordained to the priesthood in 390. In
                    394, in consequence of the attack upon the doctrines of Origen made by
                    Epiphanius of Salamis during a visit to Jerusalem, a fierce quarrel broke out,
                    which found Rufinus <hi rend="underline">and Jerome ranged on different</hi>
                    sides; and, though three years afterwards a formal reconciliation was brought
                    about between Jerome and John through the intervention of third parties, the
                    breach between Jerome and Rufinus remained unhealed.</p>
                <p>In the autumn of 397 Rufinus embarked for Rome, where, finding that the
                    theological controversies of the East were exciting much interest and curiosity,
                    he published a Latin translation of the <hi rend="italic">Apology</hi> of
                    Pamphilus for Origen, and also (398-399) a somewhat free rendering of the 7rept
                    αρχών of that author himself. In the preface to the latter work he had referred
                    to Jerome as an admirer of Origen, and as having already translated some of his
                    works; this allusion proved very annoying to the subject of it, who was now
                    exceedingly sensitive as to his reputation for orthodoxy, and the consequence
                    was a bitter pamphlet war, very wonderful to the modern onlooker, who finds it
                    difficult to see anything discreditable in the accusation against a Biblical
                    scholar that he had once thought well of Origen, or in the countercharge against
                    a translator that he had avowedly exercised editorial functions as well. Some
                    time during the pontificate of Anastasius (398-402) Rufinus was summoned from
                    Aquileia to Rome to vindicate his orthodoxy, but he excused himself from
                    personal attendance in a written <hi rend="italic">Apologia pro fide sua</hi>;
                    the pope in his reply expressly condemned Origen, but leniently left the
                    question of Rufinus’s orthodoxy to his own conscience. In 408 we find Rufinus at
                    the monastery of Pinetum (in the Campagna?); thence he was driven by the arrival
                    of Alaric to Sicily, being accompanied by Melania in his flight. In Sicily he
                    was engaged in translating the <hi rend="italic">Homilies</hi> of Origen when he
                    died in 410.</p>
                <p>The original works of Rufinus are—(1) <hi rend="italic">De Adulterations Librorum
                        Origenis—</hi> an appendix to his' translation of the <hi rend="italic"
                        >Apology</hi> of Pamphilus, and intended to show that many of the features
                    iu Origens teaching which were then held to be objectionable arise from
                    interpolations and falsifications of the genuine text; (2) <hi rend="italic">De
                        Benedietionibus XII Patriarcharum Libri II,—</hi> an exposition of Gen.

                    Theodosius the Great. The other translations of Rufinus are—(1) the <hi
