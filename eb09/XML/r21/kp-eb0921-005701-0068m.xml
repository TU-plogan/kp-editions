                    having been born in Pomerania in 1723. His parents had him educated for the
                    church, but after a residence of two years at the university of Wittenberg, he
                    determined to live the life of a scholar. His biographer (Wyttenbach) somewhat

                    Ruhnken lived in close intimacy with the two most distinguished professors,
                    Ritter and Berger, who fired his passion for things ancient, and guided his
                    studies. To them he owed a thorough grounding in ancient history and Roman
                    antiquities and literature; and from them he learned what distinguished him
                    among the scholars of his time, a pure and at the same time a vivid Latin style.
                    At Wittenberg, too, Ruhnken derived valuable mental training from study in
                    mathematics and Roman law. Probably nothing would have severed him from his
                    surroundings there but a desire which daily grew upon him to explore the inmost
                    recesses of Greek literature. Neither at AVittenberg nor at any other German
                    university was Greek in that age seriously studied. It was taught in the main to
                    students in divinity for the sake of the Greek Testament and the early fathers
                    of the church,—taught as a necessary appendage to Hebrew and Syriac, and
                    generally by the same professors. F. A. AVolf is the real creator of Greek
                    scholarship in modern Germany, and Porson’s gibe that “the Germans in Greek are
                    sadly to seek” was barbed with truth. It is significant of the state of Hellenic
                    studies in Germany in 1743 that their leading exponents were Gesner and Ernesti.
                    Ruhnken was well advised by his friends at AVittenberg to seek the university of
                    Leyden, where, stimulated by the influence of Bentley, the great scholar
                    Tiberius Hemsterhuis had founded the only real school of Greek learning which
                    had existed on the Continent since the days of Joseph Scaliger and Isaac
                    Casaubon.</p>
                <p>Perhaps no two men of letters ever lived in closer friendship than Hemsterhuis
                    and Ruhnken during the twenty-three years which passed from Ruhnken’s arrival in
                    the Netherlands in 1743 to the death of Hemsterhuis in 1766. A few years made it
                    clear that Ruhnken and A <hi rend="superscript">7</hi> Alckenaer were the two
                    pupils of the great master on whom his inheritance must devolve. As his
                    reputation spread, many efforts were made to attract Ruhnken back to Germany,
                    but the air of freedom which he drew in the Netherlands was more to him than all
                    the flesh-pots his native land could offer. Indeed, after settling in Leyden, he
                    only left the country once, when he spent a year in Paris, ransacking the public
                    libraries (1755). For work achieved, this year of Ruhnken may compare even with
                    the famous year which Ritschl spent in Italy. In 1757 Ruhnken was appointed
                    lecturer in Greek, to assist Hemsterhuis, and in 1761 he succeeded Oudendorp,
                    with the title of “ordinary professor of history and eloquence,” but practically
                    as Latin professor. This promotion drew on him the enmity of some native
                    Netherlanders, who deemed themselves (not without some show of reason) to
                    possess stronger claims for a chair of Latin. The only defence made by Ruhnken
                    was to publish works on Latin literature which eclipsed and silenced his rivals.
                    In 1766 A <hi rend="superscript">7</hi> Alckenaer succeeded Hemsterhuis in the
                    Greek chair. The intimacy between the two colleagues was only broken by A <hi
                    rend="superscript">7</hi> Alckenaeris death in 1785, and stood without strain
                    the test of common candidature for the office (an important one at Leyden) of
                    university librarian, in which Ruhnken was successful. Ruhnken’s later years
                    were clouded by severe domestic misfortune, and by the political commotions
                    which, after the outbreak of the war with England in 1780, troubled the
                    Netherlands without ceasing, and threatened to extinguish the university of
                    Leyden. The year of Ruhnken’s death was 1798.</p>
                <p>Personally, he was as far as possible removed from being a recluse or a pedant.
                    He had a well-knit and even handsome frame, attractive manners (though sometimes
                    tinged with irony), and a nature simple and healthy, and open to impressions
                    from all sides. Fond of society, he cared little to what rank his associates
                    belonged, if they were genuine men in whom he might find something to learn. His
                    biographer even says of him in his early days that he knew how to sacrifice to
                    the Sirens without proving traitor to the Muses. Life in the open air had a
                    great attraction for him; he was fond of sport, and would sometimes devote to it
                    two or three days in the week. In <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0921-0069-0058"/>his bearing towards other scholars Ruhnken was
                    generous and dignified, distributing literary aid with a free hand, and meeting
                    onslaughts for the most part with a smile. It would be difficult to point out in
                    the history of scholarship the name of another man who so thoroughly possessed
                    the <hi rend="italic">savoir vivre.</hi></p>
                <p>In the records of learning Ruhnken occupies an important position. He forms a
                    principal link in the chain which connects Bentley with the modern scholarship
                    of the Continent. The spirit and the aims of Hemsterhuis, the great reviver of
                    Continental learning, were committed to his trust, and were faithfully
                    maintained. He greatly widened the circle of those who valued taste and
                    precision in classical scholarship. He powerfully aided the emancipation of
                    Greek studies from theology; nor must it be forgotten that he first in modern
                    times dared to think of rescuing Plato from the hands of the professed
                    philosophers—men presumptuous enough to interpret the ancient sage with little
                    or no knowledge of the language in which he wrote.</p>
                <p>Rnhnken’s principal works are editions of (1) Timaeus’s <hi rend="italic">Lexicon
                    of Platonic Words,</hi> (2) Thalelaeus nnd other Greek commentators on Roman
                    law, (3) Rutilius Lupus and other grammarians, (4) Velleius Paterculus, (5) the
                    works of Muretus. He also occupied himself much with the history of Greek
                    literature, particularly the oratorical literature, with the Homeric hymns, the
                    scholia on Plato, and the Greek and Roman grammarians and rhetoricians. <hi
                    rend="italic">A</hi> discovery famous in its time was that in the text of the
                    work of Apsines on rhetoric a large piece of a work by Longinus was embedded.
                    Recent views of the writings attributed to Longinus have lessened the interest
                    of this discovery without lessening its merit. The biography of Ruhnken was
                    written by his great pupil Wyttenbach, soon after his death. (J. S. R. )</p>
