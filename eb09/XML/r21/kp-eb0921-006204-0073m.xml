                    a homestead founded by his grandfather, who had followed Penn from England in
                    1683, being of the Quaker persuasion, and a gunsmith by trade. After a careful
                    education at school and college, and an apprenticeship of six years with a
                    doctor in Philadelphia, Rush went for two years to Edinburgh, where he attached
                    himself chiefly to Cullen. He took his M.D. degree there in 1768, spent a year
                    more in the hospitals of London and Paris, and began practice in Philadelphia at
                    the age of twenty-four, undertaking at the same time the chemistry class at the
                    new medical school. He at once became a leading spirit in the political and
                    social movements of the day. He was a friend of Franklin’s, a member of Congress
                    for the State of Pennsylvania in 1776, and one of those who signed the
                    Declaration of Independence the same year. He had already written on the Test
                    Laws, “Sermons to the Rich,” and on Negro Slavery, having taken up the
                    last-named subject at the instance of Anthony Benezet, whose <hi rend="italic"
                    >Historical Account of Guinea</hi> was the inspiration of Clarkson’s celebrated
                    college essay twelve years after. In 1774 he started along with James Pemberton
                    the first anti-slavery society in America, and was its secretary for many years.
                    When the political crisis ended in 1787 with the convention for drawing up a
                    federal constitution, of which he was a member, he retired from public life, and
                    gave himself up wholly to medical practice. In 1789 he exchanged his chemistry
                    lectureship for that of the theory and practice of physic;</p>

                <p>and when the medical college, which he had helped to found, was absorbed by the
                    university of Pennsylvania in 1791 he became professor of the institutes of
                    medicine and of clinical practice, succeeding in 1805 to the chair of the theory
                    and practice of physic. He was the central figure in the medical world of
                    Philadelphia, as Cullen was at Edinburgh and Boerhaave at Leyden. Much of his
                    influence and success was due to his method and regularity of life on the
                    Franklin model. During the thirty years that he attended the Pennsylvania
                    Hospital as physician, he is said to have never missed his daily visit and never
                    to have been more than ten minutes late. Notwithstanding a weak chest, which
                    troubled him the greater part of his life, he got through an enormous amount of
                    work, literary and other; he was a systematic early riser, and his leisure at
                    the end of the day was spent in reading poetry, history, the moral sciences, and
                    the like, with his pen always in his hand. His temperament was of the gentle
                    sort, and his conversation and correspondence abounding in ideas. It is stated
                    by his friend Dr Hosack of New York, that Rush was successively a Quaker, an
                    Anabaptist, a Presbyterian, and an Anglican. He gained great credit when the
                    yellow fever devastated Philadelphia, in 1793, by his assiduity in visiting the
                    sick (as many as one hundred and twenty in a day), and by his bold and
                    apparently successful treatment of the disease by bloodletting. When he began to
                    prosper in practice, he gave a seventh part of his income in charity. He died in
                    1813, after a five days’ illness from typhus fever. Nine out of a family of
                    thirteen children survived him, all prosperously settled.</p>
                <p>Rush’s writings cover an immense range of subjects, including language, the study
                    of Latin and Greek, the moral faculty, capital punishment, medicine among the
                    American Indians, maple sugar, the blackness of the negro, the cause of animal
                    life, tobacco smoking, spirit drinking, as well as a long list of more strictly
                    professional topics. His last work was an elaborate treatise on the <hi
                    rend="italic">Diseases of the Mind</hi> (1812). He is best known now by the five
                    volumes of <hi rend="italic">Medical Inquiries and Observations,</hi> which he
                    brought out at intervals from 1789 to 1798 (two later editions revised by the
                    author). Epidemiology, and yellow fever in particular, was the subject on which
                    he wrote to most purpose. His treatment of yellow fever by bloodletting helped
                    more than anything else to make him famous, although the practice would now be
                    condemned. His views as to the origin and diffusion of yellow fever have a more
                    permanent interest. He stoutly maintained, as against the doctrine of
                    importation from the West Indies, that the yellow fever of Philadelphia was
                    generated on the spot by noxious exhalations, although he does not appear to
                    have suspected that there was something special or specific in the filthy
                    conditions of soil or harbour mud which gave rise to the miasmata. For a number
                    of years he expressed the opinion that yellow fever might become catching from
                    person to person, under certain aggravated circumstances; but in the end he
                    professed the doctrine of absolute non-contagiousness. He became well known in
                    Europe as an authority on the epidemics of fever, and was elected an honorary
                    member of several foreign societies.</p>
