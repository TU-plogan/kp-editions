                    (1763-1845), French statesman and philosopher, was born on the 21st June 1763 at
                    Sompuis near Vitry-le-Français. At an early age he became a member of the bar,

                    1814. During the interval he devoted himself mainly to philosophical studies.
                    Animated by a profound distrust of the negative sensationalism and materialism
                    which had characterized the French philosophy of the 18th century, he found a
                    master whom he could follow in Thomas Reid. The study of Reid’s <hi
                    rend="italic">inquiry,</hi> which he picked up on a book-stall, first gave a
                    definite form and direction to his thinking. Royer-Collard may be said to have
                    introduced Reid to France, and the works of the Scottish philosopher were
                    translated not long afterwards by his pupil Joutfroy. In 1810 Royer-Collard
                    became professor of philosophy, and taught with success in Paris, till the
                    Restoration recalled him to political life. In 1815 he was elected to represent
                    his native department of the Marne in the chamber of deputies; he was also made
                    councillor of state and appointed president of the commission of public
                    instruction. A royalist of moderate views, he helped to restrain the extreme
                    members of his own party, opposing alike the reactionary laws against the press
                    and the proposal to give the clergy control of public instruction. In 1827 he
                    was so popular as to be elected in seven departments, and shortly afterwards he
                    became a member of the French Academy; in the following year he was made
                    president of the chamber. In this capacity he had the unpleasant duty of
                    presenting to Charles X. the address in which the majority of the chamber
                    refused their further support to the Government (March 1830). Royer-Collard
                    retained his position as deputy under the new régime of Louis Philippe, but no
                    longer took a prominent part in public affairs. In 1842 he withdrew completely
                    from active life and spent most of his remaining time at his country seat of
                    Chateauvieux near Sainte-Aignan. He died there on the 2d September 1845.</p>
                <p>As a philosopher, Royer-Collard is not distinguished either by originality or
                    profundity; but he possesses a certain importance as having transplanted to
                    France the philosophy of common sense. He has Iiimself left no philosophical
                    writings except some fragments which appear in Jouil'roy’s edition of Reid; but
                    by his example and teaching he founded the school which has been variously named
                    the Scoto-French, the eclectic, the spiritualistic, or the psychological. Maine
                    de Biran, Cousin to some extent, and Jouffroy in a closer way, as well as Janet
                    and others at the present day, are the chief representatives of the school. The
                    name “Spiritualisme,” which is perhaps the commonest designation, expresses the
                    tenacity with which, in opposition to the dominant Sensationalistic materialism
                    of France, it upholds the doctrine of a spiritual Ego as a fact of
                    consciousness. The title psychological, however, would be preferred by the
                    philosophers themselves as describing their method, and the basis on which they
                    claim to have erected their philosophy. Philosophy tends for them, as for Reid
                    and Stewart, to become a classification of isolated facts of consciousness.</p>
