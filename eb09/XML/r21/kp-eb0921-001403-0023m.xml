                <p><label type="entry">ROUMANIA</label> a kingdom in the south-east of Europe
                    between the Carpathians, the Pruth, the Black Sea, and the Danube. The Pruth and
                    the Kilia mouth of the Danube now form the frontier with Russia. West of
                    Silistria the Danube is the boundary between Roumania and Bulgaria, while to the
                    east of that point the boundary is formed by an irregular line passing east by
                    south to the coast about ten miles to the south of Mangalia. The territory thus
                    shut off between tho Danube and the Black Sea is known as the <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Dobrudja</hi><hi rend="italic">(g.v.),</hi> and differs in its
                    physical features and products from the rest of the kingdom. It was given to
                    Roumania at the close of the last Russo-Turkish War as a compensation for the
                    territory of Bessarabia, east of the Pruth, which was then restored to Russia.
                    The area of the kingdom is estimated at about 49,250 square miles, which is
                    rather less than that of England without Wales. The greatest length of the
                    kingdom is from east to west near the parallel of 45°, along which the length is
                    about 350 miles. The line stretching from north-west to south-east between the
                    extreme points of the kingdom is about fifteen miles shorter.</p>
                <p>The crescent-shaped portion of the kingdom lying between the Danube and Pruth and
                    the Carpathians is tolerably uniform in its physical features. The southern part
                    of the area is a plain continuous with that of southern Russia. Towards the
                    interior the surface rises gradually but slowly until we come to the spurs of
                    the Caqiathians. The Roumanian frontier on this side runs for the most part
                    along the very crest of the mountains, which have peaks rising to from 6000 to
                    8000 feet and upwards. The lowest part of this plain is that which stretches
                    along the left bank of the Danube, and this also is the dreariest and least
                    productive. Large tracts of it are marshy and subject to inundation, and even
                    beyond the marshy districts the aspect of the country remains extremely
                    uninviting. Agriculture is neglected; coarse grasses occupy large areas; and the
                    most conspicuous feature in the landscape is probably a rude well, such as is
                    seen in tho pusstas of Hungary and some parts of southern Russia, where the
                    general aspect of the country is so like what we find here. Farther inland,
                    however, the appearance of the surface improves: agriculture becomes more
                    general, trees (willows, alders, and poplars) more abundant; on the still higher
                    ground nearer the Carpathians the outward signs of comfort and prosperity become
                    more and more apparent; the vine clothes the hill slopes; plums, peaches, and
                    southern fruits are grown in profusion; large forests of oak, beech, and elm
                    reach to the hill tops, and various minerals form an important addition to the
                    present and prospective resources of the country. At elevations too high for the
                    foliage trees just mentioned these are succeeded by pines and firs, birches and
                    larches, which ∙ crown the mountains to a height of 5000 or 6000 feet. Extensive
                    as the plains of Roumania are, 40 per cent, of the entire surface is more than a
                    thousand feet above sea-level, while the greater part of the northern (or
                    Moldavian) half of the crescent varies from 300 to 1000 feet, almost all the
                    rest of Moldavia being still more elevated.</p>
                <p>The superficial geology of Roumania, so far as it is known, is extremely simple,
                    at least on the left bank of the Danube. Quaternary deposits are spread over all
                    the plains. Among these the most important is the yellow loess, which covers
                    such large areas in Hungary also, and which in Roumania attains in places a
                    depth of 150 to 300 feet. In certain parts the black soil of southern Russia
                    extends into Roumania, and is important on account of its richness, though its
                    depth is nowhere above 3 feet. Advancing inland one meets next with Miocene and
                    Eocene deposits, until, in ascending the slopes of the Carpathians, Secondary,
                    Primary, and crystalline rocks are seen to crop out in succession. The desolate
                    plateau of the Dobrudja contrasts with the region on the left of the Danube in
                    its geology as in other respects. Its basis consists of crystalline rocks, but
                    these are covered with sedimentary formations of various ages. On the north this
                    plateau, which is hilly and even mountainous, sinks down rather abruptly to the
                    delta of the Danube, a congeries of alluvial marshes occupied chiefly by aquatic
                    and marsh-loving birds.</p>
                <p>Of the rivers of Roumania by far the most important is the Danube, which is
                    navigable for large vessels throughout its Roumanian reach, the first
                    obstruction to navigation, the celebrated Iron Gates, Occurringjust where it
                    enters Roumanian territory. The breadth of the river is of some consequence in
                    view of the fact that it is a frontier stream, and the marshes on the left bank
                    have at least this advantage that they enable it to serve all the more
                    effectually as a natural boundary. The plains on the left are traversed by
                    numerous winding tributaries of the Danube, but of these the only one of
                    importance as a means of communication is the Pruth, which is navigable for
                    small grain-carrying vessels. The others—the Sereth, Jalomitza, Dambovitza,
                    Olta—are sluggish streams, often half-dry, but yet at certain seasons subject to
                    inundations, which unfortunately occur at a time when the crops are so far
                    advanced as to be liable to be much damaged. In consequence of this the
                    Government has bestowed much pains on the regulation of these streams, and the
                    works for this purpose are rendered further serviceable by the fact that the
                    Roumanian rivers can be turned to account for irrigation.</p>

                <p>The climate of Roumania is one of extremes as regards temperature. Winter and
                    summer are almost equally trying. In the former season the thermometer may sink
                    to - 15° Fahr., while in the latter it may rise to from 90° to 95°. The mean
                    temperature of spring at Bucharest is 53°, summer 72∣ <hi rend="superscript"
                    >β</hi> , autumn 65°, winter 27∣°. Spring, however, scarcely exists except in
                    name, the interval between the cold winter and hot summer being very short. The
                    autumn, on the other hand, is long and is the most genial season of the year. It
                    lasts to the end of November. Being continuous with the Russian plain, Roumania
                    is exposed to the bitterly cold wind from the north-east by which southern
                    Russia is also scourged. In Roumania this wind, known as <hi rend="italic"
                    >crwets,</hi> blows on an average 155 days in the year, while a west or
                    south-west wind, called the <hi rend="italic">austru,</hi> equally disagreeable
                    for its scorching heat, blows on an average 126 days. The rainfall is not
                    excessive. The number of rainy days in the year is about 74, or only about
                    two-fifths of the number round London. The summer months are those in which the
                    rains are most abundant. Snow is unfrequent (12 days in the year). As regards
                    salubrity the low-lying plains near the Danube are the worst part of the
                    kingdom. Marsh fever is there prevalent, and the tendency to suffer from disease
                    is increased by the miserable character of the dwellings occupied by the
                    peasantry of that district. The houses are mere pits dug out in the ground and
                    covered over with sloping roofs formed of branches and twigs.</p>
                <p>Three-fourths of the population are dependent upon agriculture. The plains
                    covered by loess and black soil are admirably adapted for the growth of cereals,
                    and of these the most important are maize, wheat, and barley. The methods of
                    cultivation are to a large extent primitive and imperfect, but great
                    improvements are taking place through the application of foreign capital to the
                    development of the native resources. Improved agricultural implements of all
                    kinds have been introduced of late years in great numbers. The old plough, which
                    has a share resembling a lance head, which enters the ground horizontally and
                    thus merely scratches the surface, is being rapidly superseded by ploughs of
                    English and Austrian manufacture. These improvements, which have been greatly
                    stimulated by the alteration in the status of the Roumanian peasantry brought
                    about by the law of 1864, and likewise by the introduction of railways, have
                    resulted in an enormous increase in the amount of the production of cereals.
                    Roumania is one of the principal grain-exporting countries in Europe, and the
                    increase in the production just alluded to is sufficiently well indicated by the
                    figures given below relative to the exports of grain to the United Kingdom. The
                    great variations in these figures, though obviously due in part to political
                    causes, likewise serve to illustrate the chief drawback under which Roumanian
                    agriculture labours— namely, the liability to drought.</p>
                <p>Besides forming a valuable article of export maize furnishes the chief food of
                    the people. The great body of Roumanians seldom eat meat except on feast days,
                    and the favourite food is a dish called <hi rend="italic">mamaliga,</hi> made by
                    boiling maize-meal and flavouring it with a little salt. It thus resembles the
                    hominy of the Americans. In addition to cereals many kinds of vegetables,
                    including garlic, melons, and cucumbers, are grown. Hemp and colza are also
                    important products, and tobacco furnished a considerable article of export until
                    it was made a monopoly of the state in 1872. As already mentioned, wine and
                    numerous fruits are produced on the foot-hills of the Carpathians, but owing to
                    neglect the products are greatly inferior to what they ought to be. Nothing, it
                    is said, but care in the cultivation of the vine and the preparation and
                    preservation of the wine is necessary to make Roumania a winegrowing country of
                    the first rank. As it is, vines are estimated to cover only about 250,000 acres,
                    or about ,⅜-,∙ of the entire surface. From plums the Roumanians extract a strong
                    spirit known as <hi rend="italic">tsuica,</hi> and it is chiefly for this that
                    the plum-tree is cultivated.</p>
                <p>The rearing of domestic animals is likewise an important industry, but it has not
                    advanced so much of late years as the growth of cereals. The exports of cattle
                    are almost stationary. Oxen are of much more importance than horses, being
                    chiefly used in field labours. Buffaloes also are reared for the purpose, and
                    are much valued for their strength. Sheep and cattle rearing forms the chief
                    occupation of the sparse population of the Dobrudja.</p>
                <p>About one-sixth of the total surface of Roumania is estimated to be covered with
                    forests producing valuable timber trees. Oaks, firs, and beeches are said to be
                    met with having a diameter of more than 8 feet at the height of 33 feet above
                    the ground. The warm summers and cold winters are favourable to the quality of
                    the wood, which is hard and lasting. Unfortunately there is a good deal of
                    recklessness in the way in which the forests are utilized, and they are said to
                    be fast disappearing; but it is to be hoped that the influence of the College of
                    Agriculture and Sylviculture at Eerestreu, 2 miles from Bucharest, will help to
                    put a check upon this improvidence, as it is without doubt contributing greatly
                    to the promotion of Roumanian agriculture.</p>
                <p>The mineral wealth on the Roumanian side of the Carpathians is considerable, but
                    at present there are only three minerals that have any great industrial
                    importance. These are rock-salt, petroleum, and lignite. The salt mines are a
                    state monopoly, and two of them, at Ocna-Mare and Telega, are partly worked by
                    convicts. The depth from which the salt is extracted nowhere exceeds 300 feet.
                    The average quantity of salt sold annually is about 62,000 tons. Lignite is
                    important inasmuch as it is used along with wood on the railways, as well as
                    in.brick and lime kilns. Coal is also found, in some places even at the surface,
                    but, though one or two mines have boen opened, the total production is
                    insignificant. Ozocerite, or fossil wax, is frequently found in association with
                    lignite, but is used only in small quantity by the peasantry. Among other
                    minerals are anthracite, iron, gold, copper, lead, sulphur, cobalt, and arsenic;
                    and there is little doubt that some of these at least might be made economically
                    valuable if the resources of the country were adequately developed.</p>
                <p>So far the manufacturing industries of Roumania are hardly worthy of mention.
                    There are petroleum refineries, one or two sugar refineries," numerous
                    steam-mills for grinding flour, besides large numbers of floating maize-mills on
                    the Danube; but in addition to these there are only a few manufactories at
                    Galatz.</p>
                <p>From the account just given of the products of Roumania it follows that the
                    exports of the kingdom consist chiefly of raw produce, and above all of cereals,
                    while the imports are mainly composed of manufactured articles. The countries
                    with which the trade is chiefly carried on are Austria (with about 40 per cent,
                    of the whole trade in 1883), Great Britain (about 30 per cent.), France (about
                    10 per cent.), Germany (about 8 per cent.), Turkey, and Russia. The foreign
                    commerce of Roumania is centred in Galatz, which is situated at the bend of the
                    Danube where the river once more turns eastward on reaching the northern
                    extremity of the Dobrudja plateau. From this centre there is one line of railway
                    leading into Russia, while others pass through the interior of Roumania and
                    connect with the Austrian lines in the north and south of Hungary. The first
                    Roumanian railway was that from Giurgevo to Bucharest, opened in 1869. In 1884
                    there were about 1000 miles of railway in the kingdom. The internal trade of
                    Roumania is almost entirely in the hands of the Jews. It is greatly hampered by
                    the existence of the octroi in all the large towns, almost all the necessaries
                    of life as well as luxuries being taxed when introduced within the municipal
                    boundaries.</p>

                    barley and maize, of Ronmania to Great Britain to £3,516,442. .</p>

                    belong to the Roumanian branch of the Orthodox Greek Church, and there are

                <p>Roumania is the name officially adopted by the united kingdom that comprises the
                    former principalities of Walachia and JIoldavia. Inits native form it appears
                    simply as “Romania,” representing the claim to Roman descent put forward by its
                    inhabitants. These call themselves “Romani” or “Rumeni,” but by their
                    neighbours, Slavonic, Greek, Magyar, and German, they are universally known by
                    one or other form of the word “Vlach.” As, however, this Vlach or Rouman race
                    occupies a far wider area than that included in the present Roumanian kingdom,
                    it may be convenient to postpone the vexed questions connected with its origin,
                    migrations, and distribution for more general treatment under the heading
                    Vlachs, and to confine ourselves on this occasion to Roumania proper—the country
                    between the Carpathians, the Lower Danube, and the Black Sea. It may be
                    sufficient here to observe that, according to the concurrent accounts from
                    various sources, the great plains of the later Walachian and Moldavian
                    principalities were first occupied by an immigrant Rouman population coming from
                    the Carpathian lands and the present Transylvania in the early Middle Ages.
                    According to the Russian Nestor and the earliest Hungarian chroniclers, the
                    Carpathian region, including tracts of eastern Hungary, were occupied by a
                    Rouman (“Roman ”) population at the time of the Magyar invasion in the 9th
                    century. On the other hand, the meagre annals of the plains that lie on the left
                    bank of the Lower Danube are exclusively occupied till at least the Ilth century
                    with Slovenes, Petchenegs, Cumans, and Bulgarians. Whatever title the Carpathian
                    Roumans may have to be considered the descendants <hi rend="italic">in situ</hi>
                    of the Romanized provincials of Trajan’s Dacia, it seems fairly ascertained that
                    the present extension of this easternmost branch of the Latin peoples over the
                    Walachian and JIoldavian plains is due to a colonizing movement from the Alpine
                    regions to the west, effected for the most part in the 12th and succeeding
                    centuries.</p>

                    (Valachian, or Wallachian) principality the native sources are late and
                    untrustworthy. These sources really reduce themselves to a single chronicle, a
                    part of which appears to have been drawn up in the 16th century in
                    Bulgaro-Slovene, and of which two Rouman translations have seen the light. This
                    “History of the Rouman land since the arrival of the Roumans” <hi rend="italic"
                    >[Istoria tierei Romanesei de cândii au desealicata Rornanii)</hi> gives a
                    precise account of the founding of the Walachian state by Radul Negru, voivode
                    of the Roumans of Fogaras in Transylvania, who in 1290 descended with a numerous
                    people into the Transalpine plain and established his capital first at
                    Cimpulungu and then at Argish. Radul dies in 1314 and is succeeded by a series
                    of voivodes whose names and dates are duly given; but this early chapter of
                    Walachian history has been rudely handled by Roesler in his essay on the oldest
                    history of the Walachian voivodeship <hi rend="italic">[Romanische Studien,</hi>

                <p>In 1330 the voivode Alexander Bazarad or Bassaraba succeeded in inflicting a
                    crushing defeat on his suzerain King Charles of Hungary, and for fourteen years
                    Wallachia enjoyed complete independence. Louis the Great succeeded for a while
                    in restoring the Hungarian supremacy, but in 1367 the voivode Vlad or Vladislav
                    inflicted another severe defeat on the Hungarians, and succeeded for a time in
                    ousting the JIagyar ban of Severin and thus incorporating Little Walachia, the
                    country west of the Aluta, in his dominions. Subsequently, in order to retain a
                    hold on the loyalty of the Walachian voivode, the king of Hungary invested him
                    with the title of duke of Fogaras and Omlas, Rouman districts situate in
                    Transylvania, and this investiture seems to have left its impress on the
                    traditional account of Radul Negru.</p>
                <p>Under the voivode JIircea (1383-1419), whose prowess is still celebrated in the
                    national folk-songs, Walachia played for a while a more ambitious part. This
                    prince, during the earlier part of his reign, sought a counterpoise to Hungarian
                    influence in the close alliance with King Vladislav Jagieflo of Poland. He added
                    to his other titles that of “count of Severin, despot of the Dobrudja, and lord
                    of Silistria,” and both Widin and Sistov appear in his possession. A Walachian
                    contingent, apparently Jlircea’s, aided the Servian Kniaz Lazar on the fatal
                    field of Kosovo; later he was led by the force of circumstances to ally himself
                    with his former enemy Sigismund of Hungary against Bajazet, and in 1396 shared
                    with him the disaster of Nikopolis. Bajazet subsequently invaded and laid waste
                    a large part of Walachia, but the voivode succeeded in inflicting considerable
                    loss on the retiring Turks, and the capture of Bajazet by Timur in 1402 gave the
                    country a reprieve. In the internecine struggle that followed amongst the sons
                    of Bajazet, JIircea espoused the cause of JIusa; but, though he thus obtained
                    for a while considerable influence in the Turkish councils, this policy
                    eventually drew on him the vengeance of Sultan JIahomet I., who succeeded in
                    reducing him to a tributary position.</p>
                <p>During the succeeding period the JValachian princes appear alternately as the
                    allies of Hungary or the creatures of the Turk. In the later battle of Kosovo of
                    1448, between Hunyadiand Sultan JIurad, the JJ <hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
                    alachian contingent treacherously surrendered to the Turks, but this did not
                    hinder the victorious sultan from massacring the prisoners and adding to the
                    tribute a yearly contribution of 3000 javelins and 4000 shields. In 1453
                    Constantinople fell; in 1454 Hunyadi died; and two years later the sultan
                    invaded JValachia to set up Vlad IV., the son of a former voivode. The father of
                    this Vlad had himself been notorious for his ferocity, but his son, during his
                    Turkish sojourn, had improved on his father’s example. He was known in JWalachia
                    as “Dracul,” or the Devil, and has left a name in history as Vlad the Impaler.
                    The stories of his ferocious savagery exceed belief. He is said to have feasted
                    amongst his impaled victims. JVhen the sultan JIahomet, infuriated at the
                    impalement of his envoy, the pasha of JVidin, who had been charged with Vlad’s
                    deposition, invaded Walachia in person with an immense host, he is said to have
                    found at one spot a forest of pales on which were the bodies of men, women, and
                    children. The voivode Radul, who was now substituted for this monster by Turkish
                    influence, was constrained to pay a tribute of 12,000 ducats.</p>
                <p>The shifting policy of the JValachian princes at this time is well described in a
                    letter of the Hungarian king JIatthias to Casimir of Poland. “The voivodes,” he
                    writes, “of JValachia and JIoldavia fawn alternately upon the Turks, the Tatars,
                    the Poles, and the Hungarians, that among so many masters their perfidy may
                    remain unpunished.” The prevalent laxity of marriage, the frequency of divorce,
                    and the fact that illegitimate children could succeed as well as those born in
                    lawful wedlock, by multiplying the candidates for tho voivodeship and preventing
                    any regular system of succession, contributed much to the Internalconfusion of
                    the country. The elections, though often controlled by the Divan, were still
                    constitutionally in the hands of the boiars, who were split up into various
                    factions, each with its own pretender to the throne. The princes followed one
                    another in rapid succession, and a large proportion met with violent ends. A
                    large part of the population led a pastoral life, and at the time of Verantius’s
                    visit to JValachia in the early part of the 16th century the towns and villages
                    were built of wood and wattle and daub. Tirgovist alone, at this time the
                    capital of the country, was a considerable town, with two stone castles. Nagul
                    Bassaraba, who succeeded in 1512, was a great builder of monasteries, and,
                    besides erecting a monastic church at Argish, which he coated with white marble,
                    and a new cathedral at Tirgovist, adorned JIount Athos with his pious works. He
                    transferred the direct allegiance of the Walachian Church to Constantinople. On
                    NaguPs death, however, in 1521, the brief period of comparative prosperity which
                    his architectural works attest was tragically interrupted, and it seemed for a
                    time <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit21newyrich/page/n28/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0921-0028-0017"/>that Walachia was doomed to sink into a Turkish
                    pashalic. The Turkish commander Mahmoud Bey became treacherously possessed of
                    NaguPs young son and successor, and, sending him a prisoner to Stamboul,
                    proceeded to nominate Turkish governors in the towns and villages of Walachia.
                    The Walachians resisted desperately, elected Radul, a kinsman of Nagul, voivode,
                    and succeeded with Hungarian help in defeating Malnnoud Bey at Grumatz in 1522.
                    The conflict was prolonged with varying fortunes, but in 1524 the dogged
                    opposition of the Walachians finally triumphed in the sultan’s recognition of
                    Radul.</p>
                <p>But, though Walachia thus escaped conversion into a Turkish pashalic, the battle
                    of Mohacs in 1526 decided the long preponderance of Turkish control. The
                    unfortunate province served as a transit rente for Turkish expeditions against
                    Hungary and Transylvania, and was exhausted by continual requisitions. Turkish
                    settlers were gradually making good their footing on Walachian soil, and mosques
                    were rising in the towns and villages. The voivode Alexander, who succeeded in
                    1591, and who like his predecessors had bought his post of the Divan, carried
                    the oppression still further by introducing against the capitulations a janizary
                    guard, and farming out his possessions to his Turkish supporters. Meanwhile the
                    Turkish governors on the Bulgarian bank never ceased to ravage the country, and
                    again it seemed as if Walachia must share the fate of the Balkan states and
                    succumb to the direct government of the Ottoman. In the depth of the national
                    distress the choice of the people fell on Michael, the son of Petrushko, ban of
                    Krajova, the first dignitary of the realm, who had fled to Transylvania to
                    escape Alexander’s machinations. Supported at Constantinople by two at that time
                    influential personages, Sigmund Bathori and the English ambassador, Edward
                    Barton, and aided by a loan of 200,000 florins, Michael succeeded in procuring
                    from the Divan the deposition of his enemy and his own nomination.</p>
                <p>The genius of Michael “the Brave” (1593-1601) secured Walachia for a time a place
                    in universal history. The moment for action was favourable. The emperor Rudolph
                    II. had gained some successes over the Turks, and Sigmund Bathori, prince of
                    Transylvania, had been driven by Turkish extortions to throw off the allegiance
                    to the sultan. But the first obstacle to be dealt with was the presence of the
                    enemy within the walls, and Michael had recourse to the same desperate expedient
                    as the Montenegrins at a later date. By previous concert with the Moldavian
                    voivode Aaron, on November 13, 1594, the Turkish guards and settlers in the two
                    principalities were massacred at a given signal. Michael followed up these
                    “Walachian Vespers” by an actual invasion of Turkish territory, and, aided by
                    Sigmund Bathori, succeeded in carrying by assault Rustchuk, Silistria, and other
                    places on the right bank of the lower Danube. A simultaneous invasion of
                    Walachia by a large Turkish and Crim-Tatar host was successfully defeated; the
                    Tatar khan withdrew with the loss of his bravest followers, and, in the great
                    victory of Mantin on the Danube (1595), the Turkish army was annihilated, and
                    its leader AIustafa slain. The sultan now sent Sinan Pasha “the Renegade” to
                    invade Walachia with 100,000 men. Alichael withdrew to the mountains before this
                    overwhelming force, but, being joined by Bathori with a Transylvanian
                    contingent, the voivode resumed the offensive, stormed Bucharest, where Sinan
                    had entrenched a Turkish detachment, and, pursuing the main body of his forces
                    to the Danube, overtook the rearguard and cut it to pieces, capturing enormous
                    booty. Sinan Pasha returned to Constantinople to die, it is said, of vexation,
                    and in 1597 the sultan, weary of a disastrous contest, sent AIichael a red flag
                    in token of reconciliation, reinvested him for life in an office of which he had
                    been unable to deprive him, and granted the succession to his son.</p>
                <p>In 1599, on the definitive abdication of Sigmund Bathori in Transylvania,
                    AIichael, in league with the imperialist forces under General Basta, and in
                    connivance with the Saxon burghers, attacked and defeated his successor Andreas
                    Bathori near Hermannstadt, and, seizing himself the reins of government, secured
                    his proclamation as prince of Transylvania. The emperor consented to appoint him
                    his “locum tenens per Transylvaniam," and the sultan ratified his election. As
                    prince of Transylvania he summoned diets in 1599 and 1600, and, having expelled
                    the voivode of AIoldavia, united under his sceptre three principalities. The
                    partiality that he showed for the Rouman and Szekler parts of the population
                    alienated, however, the Transylvanian Saxons, who preferred the direct
                    government of the emperor. The imperial commissioner General Basta lent his
                    support to the disaffected party, and Michael was driven out of Transylvania by
                    a successful revolt, while a Polish army under Zamoyski invaded AValachia from
                    the AIoldavian side. AlichaePs coolness and resource, however, never for a
                    moment deserted him. He resolved to throw himself on the emperor, rode to
                    Prague, won over Rudolph by his singular address, and, richly supplied with
                    funds, reappeared in Transylvania as imperial governor. In conjunction with
                    Basta he defeated the superior Transylvanian forces at Goroslo, expelling
                    Sigmund Bathori, who had again aspired to the crown, and taking one hundred and
                    fifty flags and forty-five cannon. But at the moment of his returning prosperity
                    Basta, who had quarrelled with him about the supreme command of the imperial
                    forces, procured his murder (August 19, 1601). Thus perished AIichael the Brave
                    in the forty-third year of his age, after performing in the course of his short
                    reign achievements which, considering the small resources at his disposal, must
                    place his name beside those of Hunyadi and Sobieski in the annals of eastern
                    Europe. Not only did he succeed in rolling back for a time the tide of Turkish
                    conquest, but for the first and last time in modern history he united what once
                    had been Trajan’s Dacia, in its widest extent, and with it the whole Rouman race
                    north of the Danube, under a single sceptre.</p>
                <p>AIichaePs wife Florika and his son Petrushko were carried off into Tatar
                    captivity, and Serban, of the Bassaraba family, was raised to the voivodeship of
                    AValachia by imperialist influences. On his deposition by the Porte in 1610,
                    there followed a succession of princes who, though still for the most part of
                    Rouman origin, bought their appointment at Stamboul. Walachian contingents were
                    continually employed by the Turks in their Polish wars, and the settlement of
                    Greeks in an official or mercantile capacity in the principality provoked grave
                    discontent, which on one occasion took the form of a massacre. The reign of the
                    voivode AIatthias Bassaraba, who succeeded in 1633, was an interval of
                    comparative prosperity, and its length, twenty-one years, forms itself a
                    panegyric. He defended himself successfully against his powerful rival Vasilje
                    Lupul, the voivode of Aloldavia, and his Tatar and Cossack allies, and found a
                    golden key to Turkish tolerance. He appears as a lawgiver, translating the <hi
                    rend="italic">Basilica</hi> of Jo. Comnenus, and founded many churches and
                    monasteries. His last days were embittered, however, by an outbreak of military
                    anarchy. On his death the Turkish yoke again weighed heavier on AValachia. The
                    old capital Tirgovist was considered by the Divan to be too near the Transyl
                    vanian frontier, and the voivodes were accordingly compelled tc transfer their
                    residence to Bucharest. The mechanical skill of the AValachians was found useful
                    by the Turks, who employed them a? carpenters and pontonniers; and during the
                    siege of Vienna bj Kara Alustafa in 1683 the Walachian contingent, which, under
                    the voivode Serban Cantacuzene, had been forced to co-operate with the Turks,
                    was entrusted with the construction of the two bridges over the Danube above and
                    below Vienna. The AValachian as well as the AIoldavian prince, who had been also
                    forced to bring his contingent, maintained a secret intelligence with the
                    besieged, an intelligence continued by the voivode Serban after his return to
                    AValachia. The emperor granted him a diploma creating him count of the empire
                    and recognizing his descent from the imperial house of Cantacuzene, Serban
                    meanwhile collecting his forces foi an open breach with the Porte. His prudence,
                    however, perpetually postponed the occasion, and Walachia enjoyed peace to his
                    death in 1688. This peaceful state of the country gave the voivode leisure to
                    promote its internal culture, and in the year of his death he had the
                    satisfaction of seeing the first part of a Walachian Bible issue from the first
                    printing-press of the country, which he had established at Bucharest. He had
                    also caused to be compiled a history of AValachia, and had called to the country
                    many teachers of the Greek language, whose business it was to instruct the sons
                    oi the boiars in “grammar, rhetoric, and philosophy.”</p>
                <p>Immediately on Serban’s death the boiars, to prevent the Porte from handing over
                    the office to the Greek adventurer who bid the highest, proceeded to elect his
                    sister’s son Constantine Brancovan. The Turkish capidji pasha, then in
                    Bucharest, was persuaded to put the caftan on his head in token of Turkish
                    approval, and the patriarch of Constantinople, who was also present, and the
                    archbishop of Walachia, Theodosius, consecrated him together at the high altar
                    of the cathedral, where he took the coronation oath to devote his whole strength
                    to the good of his country and received the boiars’ oath of submission.
                    Brancovan, it is true, found it expedient to devote his predecessor’s treasure
                    to purchasing the confirmation of his title from the Divan, but the account of
                    his coronation ceremony remains an interesting landmark in the constitutional
                    history of the country. In his foreign relations with the Hapsburg power he
                    displayed the same caution as the voivode Serban. In spite of the victories of
                    the margrave of Baden at Pojarevatz, Nish, and Widin in 1689, it was only by an
                    exercise of force that the imperial troops secured winter quarters in AValachia,
                    and, though after the battle of Pultava in 1709 Brancovan concluded a secret
                    treaty with Czar Peter, he avoided giving open effect to it. The tranquillity
                    which he thus obtained was employed by Brancovan as by his predecessor in
                    furthering the internal wellbeing of the country, with what success is best
                    apparent from the description of AValachia left by the Florentine Del Chiaro,
                    who visited the country in 1709 and spent seven years there. He describes the
                    stoneless AValachian plain, with its rich pastures, its crops of maize and
                    millet, and woods so symmetrically planted and carefully kept by Brancovan’s
                    orders that hiding in them was out of the question. Butter and honey were
                    exported to supply the Grand Signor’s kitchen at Stamboul; wax and cattle to
                    Venice; and the red and white wine of Walachia, notably that of Pitesti, to
                    Transylvania. The Walachian horses were in demand amongst <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit21newyrich/page/n29/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0921-0029-0018"/>the Turks and Poles. Near Ribnik and elsewhere
                    were salt-mines which supplied all the wants of the Transdanubian provinces;
                    there were considerable copper mines at Maidan; and iron was worked near
                    Tirgovist. The Gipsy community was bound to bring fifteen pounds weight of gold
                    from the washings of the ArgLsh. The boiars were many of them wealthy, but the
                    common people were so ground down with taxation that “of their ancient Roman
                    valour only the name remained.” To avoid the extortion of their rulers numbers
                    had emigrated to Transylvania and even to the Turkish provinces. The principal
                    Walachian city was Bucharest (Bucurest), containing a population of about
                    50,000; but, except for two large “bans” or merchants’ halls built by Brancovan
                    and his predecessor, and the recently-erected palace, which had a marble
                    staircase and a fine garden, the houses were of wood. The other principal towns
                    were Tirgovist, the old capital, Cernetz, Fokshani, supplied by Brancovan with
                    an aqueduct, Ploiesti, Ghierghitza, Rusi di Vede, and Krajova, the capital of
                    the banat of that name, where a fine han had also been built. At Cimpulungu was
                    a great annual fair. The dress of the men was thoroughly Turkish except for
                    their lambskin caps, that of the women half-Greek half-Turkish. The houses were
                    scrupulously clean and strewn with sweet herbs. Del Chiaro notices the great
                    imitative capacity of the race, both artistic and mechanical. A Walachian in
                    Venice had copied several of the pictures there with great skill; the
                    copper-plates and wood engravings for the new press were executed by native
                    hands. The Walachians imitated every kind of Turkish and European manufacture;
                    and, though the boiars imported finer glass from Venice and Bohemia, a glass
                    manufactory had been established near Tirgovist which produced a better quality
                    than the Polish. From the Bucharest press, besides a variety of ecclesiastical
                    books, there were issued in the Rouman tongue a translation of a French work
                    entitled “The Maximsof the Orientals” and “The Romance of Alexander the Great.”
                    In 1700 Brancovan had a map of the country made and a copperplate engraving of
                    it executed at Padua.</p>
                <p>The prosperity of Walachia, however, under its “Golden Bey,” as Brancovan was
                    known at Stamboul, only increased the Turkish exactions. In 1701 the tribute was
                    increased to 80,500 purses of 500 florins each. In 1703 the voivode was summoned
                    in person to Adrianople, and again must resort to extraordinary means to mollify
                    the Divan. Shortly after, the Walachians were called on to supply masons,
                    carpenters, and other workmen for the fortification of Bender, and, though these
                    and other demands were punctually met and the increased tribute regularly paid,
                    the sultan finally resolved on the removal of his too prosperous vassal.
                    Brancovan was accused of secret correspondence with the emperor, the czar, the
                    king of Poland, and the Venetian republic, of betraying the Porte’s secrets, of
                    preferring Tirgovist to Bucharest as a residence, of acquiring lands and palaces
                    in Transylvania, of keeping agents at Venice and Vienna, in both of which cities
                    he had invested large sums, and of striking gold coins with his effigy, one of
                    which, with the legend Constantinvs bλssaraba de brancovan d. g. voevoda et
                    princep8 valachiae transalpine·;, and having on the reverse the crowned shield
                    of Walachia containing a raven holding a cross in its beak between a moon and a
                    star, is engraved by Del Chiaro. They were of 2, 3, and 10 ducats weight. A
                    capidji pasha arrived at BucharestonApril4, 1714, and proclaimed Brancovan
                    “mazil,” i.β., deposed. He was conducted to Constantinople and beheaded,
                    together with his four sons. A scion of the rival Cantacuzcnian family was
                    elected by the pasha’s orders, and he, after exhausting the principality for the
                    benefit of the Divan, was in turn deposed and executed in 1716.</p>
                <p>From this period onwards the Porte introduced a new system with regard to its
                    Walachian vassals. The line of national princes ceases. The office of voivode or
                    Iiospodar was sold to the highest bidder at Stamboul, to be farmed out from a
                    purely mercenary point of view. The princes who now succeeded one another in
                    rapid succession were mostly Greeks from the Fanar quarter of Constantinople who
                    had served the palace in the quality of dragoman, or held some other court
                    appointment. They were nominated by imperial firman without a shadow of free
                    election, and were deposed and transferred from one principality to another,
                    executed or reappointed, like so many pashas. Like pashas they rarely held their
                    office more than three years, it being the natural policy of the Porte to
                    multiply such lucrative nominations. The same Iiospodar was often reappointed
                    again and again as he succeeded in raising the sum necessary to buy back his
                    title. Constantine Mavrocordato was in this way Iiospodar of Walachia at six
                    different times, and paid on one occasion as much as a million lion-dollars for
                    the office. The princes thus imposed on the country were generally men of
                    intelligence and culture. Nicholas Mavrocordato, the first of the series, was
                    himself the author of a Greek work on duties, and maintained at his court
                    Demeter Prokopios of Aloschopolis, who wrote a review of Greek literature during
                    the 17th and beginning of the 18th centuries. Constantine Alavrocordato was the
                    author of really liberal reforms. He introduced an “urbarium” for the peasants,
                    Iimitingthe days of “angaria,” or forced labour for the landlord, to
                    twenty-four, and in 1747 decreed the abolition of serfdom. But the new system
                    could not but be productive of grinding oppression, and the swarms of “hungry
                    Greekliugs” who accompanied the Fanariote rulers from Stamboul made their rule
                    doubly hateful. Numbers of the peasantry emigrated, and the population rapidly
                    diminished. In 1745 the number of tax-paying families, which a few years before
                    had amounted to 147,000, had sunk to 70,000. Yet the taxes were continually on
                    the increase, and the hospodar Scarlatii Ghika (1758-61), though he tried to win
                    some popularity by the removal of Turkish settlers and the abolition of the
                    “vakarit,” or tax on cattle and homes, which was peculiarly hateful to the
                    peasantry, raised the total amount of taxation to 25,000,000 lion-dollars. The
                    Turks meantime maintained their iron grip on the country by holding on the
                    Walachian bank of the Danube the fortresses of Giurgevo, Turnul, and Orsova,
                    with the surrounding districts.</p>
                <p>But the tide of Ottoman dominion was ebbing fast. Already, by the peace of
                    Passarovitz (Pojarevatz) in 1718, the banat of Krajova had been ceded to the
                    emperor, though by the peace of Belgrade in 1739 it was recovered by the Porte
                    for its Walachian vassal. In 1769 the Russian general Romanzoif occupied the
                    principality, the bishops and clergy took an oath of fidelity to the empress
                    Catherine, and a deputation of boiars followed. The liberties of the country
                    were guaranteed, taxation reformed, and in 1772 the negotiations at Fokshani
                    between Rqssia and the Porte broke down because the czarina’s representatives
                    insisted on the sultan’s recognition of the independence of Walachia and
                    AIoldavia under an European guarantee. By the treaty of Kutshuk Kaimardji,
                    concluded in 1774, Russia consented to hand back the principalities to the
                    sultan, but by Art. xvi. several stipulations were made in favour of the
                    Walachians and AIoldaviaus. The people of the principalities were to enjoy all
                    the privileges that they had possessed under AIahomet IV.; they were to bo freed
                    from tribute for two years, as some compensation for the ruinous effects of the
                    last war; they were to pay a moderate tribute; the agents of Walachia and
                    AIoldavia at Constantinople were to enjoy the rights of nations, and the Russian
                    minister at the Porte should on occasion watch over the interests of the
                    principalities. The stipulations of the treaty of Kutshuk Kaimardji, though
                    deficient in precision (the Walachians, for instance, had no authentic record of
                    the privileges enjoyed under AIahomet IV.), formed the basis of the future
                    liberties in both principalities; and, as from this period onwards Walachian
                    history is closely connected with that of AIoldavia, it may be convenient before
                    continuing this review to turn to the earlier history of the sister,
                    principality.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Moldavia.—</hi> The mention of Vlachs on the borders of Galicia
                    in 1160 (Nie. Chon., p. 171) gives just ground for believing that a Rouman
                    population existed in AIoldavia at least as early as the first half of the 12th
                    century. Under the successive domination, how’-ever, of Petchenegs, Cumans, and
                    Tatars, it occupied as yet a subordinate position. It was not till 1352 that tho
                    Tatars, already weakened by Polish assaults on the Podolian side, were expelled
                    from this Cumanian region by tho Transylvanian voivode Andreas Laszkovich. It is
                    in fact to the period immediately succeeding this event that the first
                    establishment of an independent Rouman state in AIoldavia is referred by the
                    concurrent testimony of AIoldavian, Russian, and Hungarian sources.</p>
                <p>According to the native traditional account, as first given by tho AIoldavian
                    chroniclers of the 17th and 18th centuries (Grigorie Urechie and AIiron Costin),
                    Dragoshthe son of Bogdan, the founder of the new principality, emigrated with
                    his followers towards the end of the 14th century from the Hungarian district of
                    AIarmaros in the North Carpathians. The story is related with various fabulous
                    accompaniments. From the aurochs <hi rend="italic">{zimbru),</hi> in pursuit of
                    which Dragosh first arrived on the banks of the AIolda, is derived the ox-head
                    of the AIoldavian national arms, and from his favourite hound who perished in
                    the waters the name of the river. From the Hungarian and Russian sources, which
                    are somewhat more precise, the date of the arrival of Dragioeh, who otherwise
                    appears as Bogdan, in AIoldavia appears to have been 1359, and his departure
                    from AIarmaros was carried out in defiance of his Hungarian suzerain.</p>
                <p>In the agreement arrived at between King Louis of Hungary and the emperor Charles
                    IV. in 1372, the voivodate of AIoldavia was recognized as a dependency of the
                    crow <hi rend="superscript">τ</hi> n of St Stephen. The overlordship over the
                    country was, however, contested by the king of Poland, and their rival claims
                    were a continual source of dispute betw ’ een the two kingdoms. In 1412 a
                    remarkable agreement was arrived at between Sigismund, in his quality of king of
                    Hungaι∙y, and King Jagietto of Poland, by which both parties consented to
                    postpone the question of suzerainship in AIoldavia. Should, however, the Turks
                    invade the country, the Polish and Hungarian forces were to unite in expelling
                    them, the voivode was to be deposed, and the AIoldavian territories divided
                    between the allies. During the first half of the 15th century Polish influence
                    was preponderant, and it was customary for the voivodes of AIoldavia to do
                    homage to tho king of Poland at Kameniec or Snyatin.</p>
                <p>In 1456 the voivode Peter, alarmed at the progress of the Turks,</p>

                <p>who were now dominant in Servia and Walachia, offered Sultan Mahomet a yearly
                    tribute of 2000 ducats. On his deposition, however, in 1458 by Stephen, known as
                    “the Great,” Moldavia became a power formidable alike to Turk, Pole, and
                    Hungarian. Throughout the long reign of this voivode, which lasted forty-six
                    years, from 1458 to 1504, his courage and resources never failed him. In the
                    early part of his reign he appears, in agreement with the Turkish sultan and the
                    king of Poland, turning out the Hungarian vassal, the ferocious Vlad, from the
                    Walachian throne, and annexing the coast cities of Kilia and Cetatea Alba or
                    Bielogorod, the Turkish Akierman. In the autumn of 1474 the sultan Mahomet
                    entered IkIoldavia at the head of an army estimated by the Polish historian
                    Dlugoss at 120,000 men. Voivode Stephen withdrew into the interior at the
                    approach of this overwhelming host, but on January 17, 1475, turned at bay on
                    the banks of Lake Rakovietz and gained a complete victory over the Turks. Four
                    pashas were among the slain; over a hundred banners fell into the Moldavian
                    hands; and only a few survivors succeeded in reaching the Danube. In 1476
                    Mahomct again entered Moldavia, thirsting for vengeance, but, though successful
                    in the open field, the Turks were sorely harassed by Stephen’s guerilla
                    onslaughts, and, being thinned by pestilence, were again constrained to retire.
                    In 1484 the same tactics proved successful against an invasion of Bajazet. Three
                    years later a Polish invasion of Moldavia under John Albert with 80,000 men
                    ended in disaster, and shortly afterwards the voivode Stephen, aided by a
                    Turkish and Tatar contingent, laid waste the Polish territories to the upper
                    waters of the Vistula, and succeeded in annexing for a time the Polish province
                    of Pokutia that lay between the Carpathians and the Dniester.</p>
                <p>Exclusive of this temporary acquisition, the Moldavian territory at this period
                    extended from the river Milcov, which formed the boundary of Walachia, to the
                    Dniester. It included the Carpathian region of the Bukovina, literally “the
                    beechwood,” where lay Sereth and Suciava, the earliest residences of the
                    voivodes, the maritime district of Budzak (the later Bessarabia), with Kilia and
                    Bielogorod, and the left bank of the lower Danube from Galatz to the Sulina
                    mouth. The government, civil and ecclesiastical, was practically the same as
                    that described in the case of Walachia, the officials bearing for the most part
                    Slavonic titles derived from the practice of the Bulgaro-Vlachian czardom. The
                    church was Orthodox Oriental, and depended from the patriarch of Ohrida. In
                    official documents the language used was the old Slovene, the style of a
                    Moldavian ruler being <hi rend="italic">Natchalnik i Voievoda Moldmlasi,</hi>
                    prince and(duke (= Germ. “Fürst” and “Herzog”) of the Moldovlachs. The election
                    of the voivodes, though in the hands of the boiars, was strictly regulated by
                    hereditary principles, and Cantemir describes the extinction of the house of
                    Dragosh in the 16th century as one of the unsettling causes that most
                    contributed to the ruin of the country. The Moldavian army was reckoned 40,000
                    strong, and the cavalry arm was especially formidable. Verantius of Sebenico, an
                    eye-witness of the state of Moldavia at the beginning of the 16th century,
                    mentions three towns of the interior provided with stone walls—Suciava, Chotim,
                    and Njamtz; the people were barbarous, but more warlike than the Walachians and
                    more tenacious of their national costume, punishing with death any who adopted
                    the Turkish.</p>
                <p>In 1504 Stephen the Great died, and was succeeded by his son, Bogdan “the
                    One-eyed.” At feud with Poland about Pokutia, despairing of efficacious support
                    from hard-pressed Hungary, the new voivode saw no hope of safety except in a
                    dependent alliance with the advancing Ottoman Power, which already hemmed
                    Moklavia in on the Walachian and Crimean sides. In 1513 he agreed to pay an
                    annual tribute to Sultan Selim in return for the sultan’s guarantee to preserve
                    the national constitution and religion of Moldavia, to which country the Turks
                    now gave the name of Kara Bogdan, from their first vassal. The terms of
                    Moldavian submission were further regulated by a firman signed by Sultan
                    Suleiman at Buda in 1529 by which the yearly present or “backshish,” as the
                    tribute was euphoniously called, was fixed at 4000 ducats, 40 horses, am⅛∙ 25
                    falcons, and the voivode was bound at need to supply the Turkish army with a
                    contingent of a thousand men. The Turks pursued much the same policy as in
                    Walachia. The tribute was gradually increased. A hold was obtained on the
                    country by the occupation of various strongholds on Moldavian soil with the
                    surrounding territory,—in 1538 Cetatea Alba (Akierman), in 1592 Bender, in 1702
                    Chotim (Khotin). Already by the middle of the 16th century the yoke was so heavy
                    that the voivode Elias (1546-1551) became Mohammedan to avoid the sultan’s
                    anger.</p>
                <p>At this period occurs a curious interlude in Moldavian history. In 1561 the
                    adventurer and impostor Jacob Basilicus succeeded with Hungarian help in turning
                    out the voivode Alexander and . seizing on the reins of government. A Greek by
                    birth, adopted son of Jacob Heraklides, despot of Paros, Samos, and other Aegean
                    islands, acquainted with Greek and Latin literature, and master of most European
                    languages, appearing alternately as a student of astronomy at Wittenberg,
                    whither he had been invited by Count Mansfeld, as a correspondent of Melanchthon
                    and as a writer of historical works which he dedicated to Philip II. of Spain,
                    Basilicus, finding that his Aegean sovereignty <hi rend="italic">in
                    partibus</hi> was of little practical value beyond the crowning of poet
                    laureates, fixed his roving ambition on a more substantial dominion. He
                    published an astounding pedigree, in which, starting from “Hercules Triptolemus”
                    ho wound his way through the royal Servian line to the kinship of Moldavian
                    voivodes, and, having won the emperor Ferdinand and Albert Lasky to his
                    financial and military support, succeeded, though at the head of only 1600
                    cavalry, in routing by a bold dash the vastly superior forces of the voivode,
                    and even in purchasing the Turkish confirmation of his usurped title. He assumed
                    the style of Bα&lt;πλeus Moλδα∕3iαs, and eluded the Turkish stipulation that he
                    should dismiss his foreign guards. In Moldavia he appeared as a moral reformer,
                    endeavouring to put down the prevalent vices of bigamy and divorce. He erected a
                    school, placed it under a German master, and collected children from every part
                    of the country to be maintained and educated at his expense. He also busied
                    himself with the collection of a library. But his taxes —a ducat for each
                    family—were considered heavy; his orthodoxy was suspected, his foreign
                    counsellors detested. In 1563 the people rose, massacred the Hungarian guards,
                    the foreign settlers, and finally Jacob himself.</p>
                <p>The expelled voivode Alexander was now restored by the Porte, the schools w <hi
                    rend="superscript">τ</hi> ere destroyed, and the country relapsed into its
                    normal state of barbarism. His successor Ivonia was provoked by the Porte’s
                    demand for 120,000 ducats as tribute instead of 60,000 as heretofore to rise
                    against the oppressor, but after gaining three victories he was finally defeated
                    and slain (1574), and the country was left more than ever at the mercy of the
                    Ottoman. Voivodes were now created and deposed in rapid succession by the Divan,
                    but the victories of Michael the Bι ’ ave in Walachia infused a more independent
                    spirit into the Moldavians. The Moldavian dominion was now disputed by the
                    Transylvanians and Poles, and in 1600 Michael succeeded in annexing it to his
                    “Great Dacian” realm. On Michael’s murder the Poles under Zamoyski again
                    asserted their supremacy, but in 1618 the Porte once more recovered its dominion
                    and set up successively two creatures of its own as voivodes—Gratiani, an
                    Italian who had been Courtjeweller, and a Greek custom-house official,
                    Alexander.</p>
                <p>As in Walachia at a somewhat later date the Fanariote regime seemed now
                    thoroughly established in Moldavia, and it became the rule that every three
                    years the voivode should procure his confirmation by a large backshish, and
                    every year by a smaller one. The prince Vasilje Lupul, however, an Albanian, who
                    succeeded in 1634, showed great abilities, and for twenty years succeeded in
                    maintaining his position on the Moldavian throne. He introduced several internal
                    reforms, codified the written and unwritten laws of the country, established a
                    printing press, Greek monastic schools, and also a Latin school. He brought the
                    Moldavian Church into more direct relation with the patriarch of Constantinople,
                    but also showed considerable favour to the Latins, allowing them to erect
                    churches at Suciava, Jassy, and Galatz.</p>
                <p>During the wars between Sobieski and the Turks Moldavia found itself between
                    hammer and anvil, and suffered frightfully moreover from Tatar devastations. The
                    voivode Duka was forced like his Walachian contemporary to supply a contingent
                    for the siege of Vienna in 1683. After Sobieski’s death in 1696, the hopes of
                    Moldavia turned to the advancing Muscovite power. In 1711 the voivode Demetriu
                    Cantemir, rendered desperate by the Turkish exactions, concluded an agreement
                    with the czar Peter by which Moldavia was to become a protected and vassal state
                    of Russia, with the enjoyment of its traditional liberties, the voivodeship to
                    be hereditary in the family of Cantemir. On the approach of the Russian army the
                    prince issued a proclamation containing the terms of the Russian protectorate
                    and calling on the boiars and people to aid their Orthodox deliverers. But the
                    iron had entered into the people’s soul. The long Turkish terrorism had done its
                    work, and at the approach of a Turkish and Tatar host the greater part of the
                    Moldavians deserted their voivode. The Russian campaign was unsuccessful, and
                    all that Czar Peter could offer Cantemir and the boiars who had stood by him was
                    an asylum on Russian soil.</p>
                <p>In his Russian exile Cantemir composed in a fair Latin style his <hi
                    rend="italic">DeSCriptio Moldaviae,</hi> the counterpart so far as Moldavia is
                    concerned to Del Chiaro’s contemporary description of Walachia. The capital of
                    the country was now Jassy, to which city Stephen the Great had transferred his
                    court from Suciava, the earlier residence of the voivodes. It had at this time
                    forty churches—some of stone, some of wood. Fifty years before it had contained
                    12,000 houses, but Tatar devastations had reduced it to a third of its former
                    size. The most important commercial emporium was the Danubian port of Galatz,
                    which was frequented by vessels from the whole of the Levant from Trebizond to
                    Barbary. The cargoes which they here took in consisted of Moldavian timber (oak,
                    deal, and cornel), grain, butter, honey and wax, salt, and nitre; Kilia at the
                    north mouth of the Danube was also frequented by trading vessels, including
                    Venetian and Ragusan. Moldavian wine was exported to Poland, Russia.
                    Transylvania, and Hungary; that of Cotnar was <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0921-0031-0020"/>in Cantemir’s opinion superior to Tokay. The
                    excellence of the Moldavian horses is attested by a Turkish proverb; and annual
                    droves of as many as 40,000 Moldavian oxen were sent across Poland to Dantzic.
                    Moldavia proper was divided into the upper country or <hi rend="italic">Terra de
                    sus,</hi> and the lower country, or <hi rend="italic">Terra de josu.</hi>
                    Bessarabia had been detached from the rest of the principality and</p>
                <p>!)laced under the direct control of the seraskier. It was divided into our
                    provinces:—that of Budzak, inhabited by the Nogai Tatars; that of Akierman or
                    Cetatea Alba, the Greek Monkastron, a strongly fortified place; and those of
                    Ismaila and Kilia. The voivodes owed their nomination entirely to the Porte, and
                    the great officers of the realm were appointed at their discretion. These were
                    the Great Logothete <hi rend="italic">(Marele Logofetu)</hi> or chancellor; the
                    governor of Lower Moldavia— <hi rend="italic">Vomieulu de t'erra de jοsu∙,</hi>
                    the governor of Upper Moldavia— <hi rend="italic">Vomiculu de t'erra de
                    sus</hi>; the <hi rend="italic">Hahnan</hi> or commander in chief; the high
                    chamberlain— <hi rend="italic">Marele Postelnicu;</hi> the great <hi
                    rend="italic">Spathar,</hi> or Swordbearer; the great cupbearer— <hi
                    rend="italic">Marele PahamieU</hi>; and the treasurer, or <hi rend="italic"
                    >Vistiernieu,</hi> who together formed the prince’s council and were known as
                    <hi rend="italic">Boiari, de Svαhι.</hi> Below these were a number of
                    subordinate officers who acted as their assessors and were'known as boiars of
                    the Divan <hi rend="italic">(Boiαri de Divanu).</hi> The high court of justice
                    was formed by the prince, metropolitan, and boiars: the <hi rend="italic">Boiari
                    de Svahi</hi> decided on the verdict; the metropolitan declared the law; and the
                    prince pronounced sentence. The boiars were able to try minor cases in their own
                    residences, but subject to the right of appeal to the prince’s tribunal. Of the
                    character of the Moldavian people Cantemir does not give a very favourable
                    account. Their best points were their hospitality and, in Lower Moldavia, their
                    valour. They cared little for letters and were generally indolent, and their
                    prejudice against mercantile pursuits left the commerce of the country in the
                    hands of Armenians, Jews, Greeks, and Turks. The pure-blood Rouman population,
                    noble and plebeian, inhabited the cities and towns or larger villages; the
                    peasantry were mostly of Little Russian and Hungarian race and were in a servile
                    condition. There was a considerable Gipsy population, almost every boiar having
                    several Zingar families in his possession; these were mostly smiths.</p>
                <p>ι-From this period onwards the character of the Ottoman domination in Moldavia is
                    in every respect analogous to that of Walachia, e The office of voivode or
                    hospodar was farmed out by the Porte to a succession of wealthy Greeks from the
                    Fanar quarter of Constantinople. All formality of election by the boiars was now
                    dispensed with, and the princes received their caftan of office at
                    Constantinople, where they were consecrated by the Greek patriarch. The system
                    favoured Turkish extortion in two ways: the presence of the voivode’s family
                    connexions at Stamboul gave the Porte so many hostages for his obedience; on the
                    other hand the princes themselves could not rely on any support due to family
                    influence in AIoldavia itself. They were thus mere puppets of the Divan, and
                    could be deposed and shifted with the same facility as so many pashas—an object
                    of Turkish policy, as each change was a pretext for a new levy of “backshish.”
                    The chief families that shared the office during this period were those of
                    Mavrocordato, Ghika, Callimachi, Ypsilanti, and AIurusi. Although from the very
                    conditions of their creation they regarded the country as a field for
                    exploitations, they were themselves often men of education and ability, and
                    unquestionably made some praiseworthy attempts to promote the general culture
                    and wellbeing of their subjects. In this respect, even the Fanariote regime was
                    preferable to mere pasha rule, while it had the further consequence of
                    preserving intact the national form of administration and the historic offices
                    of AIoldavia. Gregory Ghika (1774-1777), who himself spoke French and Italian,
                    founded a school or “gymnasium” at Jassy, where Greek, Latin, and theology were
                    taught in a fashion. He encouraged the settlement of German protestant colonists
                    in the country, some of whom set up as watchmakers in Jassy, where they were
                    further allowed to build an evangelical church. Carra, a Swiss who had been
                    tutor to Prince Ghika’s children, and who published in 1781 an account of the
                    actual state of the principalities, speaks of some of the boiare as possessing a
                    taste for French literature and even for the works of Voltaire, a tendency
                    actively combated by the patriarch of Constantinople.</p>
                <p>Tlio Russo-Turkish War, which ended in the peace of Kutshuk Kaimardji, was fatal
                    to the integrity of AIoldavian territory. The house of Austria, which had
                    already annexed Galicia in 1772, profited by the situation to arrange with both
                    contending parties for the peaceful cession of the Bukovina to the Hapsburg
                    monarchy. This richly-wooded AIoldavian province, containing Suciava, the
                    earliest seat of the voivodes, and Cernautii or Czernovitz, was in 1774 occupied
                    by Hapsburg troops with Russian connivance, and in 1777 Baron Thugut procured
                    its formal cession from the sultan. The Bukovina is still an Austrian
                    province.</p>

                    Kingdom.</hi> —The treaty of Kutshuk Kaimardji was hardly concluded when it was
                    violated by the Porte, which refused to recognize the right of the Walachian
                    boiars to elect their voivode, and nominated</p>
                <p>Alexander Ypsilanti, a creature of its own. In 1777 Constantine AIurusi was made
                    voivode of Aloldavia in the same high-handed fashion. The Divan seemed intent on
                    restoring the old system of government in its entirety, but in 1783 the Russian
                    representative extracted from the sultan a hattisherif defining more precisely
                    the liberties of the principalities and fixing the amount of the annual
                    tribute—for AValachia 619 purses exclusive of the bairam and other presents
                    amounting to 130,000 piasters, and for AIoldavia 135 purses and further gifts to
                    the extent of 115,000 piasters. By the peace of Jassy in 1792 the Dniester was
                    recognized as the Russian frontier, and the privileges of the principalities as
                    specified in the hattisherif confirmed. In defiance of treaties, however, the
                    Porte continued to change the Iiospodars almost yearly and to exact
                    extraordinary installation presents. The revolt of Pasvan Oglu in Bulgaria was
                    the cause of great injury to AValachia. The rebels ravaged Little AValachia in
                    1801-2, and their ravages were succeeded by those of the Turkish troops, who now
                    swarmed over the country. Exaction followed exaction, and in 1802 Russia
                    resolved to assert her treaty rights in favour of the oppressed inhabitants of
                    the principalities. On the accession of Constantine Ypsilanti the Porte was
                    constrained to issue a new hattisherif by which every prince was to hold his
                    office for at least seven years, unless the Porte satisfied the Russian minister
                    that there were good and sufficient grounds for his deposition. All irregular
                    contributions were to cease, and all citizens, with the exception of the boiars
                    and clergy, were to pay their share of the tribute. The Turkish troops then
                    employed in the principalities were to be paid off, and one year’s tribute
                    remitted for the purpose. The boiars were to be responsible for the maintenance
                    of schools, hospitals, and roads; they and the prince together for the militia.
                    The number of Turkish merchants resident in the country was limited. Finally,
                    the Iiospodars were to be amenable to representations made to them by the
                    Russian envoy at Constantinople, to whom was entrusted the task of watching over
                    the AValachian and AIoldavian liberties. This, it will be seen, was a veiled
                    Russian protectorate.</p>
                <p>In 1804 the Serbs under Karageorge rose against the Turkish dominion, and were
                    secretly aided by the AValachian voivode Ypsilanti. The Porte, instigated by
                    Napoleon’s ambassador Sebastiani, resolved on Ypsilanti’s deposition, but the
                    hospodar succeeded in escaping to St Petersburg. In the war that now ensued
                    between the Russians and the Turks, the former were for a time successful, and
                    even demanded that the Russian territory should extend to the Danube. In 1808
                    the Russians, then in occupation of the principalities, formed a governing
                    committee consisting of the metropolitan, another bishop, and four or five
                    boiars under the presidency of General Kusnikoff. The seat of the president was
                    at Jassy, and General Engelhart was appointed as vice-president at Bucharest. By
                    the peace of Bucharest, however, in 1812, the principalities were restored to
                    the sultan under the former conditions, with the exception of Bessarabia, which
                    was ceded to the czar. The Pruth thus became the Russian boundary.</p>
                <p>The growing solidarity between the two Rouman principalities received a striking
                    illustration in 1816, when the AValachian and AIoldavian hospodars published
                    together a code applicable to both countries, and which had been elaborated by a
                    joint commission. The Greek movement was now beginning, and in 1821 Alexander
                    Ypsilanti entered Aloldavia at the head of the Hetaerists, and prevailed on the
                    hospodar AIichael Sutzu to aid him in invading the Ottoman dominions. To secure
                    AValachian help, Ypsilanti advanced on Bucharest, but the prince, Theodore
                    Vladimirescu, who represented the national Rouman reaction against the
                    Fanariotes, repulsed his overtures with the remark “that his business was not to
                    march against the Turks, but to clear the country of Fanariotes.” Vladimirescu
                    was slain by a Greek revolutionary agent, but Ypsilanti’s legion was totally
                    routed by the Turks at Dragashani, and the result of his enterprise was a
                    Turkish occupation of the principalities. In 1822 the Turkish troops, who had
                    committed great excesses, were withdrawn on the combined representations of
                    Russia, Austria, and Great Britain. The country, however, was again ravaged by
                    the retiring troops, quarters of Jassy and Bucharest burnt, and the complete
                    evacuation delayed till 1824, when the British Government again remonstrated
                    with the Porte. By the convention of Akierman between the Russians and the Turks
                    in 1826 the privileges of the principalities were once more confirmed, and they
                    were again ratified in 1829, under Russian guarantee, by the peace of
                    Adrianople. By this peace all the towns on the left bank of the Danube were
                    restored to the principalities, and the Porte undertook to refrain from
                    fortifying any position on the AValachian side of the river. The principalities
                    were to enjoy commercial freedom, and the right of establishing a quarantine
                    cordon along the Danube or elsewhere. The internal constitution of the countries
                    was to be regulated by an “Organic Law,” which was drawn up by assemblies of
                    bishops and boiars at Jassyand Bucharest, acting, however, under Russian
                    control. The Organic Law thus elaborated was by no means of a liberal character,
                    and amongst other abuses maintained the feudal privileges of the boiars. It was
                    ratified by the Porte in 1834, and the Russian army of occupation thereupon
                    withdrew.</p>

                <p>The revolutionary movement of 1848 extended from the Roumans of Hungary and
                    Transylvania to their kinsmen of the Transalpine regions. In Moldavia the
                    agitation was mostly confined to the boiars, and the Iiospodar Michael Sturdza
                    succeeded in arresting the ringleaders. In Walachia, however, the outbreak took
                    a more violent form. The people assembled at Bucharest, and demanded a
                    constitution. The prince Bibescu, after setting his signature to the
                    constitution submitted to him, fled to Transylvania, and a provisional
                    government was formed. The Turks, however, urged thereto by Russian diplomacy,
                    crossed the Danube, and a joint Russo-Turkish dictatorship restored the “Organic
                    Law.” Bythe Balta-Liman convention of 1849 the two Governments agreed to the
                    appointment of Barbu Stirbeiu as prince of Walachia, and Gregoriu Ghika for
                    Moldavia.</p>
                <p>On the entry of the Russian troops into the principalities in 1853, the hospodars
                    fled to Vienna, leaving the government in . the hands of their ministers. During
                    the Danubian campaign that now ensued great suffering was inflicted on the
                    inhabitants, but in 1854 the cabinet of Vienna induced the Russians to
                    withdraw.</p>
                <p>. Austrian troops occupied the principalities, and the hospodars returned to
                    their posts.</p>
                <p>f By the treaty of Paris in 1856 the principalities with their existing
                    privileges were placed under the collective guarantee of the contracting powers,
                    while remaining under the suzerainty of the Porte,—the Porte on its part
                    engaging to respect the complete independence of their internal administration.
                    A strip of southern Bessarabia was restored to Moldavia, so as to push back the
                    Russian frontier from the Danube mouth. The existing laws and statutes of both
                    principalities were to be revised by a European commission sitting at Bucharest,
                    and their work was to be assisted by a Divan or national council which the Porte
                    was to convoke <hi rend="italic">ad hoc</hi> in each of the two provinces, and
                    in which all classes of AValachian and Moldavian society were to be represented.
                    The European commission, in arriving at its conclusions, was to take into
                    consideration the opinion expressed by the representative councils; the Powers
                    were to come to terms with the Porte as to the recommendations of the
                    commission; and the final result was to be embodied in a Iiattisherif of the
                    sultan, which was to lay down the definitive organization of the two
                    principalities. In 1857 the commission arrived, and the representative councils
                    of the two peoples were con-</p>
                <p>’ voked. On their meeting in September they at once proceeded to vote with
                    unanimity the union of the two principalities into a single state under the name
                    of Romania (Roumania), to be governed by a foreign prince elected from one of
                    the reigning dynasties of Europe, and having a single representative assembly.
                    The Powers decided to undo the work of national union. By the convention
                    concluded by the European congress at Paris in 1858, it was decided that the
                    principalities should continue as heretofore to be governed each by its own
                    prince. AValachia and Moldavia were to have separate assemblies, but a central
                    commission was to be established at Fokshaiii for the preparation of laws of
                    common interest, which were afterwards to be submitted to the respective
                    assemblies. In accordance with this convention the deputies of Moldavia aud
                    AValachia met in separate assemblies at Bucharest and Jassy, but the choice of
                    both fell unanimously on Prince Alexander John Cuza, thus ensuring the personal
                    union of the two principalities (January 1859). A new conference was now
                    summoned to Paris to discuss the affairs of the principalities, and the election
                    of Prince Cuza finally ratified by the Powers and the Porte. The two assemblies
                    and the central commission were preserved till 1862, when a single assembly met
                    at Bucharest and a single ministry was formed for the two countries. The central
                    commission was at the same time abolished, and a council of state charged with
                    preparing bills substituted for it. In May 1864, owing to difficulties between
                    the Government and the general assembly, the latter was dissolved, and a statute
                    was submitted to universal suffrage giving greater authority to the prince, and
                    creating two chambers (of senators and of deputies). The franchise was now
                    extended to all citizens, a cumulative voting power being reserved, however, for
                    property, and the peasantry were emancipated from forced labour.</p>
                <p>In 1865 a conflict broke out between the Government and the people in Bucharest,
                    and in February 1866 Prince Cuza, whose personal vices had rendered him
                    detestable, was forced to abdicate. The chambers chose first as his successor
                    the count of Flanders, but on his declining the office proceeded to elect Prince
                    Charles of Hohenzollern-Sigmaringen, who was proclaimed hospodar or <hi
                    rend="italic">Domnu</hi> of Roumania April 29, 1866. A new constitution was at
                    the same time introduced. Its provisions secure the universal suffrage of
                    tax-paying citizens, ministerial responsibility, trial by jury, freedom of
                    meeting and petition, of speech and of the press (except as regards breaches of
                    the criminal code), gratuitous and compulsory primary education, and the right
                    of asylum for political exiles. Legislative power is shared between the prince
                    and chambers, but bills relating to the budget and army must originate with the
                    chamber of deputies. There are two chambers— the senate and the chamber of
                    deputies. Both houses are elective, and the election is carried out by means of
                    electoral colleges classified according to property and professional
                    qualifications. For the house of deputies each constituency is divided in this
                    way into four colleges, each of which elects a member. The two highest of these
                    colleges also elect the senators, each senator being elected for a term of eight
                    years. The senate also includes <hi rend="italic">ex officio</hi> certain high
                    officials and ecclesiastics, and members for the universities. The senate
                    consists at present of 120 members, the chamber of deputies of 178. The
                    sovereign has a right of veto reserved to him on all measures. The judicial
                    system is based on the <hi rend="italic">Code Napoléon,</hi> with some
                    modifications.</p>
                <p>On the outbreak of the Russo-Turkish war in 1877 Roumania found herself once more
                    between hammer and anvil. Yielding to <hi rend="italic">force majeure</hi> the
                    Government of Prince Charles consented to the passage of Russian troops across
                    Roumanian territory, on the understanding that the scene of hostilities was as
                    far as possible to be removed outside the limits of the principality. The Porte,
                    however, refusing to recognize that Roumania had acted under constraint,
                    proclaimed the Roumanians rebels, and the prince’s Government accordingly
                    resolved to offer active assistance to the Russians. A Roumanian division of
                    32,000 men under General Cernat, took part in the siege of Plevna, and the
                    Roumanian soldiers distinguished themselves in the opinion of the most competent
                    j udges alike for their heroism and endurance. The successful assault by the
                    Roumanian troops on the “indomitable redoubt” of Grivitza formed in fact the
                    turning point of the siege and of the war. In the peace of StStefano, however,
                    Russia insisted on the retrocession of the strip of Bessarabia that had been
                    restored to Moldavia by the treaty of Paris, giving Roumania “in exchange” the
                    islands of the Danubian delta, and the Dobrudja, which had been ceded by the
                    sultan. This territorial readjustment w ’ as ratified by the treaty of Berlin
                    (1878). The high contracting powers at the same time consented by Art. xliii. to
                    recognize the independence of the principality subject to the provision (Art.
                    xliv.) that all the inhabitants should enjoy complete religious freedom, a
                    clause inserted on account of the Jewish persecutions that had previously taken
                    place, and that foreigners in the country should be treated on a footing of
                    perfect equality. All Danubian fortresses were to be razed, and the jurisdiction
                    of the European commission to regulate the Danubian navigation, on which
                    Roumania now acquired the right of representation, was extended from the mouth
                    to the Iron Gates. The coping-stone to Roumanian independence was set by the
                    proclamation on March 26, 1881, of Prince Charles as king of Roumania, and on
                    May 22 of the same year his coronation took place with the European sanction.
                    The crown placed on King Carol’s head was made from the captured cannon of the
                    Plevna redoubts.</p>
