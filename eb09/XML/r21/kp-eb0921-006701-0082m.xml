                    rend="smallcaps">General Survey of the Russian Empire.</hi></p>
                <p>THE Russian empire is a very extensive territory in eastern Europe and northern
                    Asia, with an area exceeding 8,500,000 square miles, or one sixth of the land
                    surface of the globe (one twenty-third of its whole superficies). It is,
                    however, but thinly peopled on the average, including only one-fourteenth of the
                    inhabitants of the earth. It is almost entirely confined to the cold and
                    temperate zones. In Nova Zembla (Novaya Zemlya) and the Taimyr peninsula, it
                    projects within the Arctic Circle as far as 77° 2' and 77° 40' N. lat.; while
                    its southern extremities reach 38° 50' in Armenia, about 35° on the Afghan
                    frontier, and 42° 30' on the coasts of the Pacific. To the west it advances as
                    far as 20° 40' E. long, in Lapland, 18° 32' in Poland, and 29° 42' on the Black
                    Sea; and its eastern limit—East Cape in the Behring Strait—extends to 191° E.
                    longitude.</p>
                <p>The Arctic Ocean—comprising the White, Barents, and</p>
                <p>Kara Seas—and the northern Pacific, that is, the Seas of Behring, Okhotsk, and
                    Japan, bound it in the north and east. The Baltic, with its two deep
                    indentations, the Gulfs of Bothnia and Finland, limits it on the north-west; and
                    two sinuous lines of frontier separate it respectively from Sweden and Norway on
                    the north-west and from Prussia, Austria, and Roumania on the west. The southern
                    frontier is still unsettled, and has never remained unaltered for so many as
                    twenty consecutive years. Quite recently it has been pushed southwards, on both
                    the western and the eastern shores of the Black Sea, parts of Roumania and Asia
                    Minor having been annexed in 1878. In Asia, beyond the Caspian, the southern
                    boundary of the empire remains vague; the advance into the Turcoman Steppes and
                    Afghan Turkestan and on the Pamir plateau is still in progress. Bokhara and
                    Khiva, though represented as vassal khanates, are in reality mere dependencies
                    of Russia. An approximately settled frontier-line begins only farther east,
                    where the Russian and the Chinese empires meet on the borders of Eastern
                    Turkestan, Mongolia, and Manchuria. But even there, the province of Kuldja has
                    recently been occupied by Russia, and again restored to China; while in eastern
                    Mongolia, the great overland route from Kiakhta to Peking, <hi rend="italic"
                    >via</hi> Urga, is in fact in the hands of Russia, and it is difficult to
                    predict how far Russian influence may extend should circumstances lead it to
                    seek a footing on the thinly-peopled plateaus of Central Asia.</p>
                <p>Russia has no oceanic possessions, and has abandoned those she owned in last
                    century; her islands are mere appendages of the mainland to which they belong.
                    Such are the Aland archipelago, Hochland, Tiitters, Dagö, and Osel in the Baltic
                    Sea; Nova Zembla, with Kolguefi and Vaigatch, in the Barents Sea; the Solovetsky
                    Islands in the White Sea; the New Siberian archipelago, and the small group of
                    the Medvyezhii Islands off the Siberian coast; the Commandor Islands off
                    Kamchatka; the Shantar Islands and Saghalin in the Sea of Okhotsk. The Aleutian
                    archipelago was sold to the United States in 1867, together with Alaska, and in
                    1874 the Kurile Islands were ceded to Japan.</p>
                <p>A vast variety of physical features is obviously to be expected in a territory
                    like this, which comprises on the one side the cotton and silk regions of
                    Turkestan and Transcaucasia, and on the other the moss and lichen-clothed Arctic
                    <hi rend="italic">tundras</hi> and the Verkhoyansk Siberian pole of cold —the
                    dry Transcaspian deserts and the regions watered by the monsoons on the coasts
                    of the Sea of Japan. Still, if the border regions, that is, two narrow belts in
                    the north and south, be left out of account, a striking uniformity of physical
                    feature prevails. High plateaus, like those of Pamir (the “Roof of the World”)
                    or of Armenia, and high mountain chains like the snow-clad summits of the
                    Caucasus, the Alay, the Thian-Shan, the Sayan, are met with only on the
                    outskirts of the empire.</p>
                <p>Viewed broadly by the physical geographer, it appears as occupying the
                    territories to the north-west of that great plateau-belt of the old
                    continent—the backbone of Asia —which spreads with decreasing height and width
                    from the high tableland of Tibet and Pamir to the lower plateaus of Mongolia,
                    and thence north-eastwards through the Vitim region to the furthest extremity of
                    Asia. It may be said to consist of the immense plains and flat lands which
                    extend between the plateau-belt and the Arctic Ocean, including also the series
                    of parallel chains and hilly spurs which skirt the plateau-belt on the
                    north-west. It extends over the plateau itself, and crosses it, beyond Lake
                    Baikal only.</p>
                <p>This belt—the oldest geological continent of Asia— being unfit for agriculture
                    and for the most part unsuited for permanent settlement, while the oceanic
                    slopes of it have from the dawn of history been occupied by a dense population,
                    has long prevented Slavonian colonization from reaching the Pacific. Russians
                    happened to cross it in the 17th century, only in its narrowest and most
                    northerly part, thus reaching the Pacific on the foggy and frozen coasts of the
                    Sea of Okhotsk; and two centuries elapsed ere, after colonizing the depressions
                    of the plateau around Lake Baikal, the Russians crossed the plateau in a more
                    genial zone and descended to the Pacific by the Amur, rapidly spreading farther
                    south, up the nearly uninhabited Usuri, to what is now the Gulf of Peter the
                    Great. In the south-western higher portions of the plateau-belt the empire has
                    only recently planted its foot on the Pamir; as we write, it is endeavouring to
                    get command of the lower passages which give an easy access to the Afghan
                    portion of the plateau; while already, within the present century, it has
                    established itself firmly on the plateaus of Armenia.</p>
                <p>A broad belt of hilly tracts—in every respect alpine in character, and displaying
                    the same variety of climate and organic life as alpine tracts usually do—skirts
                    the plateau-belt throughout its length on the north and north-west, forming an
                    intermediate region between the plateaus and the plains. The Caucasus, the
                    Elburz, the Kopet-dagh, and Paropamisus, the intricate and imperfectly known
                    network of mountains west of the Pamir, the Thian-Shan and Ala-tau mountain
                    regions, and farther north-east the Altai, the still unnamed complex of
                    Minusinsk mountains, the intricate mountain-chains of Sayan, with those of the
                    Olekma, Vitim, and Aldan, all of which are ranged <hi rend="italic">en
                    échelon—</hi> the former from north-west to south-east, and the others from
                    south-west to north-east—all of these belong to one immense alpine belt
                    bordering that of the plateaus. These have long been known to Russian colonists,
                    who, seeking to escape religious prosecutions and exactions by the state, early
                    penetrated into and rapidly pushed their small settlements up the better valleys
                    of these tracts, and continued to spread everywhere as long as they found no
                    obstacles in the shape of a former population or in unfavourable climatic
                    conditions.</p>
                <p>As for the flat-lands which extend from the Alpine hill-foots to the shores of
                    the Arctic Ocean, and assume the character either of dry deserts in the
                    Aral-Caspian depression, or of low table-lands in central Russia and eastern
                    Siberia, of lake-regions in north-west Russia and Finland, or of marshy prairies
                    in western Siberia, and of</p>

                <p><hi rend="italic">tundras</hi> in the far north,—their monotonous surfaces are
                    diversified by only a few, and these for most part low, hilly tracts. Recently
                    emerged from the Post-Pliocene sea, or cleared of their ice-sheet coverings,
                    they preserve the very same features over immense stretches; and the few
                    portions that rise above the general elevation have more the character of broad
                    and gentle swellings than of mountain-chains. Of this class are the swampy
                    plateaus of the Kola peninsula, gently sloping southwards to the lake-regions of
                    Finland and north-west Russia; the λ'aldai table-lands, where all the great
                    rivers of Russia take their rise; the broad and gently-sloping meridional belt
                    of the Ural Mountains; and lastly, the Taimyr, Tunguska, and Verkhoyansk ridges
                    in Siberia, which do not reach the snow-line, notwithstanding their sub-Arctic
                    position. As to the picturesque Bureya mountains on the Amur, the forest-clothed
                    Sikhota-alin on the Pacific, and the volcanic chains of Kamchatka, they belong
                    to quite another orographical world; they are the border-ridges of the terraces
                    by which the great plateau-belt descends to the depths of the Pacific Ocean.</p>
                <p>It is owing to these leading orographical features— divined by Carl Ritter, but
                    only within the present day revealed by geographical research—that so many of
                    the great rivers of the old continent are comprised within the limits of the
                    Russian empire. Taking rise on the plateau-belt, or in its Alpine outskirts,
                    they flow, first, like the upper Rhone and Rhine, along high longitudinal
                    valleys formerly filled up with great lakes; next they find their way through
                    the rocky walls; and finally they enter the lowlands, where they become
                    navigable, and, describing great curves to avoid here and there the minor
                    plateaus and hilly tracts, they bring into water-communication with one another
                    places thousands of miles apart. The double river-systems of the Volga and Kama,
                    the Obi and Irtish, the Angara and Yenisei, the Lena and Vitim on the Arctic
                    slope, the Amur and Sungari on the Pacific slope, are instances. They were the
                    true channels of Russian colonization.</p>
                <p>A broad depression,—the Aral-Caspian desert—has arisen where the plateau-belt has
                    reached its greatest height and suddenly changes its direction from a
                    northwestern into a north-eastern one; this desert is now filled only to a small
                    extent by the salt waters of the Caspian, Aral, and Balkash inland seas; but it
                    bears unmistakable traces of having been during Post-Pliocene times an immense
                    inland basin. There the Volga, the Ural, the Sir Daria, and the Oxus discharge
                    their waters without reaching the ocean, but continue to bring life to the
                    rapidly drying Transcaspian Steppes, or connect by their river network, as the
                    Volga does, the most remote parts of European Russia.</p>
                <p>The above-described features of the physical geography of the empire explain the
                    relative uniformity of this wide territory, in conjunction with the variety of
                    physical features on its outskirts. They explain also the rapidity of the
                    expansion of Slavonic colonization over these thinly peopled regions; and they
                    also throw light upon the internal cohesion of the empire, which cannot fail to
                    strike the traveller as he crosses this immense territory, and finds everywhere
                    the same dominating race, the same features of life. In fact, in their advance
                    from the basins of the Volkhoff and Dnieper to the foot of the Altai and Sayan
                    Mountains, that is, along nearly a quarter of the earth’s circumference, the
                    Russian colonizers could always find the same physical conditions, the same
                    forests and prairies as they had left at home, the same facilities for
                    agriculture, only modified somewhat by minor topographical features. New
                    conditions of climate and soil, and consequently new cultures and civilizations,
                    the Russians met with, in their expansion towards the south and east, only
                    beyond the</p>
                <p>Caucasus, in the Aral-Caspian region, and in the basin of the Usuri on the
                    Pacific coast. Favoured by these conditions, the Russians not only conquered
                    northern Asia— they colonized it.</p>
                <p>The total population of the Russian empire was stated at 102,000,000 by estimates
                    made in 1878-82; but it is multiplying rapidly, and, as the surplus of births
                    over deaths reaches nearly 1,250,000 every year, it must now be somewhat more
                    than 106 millions.</p>
                <p>Within the empire a very great diversity of nationalities is comprised, due to
                    the amalgamation or absorption by the Slavonian race of a variety of Ural-Altaic
                    stems, of Turco-Tartars, Turco-Mongolians, and various Caucasian stems.
                    Statistics as to their relative strength are still very imperfect, and their
                    ethnical relations have not as yet been completely determined; but, considered
                    broadly, they may be classified as follows:—</p>
                <p>A. The Letto-Slavonians comprise ( <hi rend="italic">a</hi> ) the Lithuanians and
                    Letts on the lower Niemen and Düna, and ( <hi rend="italic">b</hi> ) the
                    Slavonians, that is, the Poles on the Vistula and Niemen and the Russians—Great,
                    Little, and White—whose proper abodes are in European Russia, south of a line
                    drawn from the Gulf of Finland to the middle Volga. Spreading from this region
                    towards the north-east, east, and south-east, they have colonized north-east
                    Russia, the Ural region, Caucasus, Siberia, and large parts of the Kirghiz
                    Steppe,—the leading feature of their colonization having always been penetration
                    in compact masses among the original inhabitants. Thus, on northern Caucasus the
                    Russians (chiefly Little Russians) already constitute a compact rural population
                    of nearly 1,500,000, that is, about a quarter of the total population of
                    Caucasia. In Western Siberia the Great Russians already number more than
                    2,300,000 agriculturists, constituting four-fifths of the entire population; in
                    Eastern Siberia they number more than 1,000,000, that is, probably more than the
                    original inhabitants; and the Kirghiz Steppe has also begun rapidly to be
                    colonized within the last twenty years. It is only in the more densely peopled
                    Turkestan, and in the recently annexed Transcaspian region, that Russian
                    settlers continue to bear but a small proportion to the natives (who are more
                    than 4,600,000 strong). The Slavonians altogether number more than 75,000,000,
                    of which number 5,600,000 are Poles.</p>
                <p>Swedes (310,000), Germans (1,240,000), Roumanians, Serbs, &lt;kc., may number
                    altogether about 2,500,000.</p>
                <p>B. A great variety of populations belonging to the Caucasian race, but not yet
                    well classified, some of which are considered to be remainders of formerly
                    larger nationalities pushed aside into the mountain tracts during their
                    migrations, are met with on Caucasus. Such are the Georgians, Ossetes,
                    Lesghians, who fall little short of 2,500,000, and the Armenians, about
                    1,000,000.</p>
                <p>C. The Iranian branch is represented by some 130,000 Persians and Kurds in
                    Caucasia and Transcaucasia, and by Tajiks in Turkestan, mixed with Turco-Tartar
                    Sarts. The nomad Tsigans, or Gipsies, numbering nearly 12,000, may be mentioned
                    under this head.</p>
                <p>D. The Semitic branch consists of upwards of 3,000,000 Jews in Poland, in west
                    and south-west Russia, and on Caucasus and in the towns of Central Asia, and of
                    a few thousand Karaite Jews.</p>
                <p>E. The Ural-Altaic branch comprises two great subdivisions—the Finnish and the
                    Turco-Tartarian stems, mixed to some extent with Mongolians. The former (see
                    below) occupy, broadly speaking, a wide stretch of territory to the north of the
                    Slavonians, from the Baltic to the Yenisei, and include the Baltic Finns, the
                    Northern Finns, the Volga Finns, and the Ugrians. The Russians have already
                    spread among the last two in compact masses,</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit21newyrich/page/n84/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0921-0084-0069"/>
                <p>and, while some stems, like the Ostiaks, are rapidly disappearing, others, like
                    the Mordvinians, Permians, &amp;c., are losing their national character, and
                    becoming assimilated to the Russians. The West Finns alone have fully maintained
                    their national features, and happen to have constituted a nationality developing
                    into a separate state.</p>
                <p>The Turco-Tartars (nearly 10,000,000) comprise the Tartars, the Bashkirs, the
                    Kirghizes, the Uzbegs, and the Turcomans of the Aral-Caspian region, the Yakuts
                    on the Lena, and a variety of smaller stems in East Russia and Caucasia. They
                    occupy another broad belt which extends from the Aral-Caspian depression to the
                    eastern parts of the Arctic coast.</p>
                <p>F. The Mongol-Manchurian stems of the Tunguses, and the Golds, and the Manchus
                    proper, come next, occupying the eastern parts of the mountain-belt and the
                    plateau itself in Siberia, the Tunguses also projecting north-westwards, so as
                    to separate the Yakuts from their southern Turkish brethren. Small stems of the
                    same family also pass a nomad existence in the basin of the Amur. They are
                    rapidly diminishing in number, and can hardly be estimated at more than
                    50,000.</p>
                <p>G. The Mongolian branch is represented by nearly half a million of Kalmucks on
                    the Altai outskirts of the great plateau and around the Caspian, and by nearly
                    250,000 Buriats in and around the Baikal depression.</p>
                <p>H. A variety of stems, not yet well classified, are met with on the Pacific
                    coasts. Such are the Tchuktchies, the Kamchadales, the Koryaks in the
                    north-east, the Ghilyaks on the Amur, and the Ainos in Saghalin.</p>
                <p>Statistics of the relative strength of different nationalities in the Russian
                    empire, which, however, must be considered only as rough estimates, are given
                    (in millions) in the following table (I.) :—</p>

                            areas for the first three districts are given according to M. Seidlitz
                            in <hi rend="italic">Russische Revue,</hi> 1885, 4; for the remainder,
                            according to General Meyer. The oasis of Merv proper extends to about
                            2100 square miles. The populations are given without the Russian
                            military. M. Seidlitz estimates them as follows: Akhal Tekke, 42,000;
                            Krasnovodsk, 15,300; Manghishlak, 34,500; Merv, 160,000; Tedjeñ, 7500;
                            total, 260,000. The total population, excluding military, is estimated
                            by military authorities at 214,000. </p></note>

                <p>The Russian empire falls into two great subdivisions, the European and the
                    Asiatic, the latter of which, representing an aggregate of nearly 6,500,000
                    square miles, with a population of only 16 million inhabitants, may be
                    considered as held by colonies. The European dominions comprise European Russia,
                    Finland, which is in fact a separate nationality treated to some extent as an
                    allied state, and Poland, whose very name has been erased from official
                    documents, but which nevertheless continues to pursue its own development. The
                    Asiatic dominions comprise the following great subdivisions :—Caucasia <hi
                    rend="italic">(q.v.),</hi> under a separate governor-general; the Transcaspian
                    region, which is under the governor-general of Caucasus; the Kirghiz Steppes;
                    Turkestan <hi rend="italic">(q.v.),</hi> under separate governors-general;
                    Western Siberia and Eastern Siberia (see Siberia); and the Amur region, which
                    last comprises also the Pacific coast region and Kamchatka (see Kamchatka and
                    Maritime Province). The administrative subdivisions, with their populations, as
                    estimated for 1882 for European Russia, Poland, and Caucasus, 1881 for Finland,
                    and 1878-82 for the remainder (no regular census having been taken since 1858),
                    are shown above in Table II.</p>
                <p>The empire contains only twelve cities with a population exceeding 100,000:—St
                    Petersburg, 929,090 (1881); Moscow, 753,469 (1884); Warsaw, 406,260 (1882);
                    Odessa, 217,000(1882); Riga, 169,330 (1881); Kharkoff, 159,660 (1883); Kazan,
                    140,730 (1883); Kishineff, 130,000; Kieff, 127,250 (1874); Lodz, 113,146, in
                    Poland (1884); Saratoff, 112,428 (1882); Tiflis, 104,020 (1883); and Tashkend,
                    100,000. According to the most recent returns Vilna, Orel, Rostoff, Astrakhan,
                    Nikolaieff, Dünaburg, Tula, Samara, Taganrog, Kherson, Nijni-Novgorod,
                    Berditcheff, Bobruisk, Zhitomir, Minsk, Vitebsk, Elisabetgrad, Reval, and
                    Voronezh had from 94,000 to 50,000 inhabitants, while 61 towns more in European
                    Russia, Finland, and Poland, and 20 in the Asiatic dominions, had from 50,000 to
                    20,000 inhabitants. The number of towns above 10,000 is considerable, but they
                    are mostly mere administrative centres; many villages have greater
                    importance.</p>
                <p>Only 9,263,000 (or 9 per cent.) of the aggregate population of Russia inhabit
                    towns, the number of which is 601 in the 50 Russian governments. The great
                    number of the Russian towns are mere villages; their inhabitants depend on
                    agriculture, and the houses are mostly built of wood, only 127,000 out of about
                    787,000 houses in towns being built of stone. Of the 68,600,000 who in 1882
                    formed the rural population of European Russia the greater part were settled in
                    555,278 villages, almost entirely built of wood; nearly one-seventieth of the
                    houses are destroyed by fire yearly (164,400 out of 10,649,000 in 1882).</p>
                <p>Russia is an absolute and strongly centralized monarchy. The primary unit of
                    state organization is the village community, or <hi rend="italic">mir.</hi> A
                    number of such communities are united into <hi rend="italic">volosts,</hi> whose
                    peasant inhabitants elect an elder <hi rend="italic">(yolost-noy starshina)</hi>
                    and a peasants’ tribunal ( <hi rend="italic">yolostnoy sud).</hi> Placed,
                    however, under the uncontrolled rule of a state official—the <hi rend="italic"
                    >mirovoyposrednik—</hi> and of the police, the elder of the volost and his clerk
                    have become mere organs of the local police and tax-gatherers, while the
                    tribunal of the volost is at the mercy both of influential land-proprietors and
                    of the wealthier peasants or merchants. The system of local self-government is
                    continued in the elective district and provincial assemblies—the <hi
                    rend="italic">zemstvo—</hi> on the one hand, and on the other in the elective
                    justices of the peace <hi rend="italic">(mirovoy sudia),</hi> whose periodical
                    gatherings <hi rend="italic">(mirovoy syezd)</hi> are courts of appeal against
                    the decisions of the individual justices. But neither of these institutions—and
                    least of all the zemstvo—is capable of acquiring the necessary independence. The
                    zemstvos—one for each district, and another for the province—consist of a
                    representative assembly <hi rend="italic">(zemskoye Sobraniye)</hi> and an
                    executive <hi rend="italic">Gemskaya τιprava)</hi> nominated by the former. The
                    sobraniye consists of three classes of delegates :—the landed proprietors (all
                    nobles possessing more than 590 acres, and delegates from the remainder, along
                    with delegates from the clergy in their capacity of landed proprietors);
                    representatives of the merchants, artisans, and urban population; and
                    representatives of the peasants, indirectly elected,—matters being usually so
                    adjusted that this class is less numerous than the aggregate of the other two.
                    In theory the zemstvos have large powers in relation to the incidence of
                    taxation, as well as in matters affecting education, public health, roads,
                    &amp;c. But in reality they are for the most part compelled to limit themselves
                    to the adjustment of the state taxation, which is so high that new taxes for
                    education, sanitary purposes, and so on, must necessarily be very limited.
                    Moreover, the decisions of the zemstvos are jealously controlled by the
                    representative of the central Government,— the governor,—and promptly annulled
                    whenever they manifest a different spirit from that prevailing for the time at
                    the court. Disobedience is punished by dissolution, sometimes by administrative
                    exile. These circumstances have helped to eliminate from the zemstvos the better
                    elements which at first entered into their composition. The greater number of
                    them are inspired now with the same red-tapeism as the ministerial
                    chancelleries, or are refuges for proprietors in search of a salary. Still, in
                    several provinces a good deal of most useful work has been done, especially
                    educational, by those zemstvos in which the peasants are in a majority or the
                    proprietors are inspired with a more liberal spirit; while several other
                    zemstvos have recently made extensive and most valuable inquiries into the
                    condition of agriculture, industry, &amp;c.</p>
                <p>Since 1870 the municipalities have had institutions like those of the zemstvos.
                    All owners of houses, and tax-paying merchants, artisans, and workmen, are
                    enrolled on lists in a descending order according to their assessed wealth. The
                    total valuation is then divided into three equal parts, each of which elects an
                    equal number of representatives to the <hi rend="italic">duma.</hi> The
                    executive is in the hands of an elective mayor and an u <hi rend="italic"
                    >prava</hi> which consists of several members elected by the <hi rend="italic"
                    >duma.</hi> Both are, in fact, functionaries under the governor, and the
                    municipal institutions have no real independent life. <note anchored="true"

                    extensive as they are totally undefined. There is also in each government a
                    special gendarmerie under the “chief of gendarmes,” who usually is also the head
                    of the “third section” of the Imperial Chancery. The name of the third section
                    has been recently abolished, but the institution still continues. It has charge
                    of the secret police of the state, and has most varied functions, such as the
                    arrest of supposed political offenders, their exile to Siberia, the delivery of
                    separation papers to spouses desiring divorce, and so on. Several governments
                    are placed under special governors general, whom the recent law on the “state of
                    siege” invests with almost dictatorial powers.</p>
                <p>The higher administration is represented by the emperor, who unites the supreme
                    legislative, executive, and judicial powers, and is surrounded by four distinct
                    councils—the committee of ministers, the council of the empire, the senate, and
                    the Holy Synod. The ministers, who are considered as executing the will of the
                    czar, and are nominated by him, are invested with very extensive powers; their
                    circulars for the interpretation of laws have greater weight than the laws
                    themselves. The council of the empire, which consisted in 1881 of 64 members,
                    nominated by the emperor, besides the ministers and several members of the
                    imperial family, is a consultative body for matters of legislation. The senate,
                    also nominated by the emperor, has two distinct functions. Seven “departments”
                    of it are administrative; they promulgate the laws, examine the acts of
                    governors, adjudicate in their conflicts with zemstvos, and, in theory, can make
                    remonstrances to the emperor,— in fact they merely register and promulgate laws.
                    Two other “departments” are courts of cassation. A special department,
                    reinforced by representatives of nobility, pronounces judgment in political
                    cases. The Holy Synod, consisting of metropolitans and bishops who sit there in
                    turn, has the superintendence of religious affairs.</p>
                <p>The judicial system introduced in 1864 was conceived in a very liberal spirit,
                    which, unfortunately, has not been maintained. Thus a “preliminary instruction,”
                    made by the “third section” in political cases, Jor by the police, has been
                    subsequently introduced. The “judges of instruction,” irremovable by law, have
                    not yet been nominated, their functions being discharged by substitutes entirely
                    dependent upon the ministry. Elective justices of the peace decide in all cases
                    involving less than 500 roubles, or less than six months’ imprisonment. Their
                    decisions can be brought by appeal before the district gathering of the justices
                    of the peace, and thence before the senate. All criminal cases involving severer
                    penalties are tried by juries, whose verdicts can be set aside only by a court
                    of cassation, but are not respected in cases having a so-called “political”
                    aspect. Political offences are tried by tribunals composed <hi rend="italic">ad
                    hoc.</hi> Civil cases in which more than 500 roubles are involved are tried by
                    courts of justice, with appeal to chambers of justice.</p>
                <p>In 1879 in European Russia,—exclusive of six Lithuanian and White Russian
                    governments,—42,530 persons were tried before the courts, and 59,600 before the
                    justices of the peace, the convictions being respectively 27,397 and 36,742. The
                    aggregate number of condemnations pronounced in 1882 was 46,018 in European
                    Russia, that is, 5 <hi rend="superscript">-</hi> 9 condemned in each 10,000;
                    only 4836 of them were women. On January 1, 1882, 93,108 persons were in jail;
                    530,307 men and 66,073 women (the latter with 30,769 children) were imprisoned
                    during the year, while 625,280 prisoners were liberated or exiled, and on
                    January 1, 1883, the number of prisoners in jail (excluding those of Saghalin
                    and Caucasus) was 97,337. More than 20,000 are annually transported to
                    Siberia.</p>
                <p>The empire is divided for administrative purposes into governments ( <hi
                    rend="italic">guberniya)</hi> or territories ( <hi rend="italic">oblast),</hi>
                    of which there are 50 in European Russia and 10 in Poland. Each government, or
                    territory, is divided into eight to fifteen districts <hi rend="italic"
                    >Guyezd).</hi> The Asiatic dominions are divided into one lieutenancy ( <hi
                    rend="italic">namyestnitchestvo),</hi> that of Caucasia, and four general
                    governments—Turkestan, Stepnoye (Kirghiz Steppes), East Siberia, and Amur. They
                    comprise thirty-three governments and territories, besides a few districts <hi
                    rend="italic">GJkrug, Otdyel)</hi> in Transcaucasia and the Transcaspian region,
                    regarded almost as separate governments. In Siberia the governors and
                    governors-general are assisted by councils which have a consultative voice. The
                    Baltic provinces have some peculiar institutions. Finland is a separate state,
                    having its own finances, army, and representative institutions, with limited
                    rights, but its ministers of war and the exterior are those of the empire, and
                    its institutions are not always respected by the emperor.</p>
                <p>The emperor is not the head of the church, all decisions in theological matters
                    having to be given by the Synod. His influence, however, is very great, as the
                    nomination of the bishops rests with him. In 1882 there were in Russia 40,569
                    Orthodox churches and about 14,000 chapels, with 37,318 priests, 7009 deacons,
                    and 45,395 singers. There were also 6752 monks and 3957 aspirants, 4945 nuns and
                    13,803 female aspirants. The church budget was 18,974,887 roubles in 1884. The
                    monasteries and churches are possessed of great wealth, including 2950 square
                    miles of land (a territory greater than that of Oldenburg), an invested capital
                    of 22,634,000 roubles, an annual subsidy of 408,000 roubles from Government, and
                    a very great number of inns, shops, printing establishments, burial grounds,
                    &amp;c., with whole towns covering an aggregate area of 10 1/2 square miles.
                    Their total annual revenue is estimated at 9,000,000 roubles.</p>
                <p>Much still remains to be done for the diffusion of the first elements of a sound
                    education throughout the empire; unhappily the endeavours of private persons in
                    this field and of the zemstvos are for political reasons discouraged by the
                    Government. There are seven universities—Dorpat, Kazan, Kharkoff, Kieff, Moscow,
                    Odessa, and St Petersburg—to which may be added those of Warsaw and Helsingfors.
                    In 1883 the seven Russian universities had 605 professors and 10,528 students,
                    and there were 81 professors and 1228 students at Warsaw. The standard of
                    teaching on the whole is high, and may be compared to that of the German
                    universities. The students are hardworking, and generally very intelligent.
                    Mostly sons of poor parents, they live in extreme poverty, supporting themselves
                    chiefly by translating and by tutorial work. Severe measures have been taken in
                    1885 in regard to the universities. Explicit regulations for the interpretation
                    of science have been issued, and restrictions laid upon the teaching of
                    philosophy and natural science generally; comparative legislation has been
                    excluded from the programmes; teaching in Russian (instead of German) has been
                    ordered at Dorpat. The students are placed under rigorous regulations in regard
                    to their life outside the university. About 950 students in theological
                    academies and 2500 in higher technical schools must be added to the above.</p>
                <p>The state of secondary education still leaves very much to be desired. There were
                    in 1883 180 gymnasiums and progymnasiums for boys in European Russia, and 24 in
                    the Asiatic dominions, and 27 and 10 respectively for girls; there were also 73
                    “real” schools in European Russia and 8 in the Asiatic dominions, and 48 normal
                    schools in Russia and 10 in the Asiatic dominions. To these must be added the
                    14,800 pupils in 53 theological seminaries, and about 3000 in various secondary
                    schools. The steady tendency of Russian society towards increasing the number of
                    secondary schools, where instruction would be based on the study of the natural
                    sciences, is checked by Government in favour of the classical gymnasiums. The
                    aggregate number of schools for secondary instruction in European Russia in 1882
                    was 456 for boys and 384 for girls, with 107,930 male and 79,625 female
                    scholars. Of these, 355 schools (45,303 boys and 3199 girls) give professional
                    education.</p>
                <p>For· primary instruction there were in 1882 in European Russia proper 28,329
                    schools, with 1,177,504 male and 362,471 female pupils. Of the 6,231,160 roubles
                    expended on primary schools only 747,772 roubles were contributed by Government,
                    the remainder being supplied by the zemstvos (2,512,113 roubles), by
                    municipalities, or by private persons. Sunday schools and public lectures are
                    virtually prohibited.</p>
                <p>A characteristic feature of the intellectual movement in Russia is its tendency
                    to extend to women the means of receiving higher instruction. The gymnasiums for
                    girls are both numerous and good. In addition to these, notwithstanding
                    Government opposition, a series of higher schools, where careful instruction in
                    natural and social sciences is given, have been opened in the chief cities under
                    the name of ‘‘Pedagogical Courses.” At St Petersburg a women’s medical academy,
                    the examinations of which were even more searching than those of the ordinary
                    academy (especially as regards diseases of women and children), was opened, but
                    after about one hundred women had received the degree of M.D., it has been
                    suppressed by Government. In several university towns there are also free
                    teaching establishments for women, supported by subscription, with programmes
                    and examinations equal to those of the universities. In 1882 the students
                    numbered 914 at St Petersburg, about 500 at Moscow, and 389 at Kazan.</p>
                <p>The natural sciences are much cultivated in Russia, especially during the last
                    twenty years. Besides the Academy of Science, the Moscow Society of Naturalists,
                    the Mineralogical Society, the Geographical Society, with its Caucasian and
                    Siberian branches, the archaeological societies and the scientific societies of
                    the Baltic provinces, all of which are of old and recognized standing, there
                    have lately sprung up a series of new societies in connexion with each
                    university, and their serials are yearly growing in importance, as <pb

                    Society of Friends of Natural Science, the Chemico-Physical Society, and various
                    medical, educational, and other societies. The work achieved by Russian savants,
                    especially in biology, physiology, and chemistry, and in the sciences
                    descriptive of the vast territory of Russia, are well known to Europe.</p>
                <p>The finances of the empire are in a most unsatisfactory condition. Although the
                    revenue has doubled since 18δ6, and had reached 697,980,983 roubles
                    (£69,798,098) <note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Unless
                    metallic or silver roubles are expressly mentioned, the rouble is to be taken

                    which has been 2s. sterling. The metallic rouble (277 ’ 71 grains of pure

                    but the paper rouble has gradually declined from 94∙5 per cent, of its nominal

                    the expenditure, which was estimated at 721,337,844 roubles the same year, is
                    always in excess of the income. The national debt is rapidly augmented both by
                    loans and by issues of paper money so depreciated as to be worth only about 60
                    to 63 per cent, of its nominal value. On January 1, 1884, no less than
                    1,085,000,000 paper roubles were in circulation; and the national debt, the
                    paper-money included, reached about £578,000,000, inclusive of the railway debt.
                    The great defect of Russian finance is that its direct taxes are chiefly paid by
                    the peasantry (91 per cent, of the whole), and the revenue is chiefly based on
                    excise duties (direct taxes, 136,105,320 roubles; excise duties on spirits,
                    250,291,380; duties on tobacco and sugar, 28,569,500; import duties,
                    101,053,000). Of the yearly revenue no less than 436,000,000 roubles are spent
                    in interest and sinking fund on the debt, and for war purposes. <note

                <p>The zemstvos, which have an aggregate yearly income of about thirty million
                    roubles, have also a yearly deficit of from three to five million roubles. The
                    municipalities had in 1882 an income of only 40,076,748 roubles, there being
                    only nine cities which had a budget of more than 500,000 roubles, and five above
                    one million.</p>
                <p>The Russian army has been completely reorganized since the Crimean War, and
                    compulsory military service was introduced in 1874. In 1884 the strength of the
                    army on a peace footing was 532,764 men serving with the colours, 68,786 reserve
                    troops, 55,599 Cossacks and irregulars, 72,626 local, depot, and instruction
                    troops, 27,468 officers, 129,736 horses, and 1844 guns. On a war footing there
                    were 986,000 in the active army, 563,373 in the reserve, 148,057 Cossacksand
                    irregulars, 178,450 local, depôt, and instruction troops, 41,551 officers,
                    366,354 horses, and 3778 guns; that is, about 1,300,000 men in field, to which
                    number 1,000,000 untrained militia could be added in case of need. These high
                    figures, ought, however, to be much reduced on account of the deficiencies of
                    mobilization.</p>
                <p>The irregular troops consist of ten <hi rend="italic">voiskos—</hi> Don, Kubafi,
                    Terek, Astrakhan, Orenburg, Ural, West Siberia, Semiryetchensk, Transbaikalia,
                    and Amur. All the men of these voiskos between sixteen and forty-one years of
                    age are bound to be ready for service in turn in time of peace, and to equip
                    themselves at their own expense, train and artillery being provided by
                    Government. In their twofold capacity as peasant settlers and a military force,
                    these men have contributed much to the conquest of Asia.</p>
                <p>Since 1878 compulsory military service has been introduced in Finland. The
                    Finnish troops (nine battalions of 4833 riflemen) must bo employed, as a rule,
                    for the defence of their own country.</p>
                <p>Notwithstanding large recent outlays, the Russian navy is by no means adapted to
                    the exigencies of modern warfare; much stress is therefore laid on the good
                    organization of the torpedo flotilla. The navy consists of 358 vessels, of
                    196,575 tons, carrying 24,500 men and 671 guns. Only 40 of these are armoured
                    ships, the remainder being unarmoured frigates, corvettes, and cruisers, or
                    torpedo boats (119), while a great number are mere transports and small
                    craft.</p>
                <p>The extensive frontier is defended by many fortresses, chiefly on the west.
                    Poland to the west of the Vistula remains quite unprotected, fortifications
                    being only now in course of construction in the south-west; but the Vistula is
                    defended by the first-class fortresses of Modlin (Novogeorgievsk), Warsaw, and
                    Ivangorod, with Brest-Litovsk in the rear. For protecting this line in rear new
                    fortifications are being erected. The space between Poland and the Diina is
                    protected only by the citadel of Vilna and the marshes of the Pripet. The second
                    line of fortresses has been erected on the Diina and Dnieper,—Riga, Diinaburg,
                    Vitebsk, Bobruisk, and Kieffi The south-western frontier is under the protection
                    of the advanced works of Bendery and Akerman, while the Black Sea coast is
                    defended by Kinburn and Otchakoff at the entrances of the Dnieper and the Bug,
                    Sebastopol in the Crimea, batteries at Odessa and Nikolaieff, and a series of
                    minor fortifications. Formidable defensive works have been erected on the Baltic
                    at Dünamünde, Reval, Narva, Cronstadt, Wiborg, Frederikshamn, Rohtensalm,
                    Sveaborg, Hangoudd, and in the Aland Islands. A great number of minor forts are
                    scattered throughout Caucasia, Transcaucasia, and Turkestan; but the Pacific
                    coast has only earth-works at Vladivostok and Nikolaievsk.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Pakt II.—European Russia—Geography.</hi></p>
                <p>The administrative boundaries of European Russia, apart from Finland and Poland,
                    broadly coincide on the whole with the natural limits of the East-Europcan
                    plains, where they suddenly take, eastward of the Baltic Sea, a great extension
                    towards the north. In the north it is bounded by the Arctic Ocean; the islands
                    of Nova Zembla, Kolguefl', and Vaigatch also belong to it, but the Kara Sea is
                    reckoned to Siberia. To the east it has the Asiatic dominions of the empire,
                    Siberia and the Kirghiz Steppe, from both of which it is separated by the Ural
                    Mountains, the Ural river, and the Caspian—the administrative boundary, however,
                    Partly extending into Asia on the Siberian slope of the Urals. To the south it
                    has the Black Sea and Caucasia, being separated from the latter by the double
                    valley of the two Manytches—a channel which in Post-Pliocene times connected the
                    Sea of Azoff with the Caspian. The western boundary is purely conventional: it
                    crosses first the peninsula of Kola from the Varanger Fiord to the northern
                    extremity of the Gulf of Bothnia, making an arbitrary deflexion towards the
                    west; thence it runs to the Kurische Haff in the southern Baltic, and thence to
                    the mouth of the Danube, taking a great circular sweep to the west to embrace
                    Poland, and separating Russia from Prussia, Austrian Galicia, and Roumania.</p>
                <p>Of this immense frontier line less than one-half is bordered by seas—nearly all
                    of them inland seas. For it is a special feature of Russia—a feature which has
                    impressed a special character on its history—that she has no free outlet to the
                    high seas except on the ice-bound shores of the Arctic Ocean. Even the White Sea
                    is merely a ramified gulf of that ocean. Another warmer gulf of the Arctic
                    Ocean—the Varanger Fiord—separated from Russia by the uninhabitable plateaus of
                    the peninsula of Kola, has been abandoned to Norway. The deep indentations of
                    the Gulf of Bothnia and Finland wash the shores of Finnish territory, and it is
                    only at the very head of the latter gulf that the Russians happen to have taken
                    a firm foothold by erecting their capital on the marshes at the mouth of the
                    Neva. The Gulf of Riga and the south-eastern Baltic belong also to territory
                    which is not inhabited by Slavonians, but by Finnish stems, and by Germans. It
                    is only very recently, within the last hundred years, that the Russians
                    definitively took possession of the northern shores of the Black Sea and the Sea
                    of Azoff. The eastern coast of the Black Sea belongs properly to Transcaucasia,
                    a great chain of mountains separating it from Russia. But even this sea is an
                    inland one, the only outlet of which, the Bosphorus, is in foreign hands, while
                    the Caspian is but an immense shallow lake, bordered mostly by deserts, and
                    possessing more importance as a link between Russia and her colonies than as a
                    channel for intercourse with other countries.</p>
                <p>The great territory occupied by European Russia—1600 miles in length from north
                    to south, and nearly as much from west to east —is on the whole a broad elevated
                    plain, ranging between 500 and 900 feet above sea-level, deeply cut into by
                    river-valleys, and bounded on all sides by broad hilly swellings or mountains
                    :—the lake plateaus of Finland and the Maanselka heights in the northwest; the
                    Baltic coast-ridge and spurs of the Carpathians in the west, with a broad
                    depression between the two, occupied by Poland; the Crimean and Caucasian
                    mountains in the south; and the broad but moderately high swelling of the Ural
                    Mountains in the east.</p>
                <p>From a central plateau which comprises Tver, Moscow, Smolensk, and Kursk, and
                    projects eastwards towards Samara, attaining an average height of 800 to 900
                    feet above the sea, the surface gently slopes in all directions to a level of
                    from 300 to 500 feet. Then it again gently rises as it approaches the hilly
                    tracts enclosing the great plain. This central swelling may be considered a
                    continuation towards the east-north-east of the great line of upheavals of
                    western Europe; the heights of Finland would then appear as continuations of the
                    Scanian plateaus, and the northern mountains of Finland as continuations of the
                    Kjolen, while the other great line of upheaval of the old continent, which runs
                    north-west and south-east, would be represented in Russia by the Caucasus in the
                    south and the Timan ridge of the Petchora basin in the north.</p>
                <p>The hilly aspects of several parts of the central plateau are not due to foldings
                    of the strata, which for the most part appear to be horizontal, but chiefly to
                    the excavating action of rivers, whose valleys arc deeply dug out in the
                    plateau, especially on its borders. The round flattened summits of the Valdai
                    plateau do not rise above 1100 feet, and they present the appearance of
                    mountains only in consequence of the depth of the valleys—the levels of the
                    rivers which flow towards the depression of Lake Peipus being only from 200 to
                    250 feet above the sea. The case is Similar with the plateaus of Livonia,
                    "Wendish Switzerland,” and Kovno, which do not exceed 1000 feet at their highest
                    points; so also with the eastern spurs of the Baltic coast-ridge between Grodno
                    and Minsk. The same elevation is reached by a very few flat summits of the
                    plateau about Kursk, and farther east on the Volga about Kamysnin, where the
                    valleys are excavated in the plateau to a depth of from 800 to 900 feet, giving
                    quite a hilly aspect to the country. It is only in the south-west, where spurs
                    <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit21newyrich/page/n88/mode/1up"

                    Bessarabia, that ridges reaching 1100 feet are met with, intersected by deep
                    ravines.</p>
                <p>The depressions on the borders of the central plateau thus acquire a greater
                    importance than the small differences in its height. Such is the broad
                    depression of the middle nVolga and lower Kama, bounded on the north by the
                    faint swelling of the Uvaty, which is the watershed between the Arctic Ocean and
                    the Volga basin. Another broad depression, from 250 to 500 feet above the sea,
                    still filled by Lakes Peipus, Ladoga, Onega, Bieto-ozero, Latche, Vozhe, and
                    many thousands of smaller ones, borders the central plateau on the north, and
                    follows the same east-north-east direction. Only a few low swellings penetrate
                    into it from the north-west, about Lake Onega, and reach 900 feet, while in the
                    north-east it is enclosed by the high Timanskiyridge (1000 feet). A third
                    depression of a similar character, occupied by the Pripet and the middle
                    Dnieper, extends to the west of the central plateau of Russia, and penetrates
                    into Poland. The immense lacustrine basin is now broken up into numberless
                    ponds, lakes, and extensive marshes (see Minsk). It is bounded on the south by
                    the broad plateaus spreading east of the Carpathians. South of 50° N. lat. the
                    central plateau gently slopes towards the south, and we find there a fourth
                    depression spreading west and east through Poltava and Kharkoff, but still
                    reaching in its higher parts 500 to 700 feet. It is separated from the Black Sea
                    by a gentle swelling which may be traced from Kremenetz to the lower Don, and
                    perhaps farther south-east. This low swelling includes the Donetz coal-measures
                    and the middle granitic ridges which cause the rapids of the Dnieper. Finally a
                    fifth immense depression, which descends below the level of the ocean, extends
                    for more than 200 miles to the north of the Caspian, comprising the lower Volga
                    and the Ural and Emba rivers, and establishing a link between Russia and the
                    Aral-Caspian region. The depression is continued farther north by plains below
                    300 feet which join the depression of the middle Volga, and extend as far as the
                    mouth of the Oka.</p>
                <p>The Ural Mountains present the aspect of a broad Swelling whose strata no longer
                    exhibit the horizontality we see in Russia, and moreover are deeply cut into by
                    rivers. It is connected in the west with broad plateaus joining those of central
                    Russia, but its orographical relations to other upheavals must be more closely
                    studied before they can be definitely pronounced on.</p>
                <p>The rhomboidal peninsula of the Crimea, connected by only a narrow isthmus with
                    the continent, is occupied by a dry plateau gently sloping north and east, and
                    bordered in the south-east by the Yaita Mountains, the summits of which range
                    between 4000 and 5113 feet (see Crimea and Tavrida).</p>
                <p>Owing to the orographical structure of the East-European plains, which Iiasjust
                    been described, the river-system has attained a very high development. Taking
                    their origin from a series of great lacustrine basins scattered over the surface
                    of the plateaus and differing slightly in elevation, the Russian rivers describe
                    immense curves before reaching the sea, and flow with a very gentle gradient,
                    receiving numerous large tributaries, which collect their waters from vast
                    areas. Thus the Volga, the Dnieper, and the Don attain respectively a length of
                    2110, 1330, and 1125 miles, and their basins cover 645,000, 244,600, and about
                    115,000 square miles respectively. Moreover the chief rivers of Russia—the
                    Volga, the Diina, the Dnieper, and even the Lovat and the Oka—take their rise in
                    the north-western part of the central plateau, so close to one another that they
                    may be said to radiate from the same marshes. The sources of the Don are
                    ramified among the tributaries of the Oka, while the upper tributaries of the
                    Kama join those of the Dwina and Petchora. In consequence of this, the rivers of
                    Russia have been from remote antiquity the true channels of trade and migration,
                    and have contributed much more to the elaboration of the national unity than any
                    political institutions. Boats could be conveyed over flat and easy portages,
                    from one river-basin to another, and these portages were subsequently
                    transformed with a relatively small amount of labour into navigable canals, and
                    even at the present day these canals have more importance for the traffic of the
                    country than most railways. By their means the plains of the central plateau—the
                    very heart of Russia, whose natural outlet was the Caspian—were brought into
                    water-communication with the Baltic, and the Volga basin connected with the Gulf
                    of Finland. The White Sea has also been brought into connexion with the central
                    Volga basin, while the sister-river of the Volga —the Kama—became the main
                    artery of communication with Siberia.</p>
                <p><hi rend="subscript">-</hi> It must be observed, however, that, though ranking
                    before the rivers of western Europe in respect of length, the rivers of Russia
                    are far behind as regards the amount of water discharged. They freeze in winter
                    and dry up in summer, and most of them are navigable only during the
                    spring-floods; even the great Volga becomes so shallow during the hot season
                    that only light boats can pass its shoals.</p>
                <p>Russia has a very large number of lakes. The aggregate area of the largest ones
                    is stated at 25,800 square miles.</p>
                <p>The following is a descriptive list of the principal rivers of European
                    Russia.</p>
                <p>A. <hi rend="italic">Artic Ocean Basin.—</hi> (1) The Petchora (1025 miles) rises
                    in the northern Urals, and enters the ocean by a large estuary at the Gulf of
                    Petchora. Its basin, thinly peopled and available only for cattle-breeding and
                    for hunting, is quite isolated from Russia by the Timan ridge. The river is
                    navigable for 770 miles; grain and a variety of goods conveyed from the upper
                    Kama are floated down, while furs, fish, and other products of the sea are
                    shipped, up the river to be transported to Tcherdyn on the Kama. (2) The Kara
                    (139 miles) enters the Kara Sea. (3) The Mezen (510 miles) enters the Bay of
                    Mezen; it is navigable for 450 miles, and is the channel of a considerable
                    export of timber. (4) The northern Dwina, or Dvina (950 miles), with a basin of
                    about 150,000 square miles, is formed by the union of two great rivers, the Yug
                    (270 miles) and the Sukhona (330 miles). The Sukhona has its origin in Lake
                    Kubenskoye, in north-west Vologda, and flows rapidly southwards and eastwards,
                    having a great number of rapids. It is navigable throughout its length, and, as
                    Lake Kubenskoye communicates by the Alexander of Wurtemberg Canal with Lake
                    Bietoye, it is connected with the Caspian and Baltic. The Vytchegda (685 miles),
                    which flows west-south-west to join the Sukhona, through a woody region, thinly
                    peopled, is navigable for 500 miles and in its upper portion is connected by a
                    canal with the upper Kama. The Dwina flows with a very slight gradient through a
                    broad valley, receiving many tributaries, and reaches the White Sea at Archangel
                    by a number of branches. Notwithstanding serious obstacles offered by shallows,
                    corn, fish, salt, and timber are largely shipped to and from Archangel. (5) The
                    Onega (245 miles) rises in Lake Latche in the south of OIonetz, and flows into
                    Onega Bay; it has rapids; timber is floated down in spring, and fishing and some
                    navigation are carried on in the lower portion.</p>
                <p>B. <hi rend="italic">Baltic Basin.—</hi> (6) The Neva (46 miles) flows from Lake
                    Ladoga into the Gulf of Finland (see Sτ Petersburg). (7) The Volkhoff (135
                    miles), discharging into Lake Ladoga (see Ladoga), and forming part of the
                    Vyshnevolotsk system of canals, is an important channel for navigation; it flows
                    from Lake Ilmen (367 square miles), which receives the Msta (250 miles),
                    connected with the Volga, the Lovat (310 miles), and many smaller tributaries.
                    (8) The Svir (135 miles), also discharging into Lake Ladoga, flows from Lake
                    Onega (4925 square miles), and, being part of the Mariinsk canal system, is of
                    great importance for navigation (see Volga). (9) The Narova (46 miles) flows out
                    of Lake Peipus into the Gulf of Finland at Narva; it has remarkable rapids,
                    notwithstanding which an active navigation is carried on by means of its waters.
                    Lake Peipus, or Tchudskoye (136 square miles), receives —(10) the Velikaya (210
                    miles), a channel of traffic with southern Russia from a remote antiquity, but
                    now navigable only in its lower portion, and (11) the Embach (83 miles),
                    navigated by steamers to Dorpat. (12) The Düna, or West Dwina (577 miles), with
                    a basin area of about 75,000 square miles, rises in the Ostashkoff district of
                    Tver, and falls into the sea below Riga, after having described a great curve to
                    the south. It is shallow above the rapids of Jacob-stadt, but navigation is
                    carried on as far as Vitebsk,—corn, timber for shipbuilding, potash, flax,
                    &amp;c., being the principal shipments of its navigable tributaries (the Obsha,
                    Ulla, and Kasplya); the Ulla is connected by the Berezina canals with the
                    Dnieper. (13) The Niemen (Memel), with a course of 470 miles in Russia, rises in
                    the north of Minsk, leaves Russia at Yurburg, and enters the Kurische Haff;
                    rafts are floated upon it almost from its sources, and steamers ply as far as to
                    Kovno; the export of corn and timber to Prussia, and import of fish, grocery,
                    and manufactured ware are considerable; it is connected by the Oginski Canal
                    with the Dnieper. The chief tributaries are the Viliya and the Shara. For (14)
                    the Vistula, with the Bug and Narew, see Poland.</p>
                <p>C. <hi rend="italic">Black Sea Basin.—</hi> (15) The Pruth (505 miles) rises in
                    Austrian Bukovina, and separates Russia from Roumania; it enters (16) the
                    Danube, which flows along the Russian frontier for 100 miles below Reni,
                    touching it with its Kiliabranch. (17) The Dniester (530 miles within Russia and
                    about 330 miles in Austria) rises in Galicia. Light boats and rafts are floated
                    at all points, and steamers ply on its lower portion; its estuary has important
                    fisheries. (18) The Dnieper (1330 miles), with a basin of about 245,000 square
                    miles, with tributaries, waters thirteen governments, of which the aggregate
                    population numbers about 15,000,000. It also originates in the north-western
                    parts of the central plateau, in the same marshy lakes which give rise to the
                    Volga and Düna. It flows west, south, south-east, and south-west, and enters a
                    bay in the north-western part of the Black Sea. In the middle navigable part of
                    its course, from Dorogobuzh to Ekate-rinoslaff, it is an active channel for
                    traffic. It receives several large tributaries :—on the right, the Berezina (285
                    miles), connected with the Diina, and the Pripet (400 miles), both most
                    important for navigation,—as well as several smaller tributaries on which rafts
                    are floated; on the left the Sozh (330 miles), the Desna (590 miles), one of the
                    most important rivers of Russia, navigated by steamers as far as Bryansk, the
                    SuIa (252 miles), the PsioI (415 miles), and the VorskIa (268 miles). Below
                    Ekaterinoslaff the Dnieper flows for 46 miles through a series of thirteen
                    rapids. At Kherson it enters its long (40 miles) but <pb break="no"

                    miles) and the Ingut (220 miles). The traffic of the Dnieper and its tributaries
                    reached in 18S2 an aggregate of 12 ’ 9 million cwts. shipped and 6'7 discharged,
                    the principal items being com, salt, and timber. (19) The Don (1125 miles), with
                    a basin of about 120,000 square miles, and navigable for 880 miles, rises in
                    south-eastern Tula and enters the Sea of Azoff at Rostoff by thirty mouths,
                    after describing a great curve to the east at Tsaritsyn, approaching the Volga,
                    with which it is connected by a railway (40 miles). Its navigation is of great
                    importance (5 <hi rend="superscript">-</hi> 4 million cwts. shipped, and 5Ί
                    discharged), especially for goods brought from the Volga, and its fisheries are
                    extensive. The chief tributaries are the Sosna (175 miles) and North Donetz (615
                    miles) on the right, and the Voronezh (305 miles), Khoper (565 miles),
                    Medvyeditsa (410 miles), and Manytch (295 miles), on the left. (20) The Ylya
                    (192 miles), (21) the Kubah (510 miles), and (22) the Rion belong to
                    Caucasia.</p>
                <p>D. <hi rend="italic">The Caspian Basin.—</hi> (23) The Volga, the chief river of
                    Russia, has a length of 2110 miles, and its basin, about 648,000 square miles in
                    area, contains a population of more than 40,000,000. It is connected with the
                    Baltic by three systems of canals (see Volga). (24) The Great and the Little
                    Uzen no longer reach the Caspian but lose themselves in the Babinskoye Lakes.
                    (25) The Ural (1475 miles), in its lower part, constitutes the frontier between
                    European Russia and the Kirghiz Steppe; it receives the Sakmara on the right and
                    the Ilek on the left. (26) The East DIanytch (175 miles) is on the Caucasian
                    boundary. (27) The Kuma (405 miles), (28) the Terek (360 miles), and (29) the
                    Kura (about 650 miles), with the Arax (about 650 miles), which receives the
                    waters of Lake Goktcha, belong to Caucasia. <hi rend="superscript">1</hi></p>
                <p>. Almost every geological formation, from the oldest up to the most recent, is
                    met with in Russia; but, as they are almost horizontal, they for the most part
                    cover one Another over immense spaces, so that the lower ones appear only at the
                    bottom of the deeper valleys, and the oldest are seen only on the borders of the
                    great Russian plain.</p>
                <p>At the beginning of the Palaeozoic period only a very few portions of what is now
                    Russia—Finland, namely, and parts of Olonetz— rose above the surface of the sea;
                    but, as the result of a gradual upheaval continued through Palaeozoic times, it
                    is supposed that at the end of this epoch Russia was a continent not greatly
                    differing from tho present one. In DIesozoic times the sea began again to invade
                    it, but, while in the preceding period the oscillations resolved themselves into
                    a gradual upheaval extending from west to east, in Mesozoic times the upheaval
                    went on from north-west to south-east. The Dlcsozoic sea, however, did not
                    extend beyond what is now central Russia, and did not cover the “Devonian
                    plateau” of western Russia, which remained a continent from the Carboniferous
                    epoch. A gradual rising of the continent followed, and was continued through
                    Neozoic times, with perhaps a limited subsidence in tho Post-Glacial period,
                    when the actual seas extended their narrow gulfs up the valleys now occupied by
                    the great rivers. During the first part of the Glacial period, Russia seems to
                    have been covered by an immense ice-sheet, which extended also over central
                    Germany, and of which the eastern limits cannot yet be determined.</p>
                <p>The Archaean gneisses have a broad extension in Finland, northern Russia, the
                    Ural Mountains, and the Caucasus; they form also the back-bone of the ridge
                    which extends from the Carpathians through southern Russia. They consist for the
                    most part of red and grey gneisses and gτanulites, with subordinate layers of
                    granite and granitite. Tho Finland <hi rend="italic">raρpa-kivi,</hi> the
                    Serdobol gneiss, and the Pargas and Rustiala marble (with the so-called <hi
                    rend="italic">Eozoon cana∙ dense)</hi> yield good building stone; while iron,
                    copper, and zinc-ore are common in Finland and in the Urals. Rocks regarded as
                    representing the Huronian system appear also in Finland, in northwestern Russia,
                    as a narrow strip on the Urals, and in the Dnieper ridge. They consist of a
                    series of Unfossiliferous crystalline slates. The Cambrian is represented by
                    blue clays, ungulite sandstones, and bituminous slates in Esthonia and St
                    Petersburg.</p>
                <p>The Silurian system is widely developed, and it is most probable that, with the
                    exception of the Archaean continents of Finland and the Urals, the Silurian sea
                    covered the whole of Russia. Being concealed by more recent deposits, Silurian
                    rocks appear on the surface only in north-western Russia (Esthonia, Livonia, St
                    Petersburg, and on the Volkhoff), where all European subdivisions of tho system
                    have been found, in the Timan ridge, on the western slope of the Urals, in the
                    Pai-kho ridge, and in the islands of the Arctic Ocean. In Poland it is met with
                    in the Kielce mountains, and in Podolia in the deeper ravines.</p>

                <p>The Devonian dolomites, limestones, and red sandstones cover immense tracts and
                    appear on the surface over a much wider area. From Esthonia these rocks extend
                    north-east to Lake Onega, and south-east to Moghileff; they form the central
                    plateau, as also the slopes of the Urals and the Petchora region. In
                    north-western and middle Russia they contain a special fauna, and it appears
                    that the Lower Devonian series of western Europe, represented in Poland and in
                    the Urals, is missing in north-western and central Russia, where only the Middle
                    and Upper Devonian divisions are found.</p>
                <p>Carboniferous deposits cover nearly all eastern Russia, their west boundary being
                    a line drawn from Archangel to the upper Dnieper, thence to the upper Don, and
                    south to the mouth of the last-named river, with a long narrow gulf extending
                    west to encircle the plateau of the Donetz. They are visible, however, only on
                    the western borders of this region, being covered towards the east by thick
                    Permian and Triassic strata. Russia has three large coal-bearing regions—the
                    Moscow basin, the Donetz region, and the Urals. In the Valdai plateau there are
                    only a few beds of mediocre coal. In the DIoscow basin, which was a broad gulf
                    of the Carboniferous sea, coal appears as isolated inconstant seams amidst
                    littoral deposits, the formation of which was favoured by frequent minor
                    subsidences of the sea-coast. The Donetz coal-measures, containing abundant
                    remains of a rich land-flora, cover nearly 16,000 square miles, and comprise a
                    valuable stock of excellent anthracite and coal, together with iron-mines.
                    Several smaller coal-fields on the slopes of the Urals and on the Timan ridge
                    may be added to the above. The Polish coal-fields belong to another
                    Carboniferous area of deposit, which extended over Silesia.</p>
                <p>The Permian limestones and marls occupy a strip in eastern Russia of much less
                    extent than that assigned to them on geological maps a few years ago. The
                    variegated marls of eastern Russia, rich in salt-springs, but very poor in
                    fossils, are now held by most Russian geologists to be Triassic. Indisputably
                    Triassic deposits have been found only in the two Bogdo mountains in the Kirghiz
                    Steppe <hi rend="italic">[Campilcr-Sefiichtcn)</hi> and in south-western
                    Poland.</p>
                <p>During the Jurassic period the sea began again to invade Russia from south-east
                    and north-west. The limits of the Russian Jurassic system may be represented by
                    a line drawn from the double valley of the Sukhona and Vytchegda to that of the
                    upper Volga, and thence to Kiefl', with a wide gulf penetrating towards the
                    northwest. Within this space three depressions, all running south-west to
                    north-east, are filled up with Upper Jurassic deposits. They are much denuded in
                    the higher parts of this region, and appear but as isolated islands in central
                    Russia. In the south-east all the older subdivisions arc represented, the
                    deposits having the characters of a deep-sea deposit in the Aral-Caspian region
                    and on the Caucasus.</p>
                <p>The Cretaceous deposits—sands, loose sandstones, marls, and white chalk—cover the
                    region south of a line drawn from the Niemen to the upper Oka and Don, and
                    thence north-east to Simbirsk, with the exception of the Dnieper and Don ridge,
                    the Yaita Dlountains, and the upper Caucasus. They are rich in grinding stone,
                    and especially in secondary layers of phosphorites.</p>
                <p>The Tertiary formations occupy large areas in southern Russia. The Eoccne covers
                    wide tracts from Lithuania to Tsaritsyn, and is represented in the Crimea and
                    Caucasus by thick deposits belonging to the same ocean, which left its deposits
                    on the Alps and the Himalayas. Oligocene, quite similar to that of North
                    Germany, and containing brown coal and amber, has been met with only in Poland,
                    Courland, and Lithuania. The Miocene (Sarmatian stage) occupies extensive tracts
                    in southern Russia, south of a line drawn through Lublin to Ekaterinoslaff and
                    Saratoff Not only the higher chains of Caucasus and Yaita, but also the Donetz
                    ridge, rose above the level of the DIiocene sea, which was very shallow to the
                    north of this last ridge, while farther south it was connected both with the
                    Vienna basin and with the Aral-Caspian. The Pliocene appears only in the coast
                    region of the Black and Azoff Seas, but it is widely developed in the
                    Aral-Caspian region, where, however, the Ust-Urt and the Obshchiy Syrt rose
                    above the sea.</p>
                <p>The thick Quateniary, or Post-Pliocene, deposits which cover nearly all Russia
                    were for a long time a puzzle to geologists. They consist of a boulder clay in
                    the north and of loess in the south. The former presents an intimate mixture of
                    boulders brought from Finland and Olonetz (with an addition of local boulders)
                    with small gravel, coarse sand, and the finest glacial mud,—the whole bearing no
                    trace of ever having been washed up and sorted by water in motion, except in
                    subordinate layers of glacial sand and gravel; the size of the boulders
                    decreases on the whole from north to south, and tho boulder clay, especially in
                    northern and central Russia, often takes the shape of ridges parallel to the
                    direction of the <pb break="no"

                    roughly corresponding with those established by Murchison, but not yet settled
                    in the south-east and east, are, according to M. Nikitin, the following :— from
                    the southern frontier of Poland to Ovrutch, Uman, Kremen-tchug, Poitava, and
                    Razdornaya (50° N. latitude), with a curve northwards to Kozelsk (?); thence due
                    north to Vetluga (δ8° north latitude), east to Glazova in Vyatka, and from this
                    place towards the north and west along the watershed of the Volga and Petchora
                    (?). South of the 50th "parallel appears the loess, with all its usual
                    characters (land fossils, want of stratification, &amp;c. ), showing a
                    remarkable uniformity of composition over very large surfaces; it covers both
                    watersheds and valleys, but chiefly the former. Such being the characters of the
                    Quaternary deposits in Russia, the majority of Russian geologists now adopt the
                    opinion that Russia was covered, as far as the above limits, with an immense
                    ice-sheet which crept over central Russia and central Germany from Scandinavia
                    and north Russia. Another ice-covering was probably advancing at the same time
                    from the north-east, that is, from the northern part of the Urals, but the
                    question as to the glaciation of the Urals still remains open. As to the loess,
                    the view is more and more gaining ground which considers it as a steppe-deposit
                    due to the drifting of fine sand and dust during a dry episode in the
                    Pleistocene period.</p>
                <p>The deposits of the Post-Glacial period are represented throughout Russia,
                    Poland, and Finland, as also throughout Siberia and central Asia, by very thick
                    lacustrine deposits, which show that, after the melting of the ice-sheet, the
                    country was covered with immense lakes, connected by broad channels (the <hi
                    rend="italic">fjdrden</hi> of the Swedes), which later on gave rise to the
                    actual rivers. On the outskirts of the lacustrine region, closely resembling the
                    area of the actual continent, traces of marine deposits, not higher than 200 or
                    perhaps even 150 feet above present sea-level, are found alike on the Arctic Sea
                    and on the Baltic and Black Sea coasts. A deep gulf of the Arctic Sea advanced
                    up the valley of the Dwina; and the Caspian, connected by the Manytch with the
                    Black Sea, and by the Uzboy valley with Lake Aral, penetrated north up the Volga
                    valley, as far as its Samara bend. Unmistakable traces show that, while during
                    the Glacial period Russia had an arctic flora and fauna, the climate of the
                    Lacustrine period was more genial than it is now, and a dense human population
                    at that time peopled the shores of the numberless lakes.</p>
                <p>The Lacustrine period has not yet reached its close in Russia. Finland and the
                    north-west hilly plateaus are still in the same geological phase, and are dotted
                    with numberless lakes and ponds, while the rivers continue to dig out their yet
                    undetermined channels. But the great lakes which covered the country during the
                    Lacustrine period have disappeared, leaving behind them immense marshes like
                    those of the Pripet and in the north-east. The disappearance of what still
                    remains of them is accelerated not only by the general decrease of moisture, but
                    also by the gradual upheaval of northern Russia, which is going on from Esthonia
                    and Finland to the Kola peninsula and Nova Zembla, at an average rate of about
                    two feet per century. This upheaval,—the consequences of which have been felt
                    even within the historic period, by the drainage of the formerly impracticable
                    marshes of Novgorod and at the head of the Gulf of Finland,—together with the
                    destruction of forests, which must be considered, however, as a quite secondary
                    and subordinate cause, contributes towards a decrease of precipitation over
                    Russia and towards increased shallowness of her rivers. At the same time, as the
                    gradients of the rivers are gradually increasing on account of the upheaval of
                    the continent, the rivers dig their channels deeper and deeper. Consequently
                    central and especially southern Russia witness the formation of numerous
                    miniature canons, or <hi rend="italic">ovraghi</hi> (deep ravines), the summits
                    of which rapidly advance and ramify in the loose surface deposits. As for the
                    southern steppes, their desiccation, the consequence of the above causes, is in
                    rapid progress. <note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi

                <p>The soil of Russia depends chiefly on the distribution of the boulder-clay and
                    loess coverings described above, on the progress made by the rivers in the
                    excavation of their valleys, and on the moistness of climate. Vast areas in
                    Russia are quite unfit for cultivation, 27 per cent, of the aggregate surface of
                    European Russia (apart from Poland and Finland) being occupied by lakes,
                    marshes, sands, &amp;c., 38 per cent, by forests, 14 per cent, by prairies, and
                    only 21 per cent, being under culture. The distribution of all these is,
                    however, very unequal, and the five following subdivisions may be established
                    :—(1) the <hi rend="italic">tundras</hi>; (2) the forest region; (3) the middle
                    region, comprising the surface available for agriculture and partly covered with
                    forests; (4) the black-earth <hi rend="italic">{tchernoziom)</hi> region; and
                    (5) the Steppes. Of these the black-earth region,—about 150,000,000 acres,—which
                    reaches from the Carpathians to the Urals, extending to the Pinsk marshes and
                    the upper Oka in the north, is the most important. It is covered with a thick
                    sheet of black earth, a kind of loess, mixed with 5 to 15 per cent. of humus,
                    due to the decomposition of an herbaceous vegetation, which developed richly
                    during the Lacustrine period on a continent relatively dry even at that epoch.
                    On the three-fields system corn has been grown upon it for fifty to seventy
                    consecutive years without manure. Isolated black-earth islands, less fertile of
                    course, occur also in Courland and Kovno, in the Oka, Volga, and Kama
                    depression, on the slopes of the Urals, and in a few patches in the north.
                    Towards the Black Sea coast its thickness diminishes, and it disappears in the
                    valleys. In the extensive region covered with boulder-clay the black earth
                    appears only in isolated places, and the soil consists for the most part of a
                    sandy clay, containing a much smaller admixture of humus. There culture is
                    possible only with the aid of a considerable quantity of manure. Drainage
                    finding no outlet through the thick clay covering, the soil of the forest region
                    is often covered with extensive marshes, and the forests themselves are often
                    mere thickets spreading over marshy ground; large tracts covered with sand
                    appear in the west, and the admixture of boulders with the clay in the
                    north-west renders agriculture increasingly difficult. On the Arctic coast the
                    forests disappear, giving place to the tundras. Finally, in the south-east,
                    towards the Caspian, on the slopes of the southern Urals and the Obshchiy Syrt,
                    as also in the interior of the Crimea, and in several parts of Bessarabia, there
                    are large tracts of real desert, covered with coarse sand and devoid of
                    vegetation. <note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi

                <p>Notwithstanding the fact that Russia extends from north to south through 26
                    degrees of latitude, the climate of its different portions, apart from the
                    Crimea and the Caucasus, presents a striking uniformity. The aerial
                    currents—cyclones, anti-cyclones, and dry south-east winds—extend over wide
                    surfaces and cross the flat plains freely. Everywhere we find a cold winter and
                    a hot summer, both varying in their duration, but differing relatively little in
                    the extremes of temperature recorded. From Table III. (page 76) it will be seen
                    that there is no place in Russia, Archangel and Astrakhan included, where the
                    thermometer does not rise in summer nearly to 86° Fahr, and descend in winter to
                    -13° and - 22°. It is only on the Black Sea coast that we find the absolute
                    range of temperature reduced to 108°, while in the remainder of Russia it
                    reaches 126° to 144°, the oscillations being between - 22° to - 31°,
                    occasionally - 54°, and 86° to 104°, occasionally, 109°. Everywhere the rainfall
                    is small: if Finland and Poland on the one hand and Caucasus with the Caspian
                    depression on the other be excluded, the average yearly rainfall varies between
                    the limits of 16 and 28 inches. Everywhere, too, we find that the maximum
                    rainfall does not take place in winter (as in western Europe) but in summer, and
                    that the months of advanced spring are warmer than the corresponding months of
                    autumn.</p>
                <p>Though thus exhibiting all the distinctive features of a continental climate,
                    Russia is not altogether exempt from the moderating influence of the ocean. The
                    Atlantic cyclones also reach the Russian plains, mitigating to some extent the
                    cold of the winter, and in summer bringing with them their moist winds and
                    thunderstorms; their influence is chiefly felt in western Russia, but extends
                    also towards and beyond the Urals. They thus check the extension and limit the
                    duration of the cold anticyclones.</p>
                <p>Throughout Russia the winter is of long continuance. The last days of frost are
                    experienced for the most part in April, but also in May to the north of 55°. The
                    spring is exceptionally beautiful in central Russia; late as it usually is, it
                    sets in with vigour, and vegetation develops with a rapidity which gives to this
                    season in Russia a special charm, unknown in warmer climates; the rapid melting
                    of snow at the same time raises the rivers, and renders a great many minor
                    streams navigable for a few weeks. But a return of cold weather, injurious to
                    vegetation, is observed throughout central and eastern Russia between May 18 and
                    24, so that it is only in June that warm weather sets in definitely, reaching
                    its maximum in the first half of July (or of August on the Black Sea coast). The
                    summer is much warmer than might be supposed; in south-eastern Russia it is much
                    warmer than in the corresponding latitudes of France, and really hot weather is
                    experienced everywhere. It does not, however, prevail for long, and in the first
                    half of September the first frosts begin to be experienced on the middle Urals;
                    they reach western and southern Russia in the first days of October, and are
                    felt on the Caucasus about the middle of November. The temperature descends so
                    rapidly that a month later, about October 10 on the middle Urals and November 15
                    throughout Russia, the thermometer ceases to rise above the freezing-point. The
                    rivers rapidly freeze; towards November 20 all the streams of the White Sea
                    basin are covered with ice, and so remain for an average of 167 days; those of
                    the Baltic, Black Sea, and Caspian basins freeze later, but about December 20
                    nearly all the rivers of the <pb break="no"

                    remains frozen for a period varying between 150 days in the north and 90 days at
                    Astrakhan, the Don for 100 to 110 days, and the Dnieper for 83 to 122 days. On
                    the Diina ice prevents navigation for 125 days, and even the Vistula at Warsaw
                    remains frozen for 77 days. The lowest temperatures are experienced in January,
                    in which month the average is as low as 20° to 5° Fahr, throughout Russia; in
                    the west only does it rise above 22“. On the whole, February and March continue
                    to be cold, and their average temperatures rise above zero only on the Black Sea
                    coast. Even at Kietf and Lugaft the average of March is below 30°, while in
                    central Russia it is 25° to 22“, and as low as 20“ and 16“ at Samara and
                    Orenburg.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Isotherms.—</hi> All Russia is comprised between the isotherms
                    of 32° and 54“. On the whole, they are more remote from one another than even on
                    the plains of North America, those of 46° to 32“ being distributed over 20
                    degrees of latitude. They are, on the whole, inclined towards the south in
                    eastern Russia; thus the isotherm of 39“ runs from St Petersburg to Orenburg,
                    and that of 35“ from Torneà to Uralsk. The inflexion is still greater for the
                    winter isotherms. Closely following one another, they run almost north and
                    south; thus Odessa and Königsberg are situated on the same winter isotherm of
                    28“; so also St Petersburg, Orel, and the mouth of the Ural river (about 20“);
                    Mezen and Ufa (9°). The summer isotherms cross the above nearly at right angles,
                    so that Kieff and Ufa, Warsaw and Tobolsk, Riga and the upper Kama have the same
                    average summer temperatures of 64°, 62∣ <hi rend="superscript">o</hi> , and
                    61“.</p>
                <p>The flora of Russia, which represents an intermediate link between those of
                    Germany and Siberia, is strikingly uniform over a very large area. Though not
                    poor at any given place, it appears so if the space occupied by Russia bo taken
                    into account, only 3300 species of phanerogams and ferns being known. Four great
                    regions may be distinguished the Arctic, the Forest, the Steppe, and the
                    Circum-Mediterranean.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Arctic Region</hi> comprises the <hi rend="italic"
                    >tundras</hi> of the Arctic littoral beyond the northern limit of forests, which
                    last closely follows the coast-line, with bends towards the north in the river
                    valleys (70° N. lat. in Finland, on the Arctic Circle about Archangel, 68“ N.
                    Iat on the Urals, 71“ on West Siberia). The shortness of the summer, the
                    deficiency of drainage, and the thickness of the layer of soil which is frozen
                    through in winter are the elements which go to the making of the characteristic
                    features of the tundras. Their flora is far nearer those of northern Siberia and
                    North America than that of central Europe. Mosses and lichens cover them, as
                    also the birch, the dwarf willow, and a variety of shrubs; but where the soil is
                    drier, and humus has been able to accumulate, a variety of herbaceous flowering
                    plants, some of which arc familiar also in western Europe, make their
                    appearance. Only from 275 to 280 phanerogams are found within this region.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Forest Region</hi> of the Russian botanists occupies the
                    greater part of the country, from the Arctic tundras to the Steppes, and it
                    maintains over this immense surface a remarkable uniformity of character. M.
                    Bcketoff subdivides it into two portions—the forest region proper, and the
                    “Ante-Steppe” ( <hi rend="italic">predstepie)</hi> The northern limit of the
                    Ante-Steppe would be represented by a line drawn from the South Pruth through
                    Zhitomir, Kursk, Tamboff, and Stavropol-on-Volga to the sources of the Ural. But
                    the <hi rend="italic">Winds <hi rend="subscript">l</hi> Moisture,
                    Rainfall.—</hi> The investigation of the cyclones and anticyclones in Russia
                    cannot as yet be regarded as completed. It appears, however, that in January the
                    cyclones mostly cross north-west Russia (north of 55° and west of 40° E. long.),
                    following directions which vary between north-east and south-east. In July they
                    are displaced towards the north, and cross the Gulf of Bothnia, while another
                    series of cyclones crosses middle Russia, between 50“ and 55° N. lat. The laws
                    of the anticyclones are not yet established. The winds closely depend on the
                    routes followed by both. Generally, however, it may be said that alike in
                    January and in July west and south-west winds prevail in western Russia, while
                    eastern ones are most common in south-eastern Russia; northern winds are most
                    common on the Black Sea coast. The strength of the wind is greater, on the
                    whole, than in the continental parts of western Europe, and it attains its
                    maximum in winter. Terrible gales blow from October to March, especially on the
                    southern steppes and on the tundras. Gales with snow ( <hi rend="italic">burans,
                    myatels),</hi> lasting from two to three days, or northerly gaies without snow,
                    are especially dangerous to man and beast. The average relative moisture reaches
                    80 to 85 per cent. in the north, and only 70 to 81 per cent. in southern and
                    eastern Russia. In the steppes it is only 60 per cent. during summer, and still
                    less (57) at Astrakhan. The average amount of cloud reaches 73 to 75 per cent.
                    on the AVhite Sea and in Lithuania, 68 to 64 in central Russia, and only 59 to
                    53 in the south and south-east. The amount of rainfall is shown in the subjoined

                <p>forest region proper itself presents a certain variety of aspect in its northern
                    and southern parts, and must in turn be again subdivided into two parts—the
                    coniferous region and that of the oak forests,—these being separated by a line
                    drawn through Pskoff, Kostroma, Kazaft, and Ufa. Of course, the oak occurs
                    farther north than this, and conifer forests extend farther south, advancing
                    even to the border-region of the Steppes; but this line must still be considered
                    as important. To the north of it we have dense forests, covering very largo
                    areas, and interrupted offener by marshes than by meadows or cultivated fields.
                    A'ast and impenetrable forests, unpassable marshes and thickets, frequent lakes,
                    swampy meadows, with cleared and dry spaces here and there occupied by villages,
                    are the leading features of the region. Fishing and. hunting are the important
                    sources of livelihood. The characteristics of what may be described as the oak
                    region, which comprises all central Russia, are totally different. The surface
                    is undulatory; marshy meadow lands no longer exist on the flat watersheds, and
                    only a few shelter themselves in the much deeper and broader river valleys.
                    Forests are still numerous where not destroyed by man, but their character has
                    changed. Conifers are rare, and the Scotch pine, which covers the sandy plains,
                    has taken the place of the <hi rend="italic">Abies</hi>; birch, oak, and other
                    deciduous trees <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit21newyrich/page/n92/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0921-0092-0077"/>compose the forests, the soil of which is dry, and
                    the extension of which is interrupted by green prairies. Viewed from a rising
                    ground, the landscape presents a pleasing variety of corn-field and forest,
                    while the horizon is broken by the bell-towers of numerous villages along the
                    banks of the streams.</p>
                <p>Viewed as a whole, the flora of the forest region must be regarded as
                    European-Siberian; and, though certain Species disappear towards the east, while
                    new ones make their appearance, it maintains, on the whole, the same characters
                    throughout from Poland to Kamchatka. Thus the beech <hi rend="italic">(Fagus
                    Sylvatica),</hi> a characteristic tree of western Europe, is unable to face the
                    continental climate of Russia, and does not penetrate beyond Poland and the
                    southwestern provinces, reappearing again in the Crimea. The silver fir <hi
                    rend="italic">(pichta)</hi> does not extend over Russia, and the oak does not
                    cross the Urals. On the other hand, several Asiatic species (Siberian pine,
                    larch, cedar) grow freely in the north-east, while several shrubs and herbaceous
                    plants, originally from the Asiatic steppes, have spread into the south-east.
                    But all these do not greatly alter the general characters of the vegetation. The
                    coniferous forests of the north contain, besides conifers, the birch <hi
                    rend="italic">(Betula alba, B. pub-escens, B. fruticosa,</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">B. verrucosa,</hi> which extend from the Petchora to the
                    Caucasus), the aspen, two species of alder, the mountain-ash <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Sorbus aucuparia),</hi> the wild cherry-tree, and three species of willow.
                    South of 62° - 64° north latitude appears the lime-tree, which multiplies
                    rapidly and, notwithstanding the rapidity with which it is being exterminated,
                    constitutes entire forests in the east (central Volga, Ufa). Farther south the
                    ash <hi rend="italic">(Fraxinus excelsior}</hi> and the oak make their
                    appearance, the latter <hi rend="italic">( Quercus pedunculata)</hi> reaching in
                    isolated groups and trees as far as to St Petersburg and South Finland (Q. <hi
                    rend="italic">Robur</hi> appears only in the south-west). The hornbeam is
                    prevalent in the Ukraine, and the maple begins to appear in the south part of
                    the coniferous region. In the forest region no fewer than 772 flowering species
                    are found, of which 568 dicotyledons occur in the Archangel government (only 436
                    to the east of the White Sea, which is a botanical limit for many species). In
                    central Russia the species become still more numerous, and, though the local
                    floras cannot yet be considered complete, they number from 850 to 1050 species
                    in the separate governments, and about 1600 in the best explored parts of the
                    south-west. Corn is cultivated throughout this region. Its northern limits—which
                    are sure to advance still farther as the population increases—almost reach the
                    Arctic coast at the Varanger Fiord; farther east they hardly extend to the north
                    of Archangel, and the limit is still lower towards the Urals. The northern
                    frontier of rye closely corresponds to that of barley. Wheat is cultivated in
                    South Finland, but in western Russia it hardly passes 58° K. lat. Its true
                    domains are the oak region and the Steppes. Fruit-trees are cultivated as far as
                    62° N. in Finland, and as far as 58° in the east. Apricots and walnuts flourish
                    at Warsaw, but in Russia they do not extend beyond 50°. Apples, pears, and
                    cherries are grown throughout the oak region.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Region of the Steppes,</hi> which covers all southern
                    Russia, may be subdivided into two zones—an intermediate zone and that of the
                    Steppes proper. The Ante-Steppe of the preceding region and the intermediate
                    zone of the Steppes include those tracts where the West-European climate
                    struggles with the Asiatic, and where a struggle is being carried on between the
                    forest and the Steppe. It is comprised between the summer isotherms of 59° and
                    63°, being bounded on the south by a line which runs through Ekaterinoslaff and
                    Lugan. South of this line begin the Steppes proper, which extend to the sea and
                    penetrate to the foot of Mount Caucasus.</p>
                <p>The Steppes proper are very fertile elevated plains, slightly undulated, and
                    intersected by numerous ravines which are dry in summer. The undulations are
                    scarcely apparent to the eye as it takes in a wide prospect under a blazing sun
                    and with a deep-blue sky overhead. Not a tree is to be seen, the few woods and
                    thickets being hidden in the depressions and deep valleys of the rivers. On the
                    thick sheet of black earth by which the Steppe is covered a luxuriant vegetation
                    develops in spring; after the old grass has been burned a bright green covers
                    immense stretches, but this rapidly disappears under the burning rays of the sun
                    and the hot easterly winds. The colouring of the Steppe changes as if by magic,
                    and only the silvery plumes of the <hi rend="italic">kovyl (Stipa pennata)</hi>
                    wave under the wind, giving the Steppe the aspect of a bright yellow sea. For
                    days together the traveller sees no other vegetation; even this, however,
                    disappears as he nears the regions recently left dry from the Caspian, where
                    salted clays covered with a few <hi rend="italic">Salsolaeeae,</hi> or mere
                    sands, take the place of the black-earth. Here begins the Aral-Caspian desert.
                    The Steppe, however, is not so devoid of trees as at first sight appears.
                    Innumerable clusters of wild cherries <hi rend="italic">(Prunus
                    Chamaecerasus),</hi> wild apricots <hi rend="italic">(Amygdalus nana},
                    tchilizhnik (Caragana frutescens},</hi> and other deep-rooted shrubs grow in the
                    depressions of the surface and on the slopes of the ravines, giving the Steppe
                    that charm which manifests itself in the popular poetry. Unfortunately the
                    spread of cultivation is fatal to these oases (they are often called “islands”
                    by the inhabitants); the axe and the plough ruthlessly destroy them.</p>
                <p>The vegetation of the <hi rend="italic">poimy</hi> and z <hi rend="italic"
                    >aimischas</hi> in the marshy bottoms of the ravines, and in the valleys of
                    streams and rivers, is totally different. The moist soil gives free development
                    to thickets of various willows <hi rend="italic">(Salieineae),</hi> bordered
                    with dense walls of worm-wood and needle-bearing <hi rend="italic"
                    >Composita,</hi> and interspersed with rich but not extensive prairies
                    harbouring a great variety of herbaceous plants; while in the deltas of the
                    Black Sea rivers impenetrable masses of rush <hi rend="italic">(Arundx
                    Phragmites)</hi> shelter a forest fauna. But cultivation rapidly changes the
                    physiognomy of the Steppe. The prairies are superseded by wheat-fields, and
                    flocks of sheep destroy the true steppe-grass <hi rend="italic">(Stipa
                    pennata),</hi> which retires farther east.</p>
                <p>A great many species unknown in the forest region make their appearance in the
                    Steppes. The Scotch pine still covers sandy spaces, and maple <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Acer tatariea</hi> and <hi rend="italic">A. campestre),</hi> the hornbeam, and
                    the white and black poplar become quite common. The number of species of
                    herbaceous plants rapidly increases, while beyond the Volga a variety of Asiatic
                    species join the West-European flora.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Circum-Mediterranean Region</hi> is represented by a narrow
                    strip of land on the south coast of the Crimea, where a climate similar to that
                    of the Mediterranean coast has permitted the development of a flora closely
                    resembling that of the valley of the Arno. Of course, human cultivation has not
                    yet acclimatized there the same variety of plants as that imported into Italy
                    since the Romans. It has even destroyed the rich forests which sixty years ago
                    made deer-hunting possible at Khersones. The olive and the chestnut are rare;
                    but the beach reappears, and the <hi rend="italic">Rinus Pinaster</hi> recalls
                    the Italian pines. At a few points, such as the Nikitsky garden and Alupka,
                    where plants have been acclimatized by human agency, the Californian <hi
                    rend="italic">Wellingtonia,</hi> the Lebanon cedar, many evergreen trees, the
                    laurel, the cypress, and even the Anatolian palm <hi rend="italic">(Chamaerops
                    excelsa)</hi> flourish. The grass vegetation is very rich, and, according to
                    lists still incomplete, no fewer than 1654 flowering plants are known. On the
                    whole, the Crimean flora has little in common with that of the Caucasus, where
                    only 244 Crimean species have as yet been found. <note anchored="true"

                <p>The fauna of European Russia does not very materially differ from that of western
                    Europe. In the forests not many animals which have disappeared from western
                    Europe have held their ground; while in the Urals only a few—now Siberian, but
                    formerly also European—are met with. On the whole, Russia belongs to the same
                    zoo-geographical region as central Europe and northern Asia, the same fauna
                    extending in Siberia as far as the Yenisei and Lena. In south-eastern Russia,
                    however, towards the Caspian, we find a notable admixture of Asiatic species,
                    the deserts of that part of Russia belonging in reality rather to the
                    Aral-Caspian depression than to Europe.</p>
                <p>For the zoo-geographer only three separate sub-regions appear on the
                    East-European plains—the tundras, including the Arctic islands, the forest
                    region, especially the coniferous part of it, and the Ante-Steppe and Steppes of
                    the black-earth region. The Ural mountains might be distinguished as a fourth
                    sub-region, while the south coast of the Crimea and Caucasus, as well as the
                    Caspian deserts, have their own individuality.</p>
                <p>As for the adjoining seas, the fauna of the Arctic Ocean off the Norwegian coast
                    corresponds, in its western parts at least, to that of the North Atlantic Gulf
                    Stream. The White Sea and the Arctic Ocean to the east of Svyatoi Nos belong to
                    a separate zoological region connected with, and hardly separable from, that
                    part of the Arctic Ocean which extends along the Siberian coast as far as to
                    about the Lena. The Black Sea, of which the fauna was formerly little known but
                    now appears to be very rich, belongs to the Mediterranean region, slightly
                    modified, while the Caspian partakes of the characteristic fauna inhabiting the
                    lakes and seas of the Aral-Caspian depression.</p>
                <p>In the region of the tundras life has to contend with such unfavourable
                    conditions that it cannot be abundant. Still, the reindeer frequents it for its
                    lichens, and on the drier slopes of the moraine deposits four species of
                    lemming, hunted by the <hi rend="italic">Canis lagοpus,</hi> find quarters. Two
                    species of the white partridge <hi rend="italic">(Lagopus albus, L.
                    alpinus),</hi> the lark, one <hi rend="italic">Plectrophanes,</hi> two or three
                    species of <hi rend="italic">Sylvia,</hi> one <hi rend="italic"
                    >Phylloscopus,</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">Motacilla</hi> must be added.
                    Numberless aquatic birds, however, visit it for breeding purposes. Ducks,
                    divers, geese, gulls, all the Russian species of snipes and sandpipers <hi
                    rend="italic">(Limicula, Tringa),</hi> &amp;c., cover the marshes of the
                    tundras, or the crags of the Lapiand coast.</p>
                <p>The forest region, and especially its coniferous portion, though it has lost some
                    of its representatives within historic times, is still rich. The reindeer,
                    rapidly disappearing, is now met with only in Olonetz and Vologda; the <hi
                    rend="italic">Cervus pygargus</hi> is found everywhere, and reaches Novgorod.

                    are rapidly disappearing. The wild boar is confined to the basin of the Diina,
                    and the <hi rend="italic">Bison europea</hi> to the Bielovyezha forests. The
                    sable has quite disappeared, being found only on the Urals; the beaver is found
                    at a few places in Minsk, and the otter is very rare. On the other hand, the
                    hare <hi rend="italic">(rοussαk),</hi> and also the grey partridge <hi
                    rend="italic">(Perdix cinerea),</hi> the hedgehog, the quail, the lark, the rook
                    ( <hi rend="italic">Trypanocorax frugilega),</hi> and the stork find their way
                    into the coniferous region as the forests are cleared (Bogdanoff). The avifauna
                    of this region is very rich; it includes all the forest and garden birds which
                    are known in western Europe, as well as a very great variety of aquatic birds. A
                    list, still incomplete, of the birds of St Petersburg shows 251 species. Hunting
                    and shooting give occupation to a great number of persons. The reptiles are few.
                    As for fishes, all those of western Europe, except the carp, are met with in the
                    lakes and rivers in immense quantities, the characteristic feature of tho region
                    being its wealth in <hi rend="italic">Coregoni</hi> and in <hi rend="italic"
                    >Salmonidae</hi> generally.</p>
                <p>In the Ante-Steppe the forest species proper, such as <hi rend="italic">Pteromys
                    Volans</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Tamias Striatus,</hi> disappear, but the
                    common squirrel <hi rend="italic">(Sciurus vulgaris),</hi> the weasel, and the
                    bear are still met with in the forests. The hare is increasing rapidly, as well
                    as the fox. The avifauna, of course, becomes poorer; nevertheless the woods of
                    the Steppe, and still more the forests of the Ante-Steppe, give refuge to many
                    birds, even to the hazel-hen ( <hi rend="italic">Tetrao bonasia),</hi> the
                    woodcock, and the black grouse <hi rend="italic">(Tetrao tetrix, T.

                    decidedly rich, and includes aquatic birds. The destruction of the forests and
                    the advance of wheat into the prairies are rapidly impoverishing the Steppe
                    fauna. The various species of rapacious animals are disappearing, together with
                    the colonies of marmots; the insectivores are also becoming scarce in
                    consequence of the destruction of insects, while vermin, such as the suslik <hi
                    rend="italic">(Spermo-philus,</hi> see Marmot), become a real plague, as also
                    the destructive insects which have been a scourge to agriculture during recent
                    years. <note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi

                <p>Prehistoric anthropology is a science of very recent growth in Russia; and,
                    notwithstanding the energy displayed within that field during the last twenty
                    years, the task of reconstructing the early history of man on the plains of
                    eastern Europe is daily becoming more complicated as new data are brought to
                    light. Remains of Palaeolitlhic man, contemporary with the large Quaternary
                    mammals, are few in Russia; they are known only in Poland, Pottava, and
                    Voronezh, and perhaps also on the Oka. Those of the later portions of the
                    Lacustrine period, on the contrary, are so numerous that scarcely one old
                    lacustrine basin in the regions of the Oka, the Kama, the Dnieper, not to speak
                    of the lake-region itself, and even the White Sea coasts, can be mentioned where
                    remains of Neolithic man have not been discovered, showing an unexpected variety
                    of minor anthropological features, even at that remote period. The Russian
                    plains have been, however, the scene of so many migrations of various races of
                    mankind, the dwelling-places of prehistoric man and the routes followed during
                    his migrations were so clearly indicated by natural conditions, and so often
                    reoccupied, or again covered by new waves of colonization and migration, that at
                    many places a series of deposits belonging to widely distant epochs are found
                    superposed. Settlements belonging to the Stone age, and manufactories of stone
                    implements, burial grounds <hi rend="italic">(kostishehas)</hi> of the Bronze
                    epoch, earthen forts <hi rend="italic">(gorodishchαs),</hi> and grave mounds <hi
                    rend="italic">(kurgans)-</hi> of which last four different types are known, the
                    earliest belonging to the Bronze period—are superposed upon and obliterate one
                    another, so that a long series of researches is necessary in order that sound
                    generalizations may be reached.</p>
                <p>Two different races—a brachycephalic and a dolichocephalic—can be distinguished
                    among tho remains of the earlier Stone period (Lacustrine period) as having
                    inhabited the plains of eastern Europe. But they are separated by so many
                    generations from the earliest historic times that sure conclusions regarding
                    them are impossible; at all events, as yet Russian archaeologists are not agreed
                    as to whether the ancestors of the Slavonians were Sarmatians only or Scythians
                    also (Samokvasoff, Lemiere), whose skulls have nothing in common with those of
                    the Mongolian race. The earliest points that can, comparatively speaking, be
                    regarded as settled must thus be taken from the 1st century, when the Northern
                    Finns migrated from the North Dwina region towards the west, and the Sarmatians
                    were compelled to leave the region of the Don, and to cross the Russian steppes
                    from east to west, under the pressure of the Aorzes (the Mordvinian Erzya ?) and
                    Siraks, who in their turn were soon followed by the Huns aud the Ugur-Turkish
                    stem of Avars.</p>
                <p>It appears certain, moreover, that in the 7th century southern Russia was
                    occupied by the empire of the Khazars <hi rend="italic">(q.v.),</hi> who drove
                    the Bulgarians, descendants of the Huns, from tho Don, one section of them
                    migrating up the Volga to found there the Bulgarian empire, and the remainder
                    migrating towards the Danube. This migration compelled the Northern Finns to
                    advance farther west, and a mixture of Tavasts and Karelians penetrated to the
                    south of the Gulf of Finland.</p>
                <p>Finally, it is certain that as early as the 8th century, and probably still
                    earlier, a stream of Slavonian colonization, advancing eastward from the Danube,
                    was thrown on the plains of southwestern Russia. It is also most probable that
                    another similar stream—the northern, coming from the Elbe, through the basin of
                    the Vistula—ought to be distinguished. In the 9th century the Slavonians already
                    occupied the Upper Vistula, the southern part of the lake region, and the
                    central plateau in its western parts. They had Lithuanians to the west; various
                    Finnish stems, mixed towards the south-east with Turkish stems (the present
                    Bashkirs); the Bulgars, whose origin still remains doubtful, on the middle Volga
                    and Kama; and to the south-east the Turkish-Mongolian world of the Petchenegs,
                    Potovtsi, Uzes, &amp;c.; while in the south, along the Black Sea, extended the
                    empire of the Khazars, who kept under their rule several Slavonian steins, and
                    perhaps also some of Finnish origin. In the 9th century also the Ugrians are
                    supposed to have left their Ural abodes and to have crossed south-eastern and
                    southern Russia on their way to the basin of the Danube.</p>
                <p>If these numerous migrations on the plains of Russia be taken into account, and
                    if we add to them the Mongolian invasion, tho migration of South Slavonians
                    towards the Oka, tho North Slavonian colonization extending north-east towards
                    tho Urals and thence to Siberia, the slow advance of Slavonians into Finnish
                    territory on the Volga, and at a later period their advance into the prairies on
                    the Black Sea, driving back the Turkish stems which occupied them,—if we
                    consider the manifold mutual influences of these three races on one another, we
                    shall be able to form a faint idea of the present population of European
                    Russia.</p>
                <p>If the Slavonians be subdivided into three branches—the western (Poles, Czechs,
                    and Wends), the southern (Serbs, Bulgarians, Croa-tians, &amp;c.), and the
                    eastern (Great, Little, and White Russians), it will be seen that, with the
                    exception of some 3,000,000 Ukrainians or Little Russians, in East Galicia and
                    in Poland, and a few on the south slope of the Carpathians, the whole of tho
                    East Slavonians occupy, as a compact body, western, central, and southern
                    Russia.</p>
                <p>Like other races of mankind, the Russian race is not a pure one. The Russians
                    have taken in and assimilated in the course of their history a variety of
                    Finnish and Turco-Finnish elements. Still, Craniological researches show' that,
                    notwithstanding this fact, the Slavonian type has maintained itself with
                    remarkable persistency— Slavonian skulls ten and thirteen centuries old
                    exhibiting the same anthropological features as are seen in those of our own
                    day. This may be explained by a variety of causes, of which the chief is the
                    maintenance by the Slavonians down to a very late period of gentile organization
                    and gentile marriages, a fact vouched for, not only in the pages of Nestor, but
                    still more by deep traces still visible in tho face of society, the <hi
                    rend="italic">gens</hi> later on passing into the village community, and the
                    colonization being carried on by great compact bodies. This has all along
                    maintained the same characters. The Russians do not emigrate as isolated
                    individuals; they migrate in whole villages. The overwhelming numbers of the
                    Slavonians, and the very great differences in ethnical type, belief, mythology,
                    between the Aryans and Turanians, may have contributed in the same direction,
                    and throughout the written history of the Slavonians we see that, while a
                    Russian man, far away from his home among Siberians, readily marries a native,
                    the Russian woman seldom does the like. All these causes, and especially the
                    first-mentioned, have enabled the Slavonians to maintain their ethnical features
                    in a <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit21newyrich/page/n94/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0921-0094-0079"/>relatively high degree of purity, so as to
                    assimilate foreign elements and make them reinforce or improve the ethnical
                    type, without giving rise to half-breed races. The maintenance of the very same
                    North-Russian type from Novgorod to the Pacific, with but minor differentiations
                    on the outskirts—and this notwithstanding the great variety of races with which
                    the Russians came in contact— cannot but strike the observer. But a closer
                    observation of what is going on even now on the recently colonized confines of
                    the empire —where whole villages live, and will continue to live, without mixing
                    with natives, but very slowly bringing them over to the Russian manner of life,
                    and then very slowly taking in a few female elements from them—gives the key to
                    this prominent feature of Russian life, which is a colonization on an immense
                    scale, and assimilation of foreigners, without in turn losing the primary
                    ethnical features.</p>
                <p>Not so with the national customs. There are features—the wooden house, the oven,
                    the bath—which the Russian never abandons though lost amidst alien populations.
                    But when settled among these the Russian—the North-Russian—readily adapts
                    himself to many other differences. He speaks Finnish with Finns, Mongolian with
                    Buriats, Ostiak with Ostiaks; he shows remarkable facility in adapting his
                    agricultural practices to new conditions, without, however, abandoning the
                    village community; he becomes hunter, cattle-breeder, or fisherman, and carries
                    on these occupations according to local usage; he modifies his dress and adapts
                    his religious beliefs to the locality he inhabits. In consequence of all this,
                    the Russian peasant (not, be it noted, the trader) must be recognized as the
                    best colonizer among the Aryans; he lives on the best terms with Ostiaks,
                    Tartars, Buriats, and even with Red Indians when lost in the prairies of the
                    American Far-West.</p>
                <p>Three different branches, which may become three separate nationalities, can be
                    distinguished among the Russians since the dawn of their history :—the Great
                    Russians, the Little Russians (Malorusses or Ukrainians), and the White Russians
                    (the Biélorusses). These correspond to the two currents of immigration mentioned
                    above, the northern and southern, with perhaps an intermediate one, the proper
                    place of the White Russians not having as yet been exactly determined. The
                    primary distinctions between these branches have been increased during the last
                    nine centuries by their contact with different nationalities,—the Great Russians
                    taking in Finnish elements, the Little Russians undergoing an admixture of
                    Turkish blood, and the White Russians submitting to Lithuanian influence.
                    Moreover, notwithstanding the unity of language, it is easy to detect among the
                    Great Russians themselves two separate branches, differing from one another by
                    slight divergences Of language and type and deep diversities of national
                    character,— the Central Russians and the Novgorodians; the latter extend
                    throughout northern Russia into Siberia. They correspond, perhaps, to
                    subdivisions mentioned by Nestor. It is worthy of notice, moreover, that many
                    minor anthropological features can be distinguished both among the Great and
                    Little Russians, depending probably on the assimilation of various minor
                    subdivisions of the Ural-Altaians.</p>
                <p>The Great Russians number about 42,000,000, and occupy in one block the space
                    enclosed by a line drawn from the White Sea to the sources of the western Düna,
                    the Dneiper, and the Donetz, and thence, through the mouth of the Sura, by the
                    Vettuga, to Mezen. To the east of this boundary they are mixed with Turco-Finns,
                    but in the Ural Mountains they reappear in a compact body, and extend thence
                    through southern Siberia and along the courses of the Lena and Amur. Great
                    Russian nonconformists are disseminated among Little Russians in Tchernigoff and
                    Moghileff, and they reappear in greater masses in Novorossia, as also in
                    northern Caucasia.</p>
                <p>The Little Russians, who number about 17,000,000, occupy the Steppes of southern
                    Russia, the south-western slopes of the central plateasu and those of the
                    Carpathian and Lublin mountains, and the Carpathian plateau. The Sitch of the
                    Zaporog Cossacks colonized the Steppes farther east, towards the Don, where they
                    met with a large population of Great Russian runaways, constituting the present
                    Don Cossacks. The Zaporog Cossacks, sent by Catherine II. to colonize the east
                    coast of the Sea of Azoff, constituted there the Black Sea and later the Kuban
                    Cossacks (part of whom, the Nekrasovtsy, migrated to Turkey). They have also
                    peopled large parts of Stavropol and northern Caucasia.</p>
                <p>The White Russians, mixed to some extent with Great and Little Russians, Poles,
                    and Lithuanians, now occupy the upper parts of the western slope of the central
                    plateau. They number about 4,300,000.</p>
                <p>The Finnish stems, which in prehistoric times extended from the Obi all over
                    northern Russia, even then were subdivided into Ugrians, Permians, Bulgarians,
                    and Finns proper, who drove back the previous Lapp population from what is now
                    Finland, and about the 7th century penetrated to the south of the Gulf of
                    Finland, in the region of the Lives and Kurs, where they mixed to some extent
                    with Lithuanians and Letts.</p>
                <p>At present the stems of Finnish origin are represented in Russia by the
                    following:—(α) the Western Finns; the Tavasts in central Finland; the Kvanes, in
                    north-western Finland; the Karelians, in the east, who also occupy the
                    lake-regions of Olonetz and Archangel, and have settlements in separate villages
                    in Novgorod and Tveι ’; the Izhora and Vod, which are local names for the Finns
                    on the Neva and the south-eastern coast of the Gulf of Finland; the Esthes in
                    Esthonia and northern portion of Livonia; the Lives on the Gulf of Riga; and the
                    Kors, mixed with the Letts; (δ) the Northern Finns, or Lapps, in northern
                    Finland and on the Kola peninsula, and the Samoyedes in Archangel; (c) the Volga
                    Finns, or rather the old Bulgarian branch, to which belong the Mordvinians (g ’
                    .r.) and perhaps the Tcheremisses in Kazan, Kostroma, and Vyatka, who are also
                    classified by some authors with the following; ( <hi rend="italic">d)</hi> the
                    Permians, or Cis-Uralian Finns, including the Votiaks on the east of Vyatka, the
                    Permians in Perm, the Zyrians in Vologda, Archangel, Vyatka, and Perm, and the
                    Tcheremisses; (c) the Ugrians, or Trans-Uralian Finns, including the Voguls on
                    both slopes of the Urals, the Ostiaks in Tobolsk and partly in Tomsk, and the
                    Madjares, or Ugrians.</p>
                <p>The Turco-Tartars in European Russia number about 3,600,000. The following are
                    their chief subdivisions. (1) The Tartars, of whom three different stems must be
                    distinguished :—(α) the Kazan Tartars on both banks of the Volga, below the
                    mouth of the Oka, and on the lower Kama, penetrating also farther south in
                    Ryazan, Tamboff, Samara, Simbirsk, and Penza; (δ) the Tartars of Astrakhan at
                    the mouth of the Volga; and (c) those of the Crimea, a great many of whom have
                    recently emigrated to Turkey. There are, besides, a certain number of Tartars
                    from the south-east in Minsk, Grodno, and Vilna. (2) The Bashkirs, who inhabit
                    the slopes of the southern Urals, that is, the Steppes of Ufa and Orenburg,
                    extending also into Perm and Samara. (3) The Tchuvashes, on the right bank of
                    the Volga, in Kazan and Simbirsk. (4) The Mescheriaks, a tribe of Finnish origin
                    which formerly inhabited the basin of the Oka, and, driven thence during the
                    15th century by the Russian colonizers, immigrated into Ufa and Perm, where they
                    now live among Bashkirs, having adopted their religion and customs. (5) The
                    Tepters, also of Finnish origin, settled among Tartars and Bashkirs, together
                    with the Mescheriaks, also in Samara and Vyatka. They have adopted the religion
                    and customs of the Bashkirs, from whom they can hardly be distinguished. The
                    Bashkirs, Mescheriaks, and Tepters have rendered able service to the Russian
                    Government against the Kirghizes, and until 1863 they constituted a separate
                    Bashkir and Mescheriak Cossacks army, employed for service in the Kirghiz
                    Steppe. (6) The Kirghizes, whose true abodes were in Asia, in the Ishim and
                    Kirghiz Steppe; but one section of them crossed the Urals and occupied the
                    Steppes between the Urals and the Volga. Only the Horde of Bukeeff inhabits
                    European Russia, north-east of Astrakhan, the remainder belonging to Turkestan
                    and Siberia.</p>
                <p>The Mongolian race is represented in Russia by the Lamaite Kalmuks, who inhabit
                    the Steppes of Astrakhan betw <hi rend="superscript">τ</hi> een the Volga, the
                    Don, and the Kuma. They immigrated to the mouth of the Volga from Dzungaria, in
                    the 17th century, driving out the Tartars and Nogais, and after many wars with
                    the Don Cossacks, followed by treaties of mutual assistance for military
                    excursions, one part of them was taken in by the Don Cossacks, so that even now
                    there are among these Cossacks several Kalmuk <hi rend="italic">sotnias</hi> or
                    squadrons. They live for the most part in tents, supporting themselves by
                    cattle-breeding, and partly by agriculture.</p>
                <p>The Semitic race is represented in Russia by upwards of 3,000,000 Jews and 3000
                    Karaites. The Jews first entered Poland from Germany during the crusades, and
                    soon spread through Lithuania, Courland, the Ukraine, and, in the 18th century,
                    Bessarabia. The rapidity with which they peopled certain towns and whole
                    provinces was really prodigious. Thus, from having been but a few dozens at
                    Odessa some eighty years since, they make now one-third of its population
                    (73,400, out of 207,000). The law of Russia prohibits them from entering Great
                    Russia, only the wealthiest and most educated enjoying this privilege;
                    nevertheless they are met with everywhere, even on the Urals. Their chief
                    abodes, however, continue to be Poland, the western provinces of Lithuania,
                    White and Little Russia, and Bessarabia. In Russian Poland they are in the
                    proportion of 1 to 7 inhabitants. In Kovno, Vilna, Moghileff, Grodno, Volhynia,
                    Podolia, and probably also in Bessarabia and Kherson, they constitute, on the
                    average, 10 to 16 per cent. of the population, while in separate districts the
                    proportion reaches 30 to 36 per cent. (50 <hi rend="italic">'5</hi> in
                    Tchaussy). Organized as they are into a kind of community for mutual protection
                    and mutual help (the Kahal), they soon become masters of the trade wherever they
                    penetrate. In the villages they are mostly innkeepers, intermediaries in trade,
                    and pawnbrokers. In many tow ’ ns most of the skilled labourers and a great many
                    of the unskilled (for instance, the grain-porters at Odessa and elsewhere) are
                    Jews. In the 16 western provinces of Russia they numbered 2,843,400 in 1883, and
                    about 432,000 in five Polish provinces. Less than 600,000 of them inhabit
                    villages, the remainder being concentrated in towns.</p>
                <p>The Karaites differ entirely from the Jews both in worship and in mode of life.
                    They, too, are inclined to trade, but also success <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0921-0095-0080"/>fully carry on agriculture. Those inhabiting the
                    Crimea sneak Tartar, and the few who are settled in western Russia speak Polish.
                    They are on good terms with the Russians.</p>
                <p>Of West Europeans, only the Germans attain considerable numbers (upwards of a
                    million) in European Russia. In the Baltic provinces they constitute the
                    ennobled landlord class, and that of tradesmen and artisans in towns.
                    Considerable numbers of Germans, also tradesmen and artisans, were scattered
                    throughout many of the larger towns of Russia as early as the 16th century, and
                    to a much greater extent in the 18th century, German artisans having been
                    invited by the Government to settle in Russia, and their numbers having steadily
                    increased since. Finally, numbers of Germans were invited in 1762 to settle in
                    southern Russia, as separate agricultural colonies, which gradually extended in
                    the Don region and in northern Caucasia. Protected as they were by the right of
                    self-government, exempted from military service, and endowed with considerable
                    allotments of good land, these colonies are much wealthier than the neighbouring
                    Russian peasants, from whom they have adopted the slowly modified village
                    community. They are chiefly Lutherans, but many of them belong to other
                    religious sects,—Anabaptists, Moravians, Mennonites (about 40,000). In certain
                    districts (Akkerman, Odessa, Berdiansk, Kamyshin, Novouzensk) they constitute
                    from 10 to 40 per cent. of the total population. The Swedes, who number about
                    300,000 in Finland, hardly reach 12,000 in European Russia, mostly in the Baltic
                    provinces.</p>
                <p>The Roumanians (Moldavians) number not less than 800,000, and are still
                    increasing. They inhabit the governments of Bessarabia, Podolia, Kherson, and
                    Ekaterinoslaff. In Bessarabia they constitute from one-fourth to three-fourths
                    of the population of certain districts. On the whole, the Novorossian
                    governments (Bessarabia, Kherson, Ekatcrinoslaff, and Taurida) exhibit the
                    greatest variety of population. Little and Great Russians, Roumanians,
                    Bulgarians, Serbs, Germans, Greeks, Frenchmen, Poles, Tartars, and Jews are
                    mixed together and scattered about in small colonies, especially in Bessarabia.
                    Of course, the Greeks inhabit chiefly the towns, where they carry on trade, as
                    also do the Armenians, scattered through the towns of southern Russia, and
                    appearing in larger numbers only in the district of Rostoff (10 per cent. of
                    population).</p>
                <p>However great the variety of nationalities inhabiting European Russia, its
                    ethnological composition is much simpler than might at first sight be supposed.
                    The Russians—Great, Little, and White —largely prevail over all others, both
                    numerically and as respects the territories they occupy in compact bodies.
                    Central Russia is almost purely Great Russian, and represents a compact body of
                    more than 30,000,000 inhabitants with but 1 to 5 per cent. of admixture of other
                    nationalities. The governments on the Dnieper (Kieff, Volhynia, Tchernigoff,
                    Podolia, and Pottava), as also the adjoining districts of Kharkoff, Voronezh,
                    Kursk, and Don, are Little-Russian, or Ukrainian, with but a slight admixture of
                    White and Great Russians, and some 12 per cent. of Jews. The Poles there number
                    only 3 to 6 per cent. of the population—chiefly landholders—and are hated by the
                    Ukrainians.</p>
                <p>Moghileff, Vitebsk, and Minsk are White Russian, the Poles constituting only 3
                    per cent, of the population (16 in Minsk). In other Bielorussian provinces, the
                    White Russians are mixed either with Lithuanians (Vilna), or Ukrainians
                    (Grodno), or Great Russians (Smolensk), and their relations to Polish landlords
                    are no better than in the Ukraine. The Lithuanians prevail in Kovno, where they
                    are 80 per cent, of the population, the remainder being chiefly Jews(10 per
                    cent.), Poles (3 per cent.), Great Russians (3 per cent.), Germans, &amp;c.</p>
                <p>In the Baltic provinces (Esthonia, Livonia, and Courland) the prevailing
                    population is Esthonian, Curonian, or Lettish, the Germans (landlords, or
                    tradesmen and artisans in towns) being respectively only 3 ’ 5, 6 <hi
                    rend="superscript">-</hi> 8, and 7'6 per cent, of the population. In the three
                    provinces, Riga included, they hardly reach 120,000 out of 1,800,000
                    inhabitants. The relations of the Esthes and Letts to their landlords are
                    anything but friendly.</p>
                <p>The northern governments of St Petersburg (apart from the capital), Olonetz, and
                    Archangel contain an admixture of 12 to 28 percent, of Karelians, Samoyedes, and
                    Zyrians, the remainder being Great Russians. In the east and south-east
                    provinces of the Volga (Nijni, Simbirsk, Samara, Penza, and Saratoff) the Great
                    Russians again prevail (88 to 65 per cent. ), the remainder being chiefly
                    AIordvinians, rapidly Russifying, as also Tartars, Tehuvashes, and Bashkirs,
                    Germans in Samara and Saratoff, and Little Russians in the last-named. Only in
                    Kazain and Astrakhan do the Great Russians number less than one half of the
                    aggregate population (42-43 per cent.). In the Ural provinces of Perm and Vyatka
                    Great Russians are again in the majority (92 and 81 per cent.), the remainder
                    being a variety of Finno-Tartars. It is only in the southern Ural governments
                    (Uralsk, Orenburg, Ufa) that the admixture of a variety of Turco-Tartars—of
                    Kirghizes in Uralsk (23 per cent.), Bashkirs in Orenburg and Ufa (22 and 23 per
                    cent.), and less important stems—becomes considerable, reducing the number of
                    Great Russians respectively to 72, 67, and 32 per cent, of the aggregate
                    population of these three provinces.</p>
                <p>Of the Turco-Tartars of eastern Russia, the Bashkirs often revolted against
                    Russian rule, and the traffic in Bashkir lands, recently carried on by the
                    Orenburg administration, certainly does not tend to reconcile them. The
                    Tcheremisses have often joined the Bashkirs in their revolts, but are rapidly
                    losing their nationality. As regards the other Turco-and Finno-Tartars <hi
                    rend="subscript">1</hi> the Mordvinians really have been assimilated to the
                    Russians; the Moslem Tartars of Kazan lived till recently on excellent terms
                    with their Russian neighbours and would have continued to do so had no attempts
                    been made to interfere with their land-laws.</p>
                <p>In western Russia, while an antipathy exists between Ukrainians and Poles, the
                    Russian Government, by its harassing interference in religious, educational, and
                    economical matters, has become antagonistic, not only to the Poles, but also to
                    the Ukrainians; printing in Ukrainian is prohibited, and “Russification” is
                    being carried on among Ukrainians by the same means as those employed in Poland.
                    The same is true with the Esthes and Letts, whom the Government, while
                    countenancing them to some extent in their antipathy to the German aristocracy,
                    has not yet found means to conciliate.</p>
                <p>The relative strength of the different ethnical elements of which the population
                    of European Russia and Poland is composed may be seen from the following figures
                    (Table IV.). They must be regarded, however, as rough estimates only. They were
                    originally computed by AL Rittich for an aggregate population of 69,788,240, and
                    in the following table they have merely been increased in pro-portion to the
                    actual population of 84,495,000.</p>

                <p>Russia is on the whole a thinly-peopled country, the average - population being
                    but 42 to the square mile. The density of population varies, however, very much
                    in European Russia—from one inhabitant per square mile in the government of
                    Archangel to 102 in that of Moscow (exclusive of the capital) and 138 in
                    Podolia. Two-thirds of the whole population are concentrated upon less than
                    one-third of the whole surface. The most thickly-peopled parts form a strip of
                    territory which extends from Galicia through Kieff to Moscow, and comprises
                    partly the most fertile governments of Russia and partly the manufacturing ones;
                    next come a strip of fertile country to the south of the above and the
                    manufacturing provinces of the upper Volga. The black-earth region has an
                    average of 90 inhabitants per square mile; the central manufacturing region, 85;
                    the western provinces, 79; the black-earth and clay region, 38; the black-earth
                    Steppes, 33; the hilly tracts of the Crimea and Caucasus, 31; the forest-region
                    proper, 26; the Steppes, 9; tħe far north, less than 2.</p>
                <p>The rate at which the population is increasing throughout the empire is very
                    considerable. It varies, however, very much in different parts, and even in
                    European Russia, being almost twice as high in the fertile tracts of the south
                    as it is in the north (1 ’ 8 to PO). The rapid increase is chiefly due to early
                    marriages, the peasants for the most part marrying their sons at eighteen and
                    their daughters at sixteen. The resulting high birth-rate compensates for the
                    great mortality, and the Russian population is increasing more quickly than the
                    Polish, Lithuanian, Finnish, or Tartar. In 1880 the marriages, births, and
                    deaths were returned as follows (Table V.)</p>

                <p>These figures agree pretty nearly with those for a series of years (1871-78),
                    which gave an annual surplus of 945,000 for European Russia alone. In 1882,
                    throughout the empire—leaving out of account Caucasus and Turgai—the births
                    numbered 4,403,555 and the deaths 3,464,404, for an estimated population of
                    95,565,100. But the birth-rate and death-rate were very different in Russia
                    proper and in the Asiatic dominions; in the former they reached respectively 4
                    <hi rend="superscript">-</hi> 8 3 and 3 <hi rend="superscript">-</hi> 77, and in
                    the latter only 3 <hi rend="superscript">-</hi> 75 and 2 <hi rend="superscript"
                    >-</hi> 84. The low birth-rate in Asia counterbalances the low mortality. So
                    also within Russia proper: in the central provinces the high mortality (35 per
                    thousand) is compensated by a high birth-rate (49), while in the western
                    provinces, where the mortality is relatively small (27), the number of births is
                    also the lowest (37).</p>
                <p>On the whole, the mortality in Russia is greater than anywhere else in Europe.
                    The lowest figures are found in Courland (20), the Baltic provinces (22), and
                    Poland (30). Within Russia itself the rate varies between 29 and 49 (30 to 38 in
                    towns). In 1882 the average mortality in the 13 central governments reached the
                    exceptional figure of 62, so that there was a decrease of 1 <hi
                    rend="superscript">-</hi> 7 per cent, in the aggregate population. The mortality
                    is highest among children, only one-half of those born reaching their seventh
                    year. From military registers it appears that of 1000 males born only 480 to 490
                    reach their twenty-first year, and of these only 375 are able-bodied; of the
                    remainder, who are unfit for military service, 50 per cent, suffer from chronic
                    diseases. Misery, insanitary dwellings, and want of food account for this high
                    mortality, which is further increased by the want of medical help, there being
                    in Russia with Poland only 15,348 males and 66 female surgeons, 7679 assistants,
                    and ohe bed in hospital for every 1270 inhabitants. The hospitals are, however
                    so unequally distributed, that in 63 governments having an aggregate country
                    population of about 76,000,000 there were only 657 hospitals with 8273 beds, and
                    an average of two surgeons to 100,000 inhabitants.</p>
                <p>The rate of emigration from the Russian empire is not high. In 1871-80 the
                    average number was 280,700 yearly, and the immigration 245,500. But within the
                    empire itself migration to South Ural, Siberia, and Caucasus goes on
                    extensively; figures, however, even approximate, are wanting. During the ten
                    years 1872-81 no less than 406,180 Germans and 235,600 Austrians immigrated into
                    Russia, chiefly to Poland and the south-western provinces.</p>
                <p>A very great diversity of religions, including (besides numerous varieties of
                    Christianity) Mohammedanism, Shamanism, and Buddhism, are found in European
                    Russia, corresponding for the most part with the separate ethnological
                    subdivisions. All Russians, with the exception of a number of White Russians who
                    belong to the Union, profess the Greek Orthodox faith or one or other of the
                    numberless varieties of nonconformity. The Poles and most of the Lithuanians are
                    Roman Catholics. The Esthes and all other Western Finns, the Germans, and the
                    Swedes are Protestant. The Tartars, the Bashkirs, and Kirghizes are Mohammedans;
                    but the last-named have to a great extent maintained along with Mohammedanism
                    their old Shamanism. The same holds good of the Mescheriaks, both Moslem and
                    Christian. The Mordvinians are nearly all Greek Orthodox, as also are the
                    Votiaks, Voguls, Tcheremisses, and Tchuvashes, but their religions are, in
                    reality, very interesting modifications of Shamanism, under the influence of
                    some Christian and Moslem beliefs. The Voguls, though baptized, are in fact
                    fetichists, as much as the unconverted Samoyedes. Finally, the Kalmucks are
                    Buddhist Lamaites.</p>
                <p>All these religions are met with in close proximity to one another, and their
                    places of worship often stand side by side in the same town or village without
                    giving rise to religious disturbances. The recent outbreaks against the Jews
                    were directed, not against the Talmudist creed, but against the trading and
                    exploiting community of the “Kahal.” In his relations with Moslems, Buddhists,
                    and even fetichists, the Russian peasant looks rather to conduct than to creed,
                    the latter being in his view simply a matter of nationality. Indeed, towards
                    paganism, at least, he is perhaps even more than tolerant, preferring on the
                    whole to keep on good terms with pagan divinities, and in difficult
                    circumstances— especially on travel and in hunting—not failing to present to
                    them his offering. Any idea of proselytism is quite foreign to the ordinary
                    Russian mind, and the outbursts of proselytizing zeal occasionally manifested by
                    the clergy are really due to the desire for “Russification,” and traceable to
                    the influence of the higher clergy and of the Government.</p>
                <p>The various creeds of European Russia were estimated in 1879 as follows :—Greek
                    Orthodox and Raskolniks, 63,835,000 (about 12,000,000 being Raskolniks); United
                    Greeks and Armenio-Gregorians, 55,000; Roman Catholics, 8,300,000; Protestants,
                    2,950,000; Jews, 3,000,000; Moslems, 2,600,000; Pagans, 26,000. In 1881 the
                    number of Greek Orthodox throughout the empire, excluding two foreign
                    bishoprics, was estimated at 61,941,000.</p>
                <p>Nonconformity (Raskoi) is a most important feature of Russian popular life, and
                    its influence and prevalence have rapidly grown during the last twenty-five
                    years.</p>
                <p>When, towards the beginning of the 17th century, the Moscow principality fell
                    under the rule of the Moscow <hi rend="italic">boiars</hi> (one of whom,
                    Godunoff, reached the throne), they took advantage of the power thus acquired to
                    increase their wealth by a series of measures affecting land-holding and trade;
                    they sanctioned and enforced by law the serfdom which had already from
                    economical causes found its way into Russian life. The great outbreak of 1608-12
                    weakened their power in favour of that of the czar, but without breaking it; and
                    throughout the reigns of Michael and Alexis the <hi rend="italic">ukazes</hi>
                    were issued in the name of “the czar and boiars.” Serfdom was reinforced by a
                    series of laws, and the whole of the 17th century is characterized by a rapid
                    accumulation of wealth in the hands of boiars, by the development of luxury,
                    imported from Poland, and by the struggle of a number of families to acquire the
                    political power already enjoyed by their Polish neighbours. The same tendency

                    xml:id="kp-eb0921-0097-0082"/>pervaded the church, which was also accused by the
                    people of having introduced “Polish luxury,” “Polish creed,” and the tendencies
                    towards supremacy of the Polish clergy. The patriarch Nikon was a perfect
                    representative of these tendencies. Opposition resulted, and the revision of the
                    sacred books, which was undertaken by Nikon, gave the opposition acute
                    character. The <hi rend="italic">Raskoi (lit.</hi> “splitting” or “schism ”)
                    made its appearance, and gathered under its banner, not only those who accused
                    Nikon of “Polish” and “Latin” tendencies, but also all those who were for the
                    old customs, for federative and communist principles of social organization, and
                    who revolted against serfdom, centralization, and the suppression of municipal
                    life. A series of insurrections broke out under the banner of the “eight-ends”
                    cross of the <hi rend="italic">Raskolniks.</hi> Barbarous persecutions by
                    Alexis, Peter I., and their followers did not kill out an opposition which
                    inspired with fanatical enthusiasm the best elements among the Great Russians,
                    and induced its supporters to submit to the fire by thousands at a time, while
                    others rather than submit w <hi rend="superscript">τ</hi> ent to colonize the
                    forests of the Arctic littoral, or betook themselves to Siberia. Profound
                    modifications have taken place in Russian nonconformity since its first
                    appearance. It would be impossible to enumerate them all here, but the following
                    points of primary importance must be mentioned. (1) The mere protest against
                    Nikon s “innovations” <hi rend="italic">(novshestvas)</hi> led, in the course of
                    two centuries, to a mere servile adherence to the letter of the vernacular
                    Scriptures—even to obvious errors of earlier translators— and to interminable
                    discussions about minor points of ritual and about unintelligible words. (2)
                    Another current which now pervades the whole of Russian nonconformity is that
                    proceeding from rationalist sects which had already spread in north-west Russia
                    in the 16th century, and even in the 14th. These have given rise to several
                    sects which deny the divinity of Christ or explain away various dogmas and
                    prescriptions of orthodoxy. (3) Protestantism, with its more or less
                    rationalistic tendencies, has made itself increasingly felt, especially during
                    the present century and in southern Russia. (4) Hostile critics of the
                    Government, and especially of the autocracy, with its army of officials and its
                    system of conscriptions, passports, and various restrictions on religious
                    liberty, are found more or less in all the nonconforming bodies, which see in
                    these manifestations of authority the appearance of the Antichrist. Several of
                    them refuse accordingly to have any dealings whatever with the official world.
                    (5) Another tendency pervading the whole of Russian nonconformity is that which
                    seeks a return to what are supposed to have been the old communist principles of
                    Christianity in its earlier days. All new sects start with applying these
                    principles to practical life; but in the course of their development they modify
                    them more or less, though always maintaining the principle at least of mutual
                    help. (6) Finally, all sects deal more or less with the question of marriage and
                    the position of woman. A few of them solve it by encouraging,—at least during
                    their “love-feasts,”—absolutely free relations between all “brethren and
                    sisters,” while others only admit the dissolubility of marriage or prohibit it
                    altogether. On the whole, leaving the extremer views out of account, the
                    position of woman is undoubtedly higher among the dissenters than among the
                    Orthodox.</p>
                <p>These various currents, combining with and counteracting one another in the most
                    complicated ways, have played and continue to play a most important part in
                    Russian history. The mutual assistance found in dissenting sects has preserved
                    many millions of peasants from falling into abject misery, the nonconformists
                    enjoying, as a rule, a greater degree of prosperity than their Orthodox
                    neighbours. The leading feature of Russian history, the spread of the Great
                    Russians over the immense territory they now occupy, cannot be rightly
                    understood without taking into account the colonization of the most inaccessible
                    wildernesses by Raskolniks, and the organization of this by their communities,
                    who send delegates for the choice of land and sometimes clear it in common by
                    the united labours of all the young men and cattle of the community. On the
                    other hand, the nonconforming sects, while helping to preserve several
                    advantageous features of Russian life, have had a powerful influence in
                    maintaining, especially among the “Staroobr-yadtsy,” the old system of the
                    Moscovite family, subject to the despotic yoke of its chief, aud hermetically
                    sealed against instruction.</p>
                <p>It is worthy of notice that since the emancipation of the serfs nonconformity has
                    again made a sudden advance, the more radical sects preponderating over the
                    scholastic ones, and the influence of Protestantism being increasingly felt.
                    Nonconformity, which formerly had no hold upon Little Russia (though it had
                    penetrated among Protestant Esthonians and Letts, and even among Moslem
                    Tartars), has suddenly begun to make progress there in the shape of the
                    “Stunda,” a mixture of Protestant and rationalistic teaching, with tendencies
                    towards a social but rarely socialistic reformation.</p>
                <p>The Russian dissenting sects may be subdivided into (1) the “Popovtsy” (who have
                    priests), (2) the “Bezpopovtsy” (who have none), and (3) numerous spiritualist
                    sects, “Dukhovnyie Khris-tiane.” The Popovtsy (5 to 6 millions) are again
                    subdivided into two classes,—those who recognizo the Austrian hierarchy, and
                    those who have only Orthodox “runaway priests” (“Byeglopopovtsy ”). The latter
                    have recently received unexpected help in the accession of three Orthodox
                    priests of great learning and energy. Moreover, there are among the Popovtsy
                    about a million of “Edinovyertsy,” who have received Orthodox priests on the
                    condition of their keeping to the unrevised books. They are patronized by
                    Government.</p>
                <p>The Bezpopovtsy embody three large sects—the Pomory, Fedoseevtsy, and
                    Filipovtsy—aud a variety of minor ones. They recognize no priests, and repudiate
                    the Orthodox ritual and the sacraments. They avoid all contact with the state,
                    and do not allow prayer for the czar, who is regarded as the Antichrist. They
                    may number about 5,000,000 in west, north, and north-east Russia, and represent,
                    on the whole, an intellectually developed and wealthy population. Of the very
                    numerous smaller sects of Bezpopovtsy, the “Stranniki” (Errants) are worthy of
                    notice. They prefer to lead the life of hunted outcasts rather than hold any
                    relation with the state.</p>
                <p>The spiritualists, very numerous in central and southern Russia, are subdivided
                    into a great variety of schools. The “Khlysty,” who have their “love-feasts,”
                    their “Virgins,” sometimes flagellation, and so on, represent a numerous and
                    strong organization in central Russia. The “Skoptsy” (“Men of God,” “Castrati ”)
                    occur everywhere, even among the Finns, but chiefly in Orel and Kursk, and in
                    towns as money-brokers. The “Dukhobortsy” communities (warriors of the Spirit),
                    chiefly found in the south-east, arc renowned as colonizeι <hi
                    rend="superscript">-</hi> s. They are spreading rapidly in Caucasia and Siberia.
                    The “Molokany” (a kind of Baptists), numbering perhaps about one million, are
                    spread also in the south-east, and are excellent gardeners and tradesmen. Both
                    are quite open to instruction, and have come under the influence of
                    Protestantism, like the “Stunda” in Little Russia and Bessarabia. The
                    “Sabbathers” and the “Ska-kuny” (a kind of Shakers) are also worthy of notice;
                    while a great variety of new sects, such as the “Nemolyaki” (“who do not pray”),
                    the “Vozdykhateli” (“who sigh”), the “Neplatelshchiki” (“who do not pay taxes”),
                    the “Ne-Nashi” (the “Not-ours ”), and so on, spring up every year.</p>
                <p>The aggregate number of Raskolniks is officially stated at nearly one million,
                    but this is quite misleading. The ministry of interior estimated them at
                    9,000,000 in 1850 and 9,500,000 in 1859. In reality the number is still higher.
                    In Perm alone they were recently computed at a million, and there would be no
                    exaggeration in estimating them at a total of from twelve to fifteen
                    millions.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>See Schapoff

                <p>The old subdivisions of the population into orders possessed of unequal rights is
                    still maintained. The great mass of the people, 81·6 per cent., belong to the
                    peasant order, the others being— nobility, 1·3 per cent.; clergy, O·9; the
                    “meschane” or burghers and merchants, 9·3; military, 6·1; foreigners, 0·2;
                    unclassified, O·5. Thus more than 63 millions of the Russians are peasants. Half
                    of them were formerly serfs (10,447,149 males in 1858),— the remainder being
                    “state peasants” (9,194,891 males in 1858, exclusive of the Archangel
                    government) and “domain peasants” (842,740 males the same year).</p>
                <p>The serfdom which had sprung up in Russia in the 16th century, and became
                    consecrated by law in 1609, taking, however, nearly one hundred and fifty years
                    to attain its full growth and assume the forms under which it appeared in the
                    present century, was abolished by law in 1861. This law liberated the serfs from
                    a yoke which was really terrible, even under the best landlords, and from this
                    point of view it was obviously an immense benefit, the results of which are
                    apparent now. But it was far from securing corresponding economic results. Along
                    with the enrichment of the few, a general impoverishment of the great mass
                    followed, and took proportions so alarming as to arouse public attention and to
                    result in a great number of serious investigations conducted by the state, the
                    provincial assemblies, scientific societies, and private statisticians. The
                    general results of these inquiries may be summed up in the subjoined
                    statement.</p>
                <p>The former “dvorovyie,” attached to the personal service of their masters, were
                    merely set free; and they entirely went to reinforce the town proletariat. The
                    peasants proper received their houses and orchards, and also allotments of
                    arable land. These allotments were given over to the rural commune <hi
                    rend="italic">(mir),</hi> which was made responsible, as a whole, for the
                    payment of taxes for the allotments. The size of the allotments was determined
                    by a maximum and by a minimum, which last, however, could be still further
                    reduced if the amount of land remaining in the landlord’s hands was less than
                    one half of what was allotted to the peasants. For these allotments the peasants
                    had to pay, as before, either by personal labour (twenty to forty men’s days and
                    fifteen to thirty women’s days per year), or by a fixed rent (“obrok ”), which
                    varied from 8 to 12 roubles per allotment As long as these relations subsisted,
                    the peasants were considered as “temporarily obliged” <hi rend="italic"
                    >(vremenno obyazannyie).</hi> On January 1, 1882, they still numbered</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit21newyrich/page/n98/mode/1up"

                <p>1,422,012 males; but this category is now disappearing in consequence of a recent
                    law (December 28, 1881).</p>
                <p>The allotments could be redeemed by the peasants with the help of the crown, and
                    then the peasants were freed from all obligations to the landlord. The crown
                    paid the landlord in obligations representing the capitalized “obrok,” and the
                    peasants had to pay the crown, for forty-nine years, 6 per cent. interest on
                    this capital, that is, 9 to 12 roubles per allotment. If the redemption was made
                    without the consent of the peasants—on a mere demand of the landlord, or in
                    consequence of his being in arrear for the payment of his debts to the nobility
                    hypothec bank—the value of the redemption was reduced by one-fifth. The
                    redemption was not calculated on the value of the allotments, but was considered
                    as a compensation for the loss of the compulsory labour of the serfs; so that
                    throughout Russia, with the exception of a few provinces in the south-east, it
                    was—and still remains notwithstanding a very great increase of the value of
                    land—much higher than the market value of the allotment. Moreover, taking
                    advantage of the maximum law, many proprietors cut away large parts of the
                    allotments the peasants possessed under serfdom, and precisely the parts the
                    peasants were most in need of, namely, pasture lands around their houses, and
                    forests. On the whole, the tendency was to give the allotments so as to deprive
                    the peasants of grazing land and thus to compel them to rent pasture lands from
                    the landlord at any price.</p>
                <p>The present condition of the peasants—according to official documents—appears to
                    be as follows. In the twelve central governments the peasants, on the average,
                    have their own rye-bread for only 200 days per year,—often for only 180 and 100
                    days. One quarter of them have received allotments of only 2 <hi
                    rend="superscript">-</hi> 9 acres per male, and one half less than 8 ’ 5 to 11'4
                    acres,—the normal size of the allotment necessary to the subsistence of a family
                    under the three-fields system being estimated at 28 to 42 acres. Land must be
                    thus rented from the landlords at fabulous prices. Cattle-breeding is
                    diminishing to an alarming degree. The average redemption is 8 <hi
                    rend="superscript">-</hi> 56 roubles (about 17s.) for such allotments, and the
                    smaller the allotment the heavier the payment, its first “dessiatina” (2 <hi
                    rend="superscript">-</hi> S6 acres) costing twice as much as the second, and
                    four times as much as the third. In all these governments, the state commission
                    testifies, there are whole districts where one-third of the peasants have
                    received allotments of only 2 ’ 9 to 5 <hi rend="superscript">-</hi> 8 acres.
                    The aggregate value of the redemption and land-taxes often reaches from 185 to
                    275 per cent, of the normal rental value of the allotments, not to speak of
                    taxes for recruiting purposes, the church, roads, local administration, and so
                    on, chiefly levied from peasants. The arrears increase every year; one-fifth of
                    the inhabitants have left their houses; cattle are disappearing. Every year more
                    than half the adult males (in some districts three-fourths of the men and
                    one-third of the women) leave their homes and wander throughout Russia in search
                    of labour. The state peasants are only a little better off.</p>
                <p>Such is the state of affairs in central Russia, and it would be useless to
                    multiply figures, repeating nearly the same details. In the eight governments of
                    the black-earth region the state of matters is hardly better. Many peasants took
                    the “gratuitous allotments,” whose amount was about one-eighth of the normal
                    ones.</p>
                <p>The average allotment in Kherson is now only 0 <hi rend="superscript">-</hi> 90
                    acre, and for allotments from 2'9 to 5'8 acres they pay from 5 to 10 roubles of
                    redemption tax. The state peasants are better off, but still they are emigrating
                    in masses. It is only in the Steppe governments that the situation is more
                    hopeful. In Little Russia, where the allotments were personal (the <hi
                    rend="italic">mir</hi> existing only among state peasants), the state of affairs
                    does not differ for the better on account of the high redemption taxes. In the
                    western provinces, where the land was valued cheaper and the allotments somewhat
                    increased after the Polish insurrection, the general situation might be better
                    were it not for the former misery of peasants. Finally, in the Baltic provinces
                    nearly all the land belongs to German landlords, who either carry on agriculture
                    themselves, with hired labourers, or rent their land as small farms. Only
                    one-fourth of the peasants are farmers, the remainder being mere labourers, who
                    are emigrating in great numbers.</p>
                <p>The situation of the former serf-proprietors is also unsatisfactory. Accustomed
                    to the use of compulsory labour, they have failed to accommodate themselves to
                    the new conditions. The 700,000,000 roubles of redemption money received from
                    the crown down to 1877 by 71,000 landed proprietors in Russia have been spent
                    without accomplishing any agricultural improvement. The forests have been sold,
                    and only those landlords are prospering who exact rack-rents for the land
                    without which the peasants could not live upon their allotments.</p>
                <p>As showing a better aspect of the situation it must be added that in eighty-five
                    districts of Russia the peasants have bought 5,349,000 acres of land since 1861.
                    But these are mostly village-traders and grain-lenders (kulaks). A real
                    exception can be made only for Tver, where 53,474 householders united in
                    communities have bought 633,240 acres of land. There has been an increase of
                    wealth among the few, but along with this a general impoverishment of the mass
                    of the people. <note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>See

                <p>The ancient Scandinavians described Russia as Gardariki,—the country of
                    towns,—and until now Great Russia has maintained this character. The dwellings
                    of the peasantry are not scattered over the face of the country, but aggregated
                    in villages, where they are built in a street or streets. This grouping in
                    villages has its origin in the bonds which unite the peasants in the village
                    community—the <hi rend="italic">mir,</hi> or the o <hi rend="italic"
                    >bshchina.</hi></p>
                <p>When Haxthausen first described the Great Russian mir, it was considered a
                    peculiarity of the Slavonian race,—a view which is no longer tenable. The mir is
                    the Great Russian equivalent for the German, Dutch, and Swiss “mark” or
                    “allmend,” the English “township,” the French “commune,” the Polish “gmina,” the
                    South Slavonian “zadruga,” the Finnish “pittayä,” &amp;c.; and it very nearly
                    approaches, though differing from them in some essential features, the forms of
                    possession of land prevailing among the Moslem Turco-Tartars, while the same
                    principle is found even among the Mongol Buriat shepherds and the Tungus
                    hunters.</p>
                <p>The following are the leading features of the organization of the mir among the
                    Great Russians.</p>
                <p>The whole of the land occupied by a village—whoever be the landlord recognized by
                    law—the state, a private person, or a juridical unity, such as the <hi
                    rend="italic">voisko</hi> of the Cossacks—is considered as belonging to the
                    village community as a whole, the separate members of the community having only
                    the right of temporary possession of such part of the common property as will be
                    allowed to them by the mir in proportion to their working power. To this right
                    corresponds the obligation of bearing an adequate part of the charges which may
                    fall upon the community. If any produce results from the common work of the
                    community, each member has a right to an equal part of it.</p>
                <p>According to these general principles, the arable land is divided into as many
                    lots as there are working units in the community, and each family receives as
                    many lots as it has working units. The unit is usually one male adult; but, when
                    the working power of a large family is increased by its containing a number of
                    adult women, or boys approaching adult age, this circumstance is taken into
                    account, as well as the diminution from any cause of working power in other
                    households.</p>
                <p>For dividing the arable land into lots, the whole is parted first into three
                    “fields,” according to the three-field rotation of crops. As each field,
                    however, contains land of various qualities, it is in its turn subdivided into,
                    say, three parts—of good, average, and poor quality; and each of these parts is
                    subdivided into as many lots as there are working units. Each household receives
                    its lots in each of the subdivisions of the “field,” a carefully minute
                    equalization as to the minor differences between the lots being aimed at; and
                    the partition is nearly always made so as to permit each householder to reach
                    his allotment without passing through that of another.</p>
                <p>To facilitate this division, the community divides, first, into smaller groups
                    <hi rend="italic">(vyt, Zhxrebyevka,</hi> a “ten,” an “eight,” &amp;c.), each of
                    which is composed, by free selection, of a number of householders —the community
                    only taking care that each shall not be composed of rich, of poor, or of
                    “turbulents” exclusively. The division of the land is first made among such
                    groups, and the subdivision goes on within these. The division into groups
                    facilitates also the distribution of such work as the community may have to
                    accomplish— as when a bridge or a ditch has to be repaired, or a meadow mowed
                    —and the work cannot be done by the community as a whole.</p>
                <p>As sickness, death, removal, and other incidents bring about changes in the
                    distribution of working power among the different households, or when the number
                    of working units in the community has increased or decreased, a redistribution
                    of land <hi rend="italic">(peredyel)</hi> follows. Whether the land be a burden
                    (the taxes exceeding its rental value) or a benefit, its division is equalized;
                    the households whose working power has increased receive additional lots, and
                    <hi rend="italic">vice versa.</hi> The peredyel may be “partial” or “general.”
                    In most cases a mere equalization of lots among several families will serve, and
                    a general redistribution is resorted to only when greater inequalities have
                    arisen. On the whole, these redistributions are rare, and the precariousness of
                    land-holding which has been supposed to be a consequence of the mir proves to
                    have been exaggerated. More detailed inquiries have <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit21newyrich/page/n99/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0921-0099-0084"/>shown that no redistribution is made without
                    urgent necessity. Thus, to quote but one instance, in 4442 village communities
                    of Moscow, the average number of redistributions has been 2.1 in twenty years
                    (1858-78), and in more than two-thirds of these communities the redistribution
                    took place only once. On the other hand, a regular rotation of all households
                    over all lots, in order to equalize the remaining minor inequalities, is very
                    often practised in the black-earth region, where no manure is needed.</p>
                <p>Besides the arable mark, there is usually a <hi rend="italic">vygon</hi> (or
                    “common ”) for grazing, to which all householders send their cattle, whatever
                    the number they possess. The meadows are either divided on the above principles,
                    or mowed in common, and the hay divided according to the number of lots. The
                    forests, when consisting of small wood in sufficient quantity, are laid under no
                    regulations; when this is scarce, every trunk is counted, and valued according
                    to its age, number of branches, &amp;c., and the whole is divided according to
                    the number of lots.</p>
                <p>The houses and the orchards behind them belong also, in principle, to the
                    community; but no peredyel is made, except after a fire or when the necessity
                    arises of building the houses at greater distances apart. The orchards usually
                    remain for years in the same hands, with but slow equalizations of the lots in
                    width.</p>
                <p>All decisions in the village community are given by the mir, that is, by the
                    general assembly of all householders,—women being admitted on an equal footing
                    with men, when widows, or when their male guardians are absent. For the
                    decisions unanimity is necessary; and, though in some difficult cases of a
                    general peredyel the discussions may last for two or three days, no decision is
                    reached until the minority has declared its agreement with the majority.</p>
                <p>Each commune elects an elder <hi rend="italic">(starosta)</hi>; he is the
                    executive, but has no authority apart from that of the mir whose decisions he
                    carries out All attempts on the part of the Government to make him a functionary
                    have failed.</p>
                <p>Opinion as to the advantages and disadvantages of the village community being
                    much divided in Russia, it has been within the last twenty years the subject of
                    extensive inquiry, both private and official, and of an ever-growing literature
                    and polemic. The supporters of the mir are found chiefly among those who have
                    made more or less extensive inquiries into its actual organization and
                    consequences, while their opponents draw their arguments principally from
                    theoretical considerations of political economy. The main reproach that it
                    checks individual development and is a source of immobility has been shaken of
                    late by a better knowledge of the institution, which has brought to light its
                    remarkable plasticity and power of adaptation to new circumstances. The free
                    settlers in Siberia have voluntarily introduced the same organization. In north
                    and north-east Russia, where arable land is scattered in small patches among
                    forests, communities of several villages, or “volost” communities, have arisen;
                    and in the “voisko” of the Ural Cossacks we find community of the whole
                    territory as regards both land and fisheries and work in common. Nay, the German
                    colonists of southern Russia, who set out with the principle of personal
                    property, have subsequently introduced that of the village community, adapted to
                    their special needs (Clauss). In some localities, where there was no great
                    scarcity of land and the authorities did not interfere, joint cultivation of a
                    common area for filling the storehouses has recently been developed (in Penza
                    974 communes have introduced this system and cultivate an aggregate of 26,910
                    acres). The renting of land in common, or even purchase of land by wealthy
                    communes, has become quite usual, as also the purchase in common of agricultural
                    implements.</p>
                <p>Since the emancipation of the serfs, however, the mir has been undergoing
                    profound modifications. The differences of wealth which ensued, —the
                    impoverishment of the mass, the rapid increase of the rural proletariat, and the
                    enrichment of a few “kulaks” and “miroyedes” (“mir-eaters ”),—are certainly
                    operating unfavourably for the mir. The miroyedes steadily strive to break up
                    the organization of the commune as an obstacle to the extension of their power
                    over the moderately well-to-do peasants; while the proletariat cares little
                    about the mir. Fears on the one side and hopes on the other have been thus
                    entertained as to the likelihood of the mir resisting these disintegrating
                    influences, favoured, moreover, by those landowners and manufacturers who
                    foresee in the creation of a rural proletariat the certainty of cheap labour.
                    But the village community does not appear as yet to have lost the power of
                    adaptation which it has exhibited throughout its history. If, indeed, the
                    impoverishment of the peasants continues to go on, and legislation also
                    interferes with the mir, it must of course disappear, but not without a
                    corresponding disturbance in Russian life. <note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                <p>The co-operative spirit of the Great Russians shows itself further iu another

                    its appearance without any impulse from theory, simply as a natural form of
                    popular life. When workmen from any province come, for instance, to St
                    Petersburg to engage in the textile industries, or to work as carpenters,
                    masons, &amp;c., they immediately unite in groups of from ten to fifty persons,
                    settle in a house together, keep a common table, and pay each his part of the
                    expense to the elected elder of the artel. All Russia is covered with such
                    artels,—in the cities, in the forests, on the banks of rivers, on journeys, and
                    even in the prisons.</p>
                <p>The industrial artel is almost as frequent as the preceding, in all those trades
                    which admit of it A social history of the most fundamental state of Russian
                    society would be a history of their hunting, fishing, shipping, trading,
                    building, exploring artels. Artels of one or two hundred carpenters,
                    bricklayers, &amp;c., are common wherever new buildings have to be erected, or
                    railways or bridges made; the contractors always prefer to deal with an artel,
                    rather than with separate workmen. The same principles are often put into
                    practice in the domestic trades. It is needless to add that the wages divided by
                    the artels are higher than those earned by isolated workmen.</p>
                <p>Finally, a great pumber of artels on the stock exchange, in the seaports, in the
                    great cities (commissionaires), during the great fairs, and on railways have
                    grown up of late, and have acquired the confidence of tradespeople to such an
                    extent that considerable sums of money and complicated banking operations are
                    frequently handed over to an artelshik (member of an artel) without any receipt,
                    his number or his name being accepted as sufficient guarantee. These artels are
                    recruited only on personal acquaintance with the candidates for membership, and
                    security reaching £80 to £100 is exacted in the exchange artels. These last have
                    a tendency to become mere joint-stock companies employing salaried servants.
                    Co-operative societies have lately been organized by several zemstvos. They have
                    achieved good results, but do not exhibit, on the whole, the same unity of
                    organization as those which have arisen in a natural way among peasants and
                    artisans. <note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>See Jsaeff on

                <p>The chief occupation of the population of Russia is agriculture. Only in a few
                    parts of Moscow, Vladimir, and Nijni has it been abandoned for manufacturing
                    pursuits. Cattle-breeding is the leading industry in the Steppe region, the
                    timber-trade in the north-east, and fishing on the White and Caspian Seas. Of
                    the total surface of Russia, 1,237,360,000 acres (excluding Finland),
                    1,018,737,000 acres are registered, and it appears that 39 <hi

                    monasteries. Of the acres registered only 592,650,000 can be considered as
                    “good,” that is, capable of paying the land tax; and of these 248,630,000 acres
                    were under crone in 1884. <note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"
                    ><p>The division of the registered land is as follows, the figures being
                    percentages of the whole :— </p></note> The crops of 1883 were those of an
                    average year, that is, 2'9 to 1 in central Russia, and 4 to 1 in south Russia,
                    an&lt;∣ were estimated as follows (seed corn being left out of account) :—Rye,
                    49,185,000 quarters; wheat, 21,605,000; oats, 50,403,000; barley, 13,476,000;
                    other grains, 18,808,000. Those of 1884 (a very good year) reached an average of
                    18 per cent higher, except oats. The crops are, however, very unequally
                    distributed. In an average year there are 8 governments which are some 6,930,000
                    quarters short of their requirements, 35 which have an excess of 33,770,000
                    quarters, and 17 which have neither excess nor deficiency. The export of com
                    from Russia is steadily increasing, having risen from 6,560,000 quarters in
                    1856-60 to an average of 23,700,000 quarters in 1876-83 and 26,623,700 quarters
                    in 1884. This increase does not prove, however, an excess of corn, for even when
                    one-third of Russia was famine-stricken, during the last years of scarcity, the
                    export trade did not decline; even Samara exported during the last famine there,
                    the peasants being compelled to sell their com in autumn to pay their taxes.
                    Scarcity is quite usual, the food supply of some ten provinces being exhausted
                    every year by the end of the spring. Orach, and even bark, are then mixed with
                    flour for making bread.</p>
                <p>Flax, both for yam and seed, is extensively grown in the northwest and west, and
                    the annual production is estimated at 6,400,000 cwts. of fibre and 2,900,000
                    quarters of linseed. Hemp is largely cultivated in the central governments, the

                <p>The culture of the beet is increasing, and in 1SS4 7S5,700 acres were under this
                    root, chiefly in Little Russia and the neighbouring governments; 68,900,000
                    cwts. cf beetroot were worked up, yielding 5,119,000 cwts. of sugar, while
                    fifty-five refineries (twenty-six of them in Poland) showed a production valued
                    at 11 S, 888,530 roubles in 1882. Tobacco is cultivated everywhere, but good
                    qualities are obtained only in the south. In 1876-80 an average area of 101,600
                    acres was under this steadily increasing culture, and the crop of 1884 yielded
                    86,400,000 cwts. The vine, which might be grown much farther north than at
                    present, is cultivated only on Mount Caucasus, in Bessarabia, in the Crimea, and
                    on the lower Don for wine, and in Ekaterinoslaff, Podolia, and Astrakhan for
                    raisins. The yearly produce is 10 <hi rend="superscript">-</hi> 8 million
                    gallons in Russia, 10 0 in the Caucasus, and 24 in Transcaucasia.</p>
                <p>Market gardening is extensively carried on in Yaroslavl for a variety of
                    vegetables for exportation, in Moscow and Ryazan for hops, and in the south for
                    sunflowers, poppies, melons, &amp;c. Gardening is also widely spread in Little
                    Russia and in the more fertile central governments. Madder and indigo are
                    cultivated on Caucasus, and the silk-worm in Taurida, Kherson, and Caucasia.
                    Bee-keeping is widely spread.</p>
                <p>The breeding of live stock is largely carried on in the east and south, but the
                    breeds are usually inferior. Good breeds of cattle are met with only in the
                    Baltic provinces, and excellent breeds of horses on the Don, in Tamboff, and in
                    Voronezh. Since the emancipation, the peasants have been compelled to reduce the
                    number of their cattle, so that the increase in this department does not
                    correspond to the increase of population, as is shown by the fallowing figures

                <p>A more thorough registration of horses for military purposes gives a return of
                    21,203,900 horses in Russia and Poland, that is, 255 horses per 1000
                    inhabitants—a proportion which is elsewhere approached only in the United
                    States. They are kept in largest numbers in the three Steppe governments and on
                    the Urals (550 and 384 per 1000 inhabitants), while the smallest proportion
                    occurs in the manufacturing region (155 per 1000 inhabitants). 90 per cent, of
                    the total number of horses belong to peasants; these are mostly of a very poor
                    description. Infectious diseases make great ravages every year. In 1882 no less
                    than 121,500 cattle and 14,110 horses perished from that cause. <note

                <p>Fishing is a most important source of income for whole communities in Russia. No
                    less than 2000 to 3000 inhabitants of Archangel are engaged in fishing on the
                    Norwegian coast and in the White Sea, the aggregate yield of this industry being
                    estimated at 200,000 cwts., including 150 million herrings. These fisheries are,
                    however, declining. Fishing in the Baltic is not of much importance. In the
                    estuaries of the Dnieper, Dniester, and Bug it gives occupation to about 4000
                    men, and may be valued at less than 1,000,000 roubles. The fisheries in the Sea
                    of Azoff, which occupy about 15,000 men, are much more important, as are also
                    those of the lower Don, which last alone are valued at over 1,000,000 roubles a
                    year. The chief fisheries of Russia are, however, on the Caspian and in its
                    feeders: those of the Volga cover no less than 6000 square miles, and those of
                    the Ural extend for over 100 miles on the sea-coast and 400 miles up the river.
                    The lowest estimates give no less than 4 million cwts., valued at 15 million
                    roubles, of fish taken every year in the Caspian and its affluents. The
                    fisheries on the lakes of the lake region are also worthy of notice.</p>
                <p>. Hunting is an important source of income in north and northeast Russia, no less
                    than 400,000 squirrels and 800,000 grouse, to mention no other game, being
                    killed in different governments, while sea-hunting is still productive on the
                    shores of the Arctic Ocean. <note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                <p>Notwithstanding the wealth of the country in minerals and metals of all kinds,
                    and the endeavours made by Government to encourage mining, including the
                    imposition of protective tariffs even against Finland (in 1885), this and the
                    related industries are still at a low stage of development. The remoteness of
                    the mining from the industrial centres, the want of technical instruction and
                    also of capital, and the existence of a variety of vexatious regulations may be
                    given as the chief reasons for this state of matters. The imports of foreign
                    metals in the rough and of coal are steadily increasing, while the exports,
                    never otherwise than insignificant, show no advance. The chief mining districts
                    of Russia are the Ural Mountains and Olonetz for all kinds of metals; the Moscow
                    and Donetz basins for coal and iron; Poland and Finland; Caucasus; and the
                    Altai, the Nertchinsk, and the Amur mountains.</p>
                <p>Gold is obtained from gold-washings in Siberia (63,194 Ib in 1S82), the Urals
                    (16,850 lb), Central Asia (325 Ib in 1881), and Finland (42 lb); silver in
                    Siberia (16,128 lb), and partly on Caucasus (1232 lb), the quantity steadily
                    decreasing; platinum in the Urals (3600 to 4600 Ib every year). Lead is
                    extracted along with silver (19,416 cwts. in 1S81; 357,260 cwts. imported); zinc
                    only in Poland (89,650 cwts.; half as much is imported); tin in Finland (194
                    cwts.; 40,000 cwts. imported). Copper is worked in several governments of the
                    Ural region, in Kazah, Vyatka, Caucasus, Siberia, and Finland, but the industry
                    is a languishing one, and the crown mines show a deficit (65,000 cwts.; double
                    this amount is imported). Iron-ores are found at many places. Excellent mines
                    are worked on the Urals; and iron mines occur also in large numbers throughout
                    the Moscow and Donetz basins, as also in the western provinces, not to speak of
                    those of the Asiatic dominions, of Poland, and of Finland (bog-iron). In 1881
                    the annual production of pig-iron (which covered only two-thirds of the
                    consumption) was stated as follows, (in thousands of cwts.):—Urals, 6153;
                    central Russia, 1092; Olonetz, 42; south and south-west Russia, 501; Poland,
                    951; Finland, 413; Siberia, 85. The iron and steel throughout the empire
                    amounted to 10,720,000 cwts. in 1882. European Russia alone produced in 1882
                    31,520 cwts. of copper, 7,703,000 cwts. of pig-‘roil, 4,981,300 cwts. of iron,
                    and 3,799,600 cwts. of steel.</p>
                <p>The production of coal is rapidly increasing and in 18S2 reached 46,270,000
                    cwts., three-fourths being produced by the Donetz basin, and one-fifth by that
                    of Moscow. Poland, moreover, yielded 27,950,000 cwts. of coal in 1882, and the
                    Asiatic dominions about 800,000 cwts. Nearly 34,000,000 cwts. are imported
                    annually. The extraction of naphtha on the Apsheron peninsula of the Caspian has
                    been greatly stimulated of late, reaching about 20,000,000 cwts. in 1883
                    (4,600,000 cwts. of kerosene, 1,000,000 cwts. of lubricating oils, and 300,000
                    cwts. of asphalt).</p>
                <p>Russia and Siberia are very rich in rock-salt, salt springs, and salt lakes
                    (16,360,000 cwts. extracted; 3,746,000 imported). Excellent graphite is found in
                    the deserts of the Sayan Mountains and Turukhansk. Sulphur is obtained in
                    Caucasia, Kazan, and Poland (2000 to 5000 cwts. extracted; 70,000 tc 170,000
                    cwts. imported). The mining and related industries occupy altogether about an
                    aggregate motive force (steam and water) of 73,500 horse-power and 305,000
                    hands. <note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>See the yearly

                <p>Since the time of Peter I. the Russian Government has been unceasing in its
                    efforts for the creation and development of home manufactures. Important
                    monopolies in last century, and heavy protective, or rather prohibitive, import
                    duties, as well as large money bounties, in the present, have contributed
                    towards the accumulation of immense private fortunes, but manufactures have
                    developed but slowly. A great upward movement has, however, been observable
                    since 1863. About that time a thorough reform of the machinery in use was
                    effected, whereby the number of hands employed was reduced, but the yearly
                    production doubled or trebled. In some branches the production suddenly rose at
                    a yet higher rate (cottons from 12 million roubles in 1865 to 209 million in
                    1882). The following figures for European Russia, without Poland and Finland,
                    will give some idea of this progress :—</p>

                <p>These figures lose, however, some of their significance if the corresponding rate
                    of progress in manufacturing productivity in western Europe be taken into
                    account. Besides, since the great improvements of 1861-70 the industrial
                    progress of Russia has been but slow. The manufactories of rails and railway
                    plan t, and even the Ural ironworks, are in a precarious condition. The textile
                    industries, though undoubtedly they have made great advances, are subject to
                    great fluctuations in connexion with those of the home crops, and are thus in an
                    abnormal state. The artisans labour for twelve, fourteen, and sometimes sixteen
                    hours a day, and their condition, as revealed by recent inquiries, is very
                    unsatisfactory. Many causes contribute to this,—the want of technical
                    instruction, the want of capital, and <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit21newyrich/page/n101/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0921-0101-0086"/>above all the want of markets. Russia lias not,
                    and cannot have, such foreign markets as the countries which first attained an
                    industrial development. Her colonies are deserts, and in the home markets the
                    manufacturer only finds 80 millions of poverty-stricken people, whoso wants are
                    nearly all supplied by their petty domestic industries.</p>
                <p>These, that is, the domestic industries which are carried on by the peasants in
                    conjunction with their agricultural pursuits during the long days of idleness
                    imposed by the climate and by the reduced allotments of land, continue, not only
                    to hold their ground side by side with the large manufactures, but to develop
                    and to compete with these by the cheapness of their products. Extensive
                    inquiries are now being made into these domestic industries <hi rend="italic"
                    >kustar-noyie Proizvodstvo).</hi> 855,000 Jiersous engaged in them along with
                    agriculture <hi rend="italic">Qcustari)</hi> have already been registered, and
                    an unexpected variety of industries, and a still more unexpected technical
                    development in several of them, have been disclosed by these researches. Thie
                    yearly production of the 855,000 kustari who have been registered reaches
                    218,414,000 roubles; while the total number of Jieasants engaged in the
                    industries, mostly in Great Russia and northern Caucasia, is estimated at a
                    minimum of 7,500,000 persons, with a yearly production of at least 1,800,000,000
                    roubles, or more than double the aggregate production of the manufactures
                    proper.</p>
                <p>Of course the machinery they use is very primitive, and the wages for a day of
                    twelve to sixteen hours exceedingly low. But the industries are capable of being
                    improved, and it has been brought out that “Paris” silk hats and “Vienna” house
                    furniture sold by substantial foreign firms at Moscow are really manufactured in
                    the neighbourhood of the capital by peasants who still continue to till their
                    fields. All these industries suffer very much from want of credit, and the
                    Producers become the prey of intermediaries. But their continued existence and
                    their progress under most unfavourable conditions show that they meet a real
                    want, which is itself the consequence of the peculiar conditions under which
                    Russia, the last to come into the international market, has to develop.</p>
                <p>In those very governments where two-thirds of the textile manufactories of Russia
                    are concentrated domestic weaving (for the market, not for domestic use) employs
                    about 200,000 hands, whose yearly production is valued at 45,000,000 roubles. In
                    Stavropol on Caucasus it has so rapidly developed that 42,400 looms are now at
                    work, with a yearly production of 2,007,700 roubles. But no adequate idea could
                    be given of the petty industries of Russia without entering into greater detail
                    than the scope of the present article permits. Suffice it to say that there is
                    no branch of the industries in textiles, leather, woodwork, or metal work,
                    provided it needs no heavy machinery, which is not successfully carried on in
                    the villages. Nearly all the requirements of nine-tenths of the population of
                    Russia are met in this way.</p>
                <p>The aggregate production of industries within the empire, inclusive of mining,
                    was stated in 1882 as follows :—European Russia, 1,126,033,000 roubles; Poland,
                    147,309,000; Finland, 15,130,000. The chief manufactures in European Russia
                    (apart from Poland and Finland), and their yearly production in 1882 in millions
                    of roubles, were as follows :—cotton yarn and cottons, 208 <hi
                    rend="superscript">-</hi> 6; other textile industries, 103"5; metal wares and
                    machinery, 107'9; chemicals, 6 "6; candles, soap, glue, leather, and other
                    animal Jiroducts, 61 <hi rend="superscript">,</hi> 4; distillery products,
                    156.0; other liquors, 39.0; sugar, 140.9; flour, 74.0. The remainder are of
                    minor importance. It must be observed, however, that these figures are much
                    below those given for 1879, when the aggregate production of Russian
                    manufactures was computed at 1,102,949,000 roubles, without the mining and
                    related industries, the distillery products, and the flour.</p>
                <p>The geographical distribution of manufactures in Russia is very unequal. The
                    governments of Moscow and St Petersburg, with a yearly production of 173 and 134
                    million roubles respectively, represent together two-fifths of the aggregate
                    production of Russia. If we add Vladimir (91,766,000 roubles), Kieff
                    (73,300,000), Perm (50,500,000), Livonia, Esthonia, Kharkoff, and Kherson (from
                    30 to 35 millions each), we have all the principal manufacturing centres. In
                    fact, Moscow’, with portions of the neighbouring governments, contains half the
                    Russian manufactures exempted from excise duties, while the south-west
                    governments of Kieff, Podolia, and Kherson contain two-thirds of those not so
                    exempted. <note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>See Orloffs

                <p>The main wealth of Russia consisting in raw produce, the trade of the country
                    turns chiefly on the purchase of this for export, and the aale of manufactured
                    and imported goods in exchange. This traffic is in the hands of a great number
                    of middlemen,—in the west Jews, and elsewhere Russians,—to whom the peasants are
                    for the most part in debt, as they purchase in advance on security of subsequent
                    payments in corn, tar, wooden wares, &amp;c. A good deal of the internal trade
                    is carried on by travelling merchants ( <hi rend="italic">ofeni).</hi></p>
                <p>The fairs are very numerous; the minor ones numbered 6500 in 1878, and showed
                    sales amounting to an aggregate of 305 million roubles. Those of Nijni-Novgorod,
                    with a return of 400 million roubles, of Irbit and Kharkoff (above 100 million
                    roubles each), of Romny, Krestovskoye in Perm, and Menzelinsk in Ufa (55 to 12
                    million roubles), have considerable importance both for trade and for home
                    manufactures. The total value of the internal trade, which is in the hands of
                    681,116 licensed dealers, is roughly estimated at more than seven milliards of
                    roubles.</p>
                <p>The development of the external trade of Russia is seen from the following

                <p>The chief article of export is grain—wheat, oats, and rye— (24,870,000 quarters,
                    321,042,000 roubles in 1882), to which the increase of exports is mainly due.
                    This increase, however, does not correspond to an increase of crops, only 10 per
                    cent, of which were exported in 1870 and about 20 per cent, in 1882. Next to
                    grain come flax, hemp, linseed, and hempseed (129,370,000 roubles in 1882);
                    oil-yielding grains (441,000 quarters); wool, tallow, hides, bristles, and bone
                    (31,120,000 roubles). If we add to these timber (35,044,000 roubles) and furs
                    (4,147,000 roubles), 95 per cent, of all Russian exports are accounted for, the
                    remainder consisting of linen, ropes, and some woollen stuffs and metallic wares
                    (7,172,000 roubles to western Europe, 2,888,000 to Finland, and 5,763,000 to
                    Asia).</p>
                <p>The chief imports from Europe were in 1882 as follows:—Tea (48,091,000 roubles),
                    liquors (16,124,000 roubles), salt, fish, rice, fruits, and colonial wares
                    (38,446,000 roubles), various raw textile wares (127,986,000 roubles—cotton
                    72,417,000), raw metals (32,630,000 roubles), chemicals (57,894,000 roubles),
                    and stuffs (22,428,000 roubles). The imports from Asia—chiefly tea—in the same
                    year reached 32,853,000 roubles. The chief imports were from Germany
                    (214,000,000 roubles) and Great Britain (124,700,000), the chief exports to
                    Great Britain (210,000,000), Germany (178,000,000), and France (54,000,000).
                    Even in her trade with Finland Russia imports more than she exports,—the chief
                    imports being paper, cotton, iron, and butter; Prohibitory tariffs were imposed
                    on Finnish wares in 1885.</p>
                <p>During 1882 the ports of the empire were visited by 13,638 foreign ships
                    (5,337,000 tons), of which number 1436 were to Asiatic ports (391,200 tons). Of
                    the above total only 2489 vessels (628,000 tons) were under the Russian flag
                    (mostly Finnish), while the British alone showed a tonnage of 2,258,000 and the
                    German 639,000. The coasting trade was represented by 35,083 vessels (6,040,000
                    tons) entering the ports, chiefly those of the Black Sea. The mercantile marine
                    of Russia in 1882 numbered 6383 vessels (727,000 tons), including 604 steamers;
                    of the total number 1593 (254,000 tons) were Finnish. The chief ports are St
                    Petersburg, Odessa, Riga, Taganrog, Libau, and Reval. Baku has recently acquired
                    some importance in consequence of the naphtha trade. <note anchored="true"

                <p>The rivers of the empire, mostly connected by canals, play a very important part
                    in the inland traffic. The aggregate length of navigable waters reaches 21,510
                    miles (453 miles of canals), and 12,600 miles more are available for floating
                    rafts. In 1882 51,407 boats, with cargoes amounting to 153,250,000 cwts., valued
                    at 186,480,000 roubles, left the ports on Russian rivers and canals.</p>

                <p>Corn, firewood, and timber constitute two-thirds of the whole cargoes carried.
                    Within Russia proper, from 5740 to 7400 boats, larger and smaller, worth from
                    four to seven millions of roubles, have been built annually during the last five
                    years (7415 boats, valued at 6,758,000 roubles, in 1882,—18 of them being
                    steamers); most of them are light flat-bottomed structures, which are broken up
                    as soon as they have reached their destination. The number of steamers plying on
                    inland waters, chiefly on the Volga, was estimated in 1879 at 1056 (80,890
                    horse-power).</p>
                <p>Twenty-five years ago Russia had only 993 miles of railways; on January 1, 1883,
                    the totals were 13,428 miles for Russia and Caucasia, 8S8 for Poland, 734 for
                    Finland, and 141 for the Transcaspian region, and two years later they had
                    reached an aggregate length of 16,155 miles. The railways chiefly connect the
                    Baltic ports with the granaries of Russia in the south-east, and the western
                    frontier with Moscow, whence six trunk lines radiate in all directions. Several
                    military lines run along the western frontier, while two trunk lines, starting
                    from St Petersburg, follow the two shores of the Gulf of Finland. Of the
                    projected Siberian railway one main line (444 miles), connecting Perm and
                    Berezniki on the Kama with Ekaterinburg and the chief iron-works of the Urals,
                    has been constructed. It has been extended east to Kamyshkofl, and is to be
                    continued to Tinmen, 100 miles farther east, whence steamers ply to Tomsk.</p>
                <p>Only 738 miles of the railways of Russia belong to the state, but most of them
                    have been constructed under Government guarantees, involving payment of from 11
                    to 21 million roubles yearly. On the other hand the yearly increasing debt of
                    the railways to the state amounted to 781,888,800 roubles in 1883. Of the
                    aggregate value of the Russian railways, estimated at 2210 million roubles, no
                    less than 1971 million roubles were held by Government in shares and bonds. The
                    cost of construction has been altogether out of proportion to what it ought to
                    be; for, whereas the average rate per verst (0’663 mile) in Finland was only
                    20,000 silver roubles, in Russia it reached 60,000, 75,000, 90,000, and even
                    100,000 roubles. In 1882 21,322 versts (14,136 miles) represented an expenditure
                    of 2,210,047,632 roubles, and their net revenue was only 3'18 per cent, on the
                    capital invested (4982 roubles per English mile in 1882). In 1884 34,674,853
                    passengers, 2,287,955 military, and 834,500,000 cwts. of merchandise were
                    conveyed by 5808 locomotives and 120,940 carriages and waggons. Fully one-half
                    of the merchandise carried consisted of corn (24 per cent.), coal (13 per
                    cent.), firewood (12 per cent.), and timber (8 per cent.). <note anchored="true"

                <p>For the conveyance of correspondence and travellers along ordi-nary routes the
                    state maintains an extensive organization of post-horses between all towns of
                    the empire, that is, over an aggregate length of 110,170 miles. In 1882 4355
                    stations, with a staff of 15,560 men and 446,460 horses, were kept up for that
                    purpose. In 1883 242,193,470 letters, newspapers (93,520,000), registered
                    letters, and parcels were carried, of which 29,808,100 belonged to international
                    correspondence. The telegraph system had in the same year an aggregate length of
                    65,394 miles, with 2,957 telegraph-offices, and 10,222,139 telegrams were
                    transmitted. <note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>See <hi

                <p>The Russians, properly so called, belong to the Slavonic race, itself a division
                    of the great Aryan family. It cannot be denied that in the northern and eastern
                    parts of Russia large Finnish elements have become mixed with the Slavs, and
                    Mongolian in the south, but this is far from justifying the prejudiced attempts
                    of Duchinski and others to challenge the right of the Russians to be called an
                    Aryan people. The derivation of the words Russia, Russians <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Rous, Rossia, Rossiane),</hi> has been much disputed. The old-fashioned view
                    was to identify them with the <hi rend="italic">Rhoxolani,</hi> who are now
                    generally believed to have been a Medish tribe. The later and probably correct
                    one is to derive the name from the Finnish Ruotsi applied to the Swedes, and
                    considered by Professor Thomsen of Copenhagen to be itself a corruption of the
                    Swedish word <hi rend="italic">rothsmenn,</hi> rowers or seafarers. They are
                    Scandinavian vikings with whom we first become acquainted in northern Russia,
                    and who in a way founded the empire, although from Arabian and Jewish writers we
                    have dim records of a Slavonic race inhabiting the basin of the Dnieper about
                    the close of the 9th century. In recent times Ilovaiski and Gedeonoff have again
                    attacked the view of the Swedish origin of the invaders. They see in them only
                    Slavs, but they are not considered to have shaken the theory which derives the
                    name from Ruotsi. As the story goes, three brothers, Rurik, Sineus, and Truvor,
                    were invited to Russia from the north and settled at Novgorod in 862. Nestor
                    calls them Varangians, a name in which most people are willing to see Norsemen.
                    For a long time the Russians and Scandinavians are considered, as we shall find,
                    to be separate races, but at length they are fused, as the Saxons and Normans in
                    England under Henry I. Concerning the origin of the town of Novgorod, which
                    bears a purely Slavonic name, nothing is known; it has been supposed that at
                    first a Finnish settlement existed on its site. According to the legend the
                    three brothers were invited over by a leading citizen named Gostomisl. There is,
                    however, no mention of such a person in the <hi rend="italic">Chronicle</hi> of
                    Nestor. There is another story that Rurik was the son of the Swedish king,
                    Ludbrat, a person met with in Scandinavian legend, and his queen Umila, the
                    daughter of Gostomisl, and was born at Upsala in 830. Whatever the variants of
                    the legend may be, we seem to learn one thing,—that a successful Scandinavian
                    invasion occurred in the north of Russia. The three brothers finally settled in
                    the country,—Rurik at Ladoga, where the river Volkhoff flows into the lake,
                    Sineus at Bielo-ozero, and Truvor at Izborsk on Lake Peipus. On the death of his
                    two brothers without heirs, we are told that Rurik annexed their dominions to
                    his own, and took the title of <hi rend="italic">veliki kniaz,</hi> or
                    grand-prince. These three brothers are said to have brought two other
                    adventurers with them, Askold and Dir, who, having had a quarrel with Rurik, set
                    out with some companions to Constantinople to try their fortune. On their way
                    they saw Kieff, situated on a rich and grassy plain, in the occupation of the
                    Khazars. Of this city they made themselves masters, and permanently established
                    themselves on the Dnieper. The origin of Kieff itself is involved in mystery. It
                    is first mentioned about the 9th century. Constantine Porphyrogenitus speaks of
                    to <hi rend="italic">καστpbv</hi><hi rend="smallcaps">to</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Kιοaβa to eπorομaζομeuοu Eaμβa∕raς.</hi> This last word has given much labour
                    to scholars; some are disposed to see in it the Norse <hi rend="italic"
                    >sandbakki,</hi> the bank of sand. It is at Kieff that, according to the legend,
                    St Andrew preached the gospel to the Russians. From this place Askold and Dir
                    sallied forth two years afterwards, with an armament of two hundred vessels,
                    sailed up the Bosphorus, and plundered the capital of the Byzantine empire. The
                    Greek writers give 851 as the date of this enterprise, thus making it precede
                    the arrival of Rurik by eleven years. The emperor at the time of their invasion
                    was Michael III.</p>
                <p>Having greatly extended his dominions by subduing the surrounding Slavonic
                    tribes, Rurik died at an advanced age in 879, leaving the regency of the
                    principality and the guardianship of his son Igor to the renowned Oleg. <note

                    Askold and Dir. The story goes that he took young Igor with him, and disguised
                    himself and his companions as Slavonic merchants. The unsuspecting Askold and
                    Dir were invited to a conference and slain on the spot. Thus was Kieff added to
                    the dominions of Igor, who was recognized as the <pb break="no"

                    mentioned for the first time, is unknown. We are told that it was a city of
                    importance before the arrival of Rurik. The derivation of the name is disputed,
                    some deriving it from a Finnish, others from a Slavonic root. Oleg next resolved
                    to make an attack upon Byzantium, and his preparations were great both by sea
                    and land. Leo the Philosopher, then emperor, was ill able to resist these
                    barbarians. He attempted to block the passage of the Bosphorus, but Oleg dragged
                    his ships across the land and arrived before the gates of Constantinople. The
                    Greeks begged for peace and offered tribute. Oleg is said to have hung his
                    shield in derision on the gates of the city. We may believe this without going
                    so far as to give credence to Stryikowski, the Polish writer, who says it was to
                    be seen there in his time (16th century). The atrocities committed by Oleg and
                    his followers are described by Karamzin, the Russian historian; they are just
                    such as the other Norsemen of their race were committing at the same time in
                    northern and western Europe. The Byzantines paid a large sum of money that their
                    city might be exempted from injury, and soon after Oleg sent ambassadors <note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>It has been observed that the
                    names of the ambassadors in this treaty are purely Scandinavian. </p></note> to
                    the emperor to arrange the terms. The treaty was ratified by oaths: the
                    Byzantines swore by the Gospels, and the Russians by their gods Perun and Volos.
                    In 911 Oleg made another treaty with the Byzantines, the terms of which, as of
                    the preceding one, are preserved in Nestor. The authenticity of these two
                    treaties has been called in question by some writers, but Miklosich truly
                    observes that it would have been impossible at the time Nestor wrote to forge
                    the Scandinavian names. Soon after this Oleg died; he had exercised supreme
                    power till the time of his death to the exclusion of Igor, and seems to have
                    been regarded by the people as a wizard. He is said to have been killed by the
                    bite of a serpent, which had coiled itself in the skull of his horse, as he was
                    gazing at the animal’s unburied bones. The story is in reality a Scandinavian
                    saga, as has been shown by Bielowski and Rafn. It is also found in other
                    countries. In the reign of Igor the Petchenegs first make their appearance in
                    Russian history. In 941 he undertook an expedition against Constantinople and
                    entered the Bosphorus after devastating the provinces of Pontus, Paphlagonia,
                    and Bithynia. Nestor has not concealed the atrocities committed by the Russians
                    on this occasion; he tells us of the churches and monasteries which they burned,
                    and of their cruelty to the captives. They were, however, attacked by the
                    Byzantine fleet, and overpowered by the aid of Greek fire; many were drowned,
                    and many of those who swam to land were slaughtered by the infuriated peasants;
                    only one of their number escaped. Thirsting to avenge his loss, Igor fitted out
                    another expedition in the spring of the following year. The Greeks were
                    unwilling to run a risk again; they renewed the treaty which had been signed
                    with Oleg, and were only too glad to purchase deliverance from their
                    adversaries. The Russian at first demanded too much, but was finally persuaded
                    by his more prudent attendants: “If Caesar speaks thus,” said they, “what more
                    do we want than to have gold and silver and silks without fighting? Who knows
                    which will survive, we or they? Who has ever been able to conclude a treaty with
                    the sea? We do not go on the dry land, but on the waves of the sea; death is
                    common to all.”</p>
                <p>A treaty of peace was accordingly concluded, which is given at full length by
                    Nestor; of the fifty names attached to it we find three were Slavonic and the
                    rest Norse. The two races are beginning to be fused. From this expedition Igor
                    returned triumphant. He was, however, unfortunate in a subsequent attack on the
                    Drevlians, a Slavonic tribe whose territory is now partly occupied by the
                    government of Tchernigoff. The Drevlians had long suffered from his exactions.
                    They resolved to encounter him under the command of their prince Male; for they
                    saw, as a chronicler says, that it was necessary to kill the wolf, or the whole
                    flock would become his prey. They accordingly laid an ambuscade near their town
                    Korosten, now called Iskorost, in the government of Volhynia, and slew him and
                    all his company. According to Leo the Deacon, he was tied to two trees bent
                    together, and when they were let go the unhappy chief was torn to pieces.</p>
                <p>Igor was succeeded by his son Sviatoslaff, the first Russian prince with a
                    Slavonic name. Olga, however, the spirited wife of Igor, was now regent, owing
                    to her son’s minority. Fearful was the punishment she inflicted upon the
                    Drevlians for the death of her husband, and the story lacks no dramatic interest
                    as it has been handed down by the old chronicler. Some of the Drevlians were
                    buried alive in pits which she had caused to be dug for the purpose previously;
                    some were burned alive; and others murdered at a <hi rend="italic">trizna,</hi>
                    or funeral feast, which she had appointed to be held in her husband’s honour.
                    The town Iskorost was afterwards set on fire by tying lighted matches to the
                    tails of sparrows and pigeons, and letting them fly on the roofs of the houses.
                    Here we certainly have a piece of a <hi rend="italic">Udina,</hi> as the old
                    Russian legendary poems are called. Geoffrey of Monmouth and Layamon give the
                    same account of the capture of the city of Cirencester by Gurmund at the head of
                    the Saxons, and something similar is also told about Harold Hardrada in Sicily.
                    Finally, at the close of her life, Olga became a Christian. She herself visited
                    the capital of the Greek empire, and was instructed in the mysteries of her new
                    faith by the patriarch. There she was baptized by him in 955, and the emperor
                    Constantine Porphyrogenitus became her godfather. She did not, however, succeed
                    in persuading her son Sviatoslaff to embrace the same faith, although he took no
                    measures to impede its progress among his subjects. This son was as celebrated a
                    warrior as Oleg; his victories were chiefly over the Petchenegs previously
                    mentioned, a people of Mongol origin inhabiting the basin of the Don. He began,
                    however, the fatal custom of breaking up Russia into apanages, which he
                    distributed among his sons. The effects of this injudicious policy, subsequently
                    pursued by other grand princes, were soon felt. Thus was paved the way for the
                    invasion of Russia by the Mongols, who held it for two hundred years, and
                    communicated that semi-Asiatic character to the dress and customs of the country
                    which the <hi rend="italic">ukazes</hi> of Peter the Great could hardly
                    eradicate, and which perhaps have not entirely disappeared even in our own
                    times. In his division of the country, Sviatoslaff gave Kieff to his son
                    Yaropolk; to another son, Oleg, the conquered land of the Drevlians; to another,
                    Vladimir, he assigned Novgorod. It would be impossible to interest the reader in
                    the petty wars of these princes. After having gained several victories over the
                    Petchenegs, Sviatoslaff set out on an expedition against the Bulgarians, a
                    Ugro-Finnish tribe, dwelling on the banks of the Volga, the remains of whose
                    ancient capital can still be seen. He made himself master of their country, but
                    his victorious career was cut short at the cataracts of the Dnieper, where he
                    and his soldiers were slain by the Petchenegs. According to the barbarous custom
                    of the times, their prince Kurya made his skull <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0921-0106-0089"/>into a drinking-cup. Vladimir, the son of
                    Sviatoslaff, was for some time a monster of cruelty and debauchery. He killed
                    his brother Yaropolk, and seized his dominions; and, Yaropolk having some time
                    before murdered his brother Oleg, Vladimir now became sole ruler. To his
                    hereditary dominions he added Galicia or Red Russia, and subjugated some
                    Lithuanian and Livonian tribes. Suddenly he seems to have been troubled with
                    religious difficulties. According to the chronicler, he sent ambassadors to
                    bring him reports of the different religions—Catholic, Jewish, Mussulman, and
                    Greek. The last of these beliefs seemed the most satisfactory. Vladimir marched
                    south, took the city of Chersonesus in the Crimea, which at that time belonged
                    to the Byzantine emperors, and then sent to demand the hand of the daughter of
                    that potentate. After some deliberation his request was granted on condition
                    that he was baptized. Accordingly he went to Constantinople in 988, and was
                    admitted into the church, and at the same time received the hand of Anne, the
                    Byzantine princess, although he seems to have already had a great number of
                    wives. On his return to Kieff, he caused the image of Perun, the Slavonic god of
                    thunder, which had been erected on an eminence, to be cast into the river, after
                    having been belaboured by the cudgels of his soldiers. After this Vladimir
                    issued a proclamation ordering all the inhabitants to proceed on the following
                    day to the banks of the river to receive baptism. This extraordinary command met
                    with universal obedience, and Russia was Christianized. As Vladimir introduced
                    Christianity into Russia, so Yaroslaff his son was the first legislator. He was
                    prince of Novgorod, and died in 1054. Vladimir on his death divided his
                    dominions among his sons :—to Yaroslaff, Novgorod; to Iziaslaff, Polotsk; to
                    Boris, Rostoff; to Gleb, Murom; to Sviatoslaff, the Drevlians; and a few other
                    provinces to others of his sons. Kieff, his capital, was seized by his nephew
                    Sviatopolk, who murdered Boris and Gleb, now canonized among the martyrs of the
                    Russian Church. Yaroslaff at length drove Sviatopolk from Kieff, and was
                    temporarily restored by the Poles, but only to be driven out again, and he ended
                    his life as an exile. Yaroslaff was successful against the Petchenegs, but
                    failed in an attack on Constantinople. His great claim to be remembered lies in
                    his publishing the first recension of the <hi rend="italic">Russkaia
                    Pravda,</hi> the earliest Russian code, which was handed down in the chronicles
                    of Novgorod.</p>
                <p>We now leave the earliest period of Russian history, with its romantic stories
                    and embedded sagas, telling us of heroic men, for the second division of our
                    subject. The death of Yaroslaff was followed by the dreariest portion of the
                    Russian annals—the period of the apanages ( <hi rend="italic">udieli</hi> ),
                    lasting from 1054 to 1238. The country was now broken up into petty
                    principalities, and we shall understand its condition more clearly if we
                    remember that the chief divisions of Russia from the Ilth century to the 13th
                    were as follows <note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>See
                    Rambaud, <hi rend="italic">Histoire de la Russie,</hi> p. 76. </p></note> :—</p>
                <p>(1) The principality of Smolensk, formerly of great importance, as including in
                    its territories the sources of three of the great Russian rivers—the Volga, the
                    Dnieper, and the Diina.</p>
                <p>(2) The principality of Russia, in the early and restricted sense, the original
                    element of the country. The first form of the name is Rous. The word appears to
                    have been a collective appellation of the people; it was under the influence of
                    the Byzantine writers that in the 17th century the form Rossia sprang up, which
                    in time spread over the whole land. We must not forget, however, that to the
                    majority of Englishmen, till the beginning of the 18th century, its name was
                    Muscovy. Its situation on the Dnieper was very advantageous; and the soil was
                    fertile, the black-earth region being at the present time the great
                    wheat-growing district of Russia. Besides, the Byzantine territory was not far
                    oft. On the principality of Kieff depended that of Pereiaslavl; and Vishgorod,
                    Biel-gorod, and Tortchesk were made apanages for princes of the same
                    dynasty.</p>
                <p>(3) On the affluents of the right bank of the Dnieper, especially the Sozha, the
                    Desna, and the Seim, stretched the principalities of Tchernigoffwith Staroduband
                    Lubech, and Novgorod Severski with Putivl, Kursk, and Briansk.</p>
                <p>(4) The double principality of Ryazan and Murom.</p>
                <p>(5) The principality of Suzdal.</p>
                <p>(6) The republics of Novgorod and Pskoff, and the daughter-city of the latter,
                    Vyatka.</p>
                <p>Iziaslaff, the son of Yaroslaff, seems to have had a troubled reign of
                    twenty-four years, constantly disturbed by civil wars. On his death in 1078,
                    although he had two sons, he left the principality of Kieff to his brother
                    Vsevolod, apparently on a principle common among the Slavs to bequeath the crown
                    to the oldest male of the family; but, on the death of Vsevolod, Sviatopolk, the
                    son of Iziaslaff, succeeded in 1093. At his death Vladimir Monomakh came to the
                    throne, and ruled from 1113 to 1125. He was the son of Vsevolod, and was called
                    after his maternal grandfather, the Byzantine emperor Constantine DIonomachus.
                    The reign of this prince was a very prosperous one. He left a curious treatise
                    called “Instruction” ( <hi rend="italic">Pouchenie),</hi> addressed to his sons,
                    in which we get a picture of the simple life in Russia at that period (see
                    below, p. 103). He also founded on the river Kliazma a town which bears his
                    name. There were continual quarrels among his descendants, but it is impossible
                    to go into these minutely here. George Dolgoruki, one of the sons of Vladimir
                    Monomakh, gained possession of Kieff in 1157, but the city soon began to pale
                    before the growing power of Suzdal, and ceased to be the capital. He died the
                    same year, just while a league was being formed to drive him out of it. The
                    confederates entered the city, and their chief made himself prince. In 1169
                    Andrew Bogolioubski, son of George Dolgoruki, formed a coalition against
                    Mstislaff, who was reigning in Kieff, and a large army was sent against the
                    city. It was taken and pillaged; and the sacred pictures, sacerdotal ornaments,
                    and even bells were carried off. It is on this occasion that the head of St
                    Clement, the Slavonic apostle, which is known to have been preserved at Kieff,
                    was lost.</p>
                <p>After the fall of this city Russia ceased for some time to have any political
                    centre. During the fifty-four years previous to the arrival of the Mongols, our
                    chief interest is drawn to Suzdal and Galicia, and the republics of Novgorod and
                    Pskoff. George Dolgoruki had founded the principality of Suzdal; his great
                    anxiety, however, was to make himself master of Kieff. The chief aim of his son
                    Andrew Bogoliubski was to extend his authority in another direction, and to
                    cause it to be recognized at Novgorod the Great, where he had established his
                    nephew as a kind of lieutenant. He attacked the city in 1170, but was completely
                    repulsed from its walls, a panic having seized his army. The Novgorodians put to
                    death many of their prisoners, and sold others as slaves, so that, to quote the
                    words of their chronicler, “six Suzdalians could be bought for a grivna,” an old
                    piece of money. In 1173 Andrew was also defeated by Mstislaff the Brave at
                    Smolensk, and in 1174 he was assassinated by his own nobles. The reign of Andrew
                    was in all respects an important one. From his refusing to divide his dominions
                    among his brothers and nephews, it is plain that he saw the evil effect of the
                    system of apanages and could conceive the idea of a united state. He was a man
                    of iron will, and an astute diplomatist rather than a great soldier. He thus had
                    something of the spirit of the Ivans, and anticipated their policy. He may be
                    said with truth to have been the last of the conspicuous rulers of Russia before
                    the Mongol invasions. As yet we have had but few worthy of the attention of the
                    historian. They are Rurik, the founder of the empire, Oleg the warrior, and Olga
                    the first Christian sovereign. To these succeed the warlike <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0921-0107-0090"/>Sviatoslaff, slain by the Petchenegs; Vladimir,
                    who caused the country to be Christianized; and Yaroslaff his son, the
                    legislator. During the second period, in which we find Russia weakened and
                    divided into apanages, we have only two noteworthy princes among a score of
                    unimportant persons,—Vladimir Monomakh and Andrew.</p>
                <p>The death of Andrew, whose murderers were not brought to justice, was followed by
                    many petty wars. The only event, however, of any importance for a considerable
                    time is the battle of Lipetsk (near Pereiaslavl Zaliesski) in 1215, in which
                    George, son of Vsevolod, brother of Andrew, was defeated by the combined troops
                    of Novgorod, Pskoff, and Smolensk. In 1220 we hear of Nijni-Novgorod being
                    founded. A prince of considerable importance was Roman of Volhynia, to whom the
                    inhabitants of Galicia offered the government of their principality, but he was
                    superseded by another Vladimir, and did not get the crown till after a great
                    deal of hard fighting. He is said by Kadlubek, the Polish historian, to have
                    acted with ferocious cruelty. In 1205 he was killed in a battle with the Poles.
                    In 1224 we have the first invasion of Russia by the Mongols. Daniel of Galicia
                    was one of the last of the Russian princes to make his submission to Batu
                    (1238). He died in 1264. In the 14th century the principality of Galicia was
                    lost in the Polish republic, having been annexed to Lithuania. It joined the
                    fortunes of that state in its union with Poland at the time of the marriage of
                    Jagietlo with Jadwiga.</p>
                <p>AVe now come to the third division of our subject— Russia under the yoke of the
                    Mongols, viz., from 1238 to 1462. This is indeed a dreary period, in which the
                    political and material development of the country was delayed by its complete
                    enslavement. The first occasion on which the Russians came into contact with
                    their Mongolian invaders was in 1224, when, in company with their allies, the
                    Polovtzes, they suffered a complete defeat on the banks of the Kalka, near where
                    it flows into the sea of Azoff, and adjoining the site of the present town of
                    Mariupol. On this occasion, however, the Mongols only marched a little way up
                    the river Dnieper, and retired after devastating the country. In 1238 they
                    reappeared, and after destroying Bolgari, the capital of the Finnish Bulgarians
                    on the Volga, advanced against Ryazan, which was plundered and burned, with
                    adjoining cities. They then defeated the army of Suzdal, at Kolomna, on the Oka;
                    after which they burned Moscow, Suzdal, Yaroslavl, and other important towns.
                    The grand-duke Yuri of Suzdal had encamped on the river Sit, almost on the
                    frontiers of the territory of Novgorod. He was there defeated and was
                    decapitated on the field of battle, while his nephew A’asilko had his throat cut
                    for refusing to serve Batu. After taking Tver and advancing within fifty leagues
                    of Novgorod, the Mongols turned south and occupied the two following years
                    (1239-1240) in ravaging southern Russia. They then burned Pereiaslavl and
                    Tchernigoff, and Mangu, the grandson of Jenghiz Khan, directed his march against
                    Kieff. The noise of the great host proceeding to the capture of the fated city
                    is graphically described by the chronicler. The city was taken and given up to
                    pillage, not even the graves being respected. A olhynia and Galicia followed the
                    fate of the other principalities, and all Russia was now under the yoke of the
                    Mongols, except the territory of Novgorod.</p>
                <p>The subsequent movements of these barbarians in Hungary and Moravia cannot be
                    described here. It will suffice to say that soon afterwards Batu turned
                    eastwards. He next founded on the Volga the city of Sarai (the Palace), which
                    became the capital of the powerful Mon-golian empire, the Golden Horde. Here
                    also congregated the remains of the Petchenegs, the Polovtzes, and other tribes,
                    and to these barbarians Russia was for a long time tributary. In 1272 the
                    Mongolian hordes embraced Islam. Yaroslaff, who entered into his territory of
                    Suzdal after the death of his brother Yuri, found his hereditary domains
                    completely devastated. He had commenced rebuilding the ruined town, when he was
                    summoned by Batu to do him homage in his new capital of Sarai. This, however,
                    was not considered sufficient, and the poor prince was obliged to betake himself
                    to the court of the great khan, which was at the further end of Asia, on the
                    banks of the river Amur. His title was confirmed, but on his return he died of
                    the fatigues of the journey. He was succeeded in Suzdal by his son Andrew
                    (1246-1252). His other son Alexander reigned at Novgorod the Great, and gained
                    the surname of Nevski from his celebrated victory over the Swedes in 1240. He
                    and Dmitri Donskoi are the only great figures of this period of national
                    abasement. Alexander Nevski has become consecrated in the memories of the
                    people, and is now one of the leading Russian saints. In spite, however, of his
                    services to the people of Novgorod, he afterwards quarrelled with them and
                    retired to Pereiaslavl Zaliesski. But the citizens were soon glad to betake
                    themselves to his help. On being invaded by the German Sword-bearing Knights,
                    who had established themselves in Livonia in the year 1201, and an army of
                    Finns, Alexander was summoned, like another Camillus, and defeated the enemy on
                    Lake Peipus in what was called the “Battle of the Ice” in 1242. He entered
                    Novgorod in triumph with his prisoners. In spite of all this brilliant success,
                    Alexander was unable to resist the power of the Golden Horde, and was obliged to
                    go to Sarai to do homage to the khan. He was accompanied by his brother Andrew.
                    The ceremony was always attended by many degrading acts of submission on the
                    part of the tributary prince. In 1260 the Novgorodians, who had so long
                    preserved the liberty of their republic uninjured, consented to submit to the
                    khan and pay tribute; Alexander died before reaching VIadimir on his return from
                    one of these humiliating journeys. A great part of western Russia was now
                    consolidated by the Lithuanian princes into a state, the capital of which was
                    Vilna and the language AVhite Russian. To this many of the western provinces of
                    Russia gravitated, and by the marriage of the Polish heiress Jadwiga with
                    Jagiefto of Lithuania these provinces went to Poland and were not reannexed to
                    Russia till a much later period. The eastern portion of Russia grouped itself
                    round Moscow, which is first heard of in the chronicles in 1147. We find four
                    considerable eastern states—Ryazan, Suzdal, Tver, and Moscow. For a century
                    after its foundation we hear nothing of this city, the name of which is
                    certainly Finnish. AVe are told that it was burned by the Mongols in 1237, and
                    that a brother of Alexander Nevski was killed there in 1248, in a battle against
                    the Lithuanians. We have seen that the political centre of the country has
                    constantly changed. From Novgorod it went to Kieff, from Kieff to Vladimir, the
                    capital of Suzdal, and from Vladimir to Moscow; we shall soon find that owing to
                    the vigorous policy of its rulers this principality became the nucleus of the
                    great Russian empire, and gathered round it the adjacent states. Its true
                    founder was Daniel, a son of Alexander Nevski, who added to it the cities of
                    Pereiaslavl Zaliesski and Kolomna. At his death in 1303 he was the first to be
                    buried in the church of St Michael the Archangel, where all the Russian
                    sovereigns were laid till the days of Peter the Great. Since that time, with the
                    exception of Peter IL, they have been interred in the church of the
                    Petro-pavlovski fortress at St Petersburg. Daniel was followed on the throne by
                    his sons Yuri and Ivan in succession. Yuri Danilovich (1303-1326) took
                    possession of Mozhaisk. The <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit21newyrich/page/n108/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0921-0108-0091"/>reign of Ivan Kalita, or the Purse (1328-1340),
                    still further strengthened the new principality. Tver was added, and the
                    pre-eminence of Moscow was assured by the metropolitan coming to reside there.
                    After Kalita came in succession his two sons, Simeon the Proud (1340-1353) and
                    Ivan II. (1353-1359). Simeon first took the title of grand-duke of all the
                    Russias. He died of the Black Death, which was then devastating Europe. In spite
                    of the efforts of these princes to maintain the supremacy of Moscow, on their
                    death the hegemony of the Russian states went again for a time to Suzdal. It was
                    Dmitri, surnamed Donskoi, the son of Ivan II., who won the battle of Kulikovo
                    (lit. “the field of woodcocks”) over Mamai, the Mongolian chief, in 1380. In
                    spite of this, however, Toktamish their general invaded Russia, burned Moscow to
                    the ground, and put to death a great number of the inhabitants. To Dmitri
                    succeeded his son Vasilii or Basil (1389-1425), who was prince both of Moscow
                    and Vladimir. He in turn was followed by Vasilii the Blind (1425-1462).</p>
                <p>We begin to touch firmer ground when we approach the reign of Ivan III., the son
                    of Vasilii, who may be considered the founder of the autocracy. We may take,
                    therefore, as our fourth division the period from 1462 to 1613, which will
                    include the consolidation of the empire under the vigorous rule of Ivan III.,
                    Basil V., and Ivan IV., the usurpation of Boris Godunoff, the reign of the false
                    Demetrius, and the troubles following upon it till the accession of the house of
                    Romanoff in the person of Michael in the year 1613. Ivan III. reigned
                    forty-three years, and had as much influence in the consolidation of Russia as
                    Louis XI. had in that of France. It was the great age when throughout Europe
                    absolute monarchies were being created on the ruins of feudalism. On his
                    accession Ivan found himself surrounded by powerful neighbours—to the east the
                    great principality of Lithuania, to the south the Mongols; Ryazan and Tver had
                    not been annexed to the territory of Muscovy; Novgorod and Pskoff were still
                    republics. It was against Novgorod, a wealthy city and a member of the Hanseatic
                    league, that his efforts were first directed. In consequence of its situation,
                    and by its paying the tribute demanded, it had escaped from the ravages which
                    other parts of Russia had undergone. Taking advantage of the factions which
                    harassed this city, he succeeded in creating a party subservient to his own
                    interests, and as early as 1470 had got the control of the government of the
                    city, which a rival faction was anxious to transfer to the Poles. In 1478 the
                    republic of Novgorod ceased to exist; the chief opponents of Ivan were
                    transported to Moscow, and their goods confiscated. The <hi rend="italic"
                    >veche,</hi> as the public assembly was called, was terminated for ever, and the
                    bell which had summoned the mutinous citizens carried off triumphantly to
                    Moscow. In 1495 the tyrant was so foolish as to confiscate the goods of many of
                    the German merchants who traded at Novgorod. In consequence of this nearly all
                    the foreigners left the city, and its prosperity rapidly declined. It is now a
                    decayed provincial town, interesting only to the antiquary. In 1489 Vyatka, a
                    daughter city of Pskoff, was annexed and lost thereby its republican
                    constitution. In 1464 by giving the hand of his sister to the prince of Ryazan
                    Ivan made sure of the proximate annexation of that apanage. He seized Tver and
                    joined it to his dominions, when the grand-prince Michael had allied himself
                    with Lithuania. The system of apanages in Russia had now to come to an end. But
                    Ivan, who had married the niece of the Byzantine emperor, and assumed as his
                    cognizance the two-headed eagle, was also to come into collision with the
                    hereditary enemies of Russia, the Mongols. The great power of the Golden Horde
                    had been broken up; on its ruins had arisen the empires of Kazan and of Sarai or
                    Astrakhan, the horde of the Nogais, and the khanate of the Crimea. In 1478, when
                    Ahmed, the khan of the Great Horde, whose capital was Sarai, sent his
                    ambassadors with his portrait, to which the Russian was to do homage, Ivan
                    trampled it under foot, and put to death all the envoys, except one, who was
                    deputed to take back the news to the khan. The reply of Ahmed to this outrage
                    was a declaration of war; and the two armies met on the banks of the Oka. Ivan,
                    who, like Louis XI., was much more of a diplomatist than a soldier, according to
                    the accounts of the chroniclers, was in great terror, and could not be induced
                    to fight by the persuasions of his soldiers or the benedictions of his
                    ecclesiastics. He had already, after the armies had been for some time encamped
                    opposite to each other, given the signal of retreat, when, in consequence of a
                    sudden panic the Mongols also retreated, and the armies fled from each other in
                    mutual fear. This invasion, which occurred in the year 1480, was the last great
                    inroad of the Asiatic enemies of Russia, but we shall find some even later than
                    the days of Ivan the Terrible, in whose time Moscow was burned by these
                    barbarians. Meanwhile Ivan went on in his career of annexation. In 1472 he
                    conquered Permia, in 1489 Vyatka. Ten years afterwards he had extended his
                    authority as far north as the Petchora. His good fortune seemed ever on the
                    increase; by a war with Alexander, king of Poland, he gained an accession of
                    territory to the west as far as the river Desna. Upon peace being concluded,
                    Alexander married Helen, the daughter of Ivan, but that monarch, on pretence
                    that no regard had been paid to his daughter’s religious scruples, declared war
                    against his new son-in-law. The Polish monarch could not rely upon the fidelity
                    of many of his vassals, as we find so often the case in Polish history, and
                    suffered a complete defeat at the battle of the Vedrosha. On the other hand, in
                    1501 the Russians were routed at the battle of the Siritza, near Isborsk, by the
                    grand-master of the Teutonic order, Hermann von Plettenberg. The order had been
                    established in Lithuania as early as 1225; the Sword-bearers amalgamated with
                    them in 1237.</p>
                <p>In 1472 Ivan had married a Byzantine princess, Sophia, daughter of Thomas,
                    brother of the emperor Constantine Palaeologus. This Thomas had fled to Rome
                    after the fall of Constantinople in 1453. In consequence of this mar-riage, a
                    great many Greeks came to Moscow, bringing Byzantine culture, such as it was, to
                    Russia, and among other things a quantity of valuable manuscripts, which formed
                    the nucleus of the synodal library. Italians also made their appearance in
                    Russia, among others the cele-brated Aristotle Fioraventi of Bologna, the
                    architect of so many buildings at Moscow. Ivan not only welcomed foreigners in
                    his dominions, but entered into relations with many European powers, among
                    others the Germans, the Venetians, and the Pope. His reign is remarkable, not
                    only for the consolidation of the Russian autocracy, but also for legislation.
                    In 1497 he issued his <hi rend="italic">Sudebnik,</hi> or Book of Laws, the
                    second Russian code after the <hi rend="italic">Russkaia Pravda</hi> of
                    Yaroslaff. Comparison of the two codes will show how much had been done by the
                    Mongols to lower the Russian character. It is in the reign of Ivan that we first
                    hear of the use. of the knout: an archimandrite and some noblemen were publicly
                    knouted for being concerned in forging a will. At his death Ivan bequeathed his
                    throne to his second son Vasilii or Basil, passing over his grandson, the child
                    of his eldest son Ivan, who had pre-deceased him; he was evidently unwilling to
                    commit his growing empire to the perils of a minority, Vasilii Ivan-ovich
                    (1505-1533) fully carried out the programme of his father. He destroyed the
                    independence of Pskoff in 1510, put an end to the <hi rend="italic">veche</hi>
                    or popular assembly, and carried <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit21newyrich/page/n109/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0921-0109-0092"/>off the bell which summoned the citizens. Thus
                    fell the last of the Slavonic republics. Ryazan was next added to the Muscovite
                    territory. The prince, being accused of having contracted an alliance with the
                    khan of the Crimea, tied to Lithuania, where he died in obscurity. Novgorod
                    Severski was annexed soon after, and by a war with Sigismund I. Basil got back
                    Smolensk. He was doomed, however, to suffer from an invasion of the Mongols of
                    the Crimea, and is said to have signed a humiliating treaty to save his capital,
                    whereby he acknowledged himself the tributary of the khan.</p>
                <p>Meanwhile at home Basil exercised absolute authority; Russia now exhibited the
                    spectacle of an Asiatic despotism. He entered into negotiations with many
                    foreign princes. Herberstein, the German ambassador, who has left us such an
                    interesting account of the Russia of this time, has told us of the great
                    splendour of his court. We now come to the reign of the terrible Ivan, who has
                    left his name written in blood upon the annals of Russia, and ruled for the long
                    period of fifty-one years (1533-1584). It was a fortunate thing for the
                    aggrandizement of the empire that, instead of having a succession of weak
                    sovereigns, who only ruled a short time, it had three such vigorous potentates
                    as Ivan III., Basil, and Ivan IV., whose united reigns extended over a hundred
                    and twenty-two years. The grand-duke Basil at his death left two sons, Ivan and
                    Yuri, under the guardianship of his second wife Helen Glinska. She had come into
                    Russia from Lithuania, her family having been proscribed by the Polish king
                    Alexander on the accusation of having plotted against his life. The
                    grand-duchess ruled with great ability, but died in 1538, having been, as is
                    supposed, poisoned. The two young princes then became the victims of the
                    intrigues of the chief families, especially those of Shuiski and Belski. Ivan
                    early gave proof of a vigorous understanding, whereas his younger brother Yuri
                    appears to have been half-witted. In 1543, when only in his thirteenth year,
                    Ivan determined to emancipate himself from the galling yoke of the boiars, and
                    by a kind of <hi rend="italic">coup el'etat</hi> threw off their tutelage, and
                    caused Shuiski to be torn to pieces by dogs. After this, for some time, he was
                    under the influence of his maternal relations. In January 1547 Ivan was crowned
                    by the metropolitan Macarius, and took the title of czar, or tsar, a Slavonic
                    form of the Latin Caesar. He soon afterwards celebrated his marriage with
                    Anastasia Romanova. The same year a great conflagration took place at Moscow.
                    The mob affected to believe that this had been caused by the Glinskis, who were
                    very unpopular, and massacred a member of that family.</p>
                <p>After this time Ivan seems to have committed himself very much to the guidance of
                    the priest Silvester and Alexis Adasheff. This was the happiest portion of his
                    reign, for he was also greatly under the influence of his amiable wife. To this
                    period also belongs a recension of the <hi rend="italic">Sudebnik</hi> of his
                    grandfather Ivan III. (1550), and the <hi rend="italic">Stoglaff,</hi> or Book
                    of the Hundred Chapters, by which the affairs of the church were regulated
                    (1551). In the following year Ivan became master of Kazan, and two years later
                    of Astrakhan. The power of the Mongols was no.v almost broken. Triumphant in the
                    south and the east, he then turned his attention to the north, being anxious to
                    open up a means of communication with the west. He anticipated the plans which
                    Peter the Great was destined to carry out long afterwards. He was thus brought
                    into collision with the Swedes and the Teutonic Knights. When Ivan sent a German
                    named Schlitt to procure the assistance of some foreign artisans, they were
                    stopped by the Germans and prevented from entering Russian territory. In
                    consequence of this, war afterwards broke out between Ivan and the Order. In
                    1558 the</p>
                <p>Russian army invaded Livonia, and took several towns, whereupon the Order made an
                    alliance with Sigismund Augustus of Poland. But, while Russia was busy with this
                    war, a great change was taking place in the home policy of Ivan. He threw off
                    the influence of Silvester and Adasheff, who were both banished. From this time
                    may be said to date the commencement of the atrocities of this czar which have
                    earned him the epithet constantly added to his name. He was especially moved by
                    the treason of Prince Andrew Kurbski, who, having lost a battle with the Poles,
                    was too much afraid of the wrath of his imperial master to venture again into
                    his clutches. He accordingly fled to the king of Poland, by whom he was well
                    received, and from his safe retreat he commenced an angry correspondence with
                    the czar, reproaching him with his cruelties (see below, p. 104). The answer of
                    Ivan has been preserved. In it he dwells upon the degrading subjection in which
                    he had been kept by his early advisers, and attempts to justify his cruelties by
                    saying that they were only his slaves whom he had killed, over whom God had
                    given him power of life and death.</p>
                <p>In December 1564 Ivan retired with a few personal friends to his retreat at
                    Alexandrovskoe, near Moscow, where he passed his time pretty much as Louis XI.
                    did at Plessy-les-Tours, for he resembled the French monarch both in his cruelty
                    and his superstition. The boiars, afraid that the monarch was about to quit them
                    for ever, went in crowds to Alexandrovskoe to supplicate him to return to
                    Moscow. This he finally consented to do, and on his return established his
                    bodyguard of <hi rend="italic">oprùhniks,</hi> who were the chief agents of his
                    cruelty. In the year in which he retired to Alexandrovskoe we have the
                    establishment of a printing-press at Moscow. Ivan now commenced a long series of
                    cruelties. To this period belong the deposition and perhaps murder of Philip,
                    the archbishop of Moscow; the execution of Alexandra, the widow of his brother
                    Yuri; the atrocities committed at Novgorod, which seems to have fallen under the
                    tyrant’s vengeance for having meditated opening its gates to the king of Poland;
                    and, lastly, the terrible butcheries on the Red Square <hi rend="italic"
                    >[Krasnaia Plostchad).</hi></p>
                <p>It was in the reign of Ivan that the English first had dealings with Russia. In
                    1553, while Edward VI. was on the throne, three ships were sent out under
                    Willoughby and Chancellor to look for a north-east passage to China and India.
                    Willoughby and the crews of two of the ships were frozen to death, but
                    Chancellor arrived safely in the White Sea, and thence proceeded to the court of
                    Ivan, by whom he was favourably received. The English secured great trading
                    privileges from Ivan, and established factories in the country. In one of his
                    mad sallies, Ivan actually wrote to Queen Elizabeth (1570) asking for a safe
                    retreat in her dominions if he should be driven out by his own subjects.</p>
                <p>Ivan was continually waging war in the Baltic territory with the Teutonic
                    Knights, in which, although on the whole unsuccessful, he committed great
                    cruelties. But in 1571 he was obliged to suffer another invasion of the Mongols
                    of the Crimea, who, to quote the quaint language of an English resident, burned
                    “the Mosco every stick” (Hakluyt’s <hi rend="italic">Voyages,</hi> i. 402). On
                    the death of Sigismund Augustus of Poland in 1572, when the crown of that
                    country had become elective, the family of the Jagiettos being now extinct, Ivan
                    declared himself one of the competitors. The successful candidate was the French
                    prince Henry of Valois, but he soon fled from his new kingdom, and, on the
                    throne again becoming vacant, the redoubtable Stephen Batory was chosen, who
                    proved a formidable foe to the tyrant now growing old. In consequence of the
                    successes of Stephen, Ivan was obliged to abandon all his <pb break="no"

                    passage for Russia into the Baltic failed till carried out by the efforts of
                    Peter the Great.</p>
                <p>One of the chief events of this reign was the conquest of Siberia by a Cossack
                    named Yermak, who had formerly been a robber, but was pardoned by the czar on
                    laying his conquests at the imperial feet. Among many points in which Ivan
                    resembled Henry VIII. was the number of his wives. On the death of the seventh,
                    he was anxious to procure an eighth from the court of his friend Elizabeth of
                    England, and the daughter of the Earl of Huntingdon was offered to the
                    inspection of the Russian ambassador, Feodor Pisemski, at her own desire and the
                    queen’s. She was presented to him in the gardens of York House. The ambassador
                    prostrated himself before her, and professed to be dazzled by her beauty.
                    Before, however, the negotiations for the marriage were concluded, the young
                    lady, of whom a very favourable account had been transmitted to the court of
                    Moscow, became alarmed. Rumours had reached her about the former wives of the
                    czar and his habits. She therefore declined the brilliant prospect of an
                    alliance associated with so many dangers. Full details of the adventures of the
                    Englishmen who resided at Ivan’s court will be found in Hakluyt’s <hi
                    rend="italic">Voyages.</hi> In 1567 Anthony Jenkinson was commissioned by the
                    czar to convey a special message to Queen Elizabeth, “that the Queen’s Majestie
                    and he might be to all their enemyes joyned as one, and that England and
                    Russland might be in all manners as one.” In fact Ivan wanted the assistance of
                    the English in his wars against the Swedes and the Poles; he could appreciate
                    the superiority of their weapons and military tactics; but Elizabeth only cared
                    to secure a monopoly of trade, which the English for a long time enjoyed, and,
                    according to the historian Ustrialoff, the Russians were but little benefited by
                    it.</p>
                <p>The declining days of Ivan were embittered by the death of his eldest son, whom
                    he had stricken in a fit of passion with his iron staff. When the paroxysm of
                    his anger was over, his grief was boundless. Full of remorse and continually
                    afraid of conspiracies which might be concocted by his subjects, and harassed by
                    superstitious dread, in which he betook himself to the divination of witches,

                <p>Ivan was succeeded by his eldest surviving son Feodor (Theodore), at that time
                    twenty-seven years of age. He was feeble both in mind and body, and very
                    superstitious. Fletcher calls him “very simple, and almost a natural,” and

                    that he was so weak-minded that he could find no greater amusement than tolling
                    the church bells before service. In consequence, the chief power in the empire
                    fell into the hands of Boris Godunoff, <note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>He was of Mongol descent,—his ancestor being a certain Murza
                    Tchet. </p></note> the brother-in-law of Feodor, a man of boundless ambition and
                    great capacity. His inordinate lust of rule he concealed under the guise of
                    piety; his commanding presence extorted respect wherever he went. Between him
                    and the throne were only the sickly Feodor and his brother Dmitri, still a
                    child, who had been previously removed to the town of Uglich in the government
                    of Yaroslavl. For a while Boris had nourished the idea of proclaiming Dmitri
                    illegitimate, on the ground that he was the son of Ivan’s seventh wife, a
                    marriage forbidden by the canons of the church. Finally, as there seems every
                    reason to believe, he caused the child to be assassinated at Uglich on the 15th
                    of May 1591. The circumstances of the death of the young prince are involved in
                    mystery; so much, however, is certain. Dmitri was playing in a court-yard; his
                    gover ness Vasilissa Volokhova, his nurse, and a servant-maid were in
                    attendance. Whether from accident or design they all for a time lost sight of
                    him. According to their testimony while under examination, the young prince had
                    a knife in his hand when last seen; he amused himself with sticking it into the
                    ground and cutting pieces of wood. Suddenly the nurse, on looking round, saw him
                    prostrate and covered with blood. He died almost immediately from a large wound
                    in his throat. The account of how the news was brought to Moscow is described in
                    a highly dramatic manner by Horsey. <note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    We have no direct evidence of the complicity of Godunoff in this murder; but
                    there seems little doubt of it. A secret inquiry was conducted; the body,
                    however, was not examined, and the commissioners reported that Dmitri had died
                    of a wound accidentally inflicted by himself in a fit of epilepsy. On account of
                    the riot which had taken place at Uglich, Boris proceeded to punish the town.
                    More than two hundred of the inhabitants were put to death and many sent to
                    Siberia. The church bell of Uglich was banished with them and placed in the
                    capital of Siberia; it was not brought back till the earlier part of the present
                    century. The remains of Dmitri, who was afterwards canonized, were deposited in
                    the cathedral of St Michael, the burial-place of the czars. Soon afterwards a
                    great fire broke out in Moscow, and Boris caused many streets to be rebuilt at
                    his own expense, distributed aid, and exempted the sufferers from taxes; but
                    still the people murmured secretly; they felt that the stain of blood was upon
                    him, and ungratefully accused him of having caused the city to be set on fire.
                    In the same year (1591) the khan of the Crimea made one of his periodical raids
                    against Moscow. He set out from Perekop, and marched in a straight line,
                    everywhere plundering and devastating. In these circumstances, Feodor displayed
                    nothing but imbecility. He merely remarked that the saints who protected Russia
                    would fight for her, and again betook himself to his favourite amusement of
                    bell-ringing. Boris, however, showed vigour. In a few days he caused Moscow to
                    be surrounded with palisades, redoubts, and artillery. The Mongols were repulsed
                    with great slaughter; but, although Boris saved his country, he could not secure
                    the goodwill of the people. Indeed, they accused him of having invited the
                    Mongols that the general danger might make them forget the death of Dmitri. The
                    czarina, Irene, wife of Feodor and sister of Boris, about this time gave birth
                    to a female child, which lived but a few days, and Boris was of course accused
                    of having poisoned it. In reality the princess suffered from continual
                    ill-health, and on one occasion we find Elizabeth of England sending her a
                    physician. Boris, however, still persevered in his energetic measures for
                    strengthening the empire. Smolensk was fortified, Archangel built; and a strong
                    cordon was drawn round the territories occupied by the Mongols. The Swedes were
                    driven into Narva, and diplomatic relations were opened with the European
                    powers.</p>
                <p>About this time the imbecile Feodor died, and with him became extinct the dynasty
                    of Scandinavian Rurik. This event occurred in 1598, and Boris was elected to
                    succeed him. Godunoff, however, who felt sure of the crown, at first affected to
                    be unwilling to receive it. He retired to a monastery and was followed by the
                    people, supplicating him to be their emperor. He kept Russia in this state of
                    suspense for six weeks, and then relented. As soon as he ascended the throne,
                    the traces of his vigorous hand could be found everywhere. One of his first
                    plans was the abridgment of the power of the nobility, which had been begun by
                    Ivan III. and continued by Ivan IV. By this a benefit was conferred upon Russia;
                    but Boris also served his own ambition. He was particularly severe to <pb

                    xml:id="kp-eb0921-0111-0094"/>all members of the Romanoff family, because they
                    were allied to the house of Rurik, and troubled his dreams of sovereignty. The
                    head of this house was compelled to become a monk; his son, however, was
                    destined to ascend the throne. A famine broke out in 1601, which Boris was
                    unsparing in his efforts to allay. In the midst of all this suffering a rumour
                    spread that Dmitri, the youngest son of Ivan the Terrible, was not dead.</p>
                <p>One day in the year 1603 Prince Adam Wisniowiecki, of Bragin in Lithuania,
                    happening to be very angry with a servant, struck him and used an insulting
                    epithet. The young man, with tears in his eyes, said, “If you knew who I am, you
                    would not treat me so nor call me by that name.” “Who then are you, and whence
                    do you come ?” replied the astonished prince. “I am the prince Dmitri, son of
                    Ivan Vasilievich.” He then recounted a well-concocted tale of his miraculous
                    escape from the assassin whom Boris had employed. This was his physician, who
                    feigned compliance with the usurper’s designs, but only to frustrate them. On
                    the night appointed for the murder, the man, whose name was Simon, put the son
                    of a serf into his young master’s bed (who was accordingly killed), and
                    immediately fled with Dmitri from Uglich. He was then committed to the care of a
                    loyal gentleman, who thought it better for the sake of protection that he should
                    enter a monastery. This gentleman and the physician were dead, but in
                    confirmation of his story the false Dmitri exhibited a seal, bearing the arms
                    and name of the prince, and a golden cross set with jewels which he said was the
                    baptismal gift of his godfather, Prince Ivan Mstislavski. Wisniowiecki believed
                    his tale. There were also other supposed signs. <note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>The present writer doubts the genuineness of
                    this claimant; many authors, however, some of them contemporaries, were
                    convinced that he was the real son of Ivan, and among these the first place must
                    be assigned to the French mercenary captain Margeret, whose intimate relations
                    with the man point him out as a valuable authority. This clever adventurer had
                    entered the Russian service in the time of Boris Godunoff, and was a witness of
                    the whole struggle. At first he led the troops of the latter against Dmitri, but
                    when the pretender had established his authority he accepted a post in his
                    service. He has given us an interesting portrait of Dmitri, of whom he speaks
                    very favourably, in his work on Russia published at Paris in 1669. </p></note>
                    The Polish nobles thronged around the young man, whose manners, as we read in
                    the case of Perkin Warbeck, seemed to bear out his pretensions. Meanwhile Dmitri
                    remained in Poland, enjoying all the lavish attentions of the Polish nobility.
                    Boris was soon made acquainted with his appearance on the scene, and offered the
                    brothers Wisniowiecki money and lands if they would surrender the impostor to
                    him. Without, however, replying to these overtures, they removed him into the
                    interior of Poland, and he was received with royal honours by George Mniszek,
                    the palatine of Sandomir. Here he is said to have entered into a secret
                    understanding with the Jesuits to bring over Russia to the Latin faith, on
                    condition of being supported by the papal nuncio. <note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>According to some authors, the whole plot had
                    been concocted by the Jesuits for this purpose. For the contrary view, however,

                    Gerard Muller tells us that the’pretender “conversed in Latin and Polish with
                    fluency;” if this had been the case his knowledge of the former would be easily
                    explained by his Jesuitical training. Margeret, however, denies it altogether.
                    “Il est très certain qu’il ne parloit nullement Latin, j’en puis temoigner,
                    moins le sçavoit-il lire et écrire” (p. 163). </p></note> The pretender
                    privately abjured the Greek faith, and signed a contract of marriage with
                    Marina, the youngest daughter of Mniszek, by which he settled upon her the towns
                    of Novgorod and Pskoff, and engaged to pay her father a million of florins as
                    soon as he had ascended the throne. Afterwards he executed another treaty ceding
                    Smolensk and the surrounding territory to Mniszek and the king of Poland. These
                    proceedings were not likely to recommend him to his Russian subjects. For the
                    present they were concealed, and Dmitri publicly professed the Greek ritual.
                    Soon after this Sigismund of Poland saluted him as czar of Moscow, and assigned
                    him a pension of 40,000 florins. All this time Boris affected to regard the
                    pretender with contempt, and issued a manifesto setting forth that his real name
                    was Grishka (or Gregory) Otrepieff, a renegade monk. Whether this individual was
                    •really the man who personated Dmitri, the son of Ivan, cannot be known for
                    certain; but it seems very probable. Karamzin has adopted this view. Boris soon
                    issued a proclamation against him, calling him an apostate monk, who wished to
                    introduce the Latin heresy into Russia, and to build Romish churches in the
                    Orthodox land. Dmitri entered that country ou the 3lst of October 1604, and
                    marched on Moravsk in Tchernigoff. He met with uninterrupted success, large
                    numbers joining his expedition, and the authorities of the chief towns on his
                    route offering him bread and salt till he came to Novgorod Severski on the 23d
                    of November. This well-fortified place was defended by Basmanoff, a veteran
                    captain, with five hundred streltzi On the arrival of the pretender he was
                    summoned to capitulate, but, standing on the ramparts with a lighted match, he
                    replied: “The grand-prince and czar is at Moscow; as for your Dmitri he is a
                    robber, who shall be impaled, along with his accomplices.” After three months
                    the invaders abandoned the siege, but they had the good fortune soon afterwards
                    to seize a large sum of money which Boris was sending to some of the towns.
                    Shortly after this the important fortresses of Putivl, Sievsk, and Voronezh
                    surrendered to Dmitri. Boris was too ill to go in person against the impostor;
                    he, however, raised an army of fifty thousand men. A great battle took place
                    near Novgorod, and the supporters of the czar would have suffered a most
                    ignominious defeat had it not been for Basmanoff. This captain was recalled to
                    Moscow and loaded with honours by Boris, who, from motives not very evident,
                    unless he had begun to have suspicions of his fidelity, detained him in the
                    city, and committed the care of the new army which he had formed to Shuiski, who
                    was probably only half-hearted in his cause. A great battle took place on the 2d
                    of January 1605, on the plain of Dobrînichi, not far from Orel; here Dmitri was
                    defeated, chiefly through the bravery of the foreign legion. He would have been
                    captured had it not been for the fidelity of his Cossack infantry—for at this
                    time the Cossacks were subject to Poland—who were killed to a man, and probably
                    not a fugitive would have reached Sievsk had not Shuiski acted with duplicity.
                    Meanwhile, the pretender rode as fast as his horse would carry him to Putivl, a
                    strong town on the frontier, from which he could easily beat a retreat into
                    Poland. The followers of Boris remained at Dobrinichi, putting to death their
                    prisoners. The conduct of Shuiski showed with what apathy he viewed the cause of
                    his master; he soon drew off his troops into winter quarters, alleging that
                    nothing more could be done that season, and also wasted time before Kromî, an
                    insignificant place. Meanwhile Dmitri corrupted some of the chief generals of
                    Boris. An attempt to poison him soon afterwards failed, and the pretender sent a
                    message to Boris, recommending him to descend from the throne which he had
                    usurped. But the days of the latter were numbered. On the 13th of April 1605 he
                    presided as usual at the council-board, and received some distinguished
                    foreigners. A grand banquet was given, but suddenly after dinner he was seized
                    with illness; blood burst from his nose, ears, and mouth, and in the brief
                    period before his death, according to the Russian custom, the dress of a monk
                    was thrust upon him, and he was <pb break="no"

                    >Bogolep</hi> (“acceptable to God ”). He expired in the fifty-third year of his
                    age, after a reign of six years. Whether he committed suicide or was poisoned
                    cannot now be ascertained; his death could hardly have been natural. Boris was a
                    man of great energy of character, with views singularly in advance of his age.
                    In some respects he anticipated the plans of Peter the Great; thus he caused
                    several young Russians to be sent abroad to be educated, some of whom came to
                    England. By a ukaze, however, binding the peasant to the soil, he began the
                    system which reduced him by degrees to a condition of abject serfdom.</p>
                <p>Boris had left a sufficient number of partisans at Moscow to proclaim his son
                    Feodor, a youth of sixteen, and all classes took the oath of allegiance to him.
                    Shuiski and Mstislavski returned to Moscow to assist the young czar in the
                    government. Basmanoff was sent to take the command of the army, but, probably
                    feeling the cause of Feodor to be desperate, on the 7th of May he proclaimed
                    Dmitri. He was now ordered to march on the capital. Feodor, however, and his
                    adherents still held the Kremlin with a large garrison. Accordingly it was
                    resolved to make an attempt on Krasnoe Selo, a large town near Moscow, where
                    many wealthy merchants resided. This was easily taken, whereupon many of its
                    citizens marched to Moscow, and convoking the people called upon them to
                    acknowledge Dmitri as their sovereign. Feodor and his mother were murdered, and
                    buried in a cemetery outside the city walls, whither also the remains of Boris
                    were carried, for they were not allowed sepulture among the tombs of the czars.
                    Petreius, the Swedish envoy, who has left us an interesting account of these
                    times, tells us that the rumour was circulated that these unhappy people had
                    poisoned themselves, but he himself saw their bodies, and the marks on their
                    necks of the cords with which they had been strangled. According to some
                    authorities, Xenia, the daughter of Boris, described as beautiful by the old
                    Russian chronicler Kubasoff, was forced to retire into a convent, but Petreius
                    declares that she was compelled to become the mistress of the conqueror. The
                    usurper now hearing that every obstacle was removed, marched upon the capital,
                    which lie entered on June 20, 1605. We have not space to detail the splendours
                    of his retinue, nor the ceremonies and feastings which attended his arrival. He
                    acted at first with prudence and conciliation towards his new subjects, and even
                    promised to pay the debts of his father Ivan. He received his mother with
                    transports of joy; she professed to identify him, although she afterwards denied
                    that he was her son. She was probably, however, glad enough to get out of the
                    convent into which she had been thrust by Boris. But Dmitri soon gave offence on
                    account of his neglect of Russian etiquette and superstitious observances. It
                    was plain that he held the Greek Orthodox religion very cheap, and his subjects
                    could see that he had a propensity for the Latin heresy. In the following year
                    Marina Mniszek, his bride, made her appearance in Moscow, and the marriage took
                    place on the 18th of May. It was followed by continued banquets. But a rebellion
                    broke out on the 29th, at the head of which was Vasilii Shuiski, whom Dmitri had
                    spared when about to be executed. The czar, hearing a noise in the night, and
                    finding himself surrounded by enemies, opened a window 30 feet from the ground,
                    leapt down, and broke his leg. He was soon afterwards found and killed.
                    Basmanoff was slain while attempting to defend his master. The corpse of the
                    impostor was afterwards burned. Marina was not killed, although there was a
                    great massacre of the Poles in every quarter of Moscow; she and the ladies of
                    her suite were kept as prisoners. Thus ended this remarkable episode of Russian
                    history. The whole period has been aptly termed by the national historians “the
                    Period of Troubles” <hi rend="italic">(Smutnoye Vremya).</hi></p>
                <p>The boiars, on being convoked after the murder of Dmitri, elected Vasilii
                    Ivanovich Shuiski for their sovereign, but he found himself in every way
                    disadvan-tageously situated, without an army and without money. He was,
                    moreover, troubled by an announcement which gained credence among the people
                    that Dmitri was not really dead. To put an end to these rumours, Shuiski,
                    entirely changing his policy, and contradicting his previous assertions, sent to
                    Uglich for the body of the unfortunate prince, and caused him to be canonized.
                    Two subsequent impostors, who gave themselves out to be Dmitri, were taken and
                    executed. To complete the misfortunes of Russia, the country was invaded by the
                    Poles in 1609, who laid siege to Smolensk. Shuiski was defeated at Klushino (a
                    village situated to the north-east of Moscow), was taken prisoner, and was set
                    free, to become a monk,—a favourite way of treating troublesome persons in
                    Russia. He was afterwards delivered over to Sigismund, who kept him in prison
                    during the rest of his life. The crown was finally offered to Ladislaus, the son
                    of Sigismund, who in reality for two years was sovereign of Russia, and caused
                    money to be coined in his name at Moscow. Everything seemed to portend the ruin
                    of the country, when it was saved by the bravery of Minin, the butcher of
                    Nijni-Novgorod, who roused the citizens to arms by his patriotic appeal, and was
                    joined by Prince Pozharski. The latter took the command of the army; the
                    administrative department was handed over to the former. The brave prince
                    succeeded in driving the Poles from Russia. In 1612 the boiars resolved to elect
                    a new czar, but they did not actually meet till 1613, and many debates ensued.
                    The sufferings of the country had been great; a considerable part of the city of
                    Moscow (with the exception of the Kremlin and the churches built of stone) was
                    laid in ashes. The treasury was plundered, and its contents sent to Poland.
                    Among other things Olearius, the traveller of the 17th century, quaintly adds,
                    “the Russians lost the horn of a unicorn of great value, set with precious
                    stones,” which was also carried off to Poland; and he tells us that even up to
                    his time the Muscovites bitterly regretted that they had been robbed of it.
                    Princes Mstislavski and Pozharski refused the crown, and finally the name of
                    Michael Romanoff, a youth of sixteen, was put forward as a candidate, chiefly on
                    account of the virtues of his father Philarete. The Romanoffs were connected on
                    the female side with the house of Rurik, Anastasia Romanova having been the
                    first wife of Ivan the Terrible. Before being allowed to ascend the throne, the
                    youthful sovereign, according to some authors, took a constitutional oath. The
                    condition of the country all this time was most critical; large portions of its
                    territory were in the hands of the Swedes and Poles, and the villages were
                    plundered by wandering bands of Cossacks. Ladislaus the son of Sigismund had not
                    yet renounced the title of czar; in 1617 he appeared with an invading army under
                    the walls of Moscow, but was repulsed, and on December 1, 1618, consented to
                    abandon his claims, and conclude an armistice for fourteen years. In 1617 a
                    treaty had been made at Stolbovo, a town near Lake Ladoga, by which the Russians
                    had been compelled to give up a large portion of their territory to the Swedes.
                    Philarete, the father of Michael, who had been for some time imprisoned at
                    Warsaw, was now allowed to return; he entered Moscow in 1619, and was elected
                    patriarch, an office which had been vacant since the death of Hermogenes.
                    Michael associated his father with himself in his power; all ukazes <pb

                    held a separate court, and always sat at the right hand of the sovereign. The
                    patriarchate was suppressed in 1721 by Peter the Great, who had formed the idea
                    of making himself head of tho church from what he saw in England and other
                    Protestant countries. The reign of Michael was not very eventful; he employed it
                    wisely in ameliorating the condition of the country, which had recently suffered
                    so much, and in improving the condition of his army. Foreigners began to visit
                    the country in great numbers, and Russia was gradually opening itself to Western
                    civilization. Gustavus Adolphus of Sweden induced the czar to sign a treaty
                    offensive and defensive, and a Swedish ambassador appeared at the Russian court.
                    The sufferings which had been inflicted upon them by the Poles made the Russians
                    eager to join an alliance which was directed against the Roman Catholic
                    religion. In 1629 a French ambassador appeared at Moscow. Dutch and German
                    artisans were taken into the Russian service to assist in the iron-foundries,
                    with special view to the manufacture of cannon. The country swarmed with English
                    merchants who had obtained valuable privileges. Scottish adventurers were to be
                    met with in the Russian army in great numbers. We And them as early as the reign
                    of Ivan the Terrible, to judge from Horsey’s <hi rend="italic">Diary.</hi> The
                    false Demetrius, like Louis XI., had a Scottish guard. In Russian documents we
                    find the names of Carmichaels, Hamiltons (frequently in the corrupted Russified
                    form of Khomutoff), Bruces, Gordons, and Dalziels. From Scottish settlers in
                    Russia sprang the celebrated poet Lermontoff, the first two syllables of whose
                    name fully show his Caledonian origin.</p>
                <p>The following are the leading events of the reign of Alexis, who succeeded to the
                    throne on the death of his father Michael in 1645. (1) First comes his
                    codification of the Russian laws (called <hi rend="italic">Ulozhxnie),</hi>
                    which was based on the preceding codes of Ivans III. and IV. By the order of the
                    czar, a commission of ecclesiastical and lay members was appointed to examine
                    the existing laws, and make any necessary additions, or to adapt to present
                    needs any which had become obsolete. The work was chiefly carried on by Princes
                    Odoievski and Volkonski, with the assistance of two secretaries. They were
                    engaged over it two months and a half, and the original code is still preserved
                    in the Oruzhennaia Palata at Moscow. Ustrialoff boasts that, by recognizing the
                    equality of all men in the eyes of the law, it anticipated a principle which was
                    not generally acknowledged in western Europe till the 18th century. This
                    doctrine, however, may be considered as only a natural consequence of autocracy.
                    We are told that Alexis allowed access to all petitioners, and at his favourite
                    village of Kolomenskoe, opposite his bed-room window, was placed a tin box; as
                    soon as the czar rose and appeared at the window the suppliants came forward
                    with their complaints, and, making an obeisance, placed them in the box, which
                    was afterwards taken to him. (2) The second great event of his reign was the
                    incorporation of the Ukraine and country of the Cossacks with Russia. For a
                    description of the causes of this war, see Poland. (3) By the treaty of
                    Andruszowo the Russians gained Smolensk, Tchernigoff, and finally Kieff, the
                    Dnieper being the new boundary, and thus the towns which had been taken by the
                    Lithuanians and annexed to Poland by the treaty of Lublin (1569) became Russian
                    again. The only other events of the reign of Alexis of any importance are the
                    great riot at Moscow, on account of the depreciation of the coinage in 1648, and
                    the rebellion of Stenka Razin, a Cossack. The riot is fully described in the
                    interesting letter of an eyewitness which is preserved in the Ashmolean
                    Collection at Oxford. Razin devastated the country round the Volga, and
                    continued his depredations for three years. Alexis, however, captured him, and
                    pardoned him on condition of his taking the oath of allegiance. He soon,
                    however, broke out into rebellion again, and proclaimed himself the enemy of the
                    nobles, and the restorer of the liberty of the people. By various artifices he
                    succeeded in alluring two hundred thousand men to his standard. Astrakhan was
                    surrendered to him, and he ruled from Nijni-Novgorod to Kazan. He was, however,
                    like Pugatcheff in the reign of Catherine II., a vulgar robber and nothing more.
                    His atrocities disgusted the more respectable of his adherents; his forces were
                    gradually dispersed, and in 1671 he was taken to Moscow and executed. The czar
                    Alexis died in 1676 in his forty-eighth year. One of the most eminent men of his
                    reign was Ordin-Nastchokin, who negotiated the peace of Andruszowo. Alexis was a
                    man of broad views, and made many efforts to raise Russia to the level of a
                    European power, by sending competent men as ambassadors to foreign parts, and
                    developing the trade of the country. In these respects he resembled Boris
                    Godunoff. Altogether his reign was one of distiuct progress for Russia.</p>
                <p>He was succeeded by his eldest son Feodor, by his first wife Maria Miloslavskaia.
                    Feodor (1676-1682) was a prince of weak health, and his reign was uneventful. A
                    notable occurrence was the destruction of the <hi rend="italic">Tozriadnie
                    knigi,</hi> or books of pedigrees. According to the <hi rend="italic"
                    >vιiestni-chestυο</hi> no man could take any office which was inferior to any
                    which his ancestors had held, or could be subordinate to any man who reckoned
                    fewer ancestors than himself. Feodor, however, finding to what interminable
                    quarrels these pedigrees gave rise, both at court and in the camp, hit upon a
                    bold plan, said to have been suggested by his minister Vasilii Golitzin. He
                    caused all the families to deliver their pedigrees into court that they might be
                    examined, under pretext of ridding them of any errors which might have crept in.
                    The nobles were convoked; and the czar, assisted by the clergy, caused their
                    books to be burned before their eyes.</p>
                <p>On the death of Feodor, there seemed every probability that the empire would fall
                    into a complete state of anarchy. The czar Alexis had been twice married: his
                    first wife Maria Miloslavskaia bore him two sons, Feodor and Ivan, and several
                    daughters; his second, Natalia Narishkina, was the mother of Peter and a
                    daughter Natalia. The court was rent by the rival factions of the Miloslavskis
                    and the Narishkins. Ivan was even more infirm than Feodor and the Narishkins
                    strove to bring it about that he should be set aside and Peter should be
                    elected. Sophia, however, the daughter of Alexis by his first wife, was a woman
                    of singular energy of character, the more remarkable on account of the little
                    attention paid to the education of women in Russia and the cloistered and
                    spiritless lives they were compelled to lead. According to some accounts she was
                    a woman altogether wanting in personal attractions. Perry, however, the engineer
                    employed by Peter the Great, speaks of her as good-looking. But the position of
                    the women of the imperial family was even worse than that of the generality;
                    they were not allowed to marry subjects, and in consequence the majority of them
                    led a life of enforced celibacy. Sophia was the favourite daughter of her
                    father, and was assiduous in her attentions to him during his last illness. One
                    of her brothers being an imbecile and the other a child, she hoped to wield the
                    sceptre. She fomented a revolt of the streltzî, and, instigated by her
                    harangues, they murdered some of the family and partisans of the Narishkins. Not
                    content with slaying one of the czarina’s brothers at the beginning of the
                    rebellion, they afterwards dragged another from his hiding-place and cut him to
                    pieces.</p>
                <p>The result of all these disturbances was that Ivan and <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0921-0114-0097"/>Peter were declared joint-sovereigns, and Sophia
                    was to be regent during their minority. She appointed Vasilii Golitzin to be
                    commander-in-chief of the forces. He marched against the Mongols of the Crimea,
                    but owing to the length of the journey and sufferings of the troops w <hi
                    rend="superscript">r</hi> as able to effect but little. In 1689 Peter married
                    Eudokia Lopukhina; but the union was by no means a happy one. Two sons were born
                    to Peter, Alexander and Alexis; the first lived six months only, the latter
                    survived to make a sad figure in Russian history. Next we have another revolt of
                    the streltzî, said to have been instigated by Sophia and Golitzin. It is even
                    alleged that the object of this conspiracy was to put Peter to death. His cause,
                    however, prevailed, and the rebels were punished with great severity. Golitzin’s
                    life was spared, but all his property was taken from him. Sophia was now
                    permanently incarcerated in a convent under the name of Susanna, where she
                    remained till her death fifteen years afterwards, at the age of forty-six. Thus
                    from 1689 dates the actual rule of Peter. His brother Ivan, infirm both in body
                    and mind, had but little share in the government; his faculties both of sight
                    and speech are said to have been very imperfect. He took a wife, however, and
                    had three daughters, concerning one of whom, at least, we have much more to
                    hear. Ivan led a retired life, and died in 1696 at the age of thirty.</p>
                <p>Want of space compels us to deal here only with the leading facts of the reign of
                    Peter the Great (1689-1725); for more minute details the reader must consult the
                    special article (vol. xviii. p. 698). The great object of the new czar was to
                    give Russia ports in some other direction than the White Sea, constantly blocked
                    with ice. He had already trained an army which was officered by foreigners in
                    his pay. The Turks were the first objects of his attack. At first he was
                    unsuccessful in his attempt to get possession of Azoff at the mouth of the
                    Don,—partly on account of the treason of the Dutch engineer Jansen, who, in
                    consequence of some slight put upon him, went over to the enemy. In 1696,
                    however, he took the fort and soon afterwards made his triumphant entry into
                    Moscow. In the following year Peter, accompanied by Lefort and Generals Golovin
                    and Vosnîtzin, set out on his travels. For some time he worked at the docks of
                    Saardam in Holland, and then he went to England, where he remained three months.
                    The story of his stay at Deptford is too well known to need description here. He
                    left England, taking with him a great number of ingenious men, who were
                    appointed to teach the arts to the barbarous Russians. He was getting ready to
                    go to Venice when he heard of the great revolt of the streltzî. Before his
                    arrival their insurrection had been quelled by Gordon and others, and many of
                    them lay in prison awaiting the sentences to be given by Peter. When he reached
                    Moscow, a series of terrible executions took place, which have been described
                    with only too much accuracy by some eyewitnesses, the chief being Korb, the
                    secretary of the German embassy. In 1706 broke out the revolt of the Cossacks of
                    the Don, and in 1709 that of Mazeppa, the hetman of the Little-Russian Cossacks,
                    who eagerly joined Charles XII. in his struggle with Peter. As early as 1700 the
                    Russian czar had carried on war with this last of the vikings, as he had been
                    called. In that year Charles defeated Peter at the battle of Narva, but the
                    latter, although humbled, was not disheartened. He gathered all his strength for
                    another encounter. In the following year Sheremetreff defeated the Swedish
                    general Schlippenbach in Livonia, and again in 1702. The great object of Peter
                    was to gain possession of the Neva; this he attained, but the Russian arms were
                    disgraced by many cruelties and robberies in the unfortunate Baltic provinces,
                    which had already suffered so much in the wars of Ivan the Terrible.</p>
                <p>Charles XII. now abandoned his attacks on the Polish king and invaded Russia. “I
                    will treat with the czar at Moscow,” he said. Peter replied, “My brother Charles
                    wishes to play the part of Alexander, but he will not find me Darius.” At Lesna
                    the Swedish general Löwenhaupt fought a desperate battle with the Russians, in
                    which, although nominally victorious, his losses were terrible. On June 15
                    (n.s.) was fought the battle of Poltava, which resulted in the complete defeat
                    of Charles. He had brought it on by his recklessness, and, it may be added,
                    complete ignorance of his duties as a general.</p>
                <p>With the fall of Mazeppa and the coalition of the Little Russians in aid of
                    Charles fell also the independence of the Cossacks and their <hi rend="italic"
                    >sech</hi> or republic. They now became entirely dependent upon the Muscovite
                    czar. The hetmanship, which had long been a mere empty title, lasted till the
                    year 1789. In 1712 Peter married Martha Skavronska, a Livonian or Lithuanian
                    peasant who had been taken prisoner at the siege of Marienburg in 1702. But
                    little is known of her previous history; she received the name of Catherine on
                    being baptized as a member of the Greek Church. Peter had previously divorced
                    his wife Eudokia, who was distasteful to him on account of her sympathies with
                    the conservative party in Russia. He now set about his great plan of civilizing
                    the country on the model of the nations of the West. In this he was assisted by
                    many foreigners in his pay. He abolished the patriarchate, probably from dislike
                    of its great power, based nobility entirely upon service either civil or
                    military, and divided the merchants into guilds, but left serfdom still existing
                    in Russia, or perhaps we may say with truth even augmented it, by doing away
                    with the privileges which the <hi rend="italic">odnodvortzi</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">polovniki</hi> had and confounding all in a common category of
                    serfdom. His attempt to introduce primogeniture into Russia did not succeed. He
                    put an end to the Oriental seclusion of women and the Oriental dress of men; for
                    the beard and long caftan were substituted the cleanly-shaved face and the dress
                    in vogue in the West. He abolished also the <hi rend="italic">pravezhe</hi> or
                    public flagellation of defaulting debtors. The army was completely remodelled on
                    the European system. During the exile of Charles XIL at Bender Peter drove
                    Stanislaus Leszczynski out of Poland, and Augustus II. reentered Warsaw. Peter
                    conquered Esthonia and Livonia. He was not able to annex Courland, which was a
                    feudatory of Poland, but he negotiated a marriage between the duke and his niece
                    Anna, daughter of the late czar Ivan, who was afterwards empress. A foolish
                    expedition undertaken against Turkey was not successful. Peter found himself but
                    ill-supported by the inhabitants through whose territory he marched, and was
                    compelled to sign the treaty of the Pruth in 1711, whereby he gave back Azoff,
                    one of his most valuable conquests, to the Turks. The story of his having been
                    rescued by the dexterity of Catherine seems to lack confirmation; under any
                    circumstances, he shortly afterwards acknowledged her as his wife. In Alay 17.13
                    Peter gained some fresh victories over the Swedes. In 1717 he made another
                    European tour, visiting, among other places, Paris. On this occasion he was
                    accompanied by his wife; concerning both strange stories were told, but perhaps
                    we must be cautious how we receive too credulously, as Carlyle has done, the
                    malicious gossip of the margravine of Baireuth. In 1721, by the treaty of Nystad
                    with Sweden, Peter was left master of Livonia, Esthonia, Ingria, and part of
                    Finland. He had begun building St Petersburg, “the window by which Russia looks”
                    at Europe, as early as 1703.</p>
                <p>In 1722 we find Peter descending the Volga from Nijni to Astrakhan, and gaining
                    some important points on that river. Previous to this had occurred the sad death
                    <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit21newyrich/page/n115/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0921-0115-0098"/>of his son Alexis, in which it must be said with
                    sorrow Peter seemed lost to all the feelings of a father. Alexis had undoubtedly
                    given him great cause for dislike by identifying himself in every way with the
                    retrogressive party. The unfortunate young man probably died under the
                    "infliction of torture. In 1721 Peter promulgated the celebrated ukaze
                    (afterwards abrogated by Paul) that the sovereign had the right of naming his
                    successor. On January 28, 1725, the great reformer was dead. An attempt to
                    estimate his character has been made in the separate article assigned to
                    him.</p>
                <p>On the death of Peter the country was divided into two factions. The old
                    reactionary party, the Golitzins, Dolgo-rukis, and others, were eager to
                    proclaim Peter the son of Alexis, but those who had identified themselves with
                    the reforms of the late sovereign were anxious that Catherine his widow, who had
                    been crowned empress, should succeed. Menshikoff, the favourite of the late
                    czar, who is said when a boy to have sold cakes in the streets of Moscow, became
                    all-powerful at this period, and the reforms of Peter continued to be carried
                    out. Catherine died in 1727; she appears to have been an indolent, good-natured
                    woman, with but little capacity for government, and accordingly, throughout her
                    short reign, was entirely controlled by others. She designated as her successor
                    Peter the son of Alexis, and, in default of Peter and his issue, Anna, who had
                    married the duke of Holstein, and Elizabeth, her daughters. The regency was
                    exercised by a council consisting of tho two daughters, the duke of Holstein,
                    Menshikoff, and seven or eight of the chief dignitaries of the empire.
                    Menshikoff was still all-important; he had obtained from Catherine her consent
                    to a marriage between his daughter and the youthful czar. But his authority was
                    gradually undermined by the Dolgorukis. The favourite of Peter the Great was
                    first banished to his estates, and afterwards to Berezoff in Siberia, where he
                    died in 1729. The Dol-gorukis were now in the ascendency, and the czar was
                    betrothed to Natalia, one of that family. He showed every inclination to undo
                    his grandfather’s work, and the court was removed to Moscow. Soon afterwards,
                    however, in January 1730, the young prince died of smallpox. His last words as
                    he lay on his death-bed were, “Get ready the sledge; I want to go to my
                    sister,”— alluding to the Princess Natalia, the other child of Alexis, who had
                    died three years previously. The only foreign event of importance in this reign
                    was the attempt of Maurice of Saxony to get possession of Courland, by marrying
                    the duchess Anna, then a widow. She consented to the union, and the states of
                    the province elected him, but Menshikoff sent a body of troops who forced him to
                    quit it. On the death of Peter at the age of fifteen, various claimants of the
                    throne were put forward. The great czar had left two daughters, Elizabeth, and
                    Anna, duchess of Holstein, who had a son, afterwards Peter III. Two daughters
                    were also surviving of his eldest brother Ivan, Anna, the duchess of Courland,
                    and Catherine, duchess of Mecklenburg. Alexis Dolgoruki even had an idea of
                    claiming the crown for his daughter, because she had been betrothed to the young
                    emperor. This proposal, however, was treated with derision, and the High Secret
                    Council resolved to call to the throne Anna of Courland, thinking that, as she
                    was so much more remote by birth than the daughters of Peter, she would more
                    willingly submit to their terms. In fact, they had prepared for her signature
                    something like the <hi rend="italic">porta Conventa</hi> of Poland. The
                    following were the terms:—(1) the High Council was always to be composed of
                    eight members, to be renewed by co-option, and the czarina must consult it on
                    state affairs; (2) without its consent she could neither make peace nor declare
                    war, could not impose any tax, alienate any crown lands, or appoint to any
                    office above that of a colonel; (3) she could not cause to be condemned or
                    executed any member of the nobility, nor confiscate the goods of any noble
                    before he had a regular trial; (4) she could not marry nor choose a successor
                    without the consent of the council. In case she broke any of these stipulations
                    she was to forfeit the crown (see Rambaud, p. 425). Anna assented to these terms
                    and made her entry into Moscow, which was now to be the capital. But the empress
                    was soon informed how universally unpopular these <hi rend="italic">pacta
                    conventa</hi> were, which in reality put Russia into the hands of a few powerful
                    families, chiefly the Dolgorukis and Golitzins. She accordingly convened her
                    supporters, and publicly tore the document to pieces, and thus ended the last
                    attempt to give Russia a constitution. The new empress was a cold, repulsive
                    woman, whose temper had been soured by indignities endured in her youth; she
                    took vengeance upon her opponents, and threw herself almost entirely into the
                    hands of German advisers, especially Biren, a Courlander of low origin. This is
                    the period called by the Russians the <hi rend="italic">Bironovstchina.</hi> The
                    country was now thoroughly exploited by tho Germans; some of the leading
                    Russians were executed, and others banished to Siberia. Among the former was the
                    able minister Volinski, beheaded with two others in 1740. He had fallen under
                    the wrath of the implacable Biren. One of the most important enactments of this
                    reign was the abolition of the right of primogeniture introduced by Peter the
                    Great, which had never been popular in the country. On the crown of Poland
                    falling vacant in 1733, an attempt was again made to place Stanislaus
                    Leszczynski on the throne, but it failed through the opposition of Russia, and
                    Stanislaus escaped with difficulty from Dantzic. Upon this followed a war with
                    Turkey, which lasted four years (1735-1739), in conjunction with Austria. This
                    was not very successful, but the Russian generals gained possession of a few
                    towns, and were indignant when the Austrians signed the treaty of Belgrade with
                    the Turks (1739), and the campaign came to an end. In 1740 the empress Anna
                    died; she had reigned exactly ten years. She left the crown to Ivan, the son of
                    her niece Anna, daughter of her sister Catherine, duchess of Mecklenburg. During
                    the minority of this child Biren was to be regent. By a <hi rend="italic"
                    >revolution de palais,</hi> however, the German adventurer was hurled from power
                    and sent to Pelîm in Siberia. But matters did not rest here; taking advantage of
                    the general unpopularity of the German faction, the partisans of Elizabeth, the
                    daughter of Peter the Great, were resolved to work their overthrow, and place
                    her upon the throne. They consisted of Alexander and Peter Shuvaloff, Michael
                    Vorontzoff, Razumovski, Schwarz, and a French surgeon named Lestocq. Elizabeth
                    ingratiated herself into the favour of the soldiers, by whom the name of Peter
                    the Great was still so much cherished. Anna Leopoldovna, as she was called, her
                    husband Anthony Ulrich, the infant emperor, Munich, Ostermann, and the whole
                    German faction were arrested in the night, and Elizabeth ascended the throne.
                    Ivan VI. was imprisoned in the fortress of Schlüsselburg; Anna, with her husband
                    and children, was banished to Kholmogori near Archangel, where she died in 1746.
                    Ostermann was banished to Bere-zoff, and Munich to Pelim; they had both been
                    previously sentenced to death. Biren and his family were now recalled and
                    allowed to live at Yaroslavl. Elizabeth</p>
                <p>Petrovna (1741-1762) inaugurated the return of Russian influence in opposition to
                    the Germans, from whom the country had suffered so much during the reign of
                    Anna. The people were weary of them, yet they were, as we shall see, to have one
                    German emperor more. On ascending the throne she summoned to her court the son
                    of her sister <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit21newyrich/page/n116/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0921-0116-0099"/>Anna and the duke of Holstein, who took the name
                    of Peter Feodorovich on assuming the Greek religion, and was declared heir to
                    the throne. In 1744 he married the Princess Sophia of Anhalt-Zerbst, who by her
                    baptism in the Orthodox Church became Catherine. Thus the line of descent was
                    secured to the direct heirs of Peter the Great. In 1743, the armies of Elizabeth
                    having gained some victories over the Swedes, the treaty of Abo was signed, by
                    which Russia acquired the southern part of Finland, as far as the river Kiumen.
                    The next event of importance is the war between Russia and Frederick the Great
                    (1756-1762). In 1757 Apraksin crossed the frontier with 85,000 Russians,
                    occupied Eastern Prussia, and defeated Lewald at Gross-Jagersdorf; but, instead
                    of taking advantage of the victory, he soon afterwards retired behind the
                    Niemen, having been tampered with by the grand-duchess Catherine and the
                    chancellor Bestuzheff-Riumin. In 1758 Fermor, the Russian general, was
                    completely defeated by Frederick at Zorndorf, but he was allowed to retreat
                    without molestation. In 1759 Saltikoff beat the Prussians at Paltzig, and in the
                    same year Frederick was obliged to submit to a greater defeat at Künersdorf,
                    where he lost eight thousand men and one hundred and seventy-two cannon. It was
                    on the loss of this battle that he meditated committing suicide. In 1760 the
                    Russians entered Berlin, where they committed great havoc and destruction. “We
                    have to do,” said Frederick, “with barbarians, who are digging the grave of
                    humanity.” In the following year they took Pomerania. The cause of Frederick
                    seemed on the verge of ruin; he was saved by the death of Elizabeth in December
                    1761. The empress was an idle, superstitious woman of lax morals, who was
                    greatly under the influence of favourites. Since the reign of Peter I. no
                    successor had appeared worthy of him. Still Russia made more progress under
                    Elizabeth than it had made under Anna. In 1755 the university of Moscow, the
                    oldest in the country, was founded through the influence of Ivan Shuvaloff.
                    Literature made great advances, as will be seen below.</p>
                <p>Elizabeth was succeeded by her nephew Peter, son of her sister Anna and Charles
                    Frederick, duke of Holstein-Gottorp. He was suspected of German leanings, but
                    his first measures made him very popular. In February 1762 he published an ukaze
                    by which the nobility were freed from the necessity of entering upon any state
                    employment, and he abolished the secret chancery. On the other hand he acted in
                    some matters injudiciously, and offended the prejudices of the Russians, as the
                    false Demetrius had done a century and a half previously. He ridiculed some of
                    the ceremonies of the Orthodox Church, and showed a fondness for the Lutheran.
                    He introduced many German tactics into the army, and evinced a great preference
                    for his German corps of Holsteiners. His personal habits were very coarse: he
                    was constantly seen drunk. Moreover he sent out of the country many of the
                    talented Frenchmen who had during the reign of Elizabeth been helping Russia to
                    get rid of her barbarism. Frederick II. of Prussia, who was at his lowest depths
                    after the battle of Künersdorf, now saw to his delight a complete change in the
                    Russian policy. Peter was an ardent admirer of the Prussian sovereign; in order
                    to ensure peace, Frederick would have ceded Eastern Prussia; but Peter dreamed
                    of nothing of the kind; he restored all the Russian conquests and formed an
                    alliance with him, offensive and defensive. He lived very unhappily with his
                    wife Catherine, and meditated divorcing her and imprisoning her for the rest of
                    her life in a convent. The condition in which she passed her time may be seen
                    from her memoirs, first published by Herzen, the authenticity of which there
                    seems to be no reason to doubt. She, however, quietly waited her time, and a
                    conspiracy was concocted in which she was assisted by the</p>
                <p>Orloffs, Potemkin, the princess Dashkoff, and others (see PeteR III.). Leaving
                    her residence at Peterhof, Catherine boldly put herself at the head of twenty
                    thousand men. The miserable emperor abdicated without a struggle, and was soon
                    afterwards secretly assassinated at Ropcha, near St Petersburg. Many of the
                    details of this catastrophe are given in the interesting memoirs of the Princess
                    Dashkoff, which were published by an English lady, Mrs W. Bradford, in 1840,
                    having been taken down from her dictation. Thus had a German woman, by adroitly
                    flattering the prejudices of the Russians, succeeded in making herself head of
                    this vast empire. Two years afterwards Ivan VI., who is said to have become an
                    idiot from his long confinement at Schlüsselburg, was murdered by his guards on
                    account of the attempt of a certain Lieutenant Mirovich to set him free. Whether
                    Mirovich was incited to this adventure. by secret promises of the Government, so
                    that there might be an excuse for the murder of Ivan, has never been clearly
                    shown. He expiated his crime by public execution, and is said to have expected a
                    reprieve till the last moment.</p>
                <p>The Seven Years’ War was now over, and the next great European complications were
                    to be concerned with the partition of Poland, throughout the struggles of which
                    country the Russians were constantly interfering; but for a fuller discussion of
                    this subject the reader must be referred to the article Poland. In 1767 Turkey,
                    urged on by France, declared war against Russia; the object was to aid the Poles
                    by creating a diversion. The Russian general Golitzin attacked the grand vizier,
                    took the town of Khotin (1769), and in the following year Rumantzoff defeated
                    the khan of the Crimea, the Turkish feudatory and ally, and in 1770 won the
                    great victory of Kagul. In 1771 Dolgoruki overran the Crimea, and Alexis Orloff
                    defeated the Turks in a naval engagement at Chesme, on the coast of Asia Minor.
                    In their naval expeditions the Russians were at this time greatly assisted by
                    the number of Englishmen in their service. In 1774 was signed the peace of
                    Kutchuk-Kainardji, whereby the sultan acknowledged the independence of the
                    Mongols of the Crimea. The Russians thus detached this province from the
                    sultan’s dominions, and after exercising a kind of protectorate over it added it
                    to their own. He also ceded Azoff on the Don, Kinburn at the mouth of the
                    Dniester, and all the fortified places of the Crimea. The Greeks, who had been
                    induced to rise, were abandoned to the vengeance of the Turks.</p>
                <p>In 1771 the plague broke out at Moscow, and many of the inhabitants perished. The
                    archbishop Ambrose was massacred in a popular tumult, while endeavouring to
                    carry out some measures which were necessary for the preservation of the public
                    health. Soon afterwards occurred the rebellion of Pugatcheff, a Cossack of the
                    Don, who declared himself to be the emperor Peter III. The czar, he alleged, had
                    escaped from the hands of his would-be murderers, and would soon regain his
                    throne. A large band of disaffected peasants and Raskolniks gathered round him,
                    and he was joined by many of the Mongol races, who were inimical to the Russian
                    rule. At first the generals sent against him were defeated. The rebel’s path was
                    everywhere marked with bloodshed and pillage; he even got possession of several
                    towns, including Kazan. Had he been something more than a vulgar assassin he
                    might have made Catherine tremble on her throne, but his cruelties estranged his
                    more moderate followers. He was afterwards beaten by Bibikoff and others, and
                    finally surrendered by his accomplices to Suwaroff. He was taken to Moscow in an
                    iron cage and there publicly executed in 1775, together with four of his
                    principal followers. In the same year the empress put an end to the republic, as
                    it was called, of the Zaporogian Cossacks. A great codification of the laws took
                    place under Catherine, which may be <pb break="no"

                    legislation. The serfs, however, were not benefited by these changes. In 1767 an
                    ukaze forbade them to bring any complaints against their masters. The latter had
                    the power of sending their serfs to Siberia as a punishment, or handing them
                    over to be enlisted in the army. The public sale of serfs was not put an end to
                    till the reign of Alexander I. The country was now divided into governments for
                    the better administration of justice, each government being subdivided into <hi
                    rend="italic">uiezdi</hi> or districts. Catherine also took away from the
                    monasteries their lands and serfs, and allotted them payments according to their
                    importance from the state revenues. The plans of Peter I. were thus fully
                    carried out, and the church became entirely dependent upon the state. In 1783
                    the Crimea was annexed to Russia. A second war with Turkey broke out in 1787;
                    the Ottoman power had many grounds of complaint, but its suspicions were
                    particularly aroused by the tour of Catherine through the southern provinces of
                    Russia and her interviews with the emperor Joseph II. Turkey declared war that
                    same year; and, to increase the embarrassed position of the empress, Sweden did
                    the same, requiring from Russia the cession of the southern part of Finland
                    which had been taken from her. But King Gustavus III., in spite of some petty
                    successes, was unable to carry on the war, and soon signed the peace of Verela
                    on the footing of <hi rend="italic">status quo ante bellum.</hi> The empress met
                    with equal good fortune in the south; Potemkin took Otchakoff and Suwaroff
                    Khotin. In 1789 the latter general won the battles of Fokshani and Kimnik; and
                    in 1790 after a sanguinary engagement he took Ismail. By the treaty of Jassy in
                    1792 Catherine kept possession of Otch-akoff, and the shore between the Bug and
                    Dniester. She was next occupied with the affairs of Poland, which have been
                    described under that heading. In consequence of the demands of the confederates
                    of Targovica,—men who were prepared to ruin their country for their own private
                    ends,—eighty thousand Russians and twenty thousand Cossacks entered the Ukraine
                    to undo the work of the confederates of Bar. In 1794 Suwaroff stormed Warsaw,
                    and the inhabitants were massacred. In the following year Stanislaus Poniatowski
                    laid down his crown, the third division of Poland took place, and the
                    independence of that country was at an end. In spite of her correspondence and
                    affected sympathies with Voltaire, Diderot, and many of the advanced French
                    thinkers, Catherine showed great opposition to the principles of the French
                    Revolution, and the policy of the latter part of her reign was reactionary. She
                    died suddenly on November 17, 1796. Her character has been amply discussed by
                    foreign writers. It may suffice to say here that, whatever her private vices may
                    have been, she was unquestionably a woman of great genius, and the only
                    sovereign worthy of Russia who had appeared since the days of Peter the Great.
                    Hence the veneration with which her memory is regarded by the Russians to this
                    day.</p>
                <p>Paul, who had lived in retirement during the life of his mother, was an object of
                    aversion to her. We are told that she had prepared a will by which he would be
                    disinherited, and the succession conferred upon his son Alexander, but his
                    friend Kurakin got hold of it immediately upon the death of the empress and
                    destroyed it. The events of the reign of Paul ( <hi rend="italic"><hi
                    rend="smallcaps"> q.v.</hi></hi> ) can be only briefly discussed here. He
                    concluded an alliance with Turkey, and entered into a coalition against the
                    French republic, which he regarded with horror. Suwaroff took the command of the
                    united Russian and Austrian troops at Verona. In 1799 he defeated the French
                    general Moreau on the banks of the Adda, and made a triumphant entry into Milan.
                    After this he won another victory over Macdonald on the Trebbia, and later the
                    same year that of Novi over Joubert. He then crossed the Alps for the purpose of
                    driving the French out of Switzerland, but he was everywhere hampered by the
                    Austrians, and, after fighting his way over the Alps and suffering great losses,
                    he reached his winter quarters between the Iller and the Lech, and soon
                    afterwards he was recalled in disgrace. Paul now completely changed his tactics.
                    Accusing England and Austria of having acted treacherously towards him, he threw
                    himself into the arms of Bonaparte, who had won him over by skilful diplomacy,
                    and, among other pieces of flattery, sent back the Russian prisoners newly
                    clothed and armed. Paul then meditated joining him in a plan for conquering
                    India; but in the night between the 23d and 24th of March 1801 he was
                    assassinated. The chief agents in this catastrophe were Plato Zuboff,
                    Benning-sen, and Pahlen. The rule of Paul had become intolerable, and he was
                    fast bringing on a national bankruptcy.</p>
                <p>He was succeeded by his eldest son, Alexander I. (1801-1825). One of the first
                    acts of the new emperor was to make peace with England and France. He, however,
                    soon changed his policy, and in 1805 joined the third coalition against France,
                    to which Austria and England were parties. Events which belong to general
                    European history, and are well known, need only be described briefly here. On
                    December 2d of that year took place the battle of Austerlitz, in which the
                    Russians lost 21,000 men, 133 guns, and 30 flags. They accused their Austrian
                    allies of treachery. The war was soon ended by the treaty of Pressburg. We now
                    come to the fourth coalition against France (1806-7). In 1807 Napoleon engaged
                    the Russian general Benningsen at Eylau. The battle was protracted and
                    sanguinary, but not decisive; both parties abandoned the field and retired into
                    winter quarters. A defeat at Friedland in the same year was followed by the
                    peace of Tilsit. By this treaty the Prussian king, Frederick William III., lost
                    half his dominions. Nearly all his Polish possessions were to go to the king of
                    Saxony under the name of the grand-duchy of Warsaw. By a secret treaty, it
                    seemed as if Alexander and Napoleon almost aspired to divide the world, or at
                    least Europe, between them. The terms, however, were received by a large party
                    in Russia with disgust. The next important event in the reign of Alexander was
                    the conquest of Finland. By the treaty of Frederikshamn, September 17, 1809,
                    Sweden surrendered Finland, with the whole of East Bothnia, and a part of West
                    Bothnia lying eastward of the river Torneâ. The Finns were allowed a kind of
                    autonomy, which they have preserved to this day. The annexation of Georgia to
                    Russia was consolidated at the beginning of this reign, having been long in
                    preparation. It led to a war with Persia, which resulted in the incorporation of
                    the province of Shirvan with the Russian empire in 1806.</p>
                <p>In 1809 commenced the fifth coalition against Napoleon. Alexander, who was
                    obliged by treaty to furnish assistance to the French emperor, did all that he
                    could to prevent the war. A quarrel with Turkey led to its invasion by a Russian
                    army under Michelsen. This war was terminated by a congress held at Bucharest in
                    1812. Russia gave up Moldavia and Wallachia, which she had occupied, but kept
                    Bessarabia, with the fortresses of Khotin and Bender. Gradually an estrangement
                    took place between Alexander and Napoleon, not only on account of the creation
                    of the grand-duchy of Warsaw, but because Russia was suffering greatly from the
                    Continental blockade, to which Alexander had been forced to give his adhesion.
                    This led to the great invasion of Russia by Napoleon in 1812. <note

                <p>On May 9, 1812, Napoleon left Paris for Dresden, and the Russian and French
                    ambassadors received their passports. The grand army comprised 678,000 men,
                    356,000 of them being French; and, to oppose them, the Russians assembled
                    372,000 men. Napoleon crossed the Niemen and advanced by forced marches to
                    Smolensk. Here he defeated the Russians, and again at the terrible battle of
                    Borodino, and then entered Moscow, which had been abandoned by most of the
                    inhabitants; soon afterwards a fire broke out (probably caused by the order of
                    Rostopchin the governor), which raged six days and destroyed the greater part of
                    the city. Notwithstanding this disaster, Napoleon lingered five weeks among the
                    ruins, endeavouring to negotiate a peace, which he seemed to think Alexander
                    would be sure to grant; but he had mistaken the spirit of the emperor and his
                    people. On the 18th of October Napoleon reluctantly commenced his backward
                    march. The weather was unusually severe, and the country all round had been
                    devastated by the French on their march. With their ranks continually thinned by
                    cold, hunger, and the skirmishes of the Cossacks who hung upon their rear, the
                    French reached the Beresina, which they crossed near Studianka on the 26th-29th
                    of November with great loss. The struggle on the banks of this river forms one
                    of the most terrible pictures in history. At Smorgoni, between Vilna and Minsk,
                    Napoleon left the army and hurried to Paris. Finally the wreck of the <hi
                    rend="italic">grande armee</hi> under Ney crossed the Niemen. Not more than
                    eighty thousand of the whole army are said to have returned.</p>
                <p>Frederick William III. of Prussia now issued a manifesto, and concluded an
                    alliance with Russia for the reestablishment of the Prussian monarchy. In 1813
                    took place the battle of Dresden, and the so-called Battle of the Nations at
                    Leipsic on October 16 and the two following days. In 1814 the Russians invaded
                    France with the allies, and lost many men in the assault upon Paris. After the
                    battle of Waterloo, and the conveyance of Napoleon to the island of St Helena,
                    it fell to the Russian forces to occupy Champagne and Lorraine. In the same year
                    Poland was re-established in a mutilated form, with a constitution which
                    Alexander, who was crowned king, swore to observe. In 1825 the emperor died
                    suddenly at Taganrog at the mouth of the Don, while visiting the southern
                    provinces of his empire. He had added to the Russian dominions Finland, Poland,
                    Bessarabia, and that part of the Caucasus which includes Daghestan, Shirvan,
                    Mingrelia, and Imeretia. Much was done in this reign to improve the condition of
                    the serfs. The Raskolniks were better treated; many efforts were made to improve
                    public education, and the universities of Kazan, Kharkoff, and St Petersburg
                    were founded. One of the chief agents of these reforms was the minister
                    Speranski, who for some time enjoyed the favour of the emperor, but he attacked
                    so many interests by his measures that a coalition was formed against him. He
                    was denounced as a traitor, and his enemies succeeded in getting him removed and
                    sent as governor to Nijni-Novgorod. In 1819, when the storm raised against him
                    had somewhat abated, he was appointed to the important post of governor of
                    Siberia. In 1821 he returned to St Petersburg, but he never regained his former
                    power. To the mild influence of Speranski succeeded that of Shishkoff,
                    Novosiltzeff, and Arakcheeff. The last of these men made himself universally
                    detested in Russia. He rose to great influence in the time of Paul, and managed
                    to continue in favour under his son. Besides many other pernicious measures, it
                    was to him that Russia owed the military colonies which were so unpopular and
                    led to serious riots. The censorship of the press became much stricter, and many
                    professors of liberal tendencies were dismissed from their chairs in the
                    universities. The country was now filled with secret societies, and the emperor
                    became gloomy and suspicious. In this condition of mind he died, a man
                    thoroughly disenchanted and weary of life. He has been judged harshly by some
                    authors; readers will remember that Napoleon said of him that he was false as a
                    Byzantine Greek. To us he appears as a well-intentioned man, utterly unable to
                    cope with the discordant elements around him. He had discovered that his life
                    was a failure.</p>
                <p>The heir to the throne according to the principles of succession recognized in
                    Russia was Constantine, the second son of the emperor Paul, since Alexander left
                    no children. But he had of his own free will secretly renounced his claim in
                    1822, having espoused a Roman Catholic, the Polish princess Julia Grudzinska. In
                    consequence of this change in the devolution of the sovereign’s authority, the
                    conspiracy of the Dekabrists <note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>Literally, the men of December, the month in which Alexander
                    died. </p></note> broke out at the end of the year, their object being to take
                    advantage of the confusion caused by the alteration of the succession to get
                    constitutional government in Russia. Their efforts failed, but the rebellion was
                    not put down without great bloodshed. Five of the conspirators were executed,
                    and a great many sent to Siberia. Some of the men implicated were among the most
                    remarkable of their time in Russia, but the whole country had been long
                    honeycombed with secret societies, and many of the Russian officers had learned
                    liberal ideas while engaged in the campaign against Napoleon. So ignorant,
                    however, were the common people of the most ordinary political terms that when
                    told to shout for Constantine and the constitution <hi rend="italic"
                    >(constitutziα)</hi> they naively asked if the latter was Constantine’s wife.
                    The new emperor, Nicholas, the next brother in succession, showed throughout his
                    reign reactionary tendencies; all liberalism was sternly repressed. In 1830
                    appeared the <hi rend="italic">Complete Collection of the Laws of the Russian
                    Empire,</hi> which Nicholas had caused to be codified. He partly restored the
                    right of primogeniture which had been taken away by the empress Anna as contrary
                    to Russian usages, allowing a father to make his eldest son his sole heir. In
                    spite of the increased severity of the censorship of the press, literature made
                    great progress in his reign. From 1826 to 1828 Nicholas was engaged in a war
                    with Persia, in which the Russians were completely victorious, having beaten the
                    enemy at Elizabetpol, and again under Paskewitch at Javan Bulak. The war was
                    terminated by the peace of Turkmantchai (February 22, 1828), by which Persia
                    ceded to Russia the provinces of Erivan and Nakhitchevan, and paid twenty
                    millions of roubles as an indemnity. The next foreign enemy was Turkey. Nicholas
                    had sympathized with the Greeks in their struggle for independence, in
                    opposition to the policy of Alexander; he had also a part to play as protector
                    of the Orthodox Christians, who formed a large number of the sultan’s subjects.
                    In consequence of the sanguinary war which the Turks were carrying on against
                    the Greeks and the utter collapse of the latter, England, France, and Russia
                    signed the treaty of London in 1827, by which they forced themselves upon the
                    belligerents as mediators. From this union resulted the battle of Navarino
                    (October 20, 1827), in which the Turkish fleet was annihilated by that of the
                    allies. Nicholas now pursued the war with Turkey on his own account; in Asia
                    Paskewitch defeated two Turkish armies, and conquered Erzeroum, and in Europe
                    Diebitsch defeated the grand vizier. The Russians crossed the Balkans and
                    advanced to Adrianople, where a treaty was signed in 1829 very disadvantageous
                    to Turkey.</p>

                    vol. xix. p. 298). Paskewitch took Warsaw in 1831. The cholera which was then
                    raging had already carried off Diebitsch and the grand-duke Constantine. Poland
                    was now entirely at the mercy of Nicholas. The constitution which had been
                    granted by Alexander was annulled; there were to be no more diets; and for the
                    ancient palatinates, familiar to the historical student, were substituted the
                    governments of Warsaw, Radom, Lublin, Plock, and Modlin. The university of
                    Vilna, rendered celebrated by Mickiewicz and Lelewel, was suppressed. By another
                    treaty with Turkey, that of Unkiar-Skelessi (1833), Russia acquired additional
                    rights to meddle with the internal politics of that country. Soon after the
                    revolution of 1848, the emperor Nicholas, who became even more reactionary in
                    consequence of the disturbed state of Europe, answered the appeal of the emperor
                    Francis Joseph, and sent an army under Paskewitch to suppress the Hungarian
                    revolt. After the capitulation of Gorgei in 1849, the war was at an end, and the
                    Magyars cruelly expiated their attempts to procure constitutional government. In
                    1853 broke out the Crimean War. The emperor was anxious to distribute the
                    possessions of the “sick man,” but found enemies instead of allies in England
                    and France. The chief events of this memorable struggle were the battles of the
                    Alma, Balaklava, Inkermann, and Tchernaya, and the siege of Sebastopol; this had
                    been skilfully fortified by Todleben, who appears to have been the only man of
                    genius who came to the front on either side during the war. In 1855 the Russians
                    destroyed the southern side of the city, and retreated to the northern. In the
                    same year, on March 14th, died the emperor Nicholas, after a short illness.
                    Finding all his plans frustrated he had grown weary of life, and rashly exposed
                    himself to the severe temperature of the northern spring. He was succeeded by
                    his son Alexander II. (1855-1881), at the age of thirty-seven. One of the first
                    objects of the new czar was to put an end to the war, and the treaty of Paris
                    was signed in 1856, by which Russia consented to keep no vessels of war in the
                    Black Sea, and to give up her protectorate of the Eastern Christians; the
                    former, it must be added, she has recently recovered. A portion of Russian
                    Bessarabia was also cut off and added to the Danubian principalities, which were
                    shortly to be united under the name of Roumania. This was afterwards given back
                    to Russia by the treaty of Berlin. Sebastopol also has been rebuilt, so that it
                    is difficult to see what the practical results of the Crimean War were, in spite
                    of the vast bloodshed and expenditure of treasure which attended it. The next
                    important measure was the emancipation of the serfs in 1861. This great reform
                    had long been meditated by Nicholas, but he was unable to accomplish it, and
                    left it to be carried out by his son. The landlords, on receiving an indemnity,
                    now released the serfs from their seigniorial rights, and the village commune
                    became the actual property of the serf. This great revolution was not, however,
                    carried out without great difficulty. The Polish insurrection of 1863 has
                    already been described, as well as its fatal effects upon that part of Poland
                    which had been incorporated with Russia. On the other hand Finland has seen her
                    privileges confirmed.</p>
                <p>Among important foreign events of this reign must be mentioned the capture of
                    Schamyl in 1859 by Prince Bariatinski, and the pacification of the Caucasus;
                    many of the Circassians, unable to endure the peaceful life of cultivators of
                    the soil under the new regime, migrated to Turkey, where they have formed one of
                    the most turbulent elements of the population. Turkestan also has been gradually
                    subjugated. In 1865 the city of Tashkend was taken, and in 1867 Alexander II.
                    created the government of Turkestan. In 1858 General Muravieff signed a treaty
                    with the Chinese, by which Russia acquired all the left bank of the river Amur.
                    A new port has been created in Eastern Asia (Vladivostok), which promises to be
                    a great centre of trade. In 1877 Russia came to the assistance of the Slavonic
                    Christians against the Turks. After the terrible siege of Plevna, nothing stood
                    between them and the gates of Constantinople. In 1878 the treaty of San Stefano
                    was signed, by which Roumania became independent, Servia was enlarged, and a
                    free Bulgaria, but under Turkish suzerainty, was created. But these arrangements
                    were subsequently modified by the treaty of Berlin. Russia got back the portion
                    of Bessarabia which she had lost, and advanced her Caucasian frontier. The new
                    province of Bulgaria was cut into two, the southern portion being entitled
                    Eastern Roumelia, with a Christian governor, to be appointed by the Porte, and
                    self-government. Austria acquired a protectorate over Bosnia and Herzegovina.
                    The latter part of the reign of Alexander II. was a period of great internal
                    commotion, on account of the spread of Nihilism, and the attempts upon the
                    emperor’s life, which unfortunately were at last successful. In the cities in
                    which his despotic father had walked about fearless, without a single attendant,
                    the mild and amiable Alexander was in daily peril of his life. On April 16,
                    1866, Karakozoff shot at the emperor at St Petersburg; in the following year
                    another attempt was made by a Pole, Berezowski, while Alexander was at Paris on
                    a visit to Napoleon III.; on April 14, 1879, Solovioff shot at him. The same
                    year saw the attempt to blow up the Winter Palace and to wreck the train by
                    which the czar was travelling from Moscow to St Petersburg. A similar conspiracy
                    in 1881 (March 13) was successful. Five of the conspirators, including a woman,
                    Sophia Perovskaia, were publicly executed. Thus terminated the reign of
                    Alexander II, which had lasted nearly twenty-six years. He died leaving Russia
                    exhausted by foreign wars and honeycombed by plots. His wife and eldest son
                    Nicholas had predeceased him, the latter at Nice. He was succeeded by his second
                    son Alexander, born in 1845, whose reign has been characterized by conspiracies
                    and constant deportations of suspected persons. It was long before he ventured
                    to be crowned in his ancient capital of Moscow (1883), and the chief event since
                    then has been the disturbed relations with England, which for a time threatened
                    war. (w. R. M.)</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Pakt V.—Russian Literatuke.</hi></p>
                <p>To get a clear idea of Russian literature, it will be most convenient for us to
                    divide it into oral and written. The first of these sections includes the
                    interesting <hi rend="italic">bîlinî,</hi> or “tales of old time,” as the word
                    may be translated, which have come down to us in great numbers, as they have
                    been sung by wandering minstrels all over the country. The scholars who during
                    the last forty years have given their attention to these compositions have made
                    the following division of them into cycles:—(1) that of the older heroes; (2)
                    that of Vladimir, prince of Kieff; (3) that of Novgorod; (4) that of Moscow; (5)
                    that of the Cossacks; (6) that of Peter the Great; (7) the modern period. These
                    poems, if they may be so styled, are not in rhyme; the ear is satisfied with a
                    certain cadence which is observed throughout. For a long time they were
                    neglected, and the collection of them only began at the commencement of the
                    present century. The style of Russian literature which prevailed from the time
                    of Lomonosoff was wholly based upon the French or pseudo-classical school. It
                    was, therefore, hardly likely that these peasant songs would attract attention.
                    But when the gospel of romanticism was preached and the <hi rend="italic"
                    >History</hi> of Karamzin appeared, which presented to the Russians a <pb
                    break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit21newyrich/page/n120/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0921-0120-0103"/>past of which they had known but little, described
                    in poetical and ornate phraseology, a new impulse was given to the collection of
                    all the remains of popular literature. In 1804 appeared a volume based upon
                    those which had been gathered together by Cyril or Kirsha Daniloff, a Cossack,
                    at the beginning of the 18th century. They were received with much enthusiasm,
                    and a second edition was published in 1818. In the following year there appeared
                    at Leipsic a translation of many of these pieces into German, in consequence of
                    which they became known much more widely. This little book of 160 pages is
                    important in many ways, and not the least so because the originals of some of
                    the bilini translated in it are now lost. Since that time large collections of
                    these poems have been published, edited by Ribnikoff, Hilferding, Sreznevski,
                    Avenarius, and others.</p>
                <p>These curious productions have all the characteristics of popular poetry in the
                    endless repetitions of certain conventional phrases—the “green wine,” “the
                    bright sun” (applied to a hero), “the damp earth,” and others. The heroes of the
                    first cycle are monstrous beings, and seem to be merely impersonifications of
                    the powers of nature; such are Volga Vseslavich, Mikula Selianinovich, and
                    Svia-togor. They are called the <hi rend="italic">bogatîri starshie.</hi>
                    Sometimes we have the giants of the mountain, as Sviatogor, and the serpent
                    Gorinich, the root of part of both names being <hi rend="italic">gora</hi>
                    (mountain). The serpent Gorinich lives in caves, and has the care of the
                    precious metals. Sometimes animal natures are mixed up with them, as <hi
                    rend="italic">zmei-bogαtkr,</hi> who unites the qualities of the serpent and the
                    giant, and bears the name of Tugarin Zmievich. There is the Pagan Idol <hi
                    rend="italic">(Idolistche Poganskoe),</hi> a great glutton, and Nightingale the
                    Robber <hi rend="italic">(Solovei RazboiniU),</hi> who terrifies travellers and
                    lives in a nest built upon six oaks.</p>
                <p>In the second cycle the legends group themselves round the celebrated prince
                    Vladimir of Kieff, in whose time the Christian religion was introduced into
                    Russia, as previously mentioned. The chief hero is Ilya Murometz, who performs
                    prodigies of valour, and is of gigantic stature and superhuman strength. The
                    cycle of Novgorod deals with the stories of Vasilii Buslaevich and Sadko, the
                    rich merchant. The great commercial prosperity of Novgorod has been already
                    described. The fourth cycle deals with the autocracy; already Moscow has become
                    the capital of the future empire. AVe are told of the taking of Kazan, of the
                    conquest of Siberia by Yermak, of Ivan the Terrible and his confidant Maliuta
                    Skuvlatovich. It is observable that in the popular tradition Ivan, in spite of
                    his cruelties, is not spoken of with any hatred. As early as 1619 some of these
                    bilini were committed to writing by Richard James, an Oxford graduate who was in
                    Russia about that time as chaplain of the embassy. The most pathetic of these is
                    that relating to the unfortunate Xenia, the daughter of Boris Godunoff. Yermak,
                    the conqueror of Siberia, forms the subject of a very spirited lay, and there is
                    another on the death of Ivan the Terrible. Considering the relation in which she
                    stood to the Russians, we cannot wonder that Marina, the wife of the false
                    Demetrius, appears as a magician. Many spirited poems are consecrated to the
                    achievements of Stenka Razia, the bold robber of the Volga, who was a long time
                    a popular hero. The cycle of Peter the Great is a very interesting one. AVe have
                    songs in abundance on the various achievements of the wonderful czar, as the
                    taking of Azoff in 1696. There is also a poem on the execution of the streltzi,
                    and another on the death of Peter. In the more modern period there are many
                    songs on Napoleon. The Cossack songs, written in the Little Russian language,
                    dwell upon the glories of the <hi rend="italic">sech,</hi> the sufferings of the
                    people from the invasions of the Turks and Mongols, the exploits of the
                    Haidamaks and lastly the fall of the Cossack republic. Besides these, the
                    Russians can boast of large collections of religious poems, many of them
                    containing very curious legends. In them we have a complete store of the beliefs
                    of the Middle Ages. A rich field may be found here for the study of comparative
                    mythology and folk-lore. Many of them are of considerable antiquity, and some
                    seem to have been derived from the Midrash. Some of the more important of these
                    have been collected by Beszonoff. Besides the bilini or legendary poems, the
                    Russians have large collections of <hi rend="italic">skazki</hi> or folk-tales,
                    which have been gathered together by Sakharoff, Afanasieff, and others. They
                    also are full of valuable materials for the study of comparative mythology.</p>
                <p>Leaving the popular and oral literature, we come to what has been committed to
                    writing. The earliest specimen of Russian, properly so-called, must be
                    considered the Ostromir Codex, written by the <hi rend="italic">diak</hi>
                    Gregory at the order of Ostromir, the <hi rend="italic">posadnik</hi> or
                    governor of Novgorod. This is a Russian recension of the Slavonic Gospels, of
                    the date 1056-57. Of the year 1073 we have the <hi rend="italic">Izbomik</hi> or
                    “Miscellany” of Sviatoslaff. It was written by John the diak or deacon for that
                    prince, and is a kind of Russian encyclopaedia, drawn from Greek sources. The
                    date is 1076. The style is praised by Buslaeff as clear and simple. The next
                    monument of the language is the <hi rend="italic">Discourse concerning the Old
                    and New Testament</hi> by Ilarion, metropolitan of Kieff. In this work there is
                    <hi rend="italic">a</hi> panegyric on Prince Vladimir of Kieff, the hero of so
                    much of the Russian popular poetry. Other writers are Theodosius, a monk of the
                    Pestcherski cloister, who wrote on the Latin faith and some <hi rend="italic"
                    >Pouchenia</hi> or “Instructions,” and Luke Zhidiata, bishop of Novgorod, who
                    has left us a curious <hi rend="italic">Discourse to the Brethren.</hi> From the
                    writings of Theodosius we see that many pagan habits were still in vogue among
                    the people. He finds fault with them for allowing these to continue, and also
                    for their drunkenness; nor do the monks escape his censures. Zhidiata writes in
                    a more vernacular style than many of his contemporaries; he eschews the
                    declamatory tone of the Byzantine authors.</p>
                <p>AVith the so-called <hi rend="italic">Chronicle</hi> of Nestor <hi rend="italic"
                    >(q.v.)</hi> begins the long series of the Russian annalists. There is a regular
                    catena of these chronicles, extending with only two breaks to the time of Alexis
                    Mikhailovich, the father of Peter the Great. Besides the work attributed to
                    Nestor, we have chronicles of Novgorod, Kieff, Volhynia, and many others. Every
                    town of any importance could boast of its annalists, Pskoff and Suzdal among
                    others. In some respects these compilations, the productions of monks in their
                    cloisters, remind us of the <hi rend="italic">Anglo-Saxon Chronicle,</hi> dry
                    details alternating with here and there a picturesque incident; but the <hi
                    rend="italic">Anglo-Saxon Chronicle</hi> has nothing of the saga about it, and
                    many of these annals abound with the quaintest stories. There are also works of
                    early travellers, as the igumen Daniel, who visited the Holy Land at the end of
                    the 11th and beginning of the 12th century. A later traveller was Athanasius
                    Nikitin, a merchant of Tver, who visited India in 1470. He has left a record of
                    his adventures, which has been translated into English and published for the
                    Hakluyt Society. Later also is the account written by the two merchants,
                    Korobeinikoff and Grekoff. They were sent with a sum of money to the Holy
                    Sepulchre to entreat the monks to pray without ceasing for the soul of the son
                    of Ivan the Terrible, whom his father had killed. A curious monument of old
                    Slavonic times is the <hi rend="italic">Pouchenie</hi> (“Instruction”) written
                    by VIadimir Monomakh for the benefit of his sons. This composition is generally
                    found inserted in the <hi rend="italic">Chronicle</hi> of Nestor; it gives a
                    quaint picture of the daily life of a Slavonic prince.</p>
                <p>In the 12th century we have the sermons of Cyril, the bishop of Turoff, which are
                    attempts to imitate in Russian <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit21newyrich/page/n121/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0921-0121-0104"/>the florid Byzantine style. He is very fond of
                    allegorical representations; thus, in his sermon on Holy Week, Christianity is
                    represented under the form of spring, Paganism and Judaism under that of winter,
                    and evil thoughts are spoken of as boisterous winds. An attempt to carry this
                    symbolism through other portions of his writings leads him to many fantastic
                    conceits which are far from being in good taste. And here may be mentioned the
                    many lives of the saints and the Fathers to be found in early Russian
                    literature. Some of these have been edited by Count Bezborodko in his <hi
                    rend="italic">Pametniki Starinnoi Russkoi Literaturi</hi> (“Memorials of Ancient
                    Russian Literature”).</p>
                <p>We now come to the story of the expedition of Prince Igor, which is a kind of
                    bilina in prose, and narrates the expedition of Igor, prince of
                    Novgorod-Severski, against the Polovtzes. The manuscript was at one time
                    preserved in a monastery at Yaroslavl, but was burnt in the great fire at Moscow
                    in the year 1812. Luckily the story had been edited (after a fashion) by Count
                    Musin-Pushkin, and a transcript was also found among the papers of the empress
                    Catherine. The authenticity of this production has been disputed by some modern
                    scholars, but without solid grounds. The original was seen by several men of
                    letters in Russia, Karamzin among the number. There is a mixture of Christian
                    and heathen allusions, but there are parallels to this style of writing in such
                    a piece as the “Discourse of a Lover of Christ and Advocate of the True Faith,”
                    from which an extract has been given by Buslaeff in his <hi rend="italic"
                    >Chrestomathy.</hi> Unlike most of the productions of this period, which are
                    tedious, and interesting only to the philologist and antiquary, there is a great
                    deal of poetical spirit in the story of Igor, and the metaphors are frequently
                    very vigorous. Mention is made in it of another bard named Boyan, but none of
                    his inspirations have come down to us. A strange legend is that of the czar
                    Solomon and Kitovras, but the story occurs in the popular literatures of many
                    countries. Some similar productions among the Russians are merely adaptations of
                    old Bulgarian tales, especially the so-called apocryphal writings. The <hi
                    rend="italic">Zadon-stchina</hi> is a sort of prose-poem much in the style of
                    the “Story of Igor,” and the resemblance of the latter to this piece and to many
                    other of the <hi rend="italic">skαzαniα</hi> included in or attached to the
                    Russian chronicle, furnishes an additional proof of its genuineness. The account
                    of the battle of the “Field of Woodcocks,” which was gained by Dmitri Donskoi
                    over the Mongols in 1380, has come down in three important versions. The first
                    bears the title “Story of the Fight of the Prince Dmitri Ivanovich with Marnai”;
                    it is rather meagre in details but full of expressions showing the patriotism of
                    the writer. The second version is more complete in its historical details, but
                    still is not without anachronisms. The third is altogether poetical. The <hi
                    rend="italic">Povixst ο Drakule</hi> (“Story of Drakula”) is a collection of
                    anecdotes relating to a cruel prince of Moldavia, who lived at the beginning of
                    the 15th century. Several of the barbarities described in it have also been
                    assigned to Ivan the Terrible.</p>
                <p>The early Russian laws present many features of interest, such as the <hi
                    rend="italic">Ruxskaia Pravda</hi> of Yaroslaff, which is preserved in the
                    chronicle of Novgorod; the date is between 1018 and 1054. Large additions were
                    made to it by subsequent princes. It has many points in common with the
                    Scandinavian codes, <hi rend="italic">e.g.,</hi> trial by wager of battle, the
                    wergild, and the circuits of the judges. The laws show Russia at that time to
                    have been in civilization quite on a level with the rest of Europe. But the evil
                    influence of the Mongols was soon to make itself felt. The next important code
                    is the <hi rend="italic">Sudebnik</hi> of Ivan III., the date of which is 1497;
                    this was followed by that of Ivan IV., of the year 1550, in which we have a
                    republication by the czar of his grandfather’s laws, with additions. In the time
                    of this emperor also was issued the <hi rend="italic">Stoglav</hi> (1551), a
                    body of ecclesiastical regulations. Mention must also be made of the <hi
                    rend="italic">Ulozhxnix</hi> or “Ordinance” of the czar Alexis. This abounds
                    with enactments of sanguinary punishment: women are buried alive for murdering
                    their husbands; torture is recognized as a means of procuring evidence; and the
                    knout and mutilation are mentioned on almost every page. Some of the penalties
                    are whimsical: for instance, the man who uses tobacco is to have his nose cut
                    off; this, however, was to be altered by Peter the Great, who himself practised
                    the habit and encouraged it in others.</p>
                <p>In 1553 a printing press was established at Moscow, and in 1564 the first book
                    was printed, an “Apostol,” as it is called, <hi rend="italic">ix.,</hi> a book
                    containing the Acts of the Apostles and the Epistles. The printers were Ivan
                    Feodoroff and Peter Mstislavetz; a monument was erected a year or two ago to the
                    memory of the former. As early as 1548 Ivan had invited printers to Russia, but
                    they were detained on their journey. Feodoroff and his companions were soon,
                    however, compelled to leave Russia, and found a protector in Sigismund III. The
                    cause of their failure appears to have been the enmity which they had stirred up
                    among the copyists of books, who felt that their means of gaining a livelihood
                    were lessened. They succeeded accordingly in drawing over to their side the more
                    fanatical priests, who thought it degrading that the sacred books should be
                    multiplied by such an art, just as at the present day the Arabs refuse to allow
                    the Koran to be printed. The first Slavonic Bible was printed at Ostrog in
                    Volhynia in 1581. Another press, however, was soon established at Moscow; up to
                    1600 sixteen books had been issued there.</p>
                <p>A curious work of the time of Ivan the Terrible is the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Domostroi,</hi> or “Book of Household Management,” which is said to have been
                    written by the monk Sylvester, although this statement has been disputed. This
                    priest was at one time very influential with Ivan, but ultimately offended him
                    and was banished to the Solovetzkoi monastery on the White Sea. The work was
                    originally intended by Sylvester for his son Anthemius and his daughter-in-law
                    Pelagia, but it soon became very popular and in general use. We have a faithful
                    picture of the Russia of the time, with all its barbarisms and ignorance. We see
                    the unbounded authority of the husband in his own household: he may inflict
                    personal chastisement upon his wife; and her chief duty lies in ministering to
                    his wants. The Mongols had introduced into Russia the Oriental seclusion of
                    women; those of the older time knew nothing of these restrictions. Sylvester, or
                    whoever wrote the book, was a complete conservative, as indeed the clergy of
                    Russia almost universally were. <note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>In a curious letter of the date of 1698, and now among the
                    manuscripts of the Bodleian, Bishop Burnet writes thus of a priest who
                    accompanied Peter the Great to England: “The czar’s priest is come over, who is
                    a truly holy man, and more learned than I should have imagined, but thinks it a
                    great piece of religion to be no wiser than his fathers, and therefore cannot
                    bear the thought of imagining that anything among them can want amendment.”
                    </p></note> To the reign of Ivan the Terrible must also be assigned the <hi
                    rend="italic">Chetii-Minei</hi> or “Book of Monthly Readings,” containing
                    extracts from the Greek fathers, arranged for every day of the week. The work
                    was compiled by the metropolitan Macarius, and was the labour of twelve years.
                    An important writer of the same period was Prince Alexander Kurbski, descended
                    from the sovereigns of Yaroslavl, who was born about 1528. In his early days
                    Kurbski saw a great deal of service, having fought at Kazan and in Livonia, But
                    he quarrelled with Ivan, who had begun to persecute the followers of Sylvester
                    and Adasheff, and fled to Lithuania in 1563, where he was well received by <pb

                    xml:id="kp-eb0921-0122-0105"/>Sigismund Augustus. From his retreat he commenced
                    a correspondence with Ivan, in which he reproached him for his many cruelties.
                    Ivan in his answer declared that he was quite justified in taking the lives of
                    his slaves, if he thought it right to do so. While living in Lithuania, Kurbski
                    appeared as the defender of the Greek faith, which was being undermined by the
                    Jesuits. He died in exile in 1583. Kurbski was a fluent writer, but Bestu-zheff
                    Riumin thinks that his hatred of Ivan led him to exaggerate, and he regrets that
                    Karamzin should have followed him so closely. Besides the answers of Ivan to
                    Kurbski, there is his letter to Cosmas, and the brotherhood of the Cyrillian
                    monastery on the White Lake (Bielo Ozero), in which he reproaches them for the
                    self-indulgent lives they are leading. Other works of the 16th century are the
                    <hi rend="italic">Stepennaya Kniga,</hi> or “Book of Degrees” (“or Pedigrees”),
                    in which historical events are grouped under the reigns of the grand-dukes,
                    whose pedigrees are also given; and the <hi rend="italic">Life of the Czar
                    Eeodor Ivanovich</hi> (1584-1598), written by the patriarch Job. To the
                    beginning of the 17th century belongs the <hi rend="italic">Chronograph</hi> of
                    Sergius Kubasoff of Tobolsk. His work extends from the creation of the world to
                    the accession of Michael Romanoff, and contains interesting accounts of such of
                    the inembers of the Russian royal family as Kubasoff had himself seen. Something
                    of the same kind must have been the journal of Prince Mstislavski, which he
                    showed the English ambassador Jerome Horsey, but which is now lost. <note

                <p>To the time of the first Romanoffs belongs the story of the siege of Azoff, a
                    prose poem, which tells us, in an inflated style, how in 1637 a body of Cossacks
                    triumphantly repelled the attacks of the Turks. They had seized this town, which
                    they were anxious to hand over to the czar Michael, but circumstances were not
                    ripe for it. There is also an account of the siege of the Troitza monastery by
                    the Poles during the “Smutnoye Vremya,” or Period of Troubles, as it is
                    called,—that which deals with the adventures of the false Demetrius and the
                    Polish invasion which followed. But all these are surpassed by the work on
                    Russia of Gregory Karpoff Kotoshikhin. He served in the ambassador’s office <hi
                    rend="italic">(posolski prikaz),</hi> and when called upon to give information
                    against his colleagues fled to Poland about 1664. Thence he passed into Sweden
                    and wrote his account of Russia at the request of Count Delagardie, the
                    chancellor of that country. He was executed about 1669 for slaying in a quarrel
                    the master of the house in which he lived. The manuscript was found by Prof.
                    Solovieff (not the eminent historian lately deceased) at Upsala and printed in
                    1840. A new edition has recently appeared, and Prof. Grote has collected some
                    fresh facts about the author’s life, but we have no space here for a minute
                    examination of them. The picture which Kotoshikhin draws of his native country
                    is a sad one: ignorance, cruelty, and superstition are seen everywhere rampant.
                    His work is of great importance, since it is from his description, and the facts
                    we gather from the <hi rend="italic">Domostroi,</hi> that we can reconstruct the
                    Old Russia of the time before Peter the Great, as in our days the valuable
                    labours of M. Zabielin have done in his work on Russian domestic life. Perhaps,
                    as an exile from his country, Kotoshikhin has allowed himself to write too
                    bitterly. A curious work is the <hi rend="italic">Uriadnik Sokol-nichia
                    Puti</hi> (“Directions for Falconry”), which was written for the use of the
                    emperor Alexis, who, like many Russians of old time, was much addicted to this
                    pastime. The Serb, Yuri Krizhanich, who wrote in Russian, was the first
                    Pan-slavist, anticipating Kollar by one hundred and fifty years or more. He
                    wrote a critical Servian grammar (with comparison of the Russian, Polish,
                    Croatian, and White Russian), which was edited from the manuscripts by Bodianski
                    in 1848. For his time he had a very good insight into Slavonic philology. His
                    Panslavism, however, sometimes took a form by no means practical. He went so far
                    as to maintain that a common Slavonic language might be made for all the peoples
                    of that race,— an impossible project which has been the dream of many
                    enthusiasts. From some unexplained cause he was banished to Siberia, and
                    finished his grammar at Tobolsk. He also wrote a work on the Russian empire,
                    which was edited by Beszonoff in 1860. In it he shows himself a widely-read man,
                    and with very extensive Western culture. The picture drawn, as in the
                    corresponding production of Kotoshikhin, is a very gloomy one. The great remedy
                    suggested by the Serb is education. To this period belongs the life of the
                    patriarch Nikon by Shusherin. The struggles of Nikon with the czar, and his
                    emendations of the sacred books, which led to a great schism in Russia, are well
                    known. They have been made familiar to Englishmen by the eloquent pages of Dean
                    Stanley. <note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi
                    rend="italic">Lectures on the Eastern Church.</hi></p></note> At Aloscow may be
                    seen the portrait of this celebrated divine and his tomb; his robes, which have
                    been preserved, show him to have been a man of 7 feet in stature. The mistakes
                    which had crept into the translation of the Scriptures, from the blunders of
                    generations of copyists, were frequently of a ludicrous character; still, a
                    large number of the people preferred retaining them, and from this revision may
                    be dated the rise of the Raskolniks (Dissenters) or Staro-obriadtzi (those who
                    adhere to the old ritual). With the name of Simeon Polotzki (1628-1680) the old
                    period of Russian literature may be closed. He was tutor to the czar Feodor, son
                    of Alexis, and may be said in a way to have helped to introduce the culture of
                    the West into Russia, as he was educated at Kieff, then a portion of Polish
                    territory. Polotzki came to Moscow about 1664. He wrote religious works <hi
                    rend="italic">(Vienetz Vierî,</hi> “The Garland of Faith,”) and composed poems
                    and religious dramas <hi rend="italic">(The Prodigal Son, Nebuchadnezzar,</hi>
                    &amp;c.). He has left us some droll verses on the czar’s new palace of
                    Kolomenskoe, which are very curious doggerel. The artificial lions that roared,
                    moved their eyes, and walked especially delighted him. Alexis had probably
                    ordered something to be constructed resembling the machinery we find mentioned
                    in the Byzantine writers. There does not seem to be any ground for the assertion
                    (often met with even in Russian writers) that Sophia, the sister of Peter the
                    Great, was acquainted with French, and translated some of the plays of
                    Moliere.</p>
                <p>And now all things were to be changed as if by an enchanter’s wand. Russia was to
                    leave her martyrologies and historical stories and fragmentary chronicles, and
                    to -adopt the forms of literature in use in the West. One of the chief helpers
                    of Peter the Great in the education of the people was Feofane (Theophanes)
                    Procopovich, who advocated the cause of science, and attacked unsparingly the
                    superstitions then prevalent; the cause of conservatism was defended by Stephen
                    Yavorski. The <hi rend="italic">Rock of Faith</hi> of the latter was written to
                    refute the Lutherans and Calvinists. Another remarkable writer of the times of
                    Peter the Great was Pososhkoff, who produced a valuable work on <hi
                    rend="italic">Poverty and Riches,</hi> a kind of treatise on political economy.
                    Antiokh Kantemir (1708-1744), son of a former hospodar of Moldavia, wrote some
                    clever satires still read; they are imitated from Boileau. He also <pb

                    xml:id="kp-eb0921-0123-0106"/>translated parts of Horace. Besides his satires,
                    he published versions of Fontenelle’s <hi rend="italic">Pluralité des
                    Mondes</hi> and the histories of Justin and Cornelius Nepos. He was for some
                    time Russian ambassador at the courts of London and Paris. But more celebrated
                    than these men was Michael Lomonosofe (q <hi rend="italic">.v.).</hi> He was an
                    indefatigable writer of verse and prose, and has left odes, tragedies, didactic
                    poetry, essays, and fragments of epics; without being a man of great genius he
                    did much to advance the education of his country. He also made many valuable
                    contributions to science. Basil Tatistcheff (1686— 1750), a statesman of
                    eminence, was the author of a Russian history which, although written in a
                    confused style and hardly superior to a chronicle, is interesting as the first
                    attempt in that field, which was afterwards so successfully cultivated by
                    Karamzin, Solovieff, and Kosto-maroff. His work was not given to the world till
                    after his death. There had been a slight sketch published before by Khilkoff,
                    entitled the <hi rend="italic">Harrow of Russian History.</hi> Basil
                    Trediakovski (1703-1769) was but a poor poetaster, in spite of his many
                    productions. He was born at Astrakhan, and we are told that Peter, passing
                    through that city at the time of his Persian expedition, had Trediakovski
                    pointed out to him as one of the most promising boys of the school there.
                    Whereupon, having questioned him, the czar said, with truly prophetic insight,
                    “A busy worker, but master of nothing.” His <hi rend="italic">Telemakhida,</hi>
                    a poem in which he versified the <hi rend="italic">Telemaque</hi> of Fénelon,
                    drew upon him the derision of the wits of the time. He had frequently to endure
                    the rough horse-play of the courtiers, for the position of a literary man at
                    that time in Russia was not altogether a cheerful one.</p>
                <p>From the commencement of the reign of Elizabeth Russian literature made great
                    progress, the French furnishing models. Alexander Sumarokoff (1718-1777) wrote
                    prose and verse in abundance—comedies, tragedies, idyls, satires, and epigrams.
                    He is, perhaps, best entitled to remembrance for his plays, which are rhymed,
                    and in the French style. It took the Russians some time to find out that their
                    language was capable of the unrhymed iambic line, which is the most suitable for
                    tragedy. His <hi rend="italic">Dmitri Samozvanetz</hi> (“Demetrius the
                    Pretender”) is certainly not without merit. Some of the pieces of Kniazhnin had
                    great success in their time, such as <hi rend="italic">The Chatterbox, The
                    Originals,</hi> and especially <hi rend="italic">The Fatal Carriage.</hi> He is
                    now, however, almost forgotten. In 1756 the first theatre was opened at St
                    Petersburg, the director being Sumarokoff. Up to this time the Russians had
                    acted only religious plays, such as those written by Simeon Polotzki. The reign
                    of Catherine II. (1762—96) saw the rise of a whole generation of court poets,
                    many of whom were at best but poor writers. Everything in Russia was to be
                    forced like plants in a hot-house; she was to have Homers, Pindars, Horaces, and
                    Virgils. Michael Kheraskoff (1733—1807) wrote besides other poems two enormous
                    epics—the <hi rend="italic">Rossiada</hi> in twelve books, and <hi rend="italic"
                    >Vladimir</hi> in eighteen; they are now but little read. Although they are
                    tedious poems on the whole, yet we occasionally find spirited passages.
                    Bogdanovich (1743-1803) wrote a pretty lyric piece, <hi rend="italic"
                    >Dushenka,</hi> based upon La Fontaine, and telling the old story of the loves
                    of Cupid and Psyche. Perhaps the elegance of the versification is the best thing
                    to be found in it. With Ivan Khemnitzer begins the long list of fabulists; this
                    Iialf-Oriental form of literature, so common in countries ruled absolutely, has
                    been very popular iu Russia. Khemnitzer (1744-1784), whose name seems to imply a
                    German origin, began by translating the fables of Geliert, but afterwards
                    produced original specimens of this kind of literature. A writer of real
                    national comedy appeared in Denis von Visin, probably of</p>
                <p>German extraction, but born at Moscow (1745-1792). His best production is <hi
                    rend="italic">Nedorosl</hi> (“The Minor”), in which he satirizes the coarse
                    features of Russian society, the ill-treatment of the serfs, and other matters.
                    The colouring of the piece is truly national. He has also left some very good
                    letters describing his travels. He saw France on the eve of the great
                    Revolution, and has well described what he did see. Russian as he was, and
                    accustomed to serfdom, he was yet astonished at the wretched condition of the
                    French peasants. The great poet of the age of Catherine, the laureate of her
                    glories, was Gabriel Derzhavin (1743-1816). He essayed many styles of
                    composition, and was ε great master of his native language. Many of his lyric
                    pieces are full of fire. No one can deny the poet a vigorous imagination and a
                    great power of expressing his ideas. There is something grandiose and organ-like
                    in his high-sounding verses; unfortunately he occasionally degenerates into
                    bombast. His versification is perfect; and he had the courage, rare at the time,
                    to write satirically of many persons of high rank. His <hi rend="italic">Ode to
                    God</hi> is the best known of his poems in Western countries. We can see from
                    some of his pieces that ho was a student of Edward Young, the author of the <hi
                    rend="italic">Night Thoughts.</hi> Tawdry rhetoric, containing, however,
                    occasionally fine and original thoughts, rendered this writer popular throughout
                    Europe. Other celebrated poems of Derzhavin are the <hi rend="italic">Odes on
                    the Death of Prince Mestcherski, The Nobleman, The Taking of Ismail,</hi> and
                    <hi rend="italic">The Taking of Warsaw.</hi></p>
                <p>Au unfortunate author of the days of Catherine was Alexander Radistcheff, who,
                    having, in a small work, <hi rend="italic">A</hi><hi rend="italic">Journey to
                    Moscow,</hi> spoken too severely of the miserable condition of the serfs, was
                    punished by banishment to Siberia, from which he was afterwards allowed to
                    return, but not till his health had been permanently injured by his sufferings.
                    An equally sad fate befell the spirited writer Novikoff, who, after having
                    worked hard as a journalist, and done much for education in Russia, fell under
                    the suspicion of the Government, and was imprisoned by Catherine. On her death
                    he was released by her successor. The short reign of Paul was not favourable to
                    literary production; the censorship of the press was extremely severe, and many
                    foreign books were excluded from Russia. Authors and lovers of literature were
                    liable to get into trouble, as we see by the experiences of the poet Kotzebue
                    and pastor Seidler.</p>
                <p>But a better state of things came with the reign of Alexander, one of the glories
                    of whose days was Nicholas Karamzin <hi rend="italic">(q.v.).</hi> His chief
                    work is his <hi rend="italic">History of the Russian Empire,</hi> but he
                    appeared in the fourfold aspect of historian, novelist, essayist, and poet. Nor
                    need we do more than mention the celebrated Archbishop Platon <hi rend="italic"
                    >(q.v.).</hi> Ivan Dmitrieff (1760-1837) wrote some pleasing lyrics and
                    epistles, but without much force. He is like some feeble British poets towards
                    the close of last century, in whom the elegance of the diction will not atone
                    for the feebleness of the ideas. He appears from his translations to have been
                    well acquainted with the English poets. Ozeroff wrote a great many tragedies,
                    which are but little read now. They are in rhyming alexandrines. His form
                    belongs to the false classical school, but he occasionally handled native
                    subjects with success, as in his <hi rend="italic">Dmitri Donskoi</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">Yaropolk and Oleg.</hi> In Ivan Kriloff (1768-1844) the Russians
                    found their most genial fabulist. His pieces abound with vigorous pictures of
                    Russian national life, and many of his lines are standard quotations with the
                    Russians, just as <hi rend="italic">Hudibrax</hi> is with ourselves. Long before
                    his death Kriloff had become the most popular man in Russia. He resembled La
                    Fontaine not only in the style of his verse but in his manner of life. He was
                    the same careless, unpractical sort of person, and <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0921-0124-0107"/>showed the same simplicity of character. As
                    Derzhavin was the poet of the age of Catherine, so Zhukovski (1783-1852) may be
                    said to have been that of the age of Alexander. He is more remarkable, however,
                    as a translator than as an original poet. With him Romanticism began in Russia.
                    The pseudo-classical school, led by the French, was now dead throughout Europe.
                    In 1802 he published his version of Gray’s <hi rend="italic">Elegy,</hi> which
                    at once became a highly popular poem in Russia. Zhukovski translated many pieces
                    from the German (Goethe, Schiller, Uhland) and English (Byron, Moore, Southey).
                    One of his original productions, “The Poet in the Camp of the Russian Warriors,”
                    was on the lips of every one at the time of the war of the fatherland <hi
                    rend="italic">(Otechestvennaia Voina)</hi> in 1812. He attempted to familiarize
                    the Russians with all the most striking specimens of foreign poetical
                    literature. He produced versions of the episode of Nala and Damayanti from the
                    <hi rend="italic">Mahabharata,</hi> of Rustam and Zohrab from the <hi
                    rend="italic">Shah-Namah,</hi> and of a part of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Odyssey.</hi> In the case of these three masterpieces, however, he was obliged
                    to work from literal translations (mostly German), as he was unacquainted with
                    the original languages. The <hi rend="italic">Iliad</hi> was translated during
                    this period by Gnedich, who was familiar with Greek. He has produced a faithful
                    and spirited version, and has naturalized the hexameter in the Russian language
                    with much skill. Constantine Batiushkoff (1787-1855) was the author of many
                    elegant poems, and at the outset of his career promised much, but sank into
                    imbecility, and lived in this condition to an advanced age. Merzliakoff and
                    Tziganoff deserve a passing notice as the writers of songs some of which still
                    keep their popularity. As the poet of the age of Catherine was Derzhavin, and of
                    that of Alexander Zhukovski, so the next reign, that of Nicholas, was to have
                    its representative poet, by the common consent of his critics the greatest whom
                    Russia had yet seen. During his short life (1799-1837) Alexander Pushkin
                    produced many celebrated poems, which will be found enumerated in the article
                    devoted to him (see Poushkin). It may suffice to say here that he tried almost
                    all styles of composition—the drama, lyric poetry, the novel, and many others.
                    In Alexander Griboiedoff (1794-1829) the Russians saw the writer of one of their
                    most clever comedies <hi rend="italic">(Gore ot Uma),</hi> which may perhaps be
                    translated “The Misfortune of being too Clever” (lit. “Grief out of Wit”). The
                    fate of Griboiedoffwas sad; he was murdered in a riot at Teheran, where he was
                    residing as Russian minister at the court of Persia. The poet is said to have
                    had a presentiment of his fate and to have been unwilling to go. Pushkin, while
                    travelling in the Caucasus, in the track of the army of Paskewitch, met the body
                    of his friend, which was being carried to Tiflis for burial. The satirical
                    powers of Griboiedoff come out in every line of his play; he was unquestionably
                    a man of genius. A few words may be allowed to Ivan Kozloff (1774-1838), the
                    author of some pretty original lyrics, and some translations from the English,
                    among others Burns’s <hi rend="italic">Cotter’s Saturday Night.</hi> He became a
                    cripple and blind, and his misfortunes elicited some cheering and sympathetic
                    lines from Pushkin, which will always be read with pleasure.</p>
                <p>Since the death of Pushkin, the most eminent Russian poet is Lermontoff
                    (1814-41); his life terminated, like that of his predecessor, in a duel. He has
                    left us many exquisite lyrics, mostly written in a morbid and melancholy spirit.
                    In quite a different vein is his clever imitation of a Russian bilina, “Song
                    about the Czar Ivan Vasilievich, the Young Oprichnik, and the Bold Merchant
                    Kalashnikoff.” The poet was of Scotch extraction (Learmont), the termination
                    being added to Russify his name. In one of his pieces he has alluded to his</p>
                <p>Caledonian ancestors. His chief poems are “The Demon,” “The Novice” (“Mtziri,” a
                    Georgian word), and “Hadji Abrek.” He also wrote a novel, <hi rend="italic">A
                    Hero of our Time.</hi> He has faithfully reproduced in his poems the wild and
                    varied scenery of the Caucasus and Georgia; from them he has drawn his
                    inspiration—feeling, no doubt, that the flat grey landscapes of northern Russia
                    offered no attractions to the poet. A genuine bard of the people, and one of
                    their most truly national authors, was Koltzoff (1809-1842), the son of a tallow
                    merchant of Voronezh. He has left us a few exquisite lyrics, which are to be
                    found in all the collections of Russian poetry. He died of consumption after a
                    protracted illness. Another poet who much resembled Koltzoff was Nikitin, born
                    in the same town, Voronezh. His life was spent in poverty; his father was an
                    incurable drunkard, and brought his family to the greatest distress. Nikitin, to
                    support his relations, was obliged to keep an inn; this he was afterwards
                    enabled to change for the more congenial occupation of a bookseller. He died in
                    1861. The novel in Russia has had its cultivators in Zagoskin and Lazhechnikoff,
                    who imitated Sir Walter Scott. The most celebrated of the romances of Zagoskin
                    was <hi rend="italic">Yuri Milo-slavski,</hi> a tale of the expulsion of the
                    Poles from Russia in 1612. The book may even yet be read with interest; it gives
                    a very spirited picture of the times; unfortunately, as is but too often the
                    case with the writings of Sir Walter Scott himself, a gloss is put upon the
                    barbarity of the manners of the period, and the persons of the novel have
                    sentiments and modes of expressing them which could only have existed about two
                    centuries afterwards. There is also too much of the sentimentalism which was
                    prevalent at the time when the author wrote. Among the better known productions
                    of Lazhechnikoff are <hi rend="italic">The Heretic</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >The Palace of Ice.</hi> A flashy but now forgotten writer of novels was
                    Bulgarin, author of <hi rend="italic">Ivan Vishigin,</hi> a work which once
                    enjoyed considerable popularity. The first Russian novelist of great and
                    original talent was Nicholas Gogol (1809-1852). In his <hi rend="italic">Dead
                    Souls</hi> he satirized all classes of society, some of the portraits being
                    wonderfully vivid; take, for example, that of Pliush-kin, the miser. Being a
                    native of Little Russia, he is very fond of introducing descriptions of its
                    scenery and the habits of the people, especially in such stories as the <hi
                    rend="italic">Old-fashioned Household,</hi> or in the more powerful <hi
                    rend="italic">Taras Bulba.</hi> This last is a highly-wrought story, giving us a
                    picture of the savage warfare carried on between the Cossacks and Poles. Taras
                    is brave, but perhaps too much of a barbarian to be made interesting to Western
                    readers. He reminds us of some of the heroes of the Cossack poet Shevchenko.
                    Gogol was also the author of a good comedy, <hi rend="italic">The Reviser,</hi>
                    wherein the petty pilferings of Russian municipal authorities are satirized. In
                    his <hi rend="italic">Memoirs of a Madman</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >Portrait,</hi> he shows a weird and fantastic power which proves him to have
                    been a man of strong imagination. The same may be said of <hi rend="italic">The
                    Cloak,</hi> and the curious tale <hi rend="italic">Vii</hi> (“The Demon”), where
                    he gives us a picture of Kieff in the old days. He has very dexterously
                    interwoven his tales with the traditions and superstitions of Little Russia. The
                    fate of Gogol was sad; he sank into religious melancholy, and ultimately into
                    imbecility. He made great efforts to destroy all his writings, and indeed burnt
                    most of the second part of his <hi rend="italic">Dead Souls</hi>; only fragments
                    have been preserved. His <hi rend="italic">Confessions of an Author</hi> is the
                    production of a mind verging on insanity. He died in 1852, aged forty-two. Since
                    his time the novel has been very much cultivated in Russia, the school
                    culminating in Ivan Turgenieff, but it is the school of Thackeray and Dickens,
                    not that of Balzac and George Sand. The Russians seem to affect especially the
                    realistic <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit21newyrich/page/n125/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0921-0125-0108"/>novels of England. Among the most conspicuous of
                    these writers was the celebrated Alexander Herzen, author of a striking romance,
                    <hi rend="italic">Kto Vinovat?</hi> (“Who is to Blame? ”), which he published
                    under the assumed name of Iskander. The public career of Herzen is well known.
                    The freedom of his opinions soon embroiled him with the authorities. He was
                    exiled to Perm, and, seizing the first opportunity which offered itself of
                    passing the Russian frontiers, he spent the remainder of his life chiefly in
                    France and England, and died at Geneva in 1869. His celebrated journal <hi
                    rend="italic">Kolokol</hi> (“The Bell ”) had a great circulation. A novelist of
                    repute was Goncharoff, his two chief works being <hi rend="italic">A
                    Common-place Story</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Oblomoff.</hi> Grigorovich has
                    written <hi rend="italic">The Fisherman</hi> and <hi rend="italic">The
                    Emigrants.</hi> Pisemski, another novelist of the realistic type, is the author
                    of <hi rend="italic">The Man of St Petersburg</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Lieshi
                    (“</hi> The Wood Demons”). Other novelists of celebrity are Saltikoff, who
                    writes under the name of Stchedrin, and whose <hi rend="italic">Provincial
                    Sketches</hi> published a few years ago made a great sensation and have been
                    followed by <hi rend="italic">Letters to My Aunt</hi> and other works;
                    Dostoïevski (d. 1881), author of <hi rend="italic">Poor People, Letters from the
                    House of the Dead</hi> (describing his impressions of Siberia, whither he was
                    banished in consequence of a political offence), a powerful writer; and
                    Ostrovski. We may also add Ryeshetnikoff, who takes his characters from the
                    humbler classes; he died at the early age of thirty-nine. All these are
                    disciples of the school of Dickens and Thackeray. Count A. Tolstoi, also
                    celebrated as a dramatist, has written an historical novel entitled <hi
                    rend="italic">Prince Sert-brianni.</hi> Count L. Tolstoi is author of a work of
                    fiction describing the war of 1812, which has gained great celebrity in Russia,
                    <hi rend="italic">Voina i Mir</hi> (“War and Peace”). Novelists of the French
                    school are Krestovski, Stebnitzki, and Bobo-rikin. During 1885 a new writer of
                    merit, Kozolenko, appeared, who describes Siberian life.</p>
                <p>On September 4, 1883, died Ivan Turgenieff, aged sixty-four, the most eminent
                    Russian novelist, and perhaps the only Russian man of letters universally known.
                    His celebrity dates from his <hi rend="italic">Memoirs of a Sportsman,</hi> in
                    which he appears as the advocate of the Russian <hi rend="italic">muzhik</hi> or
                    peasant. He had witnessed in his youth many sad scenes at his own home, where
                    his mother, a wealthy lady of the old school, treated her serfs with great
                    cruelty. The poet devoted all his energies to procure their emancipation. This
                    work was followed by a long array of tales, too well known to need
                    recapitulation here, which have gained their author a European reputation, such
                    as <hi rend="italic">Dvorianskoe Gnezdo</hi> (“A Nest of Gentle People ”), one
                    of the most pathetic tales in any language, <hi rend="italic">Nov</hi> (“Virgin
                    Soil”), and others; nor can the minor tales of Turgenieff be forgotten,
                    especially <hi rend="italic">Mumu,</hi> a story based upon real life, for the
                    dumb doorkeeper was a serf of his mother’s, and experienced her ill-treatment.
                    His last two works were <hi rend="italic">Poetry in Prose</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">Clara Milixh.</hi></p>
                <p>In Belinski the Russians produced their best critic. For thirteen years
                    (1834-1847) he was the Aristarchus of Russian literature and exercised a healthy
                    influence. In his latter days he addressed a withering epistle to Gogol on the
                    newly-adopted reactionary views of the latter.</p>
                <p>Since the time of Karamzin the study of Russian history has made great strides.
                    He was followed by Nicholas Polevoi, who wrote what he called the <hi
                    rend="italic">History of the Russian People,</hi> but his work was not received
                    with much favour and has now fallen into oblivion. Polevoi was a self-educated
                    man, the son of a Siberian merchant; besides editing a well-known Russian
                    journal <hi rend="italic">The Telegraph,</hi> he was also the author of many
                    plays, among others a translation of <hi rend="italic">Hamlet.</hi> Since his
                    time, however, the English dramatist has been produced in a more perfect dress
                    by Kroneberg, Druzhinin, and others. In the year 1879 died Sergius Solovieff,
                    whose <hi rend="italic">History of Russia</hi> had reached its twenty-eighth
                    volume, and fragments of the twenty-ninth were published after his death. This
                    stupendous labour lacks something of the critical faculty, and perhaps may be
                    described rather as a quarry of materials for future historians of Russia than
                    an actual history. During 1885 the Russians have had to mourn the loss of
                    Kostomaroff, the writer of many valuable monographs on the history of their
                    country, of which those -on Bogdan Khmelnitzki and the False Demetrius deserve
                    special mention. From 1847 to 1854 Kostomaroff, who had become obnoxious to the
                    Russian Government, wrote nothing, having been banished to Saratoff, and
                    forbidden to teach or publish. But after this time his literary activity begins
                    again, and, besides separate works, the leading Russian reviews, such as <hi
                    rend="italic">Old and New Russia, The Historical Messenger,</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">The Messenger of Europe,</hi> contain many contributions from his
                    pen of the highest value. In 1885 also died Constantine Kavelin, the author of
                    many valuable works on Russian law, and Kalatcheff, who published a classical
                    edition of the old Russian codes. Hovaiski and Gedeonoff have attempted to upset
                    the general belief that the founders of the Russian empire were Scandinavians.
                    Their opinions have been alluded to above (p. 87). A good history of Russia was
                    published by Ustrialoff (1855), but his most celebrated work was his <hi
                    rend="italic">Tzarstvovanie Petra Velikago</hi> (“Reign of Peter the Great”); in
                    this many important documents first saw the light, and the circumstances of the
                    death of the unfortunate Alexis were made clear. Russian writers of history have
                    not generally occupied themselves with any other subject than that of their own
                    country, but an exception may be found in the writings of Granovski, such as <hi
                    rend="italic">Abbé Suger</hi> (1849) and <hi rend="italic">Four Historical
                    Portraits</hi> (1850). So also Kudriav-tzoff, who died in 1850, wrote on “The
                    Fortunes of Italy, from the Fall of the Roman Empire of the West till its
                    Reconstruction by Charlemagne.” He also wrote on “The Roman Women as described
                    by Tacitus.” We may add Kareyeff, now professor at AVarsaw, who has written on
                    the condition of the French peasantry before the Revolution. Other writers on
                    Russian history have been Pogo-dine, who compiled a <hi rend="italic">History of
                    Russia till the invasion of the Mongols,</hi> 1871, and especially Zabielin, who
                    has written a <hi rend="italic">History of Russian Life from the most Remote
                    Times</hi> (1876), and the <hi rend="italic">Private Lives of the CzaAnas</hi>
                    and <hi rend="italic">Czars</hi> (1869 and 1872). Leshkoff has written a <hi
                    rend="italic">History of Russian Law to the 18th Century,</hi> and Tchitcherin a
                    <hi rend="italic">History of Provincial Institutions in Russia in the 17th
                    Century</hi> (1856). To these must be added the work of Zagoskin, <hi
                    rend="italic">History of Law in the State of Muscovy</hi> (Kazan, 1877). Prof.
                    Michael Kovalevski, of the university of Moscow, is now publishing an excellent
                    work on <hi rend="italic">Communal Land Tenure,</hi> in which he investigates
                    the remains of this custom throughout the world. Of the valuable history of
                    Russia by Prof. Bestuzheff-Riumin (1872) one volume only has appeared; the
                    introductory chapters giving an account of the sources and authorities of
                    Russian history are of the highest value. It is the most critical history of
                    Russia which has yet appeared. In 1885 Dubrovin published an excellent history
                    of the revolt of Pugatcheff. The valuable work by Messrs Pipin and Spasovich,
                    <hi rend="italic">History of Slavonic Literatures,</hi> is the most complete
                    account of the subject, and has been made more generally accessible to Western
                    students by the German translation of Pech. The <hi rend="italic">History of
                    Slavonic Literature</hi> by Schafarik, published in 1826, has long been
                    antiquated. Previous to this, a history of Russian literature by Paul Polevoi
                    had appeared, which has gone through two editions. It is modelled upon
                    Chambers’s <hi rend="italic">Cyclopaedia of English Literature.</hi> The account

                    pages of the Russian magazine, <hi rend="italic">Starina.</hi></p>
                <p>Since the death of Lermontoff the chief Russian poet who has appeared is Nicholas
                    Nekrasoff, who died in 1877. He has left six volumes of poetry, which in many
                    respects remind us of the writings of Crabbe; the poet dwells mainly upon the
                    melancholy features of Russian life. He is of that realistic school in which
                    Russian authors so much resemble English. Another writer of poetry deserving
                    mention is Ogarieff, for a long time the companion in exile of Herzen in
                    England; many of his compositions appeared in the <hi rend="italic">Polar
                    Star</hi> of the latter, a medley of prose and verse, which contains some very
                    important papers, including the interesting autobiographical sketches of Herzen,
                    entitled <hi rend="italic">Biloe i Dumi</hi> (“The Past and my Thoughts”).
                    Alaikoff at one time enjoyed great popularity as a poet; he is a kind of link
                    between the present generation and that of Pushkin, of whose elegance of
                    versification he is somewhat of an imitator. Another poet of a past generation
                    was Prince Viazemski, "whose works are now being collected. Graceful lyrics have
                    also been written by Mei, Fet (whose name would apparently prove Dutch
                    extraction, Veth), Stcherbina, and, going a little farther back, Yazikoff, the
                    friend of Pushkin, and Khomi-akoff, celebrated for his Slavophile propensities.
                    To these may be added Mdlle Zhadovskaia, who died a short time ago, Benediktoff,
                    Podolinski, and Tiutcheff. It will be seen that in Russia (as in England)
                    lyrical poetry is almost the only form now cultivated. It is becoming more and
                    more coloured with imitations of the bilini and reproductions of the old Russian
                    past, which is perhaps getting treated somewhat fantastically, as was the old
                    Irish life in the Irish melodies of Moore. Occasionally Polonski contributes one
                    of his exquisite lyrics to the <hi rend="italic">Viestnik Yevropi</hi>
                    (“European Messenger”).</p>
                <p>Excellent works on subjects connected with Slavonic philology have been published
                    by Vostokoff, who edited the Ostromir Codex, mentioned above (p. 103), and
                    Sreznevski and Bodianski, who put forth an edition of the celebrated codex used
                    at Rheims for the coronation of the French kings. Since their deaths their work
                    has been carried on by Prof. Grote <hi rend="italic">(Philological
                    Investigations,</hi> also many critical editions of Russian classics).
                    Budilovich, now a professor at Warsaw, Potebnya of Kharkoff, and Baudoin de
                    Courtenay, -who, among other services to philology, has described the Slavonic
                    dialect spoken by the Resanians, a tribe living in Italy, in two villages of the
                    Julian Alps. The songs (bilini) of the Russians have been collected by
                    Zakrevski, Ribnikoff, Hilferding, Barsoff, and others, and their national tales
                    by Sakharoff, Afanasieff, and Erlen-vein. Kotliarevski, Tereshenko, and others
                    have treated of their customs and superstitions, but it is to be regretted that
                    no one as yet has made a complete study of the vexed question of Slavonic
                    mythology. At the present time Stanislaus Alikutzki, professor, at the
                    university of Warsaw, is publishing his <hi rend="italic">Materials for a
                    Dictionary of the Roots of the Russian and all Slavonic Dialects,</hi> but,
                    unfortunately, it represents a somewhat obsolete school of philology. The Early
                    Russian Text Society continues its useful labours, and has edited many
                    interesting monuments of the older Slavonic literature. Quite recently two
                    valuable codices have been printed in Russia, Zogra-phus and Marianus,
                    interesting versions of the Gospels in Palaeoslavonic. They were edited by the
                    learned Croat Jagid, who now occupies the chair of Sreznevski in St Petersburg.
                    An excellent <hi rend="italic">Tolkovi Slovar Velikorusskago Yazika</hi>
                    (“Explanatory Dictionary of the Great Russian</p>
                <p>Language”), by Dahl, has gone into a second edition. Alexander Hilferding
                    published some valuable works on ethnology and philology, among others on the
                    Polabes, an extinct Slavonic tribe who once dwelt on the banks of the Elbe.
                    Although they have produced some good Slavonic scholars, the Russians have not
                    exhibited many works in the field of classical or other branches of philology.
                    Exception, however, must be made in favour of the studies of Tchubinoff in
                    Georgian, Minayeff in the Indian, and Tzvetayeff in the old languages of
                    Italy.</p>
                <p>In moral and mental philosophy the Russians have produced but few authors. We
                    meet with some good mathematicians, Ostrogradski among others, and in natural
                    science the publications of the Society for Natural History at Moscow have
                    attracted considerable attention.</p>
                <p>Since the <hi rend="italic">Boris Godunoff</hi> of Pushkin, which was the first
                    attempt in Russia to produce a play on the Shakespearian model, many others have
                    appeared in the same style. A fine trilogy was composed by Count A. Tolstoi on
                    the three subjects, <hi rend="italic">The Death of Ivan the Terrible</hi>
                    (1866), <hi rend="italic">The Czar Feodor</hi> (1868), and <hi rend="italic">The
                    Czar Boris</hi> (1869). Other plays of merit have been written by Ostrovski and
                    Potiekhin.</p>
                <p>Many excellent literary journals and magazines make their appearance in the
                    country; among these may especially be mentioned the time-honoured <hi
                    rend="italic">Viestnik Yevropi</hi> (“Messenger of Europe”), which contains some
                    of the most brilliant writing produced in the Russian empire. The <hi
                    rend="italic">Istoricheski Viestnik</hi> (“Historical Messenger”) is full of
                    curious matter, and does not confine itself merely to Russian subjects. It is
                    edited by M. Shubinski, the author of some pleasant sketches on the manners of
                    Russia in the old time. On the contrary <hi rend="italic">Starina</hi> (the
                    “Antiquary,” if we may so freely translate the original name) is entirely
                    Russian, and is a valuable repertory of documents concerning the history of the
                    country, and memoirs, especially relating to the latter part of the 17th
                    century. The highly interesting magazine <hi rend="italic">Drevnaia i Novaia
                    Rossia</hi> did not protract its existence beyond six years, having come to an
                    end in 1881. Many of the best Russian writers contributed to it; it contains
                    much valuable material for the student of history. The <hi rend="italic">Russkii
                    Arkhiv</hi> is edited by M. Bartenieff, and has long been celebrated; some of
                    the most important notes on Russian history of the 18th and 19th century have
                    appeared in this journal. During the last few years extensive excavations have
                    been made in many parts of Russia, and much has been done to throw light upon
                    the prehistoric period of the country. A large “kurgan,” called <hi
                    rend="italic">Cherna Mogila,</hi> or the Black Grave, was opened by Samokvasoff
                    in the government of Tchernigoff and described in the pages of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Old and New Russia.</hi> Explorations have been carried on on the site of
                    Bolgari, the ancient capital of the Ugrian Bolgars on the Volga. One of the most
                    active workers in this field was the late Count Uvaroff (d. 1884), who published
                    a valuable monograph on the Stone Age in Russia, and many other important
                    works.</p>
                <p>A few words must be said on the literature of the Russian dialects, the Little
                    and White Russian. The Little Russian is rich in <hi rend="italic">skazki</hi>
                    (tales) and songs. Peculiar to them is the <hi rend="italic">duma,</hi> a
                    narrative poem which corresponds in many particulars with the Russian bilina.
                    Since the commencement of the present century, when curiosity was first aroused
                    on the subject of national poetry, the Little Russian <hi rend="italic"
                    >dumî</hi> have been repeatedly edited, as by Maksimovich Metlinski and others.
                    An elaborate edition (far surpassing the earlier ones) was commenced by
                    Dragomanoff and Antonovich, but as yet only one volume and a portion of a second
                    have made their appearance. Just as the bilini-of the Great Russians, so also
                    these dumi of the Little Russians admit of classification, and they have been
                    divided by their latest editors as follows (1) the songs of the <hi
                    rend="italic">druzhina,</hi> treating of the early princes and their followers;
                    (2) the Cossack period <hi rend="italic">(Kozaehxstvo),</hi> in which the
                    Cossacks are found in continual warfare with the <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit21newyrich/page/n127/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0921-0127-0110"/>Polish <hi rend="italic">pans</hi> and the
                    attempts of the Jesuits to introduce the Roman Catholic religion; (3) the period
                    of the Haidamaks, who formed the nucleus of the national party, and prolonged
                    the struggle. The gradual break up of tho military republic of these sturdy
                    freebooters has already been described.</p>
                <p>The foundation of the Little Russian literature (written, as opposed to tho oral)
                    was laid by Ivan Kotliarevski (1769-1838), whose travesty of part of the <hi
                    rend="italic">Aeneid</hi> enjoys great popularity among some of his countrymen.
                    Others, however, object to it as tending to bring the language or dialect into
                    ridicule. A truly national poet appeared in Taras Shevchenko, born at the
                    village of Kirilovka in the government of Kieff, in the condition of a serf. The
                    strange adventures of his early life he has told us in his autobiography. He did
                    not get his freedom till some time after he had reached manhood, when he was
                    purchased from his master by the generous efforts of the poet Zhukovski and
                    others. Besides poetry, he occupied himself with painting with considerable
                    success. He unfortunately became obnoxious to the Government, and was punished
                    with exile to Siberia from 1847 to 1857. He did not long survive his return,
                    dying in 1861, aged forty-six. No one has described with greater vigour than
                    Shevchenko the old days of the Ukraine. In his youth he listened to the village
                    traditions handed down by the priests, and he has faithfully reproduced them.
                    The old times of Nalivaiko, Doroshenko, and others live over again. Like Gogol
                    he is too fond of describing scenes of bloodshed. In the powerful poem entitled
                    <hi rend="italic">Haidamak</hi> we have a graphic picture of tho horrors enacted
                    by Gonta and his followers at Uman. The sketches are almost too realistic. Like
                    Burns with the old Scottish songs, so Shevchenko has reproduced admirably the
                    spirit of the lays of the Ukraine. All those familiar with his works will
                    remember the charming little lyrics with which they are interspersed. The
                    funeral of the poet was a vast public procession; a great cairn, surmounted with
                    a cross, was raised over his remains, where he lies buried near Kanioff on tho
                    banks of tho Dnieper. His grave has been styled the “Mecca of the</p>
                <p>South Russian Revolutionists.” He is the great national poet of the Southern
                    Russians. A complete edition of his works, with interesting biographical
                    notices—one contributed by the novelist Turgenieff—appeared at Prague in 1876.
                    Besides the national songs, excellent collections of the South Russian
                    folk-tales have appeared, edited by Dragomanoff, Rudchenko, and others. Many of
                    these are still recited by the “tchumaki” or wandering pedlars. A valuable work
                    is the <hi rend="italic">Zapiski o Yuzhuoi Rossii</hi> (“Papers on Southern
                    Russia”), published at St Petersburg in 1857 by Panteleimon Kulish. After he got
                    into trouble (with Kostomaroff and Shevchenko) for his political views, the late
                    works of this author show him to have undergone a complete change. Other writers
                    using the Little Russian language are Marko-Vovchok (that is, Madame Eugenia
                    JIarkovich), and Yuri Fedkovieh, who employs a dialect of Buko-vina. Fedkovich,
                    like Shevchenko, sprang from a peasant family, and served as a soldier in the
                    Austrian army against the French during the Italian campaign. Naturally we find
                    his poems filled with descriptions of life in the camp. Like the Croat
                    Preradovid, ho began writing poetry in the German language, till he was turned
                    into more natural paths by some patriotic friends. A collection of songs of
                    Bukovina was published at Kieff in 1875 by Lona-chevski. At the present time
                    Eugene Zelechowski continues his valuable <hi rend="italic">Dictionary of Little
                    Russian,</hi> of which about one half has appeared. This promises to be a very
                    useful book, for up to the present time students have been obliged to rest
                    satisfied with the scanty publications of Levchenko, Piskunoff, and Verchratzki.
                    There is a good grammar by Osadtza, a pupil of Miklosich.</p>
                <p>In the White Russian dialect are to be found only a few songs, with the exception
                    of portions of the Scriptures and some legal documents. A valuablo dictionary
                    was published a short time ago by Nosovich, but this is one of the most
                    neglected of the Russian dialects, as the part in which it is spoken is one of
                    the dreariest of the empire. Collections of White Russian songs have been
                    published by Sheiu and others. For details regarding this and the other Russian
                    dialects see Slavs. (W. R. M.)</p>
