                    Lincoln’s Inn, and was in due course called to the bar. As early as 1630 he
                    seems to have commenced attendance at the courts, especially the Star Chamber
                    and the Exchequer Chamber, not for the purpose of practising his profession, but
                    in order that he might observe and record the more remarkable of their
                    proceedings. On the meeting of the Long Parliament in 1640
                    Lewasappointedassistant clerk to the House of Commons, and was in the habit of I
                    making short-hand notes of the speeches he heard delivered in debate. He himself
                    states that it was from his report that the words used by Charles I. during his
                    memorable attempt to seize the “five members” were printed for public
                    distribution under the king’s orders. Being an expert horseman, it seems that
                    Rushworth was frequently employed by the House as their messenger as well as in
                    the capacity of clerk. When the king left London, and while the earl of Essex
                    was general, he was often the bearer of communications from the parliament to
                    one or the other of them. In 1645 Sir Thomas Fairfax, to whom he was distantly
                    related, and who was then in command of the Parliamentary forces, made him his
                    secretary, and he remained with the army almost continuously until 1650. In 1649
                    he was at Oxford, and the degree of master of arts was conferred on him by the
                    university. In 1652 he was nominated one of the commissioners for the reform of
                    the common law, and in 1658 he was elected member for Berwick in the parliament
                    of the commonwealth. Almost immediately before the Restoration he published the
                    first volume of his <hi rend="italic">Historical Collections,</hi> which had
                    been submitted in manuscript to Oliver Cromwell, with a very laudatory
                    dedication to Richard Cromwell, then Lord Protector. But the turn of events
                    induced him to withdraw this dedication, and he subsequently endeavoured without
                    success to conciliate Charles II. by presenting him with some of the registers
                    of the privy council which had come into his possession. In the convention of
                    1660, which recalled the king, he sat again as member for Berwick. In 1677 he
                    was made secretary to Sir Orlando Bridgeman, then lord keeper, and he was
                    returned for Berwick a third and a fourth time to the parliaments of 1679 and
                    1681. Soon after this he appears to have fallen into straitened circumstances.
                    In 1684 he was arrested for debt, and cast into the King’s Bench prison, where
                    he died, after lingering for some time in a condition of mental infirmity, the
                    result of excessive drinking, in 1690.</p>
                <p>Rushworth’s <hi rend="italic">Historical Collections of Private Passages of
                    Stats, IVeighty Matters in Law, and Remarkable Proceedings in Parliament</hi>
                    was reprinted in eight folio volumes in 1721. The eighth volume of this edition
                    is an account of the trial of the earl of Strafford, the other seven volumes
                    being concerned with the miscellaneous transactions of the period from 1618 to
                    1648. Only the first three volumes and the trial of Strafford were originally
                    published in Rushworth’s lifetime; but the manuscript of the other volumes was
                    left by him ready for the press. The extreme value of the work is well known to
                    all inquirers into the history of the Civil War, and much of the information it
                    contains is to be found nowhere else. Its impartiality, however, can hardly be
                    seriously maintained, and hence it is necessary to consult it with some
                    caution.</p>
