                    pirates. In 1640 he entered the service of the States, and, being appointed
                    rear-admiral of a fleet fitted out to assist Portugal against Spain, specially
                    distinguished himself at Cape St Vincent, 3d November 1641. In the following
                    year he left the service of the States, and, until the outbreak of war with
                    England in 1652, held command of a merchant vessel. In 1653 a squadron of
                    seventy vessels was despatched against the English, under the command of Admiral
                    Tromp. Ruyter, who accompanied the admiral in this expedition, seconded him with
                    great skill and bravery in the three battles which were fought with the English.
                    He was afterwards stationed in the Mediterranean, where he captured several
                    Turkish vessels. In 1659 he received a commission to join the king of Denmark in
                    his war with the Swedes. As a reward of his services, the king of Denmark
                    ennobled him and gave him a pension. In 1661 he grounded a vessel belonging to
                    Tunis, released forty Christian slaves, made a treaty with the Tunisians, and
                    reduced the Algerine corsairs to submission. From his achievements on the west
                    coast of Africa he was recalled in 1665 to take command of a large fleet which
                    had been organized against England, and in May of the following year, after a
                    long contest off the North Foreland, he compelled the English to take refuge in
                    the Thames. On June 7, 1672, he fought a drawn battle with the combined fleets
                    of England and France, in Southwold or Sole Bay, and after the fight he convoyed
                    safely home a fleet of merchantmen. His valour was displayed to equal advantage
                    in several engagements with the French and English in the following year. In
                    1676 he was despatched to the assistance of Spain against France in the
                    Mediterranean, and, receiving a mortal wound in the battle on the 21st April off
                    Messina, died on the 29th at Syracuse. A patent by the king of Spain, investing
                    him with the dignity of duke, did not reach the fleet till after his death. His
                    body was carried to Amsterdam, where a magnificent monument to his memory was
                    erected by command of the states-general.</p>
