                    the younger son of Ralph Rymer, lord of the manor of Brafferton in Yorkshire,
                    described by Clarendon as “possessed of a good estate” and executed for his
                    share in the “Presbyterian rising” of 1663. Thomas was probably born at Yafforth
                    Hall early in 1641, and was educated at a private school kept by Thomas Smelt, a
                    noted Royalist, with whom Rymer was “a great favourite,” and “well known for his
                    great critical skill in human learning, especially in poetry and history.” <note

                    bar on June 16, 1673. His first appearance in print was as translator of <hi

                    principles there set forth in a tragedy in verse, licensed September 13, 1677,
                    called <hi rend="italic">Edgar, or the English Monarch,</hi> which was not,
                    however, very successful. The printed editions of 1678, 1691, and 1693 belong to
                    the same issue, with new title-pages. Rymer’s views on the drama were again
                    given to the world in the shape of a printed letter to Fleetwood Shep-heard, the
                    friend of Prior, under the title of <hi rend="italic">The Tragedies of the Last
                        Age Considered</hi> (1678). To <hi rend="italic">Ovid’s Epistles

                    Ulysses” was contributed by Rymer, who was also one of the “hands” who Englished
                    the Plutarch of 1683-86. The life of Nicias fell to his share. He furnished a
                    preface to Whitelocke’s <hi rend="italic">Memorials of English Afairs</hi>
                    (1682), and wrote in 1681 <hi rend="italic">A General Drauglvt and Prospect of

                    ignorant of his future dignity, the critic had the misfortune to observe, “You
                    are not to expect truth from an historiographer royal.” He contributed three
                    pieces to the collection of <hi rend="italic">Poems to the Memory of Edmund
                        Waller</hi> (1688), afterwards reprinted in Dryden’s <hi rend="italic"
                        >Miscellany Poems,</hi> and is said to have written the Latin inscription on
                    Waller’s monument in Beaconsfield churchyard. He produced a congratulatory poem
                    upon the arrival of Queen Mary in 1689. His next piece of authorship was to
                    translate the sixth elegy of the third book of Ovid’s <hi rend="italic"
                        >Tristia</hi> for Dryden’s <hi rend="italic">Miscellany Poems</hi> (1692, p.
                    148). On the death of Thomas Shadwell in 1692 Rymer received the appointment of
                    historiographer royal, at a yearly salary of £200. Immediately afterwards
                    appeared his <hi rend="italic">Short Vicw of Tragedy</hi> (1693), criticizing
                    Shakespeare and Ben Jonson, which produced <hi rend="italic">The Impartial

                    that ever lived.” Within eight months of his official appointment Rymer was
                    directed (August 26,1693) to carry <pb break="no"

                    his name will always be honourably connected, and of which there is reason to
                    believe that Lords Somers and Halifax were the original promoters. The <hi
                        rend="italic">Codex Juris Gentium Diplo-maticus</hi> of Leibnitz was taken
                    by the editor as the model of the <hi rend="italic">Foedera.</hi> The plan was
                    to publish all records of alliances and other transactions in which England was
                    concerned with foreign powers from 1101 to the time of publication, limiting the
                    collection to original documents in the royal archives and the great national
                    libraries. Unfortunately, this was not uniformly carried out, and the work
                    contains some extracts from printed chronicles. From 1694 he corresponded with
                    Leibnitz, by whom he was greatly influenced with respect to the plan and
                    formation of the <hi rend="italic">Foedera.</hi> While collecting materials,
                    Rymer unwisely engraved a spurious charter of King Malcolm, acknowledging that
                    Scotland was held in homage from Edward the Confessor. When this came to be
                    known, the Scottish antiquaries were extremely indignant. G. Redpath published a
                    MS. on the independence of the Scottish crown, by Sir T. Craig, entitled <hi
                        rend="italic">Scotland's Sovereignty Asserted</hi> (1695), and the subject
                    was referred to by Bishop Nicolson in his <hi rend="italic">Scottish Historical
                        Library</hi> (1702). This led Rymer to address three <hi rend="italic"
                        >Letters to the Bishop of Carlisle</hi> (1702), explaining his action, and
                    discussing other antiquarian matters. The first and second letters are usually
                    found together; the third is extremely rare. Rymer had now been for some years
                    working with great industry, but was constantly obliged to petition the crown
                    for money to carry on the undertaking. Up to August 1698 he had expended £1253,
                    and had only received £500 on account.</p>
                <p>At last, on November 20, 1704, was issued the first folio volume of the <hi
                        rend="italic">Eoedera, Conventiones, Litterae et cujuscuη-que generis Acta
                        Publixa inter reges Angliae et alios quosvis imperatores, reges, &amp;c., ab
                        A.D. 1101 ad nostra usque tempora habita aut tractata.</hi> The publication
                    proceeded with great rapidity, and fifteen volumes were brought out by Rymer in
                    nine years. Two hundred and fifty copies were printed; but, as nearly all of
                    them were presented to persons of distinction, the work soon became so scarce
                    that it was priced by booksellers at one hundred guineas. A hundred and twenty
                    sheets of the fifteenth volume and the copy for the remainder were burnt at a
                    fire at William Bowyer’s, the printer, on January 30, 1712-13. Rymer died
                    shortly after the appearance of this volume, but he had prepared materials for
                    carrying the work down to the end of the reign of James I. These were placed in
                    the hands of Robert Sanderson, his assistant. For the greater part of his life
                    Rymer derived his chief subsistence from a mortgage assigned to him by his
                    father. His miscellaneous literary work could not have been very profitable. At
                    one time he was reduced to offer his MSS. for a new edition for sale to the earl
                    of Oxford. About 1703 his affairs became more settled, and he afterwards
                    regularly received his salary as historiographer, besides an additional £200 a
                    year as editor of the <hi rend="italic">Foedera.</hi> Twenty-five copies of each
                    volume were also allotted to him. He died at Arundel Street, Strand, December
                    14, 1713, and was buried in the church of St Clement Danes. His will was dated
                    July 10, 1713. Tonson issued an edition of Rochester’s <hi rend="italic"
                        >Works</hi> (1714), with a short preface by the late historiographer.
                    Another posthumous publication was in a miscellaneous collection called <hi
                        rend="italic">Cumous Amusements,</hi> by Al. B. (1714), which included “some
                    translations from Greek, Latin, and Italian poets, by T. Rymer.” Some of his
                    poetical pieces were also inserted in J. Nichols’s <hi rend="italic">Select
                        Collection</hi> (1780-86, 8 vols.).</p>
                <p>Two more volumes of the <hi rend="italic">Foedera</hi> were issued by Sanderson
                    in 1715 and 1717, and the last three volumes (xviii., xix., and xx.) by the same
                    editor, but upon a slightly different plan, in 1726-35. The latter volumes were
                    published by Tonson, all the former by Churchill. Under Rymer it was carried
                    down to 1586, and continued by Sanderson to 1654. The rarity and importance of
                    the work induced Tonson to obtain a licence for a second edition, and George
                    Holmes, deputy keeper of the Tower records, was appointed editor. The new
                    edition appeared between 1727 and 1735. The last three volumes are the same in
                    both issues. There are some corrections, enumerated in a volume, <hi
                        rend="italic">The Emendations in the new edition of Mr Rymer's Foedera,</hi>
                    printed by Tonson in 1730, but in other respects the second is inferior to the
                    first edition. A third edition, embodying Holmes’s collation, was commenced at
                    The Hague in 1737 and finished in 1745. It is in smaller type than the others,
                    and is compressed within ten folio volumes. The arrangement is rather more
                    convenient; there is some additional matter; the index is better; and on the
                    whole it is to be preferred to either of the previous editions. When the volumes
                    of the <hi rend="italic">Foedera</hi> first appeared they were analysed by
                    Leclerc and Rapin in the <hi rend="italic">Bibliothèque Choisie</hi> and <hi
                        rend="italic">Bibliothèque Ancienne et Moderne.</hi> Rapin’s articles were
                    collected together, and appended, under the title of <hi rend="italic">Abrégé
                        historique des actes publiques de l' Angleterre,</hi> to the Hague edition.
                    A translation, called <hi rend="italic">Acta Regia,</hi> was published by
                    Stephen Whatley, 1726-7, 4 vols. 8vo, reprinted both in 8vo and folio, the
                    latter edition containing an analysis of the cancelled sheets, relating to the
                    journals of the first Parliament of Charles I., of the 18th volume of the <hi
                        rend="italic">Foedera.</hi></p>
                <p>In 1808 the Record Commissioners appointed Dr Adam Clarke to prepare a new and
                    improved edition of the <hi rend="italic">Foedera.</hi> Six parts, large folio,
                    edited by Clarke, Caley, and Holbrooke, were published between 1816 and 1830.
                    Considerable additions were made, but the editing was performed in so
                    unsatisfactory a manner that the publication was suspended in the middle of
                    printing a seventh part. The latter portion, bringing the work down to 1383, was
                    ultimately issued in 1869.</p>
                <p>The wide learning and untiring labours of Rymer have received the warmest praise
                    from historians. Sir T. D. Hardy styles the <hi rend="italic">Foedera</hi> “a
                    work of which this nation has every reason to be proud, for with all its
                    blemishes—and what work is faultless?—it has no rival in its class” <hi
                        rend="italic">(Syllabus,</hi> vol. ii., xxxvi.), and Mr J. B. Mullinger
                    calls it “a collection of the highest value and authority” (Gardiner and
                    Mullinger's <hi rend="italic">Introduction to English History,</hi> p. 224).</p>
                <p>The best account of Rymer is to be found in the prefaces to Sir T. D. Hardy's <hi
                        rend="italic">Syllabus,</hi> 1869-86, 3 vols. 8vo. There is an unpublished
                    life by Des Maizeaux (Brit. Mus. Add. MS. No. 4223), and a few memoranda in
                    Bishop Rennet's collections (Lansd. MS. No. 987). In Caulfield’s <hi
                        rend="italic">Portraits,</hi> &lt;fec., 1819, i. 50, may be seen an
                    engraving of Rymer, with a description of a satirical print. Rymer's two
                    critical works on the drama are discussed by Sir T. N. Talfourd in the <hi
                        rend="italic">Retrospective Review,</hi> 1820, vol. 1. p. 1-15.</p>
                <p>Sir T. D. Hardy's <hi rend="italic">Syllabus</hi> gives in English a condensed
                    notice of each instrument in the several editions of the <hi rend="italic"
                        >Foedera,</hi> arranged in chronological order. The third volume contains a
                    complete index of names and places, with a catalogue of the volumes of
                    transcripts collected for the Record edition of the <hi rend="italic"
                        >Foedera.</hi> In 1869 the Record Office printed, for private distribution,
                    Appendices A to E “to a report on the <hi rend="italic">Foedera</hi> intended to

                    to Great Britain, with facsimiles). In the British Museum is preserved (Add. MS.
                    24,699) a folio volume of reports and papers relating to the Record edition.
                    Rymer left extensive materials for a new edition of the <hi rend="italic"
                        >Foedera,</hi> bound in 59 vols, folio, and embracing the period from 1115
                    to 1698. This was the collection offered to the earl of Oxford. It was purchased
                    by the Treasury for £215 and is now in the British Museum (Add. MSS. Nos. 4573
                    to 4630, and 18,911). A catalogue and index may be consulted in the 17th volume
                    of Tonson's edition of the <hi rend="italic">Foedera.</hi> The Public Record
                    Office possesses a MS. volume, compiled by Robert Lemon about 1800, containing
                    instruments in the Patent Rolls omitted by Rymer. In the same place may be seen
                    a volume of reports, orders, &amp;c., on the <hi rend="italic">Foedera,</hi>
