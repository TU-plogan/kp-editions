                <p><label type="entry">ROWE</label><hi rend="smallcaps">Nicholas</hi> (1674-1718),
                    the descendant of a family long resident at Lamerton in Devon, was born at
                    Little Barford in Bedfordshire, June 30, 1674. The house in which he was born is
                    close to the Great North Road, and a small stone to his memory has been erected
                    in the centre of the garden. His father, John Rowe, took to the law as his
                    profession, and at his death in 1692 (by which time he had attained to the
                    dignity of being a serjeant at law) had amassed sufficient property to leave to
                    his son an income of £300 a year. Nicholas Rowe passed some time in a private
                    school at Highgate, and then proceeded to Westminster School, at that time under
                    the charge of the celebrated master Dr Busby. In 1688 he became a king’s scholar
                    in this foundation, but three years later he was called away from school and
                    entered as a student at the Middle Temple. Tbe study of the law had little
                    attraction for a young man of good person and lively manners, and at his
                    father’s death in the following year he devoted himself to society and to
                    literature. His first play, <hi rend="italic">The Ambitious Stepmother,</hi> was
                    produced when he was twenty-five years old. It was followed by <hi rend="italic"
                        >Tamerlane,</hi> a patriotic composition in which the virtues of William
                    III. were lauded under the disguise of Tamerlane and the vices of the French
                    king, Louis XIV., were denounced in the person of Bajazet. The popularity of
                    this production soon declined, but for many years it was acted once every year,
                    on the anniversary of the landing at Torbay of the Dutch prince. His next play,
                        <hi rend="italic">The Fair Penitent,</hi> long retained the favourable
                    reception which marked its first appearance, and was pronounced by the great
                    critic of the 18th century one of the most pleasing tragedies which had ever
                    been written. Through its success the name of the principal male character
                    Lothario became identified in popular language as the embodiment of the manners
                    and habits of a fashionable rake. After the production of two more tragedies,
                        <hi rend="italic">Ulysses</hi> and <hi rend="italic">The Royal Convert,</hi>
                    of slight account at the time and long since forgotten, Rowe tried; his hand on
                    a comedy, <hi rend="italic">The Biter.</hi> Much to the author’s surprise his
                    attempt in this new direction proved a failure, but Rowe recognized the justice
                    of the verdict of the audience sufficiently to abstain from risking a second
                    disappointment. His two last dramatic works were entitled <hi rend="italic">Jane
                        Shore</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Lady Jane Grey,</hi> and the former of
                    them, from the popularity of its subject and the elegance of its language, kept
                    its position on the stage longer than any other of his works.</p>
                <p>Rowe excelled most of his contemporaries in the knowledge of languages. He was
                    acquainted more or less thoroughly with Greek, Latin, French, Italian, and
                    Spanish. The latter tongue he is said to have acquired on the recommendation of
                    Harley and with the expectation that he would afterwards be rewarded by some
                    high office. When, however, he reported his new acquisition to the new minister
                    he was met with the dry remark from Harley—“How I envy you the pleasure of
                    reading Don Quixote in the original !” Notwithstanding this disappointment, Rowe
                    enjoyed many lucrative posts during his short life. When the duke of Queensberry
                    was principal secretary of state for Scotland (1708-10), Rowe acted as his
                    under-secretary. On the accession of George I. he was made a surveyor of
                    customs, and on the death of Tate he became poet laureate. He was also appointed
                    clerk of the council to the prince of Wales, and the list of preferments was
                    closed by his nomination by Lord-Chancellor Parker (5th May 1718) as secretary
                    of presentations in Chancery. He died 6th December 1718, and was buried in the
                    south cross of Westminster Abbey. By his first wife, a daughter of Mr Parsons,
                    one of the auditors of the revenue, he left a son John; and by his second wife,
                    Anne, the daughter of Joseph Devenish of a Dorsetshire family, he had an only
                    daughter, Charlotte, born in 1718, who married Henry Fane, a younger brother of
                    Thomas, eighth earl of Westmoreland. The burials of mother and daughter are
                    recorded in Colonel Chester’s <hi rend="italic">Registers of Westminster
                        Abbey.</hi></p>
                <p>Rowe’s tragedies were marked by passionate feeling set off by a graceful diction,
                    and were well adapted for stage effect. If <hi rend="italic">The Fair
                        Penitent</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Jane Shore</hi> have been expelled from
                    the stage, their historic reputation and their style will repay perusal.</p>
                <p>Among Rowe’s other literary efforts may be mentioned an edition of the works of
                    Shakespeare (1709), for which he received from Lintot the bookseller the sum of
                    £36, 10s., a rate of pay not out of proportion to the labour which was bestowed
                    upon the task. At the time of his death he had also finished a translation of
                    Lucan’s <hi rend="italic">Pharsalia,</hi> a work then much praised and not yet
                    superseded by any competitor. Rowe’s minor poems were beneath the level of his
                    age. An edition of his works was published in 1720 under the care of Mr
                    (afterwards Bishop) Newton. His translation of Lucan was edited by Dr
                    Welwood.</p>
