                    an eminent Scottish scholar, was born in October 1674, at Raggal, in the parish
                    of Boyndie, Banffshire, where his father was a farmer. He studied Latin eagerly
                    at the school of his native parish, and when sixteen started off to walk to
                    Aberdeen, there to compete for a college bursary. On the way he was attacked by
                    Gipsies, robbed of a guinea, which was all he had, and otherwise very cruelly
                    treated; but he j&gt;ersevered in his journey, reached Aberdeen, and competed
                    for and won the bursary. He then entered the university, and four years
                    afterwards—on 21st June 1694—received the degree of M.A. For some time he acted
                    as schoolmaster at Laurencekirk in Kincardine. There he chanced to make the
                    acquaintance of Dr Pitcairne, of Edinburgh, who persuaded him to remove to the
                    Scottish capital, where he obtained the post of assistant in the Advocates’
                    Library. As his salary was only £8, 6s. 8d. per annum, he was forced to
                    undertake additional employment. He engaged in miscellaneous literary work, took
                    pupils, and for some time acted as an auctioneer. His chief writings at this
                    period were editions of Wilson’s <hi rend="italic">De Animi Tran-(Ruillitate
                    Dialogus</hi> (1707), and the <hi rend="italic">Cantixi Solomanix Paraphrasis
                    Poetixa</hi> (1709) of Arthur Johnstone <hi rend="italic">(ob.</hi> 1641),
                    editor of the <hi rend="italic">Delixve Poeiarum Scotornm.</hi></p>
                <p>In 1714 he published <hi rend="italic">Rudiments of the Latin Tongue,</hi> which
                    is even yet his best known work. This w ’ as intended to be an easy introduction
                    to Latin grammar, and was so successful that it at once superseded all others.
                    Under various forms it has been in use, down to our own day, in the schools of
                    Scotland. In 1715 he edited, with notes and annotations, the works of George
                    Buchanan in two volumes folio. As Ruddiman was a Jacobite, the liberal views of
                    Buchanan seemed to him to call for frequent censure. That censure is often
                    rather implied than openly expressed; but it excited much opposition. A society
                    of scholars was formed in Edinburgh to “vindicate that incomparably learned and
                    pious author from the calumnies of Mr Thomas Ruddiman” by publishing a correct
                    edition of his works. This they never did; but a number of obscure writers from
                    this time attacked Ruddiman λvith great vehemence. He replied; and it was not
                    till the year before his death that he said his “last word” in the
                    controversy.</p>
                <p>His worldly affairs, meanwhile, grew more and more prosperous. He founded (1715)
                    a successful printing business, and atyer some time was appointed printer to the
                    university. He acquired the <hi rend="italic">Caledernian Merxury ia</hi> 1729,
                    and in 1730 was appointed keeper of the Advocates’ Library, which post, owing to
                    failing health, he resigned in 1752. He died at Edinburgh, 19th January 1758,
                    and was interred in Greyfriars churchyard, where in 1806 a tablet was erected to
                    his memory.</p>
                <p>Besides the works mentioned, the following writings of Ruddiman deserve notice an
                    edition of Gavin Douglas’s <hi rend="italic">Aeneid</hi> of Virgil (1710); the
                    editing and completion of Anderson’s <hi rend="italic">Selxetus Diplo-rnαtum et
                    Numisinatiim Scotiae Tlixsaurus</hi> (1739); <hi rend="italic">Catalogue of
                    ιl</hi><hi rend="italic">∣</hi><hi rend="italic">x Advocates' Lihramj</hi>
                    (1733-42); an edition of Livy, famed for its “immaculate purity,” in 4 vols.
                    (1751). Ruddimun was for many years the representative scholar of Scotland.
                    Writing in 1766, Dr Johnson, after reproving Boswell for some bad Latin,
                    significantly adds—“Rnddiman is dead.” When Boswell proposed to write Ruddimans
                    life, “I should take pleasure in helping you to do honour to him,” said
                    Johnson.</p>
