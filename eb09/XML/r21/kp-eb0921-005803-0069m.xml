                    of the West India Islands and Guiana. The ordinary method of working in the West
                    Indies is the following. A wash is prepared consisting of sugar skimmings 4
                    parts, lees of still or d under 5 parts, and molasses 1 part, the quantity
                    prepared being equal to the capacity of the still in use. Dunder consists of the
                    residue of the still from previous distillations, and it takes the place of a
                    ferment, besides which the acetic acid it contains, derived from the fermenting
                    wash of previous operations, has a favourable influence on the progress of
                    attenuation. The wash prepared as above is placed in the fermenting vat, where,
                    according to weather and other conditions, the fermentation proceeds more or
                    less briskly; but usually a week or ten days is the period required for
                    attenuation, during which time the scum formed is removed from the surface of
                    the vat twice daily. λVhen sufficiently attenuated, the wash is run into the
                    still, which is generally of a simple construction, and distilled off, the first
                    product being “low wines,” which on redistillation come over as “high wines” or
                    strong rum. When a Pontefex still is used, which contains two intermediate
                    “retorts” between the still and the worm, a strong spirit is obtained at the
                    first distillation. The charge of wash yields from 10 to 12 per cent, of rum, of
                    an average strength of 25’ over proof. Pure distilled rum is an entirely
                    colourless liquid, but as imported and sold it generally has a deep brown colour
                    imparted by caramel or by storage in sherry casks. It has a peculiar aroma,
                    derived principally from the presence of a minute proportion of butyric ether.
                    Rum varies very considerably in quality, the finest being known as Jamaica rum,
                    whether it is the product of that island or not. An inferior quality of rum is
                    known among the French as <hi rend="italic">tafia</hi>; and the lowest quality,
                    into the wash for which debris of sugar cane enters, is called negro rum, and is
                    mostly consumed by the coloured workers in the sugar houses and distilleries.
                    The planters sometimes put rinds and slices of pine-apple into the barrels in
                    which rum is matured, to improve and add to its flavour, and occasionally anise
                    and other flavouring ingredients are also used. The spirit prepared from
                    molasses of beet-sugar factories cannot be classed with rum. The product has a
                    highly disagreeable odour and taste, and it can only be rendered fit for
                    consumption by repeated distillation and concentration to a high degree of
                    strength, whereby the spirit is rendered “silent,” or has only a faint rum
                    flavour. In this condition it is used for mixing with strongly flavoured rum,
                    and for the Jireparation of a fictitious rum, the flavour of which is due to
                    “rum essence,”—a mixture of artificial ether, birch bark oil, and other
                    substances. Cane-sugar molasses enters largely into the materials from which</p>

                    also is a constituent of the wash. The imports of rum into the United Kingdom
                    and the home consumption have been decreasing for a number of years. <note

                    Shrub</hi> is a kind of liqueur, or cold punch, the basis of which is rum, lemon
                    juice, and sugar. It is prepared by adding to 34 gallons of proof rum 2 oz. of
                    the essential oil of orange and an equal quantity of essential oil of lemon
                    dissolved in one quart of spirit, and 300 Ib of refined sugar dissolved in 20
                    gallons of water. This combination is thoroughly mixed together, after which
                    there is added sufficient orange juice or solution of tartaric acid to produce a
                    slight pleasant acidity. After agitating the mixture again for some time, 20
                    gallons of water are added, bringing the quantity up to 100 gallons, and the
                    agitation of the whole is continued for half an hour. In about a fortnight’s
                    time the shrub should be brilliant and ready for bottling. Other flavouring
                    ingredients are occasionally added, and the compound may be varied according to
                    taste. </p></note></p>
