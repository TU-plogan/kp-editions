                <p><label type="entry">RYAZAÑ</label>, a government of Central Russia, is bounded by
                    Moscow and Tula on the W., by Vladimir on the N., and by Tamboff on the E. and
                    S., with an area of 16,255 square miles, and a population of 1,713,581 in
                    1882.</p>
                <p>Ryazan is an intermediate link between the central Great Russian governments and
                    the Steppe governments of the south-east,—the wide and deep valley of the Oka,
                    by which it is traversed from west to east, with a broad curve to the south,
                    being the natural boundary between the two. On the left of the Oka the surface
                    often consists of sands, marshes, and forests; while on the right the fertile
                    black-earth prairies begin, occupying especially the southern part of the
                    government (the districts of Ranenburg, Sapojok, and Dankoff). The whole of
                    Ryazan is a plateau about 700 feet above the sea, but deeply cut by the river
                    valleys and numerous ravines. The geological formations represented are the
                    Devonian, the Carboniferous, the Jurassic, and the Quaternary. The Devonian
                    appears in the deeper valleys in the south, and belongs to the well-known
                    “Malevka-Muraevnya horizon,” now considered as equivalent to the <hi
                        rend="italic">Cypridina Serratostriata</hi> Upper Devonian deposits of the
                    Eifel. The Carboniferous deposits are widely spread, and appear at the surface
                    in the bottoms of the ravines and valleys. They contain strata of excellent coal
                    between plastic blue clays, "which are worked at several places. Upper
                    Carboniferous limestones, as also sandstones, the age of which has not yet been
                    determined, but which seem to be Lower Jurassic, cover the Carboniferous clays.
                    The Upper Jurassic deposits are widely spread, but they have been much destroyed
                    and now appear as separate insular tracts. They belong to the Oxford and
                    Callovian horizons, the former containing corals, which are very rare on the
                    whole in the Russian Jurassic deposits. The Quaternary deposits are represented
                    by the Glacial boulder clay and more recent alluvial deposits, which occupy wide
                    areas in the valley of the Oka. Iron-ores, limestone, grindstone grits, potters’
                    clays, and thick beds of peat are worked, besides coal. The northern parts of
                    Ryazan belong to the forest regions of Russia, and, notwithstanding the
                    wholesale destruction of forests in that part of the country, these (chiefly
                    Coniferous) still cover one-third of the surface in several districts. In the
                    south, where the proximity of the Steppes is felt, they are much less extensive,
                    the prevailing species being oak, birch, and other deciduous trees. They cover
                    an aggregate area of more than 2 million acres.</p>
                <p>The Oka is the chief river; it is navigable throughout, and receives the
                    navigable Pronya, Pra, and Tsna, besides a great many smaller streams utilized
                    for floating timber. Steamers ply on the Oka to Kasimoff and Nijni Novgorod. The
                    Don and the Lyesnoi Voronezh belong to Ryazan in their upper courses only. On
                    the whole, the south districts are not well watered. Small lakes are numerous in
                    the broad depression of the Oka and elsewhere, while extensive marshes cover the
                    north-east districts; a few attempts at draining several of these on the banks
                    of the Oka have resulted in the reclamation of excellent pasture lands. The
                    climate is a little warmer than at Moscow, the average temperature at Ryazan
                    being 41°.</p>
                <p>The territory of Ryazan was occupied in the 9th century by Finnish stems
                    (Mordvinians, Mers, Muroms, and Meschers), which for the most part have either
                    given way before or disappeared amongst the Slavonian colonizers. The population
                    is now Great Russian throughout, and contains only a trifling admixture of some
                    6000 Tartars, 1500 Poles, and 500 Jews in towns. Some Tartars immigrated into
                    the Kasimoff region in the 15th century, and are noted for their honesty of
                    character as well as for their agricultural prosperity. The people of the Pra
                    river are described as Mescheriaks, but their manners and customs do not differ
                    from those of the Russians.</p>
                <p>The chief occupation in Ryazafi is agriculture. Out of 10,100,000 acres only
                    838,000 are unfit for tillage. 5,482,000 acres are under crops, and the annual
                    produce is estimated at about 4,248,000 <pb break="no"

                        xml:id="kp-eb0921-0133-0116"/>quarters of corn and 972,000 quarters of
                    potatoes. The area under cultivation and the crops themselves are increasing, as
                    also is the export of corn. But even here, in one of the wealthiest governments
                    of Russia, the situation of the peasants is far from satisfactory.
                    Cattle-breeding is rapidly falling olf on account of want of pasturo lands, but
                    hay, which is abundant, especially on the rich meadow lands of the Oka, is
                    exported. In 1882 there were 283,500 horses, 262,200 cattle, and 839,600 sheep,
                    the figures having been 446,000, 297,000, and 847,000 respectively in 1858. Iu
                    the northern part of the government various industries are carried on, such as
                    boatbuilding, the preparation of pitch and tar, the manufacture of wooden
                    vessels, sledges, &amp;c. Various other petty trades, such as weaving,
                    lace-making, and boot-making, are combined with agriculture. Manufactures also
                    have lately begun to make progress, and in 1882 their aggregate production
                    reached 13,000,000 roubles (cotton and flax-spinning mills, glass-works and
                    metal-ware works, and distilleries, the last-named producing to the value of
                    1,850,000 roubles). Trade, especially in com and other agricultural produce and
                    in merchandise manufactured in the villages, is very active. The railway from
                    Ryazan to Moscow is one of the most important in Russia, from the amount of
                    goods carried from the south-east Steppe governments. The Oka is another artery
                    of traffic, the aggregate amount shipped to or sent from its ports within Ryazan
                    reaching 3,634,000 cwts. in 1880. The government is divided into twelve
                    districts, the chief towns of which, with their populations in 1883, are
                    subjoined: Ryazah (30,325 inhabitants), Dankoff (2475), Egorievsk (6055),
                    Kasimoff (15,260), Mikhailoff (2720), Pronsk (1740), Ranenburg (4500), Ryazhsk
                    (4265), Sapojok (2670), Skopin (10,260), Spassk (4320), and Zaraisk (5870).
                    Ranenburg, Skopin, and Zaraisk are important markets for corn and hemp. Several
                    villages, such as Muraevnya, Dyedinovo (6600) and Lovtsy (loading places on the
                    Oka), and Ukolovo (market for corn), have more commerce and industry than the
                    district towns. Large villages are numerous, about sixty having each from 2500
                    to 7000 inhabitants.</p>
                <p>The Slavonians began to colonize the region of Ryazafi as early as the 9th
                    century, penetrating thither both from the north-west (Great Russians) and from
                    the Dnieper (Little Russians). As early ns the 10th century the principality of
                    Murom and Ryazafi is mentioned in the chronicles. During the following centuries
                    this principality increased both in extent and in wealth and included parts of
                    what are now the governments of Kaluga and Moscow. Owing to the fertility of the
                    soil, its Russian population rapidly increased, while the Finnish stems which
                    formerly inhabited it migrated farther east, or became merged among the
                    Slavonians. A dozen towns, all fortified and commercial, are mentioned as
                    belonging to the principality towards the end of the 12th century. The Mongolian
                    invasion stopped all this development. The horsemen of Batu burned and destroyed
                    several towns in 1237, and killed many people, desolating the country. The
                    principality, however, still continued to exist; its great princes strongly
                    opposed the annexation plans of Moscow, making alliance with the Mongols and
                    with Lithuania, but they succumbed, and, the last of them, Ivan, having been
                    imprisoned in Moscow, his principality was definitively annexed in 1517.</p>
