                <p><label type="entry">ROY</label><hi rend="smallcaps">Rammohun</hi> (1772-1833).
                    RAjA RAmmohun Roy (or RAy), the founder of the BrAhma SamAj or Theistic Church
                    of India, was born at RAdhAnagar, Bengal, in May 1772, of an ancient and
                    honourable Brahman family. His father gave him a good education; he learnt
                    Persian at home, Arabic at Patna (where he studied Euclid, Aristotle, and the
                    Koran), and Sanskrit at Benares. Although a devout idolater in boyhood, he early
                    began to doubt and <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0921-0046-0035"/>speculate, and at fifteen left home to study
                    Buddhism in Tibet, where his criticisms on the Lama-worship gave much offence.
                    After some years’ travel he returned, but, his anti-idolatrous sentiments
                    obliging him to leave home, he lived at Benares until his father’s death in
                    1803. After this, he spent about ten years in the East India Company’s service,
                    latterly as dewAn or head officer in the collection of revenues.</p>
                <p>During this period he first began to assemble his friends together for evening
                    discussions on the absurdities of idolatry, and he also issued his first work,
                    <hi rend="italic">Tuhfat-al Muwalddddin</hi> (“A Gift to Monotheists ”). This
                    treatise was in Persian, with an Arabic preface, and was a bold protest against
                    superstition and priestcraft. These proceedings brought on him much hostility,
                    and even persecution, and in 1814 he retired to Calcutta for greater safety.
                    Here he soon established a little Friendly Society <hi rend="italic">{Atmiya
                    Sabhd),</hi> which met weekly to read the Hindu Scriptures and to chant
                    monotheistic hymns. In 1816 he translated the VedAnta into Bengali and
                    Hindustani, following this by a series of translations from the Upani-shads into
                    Bengali, Hindustani, and English, with introductions and comments of his own.
                    These works he published at his own expense and disseminated widely among his
                    countrymen. His writings excited much opposition and gave rise to numerous
                    controversies, in which his ability, tact, and learning rendered him fully a
                    match for <hi rend="underline">his</hi> antagonists. But the deadliest blow
                    which he inflicted upon Hindu superstition was his effective agitation against
                    the rite of suttee, the burning of living widows on the funeral piles of their
                    deceased husbands. In 1811 he had been a horrified witness of this sacrifice in
                    his elder brother’s family, and had vowed never to rest until he had uprooted
                    the custom. He exposed the hollow pretences of its advocates in elaborate
                    pamphlets, both in Bengali and English, and pressed the matter in every possible
                    way, till at last the tide of public feeling turned, and on December 4, 1829,
                    Lord William Bentinck issued a regulation abolishing suttee throughout all the
                    territories subject to Fort William. RAmmohun was an active politician and
                    philanthropist. He built schoolhouses and established schools in which useful
                    knowledge was gratuitously taught through the medium both of the English and the
                    native languages. He wrote a suggestive Bengali grammar, of which he published
                    one version in English (1826) and one in Bengali (1833). He wrote valuable
                    pamphlets on Hindu law, and made strenuous exertions for the freedom of the
                    native press; he also established (1822) and mainly conducted two native
                    newspapers, the <hi rend="italic">Sambad Kaumudi</hi> in Bengali, and (if
                    rightly identified) the <hi rend="italic">Mirat-al-Akhbar</hi> in Persian, and
                    made them the means of diffusing much useful political information. Becoming
                    interested in Christianity, he learned Hebrew and Greek in order to read the
                    Bible in the original languages; and in 1820 he issued a selection from the four
                    Gospels entitled <hi rend="italic">The Precepts of Jesus, the Guide to Peace and
                    Happiness.</hi> This was attacked by the Baptist missionaries of Serampur, and a
                    long controversy ensued, in which he published three remarkable <hi
                    rend="italic">Appeals to the Christian Public in Defence of the “Precepts of
                    Jesusfi</hi> He also wrote other theological tracts (sometimes under assumed
                    names) in which he attacked both Hindu and Christian orthodoxy with a strong
                    hand. But his personal relations with orthodox Christians were never unfriendly,
                    and he rendered valuable assistance to Dr Duff in the latter’s educational
                    schemes. He also warmly befriended a Unitarian Christian Mission which was
                    started in Calcutta (1824) by Mr William Adam, formerly a Baptist missionary,
                    who, in attempting to convert Rammohun to Trinitarianism, had himself been
                    converted to the opposite view. This Unitarian Mission, though not a theological
                    success, attracted considerable sympathy among the Hindu monotheists, whose
                    Atmiya SabhA had then become extinct. At last Riimmohun felt able to re-embody
                    his cherished ideal, and on August 20, 1828, he opened the first “BrAhmya
                    Association” <hi rend="italic">{Brahma Sabha)</hi> at a hired house. A suitable
                    church building was then erected and placed in the hands of trustees, with a
                    small endowment and a remarkable trust-deed by which the building was set apart
                    “for the worship and adoration of the Eternal, Unsearchable, and Immutable Being
                    who is the Author and Preserver of the universe.” The new church was formally
                    opened on the Ilth MAgh (January 23) 1830, from which day the BrAhma SamAj dates
                    its existence. Having now succeeded in his chief projects, RAmmohun resolved to
                    visit England, and the king of Delhi appointed him his envoy thither on special
                    business, and gave him the title of rAjA. He arrived in England on April 8,
                    1831, and was received with universal cordiality and respect. He watched with
                    special anxiety the parliamentary discussions on the renewal of the East India
                    Company’s charter, and gave much valuable evidence before the Board of Control
                    on the condition of India. This he republished with additional suggestions <hi

                    on the Right of Hindus over Ancestral Property</hi> (1832). He visited France,
                    and wished to visit America, but died unexpectedly of brain fever at Bristol,
                    September 27, 1833.</p>
                <p>His Bengali and Sanskrit works were lately reissued in one volume, by RAjnArAin
                    Bose and A. C. VedAntabAgish (Calcutta, 1880), and bis English works will
                    shortly be published in two volumes by Esbanchanilra Bose. NagendranAth
