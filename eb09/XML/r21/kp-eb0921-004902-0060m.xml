                    'Abdallfih, the first great genius of modern Persia, was born in Rùdag, a
                    village in Transoxiana, about 870-900, —totally blind, as most of his
                    biographers assert, although the fine distinction of colours and the minute
                    description of the various tints and shades of flowers in his poems flatly
                    contradict the customary legend of the “blind minstrel.” In his eighth year he
                    knew the whole Korfin by heart and had begun to write verses. He had besides a
                    wonderful voice which enraptured all hearers, and he played in a masterly way on
                    the lute. The fame of these accomplishments at last reached the ear of the
                    Sfimfinid Nasr II. bin Ahmad, the ruler of Khorâsân and Transoxiana (913— 942),
                    who drew the poet to his court and distinguished him by his personal favour.
                    Riidagi became his daily companion, rose to the highest honours, and grew rich
                    in worldly wealth. He received so many costly presents that he could allow
                    himself the extravagance of keeping two hundred pages, and that four hundred
                    camels were necessary to carry all his property. In spite of various
                    predecessors he well deserves the title of “father of Persian literature,” since
                    he was the first who impressed upon every form of epic, lyric, and didactic
                    poetry its peculiar stamp and its individual character. He is also said to have
                    been the founder of the “diwfin,” that is, the typical form of the complete
                    collection of a poet’s lyrical compositions in a more or less alphabetical order
                    which prevails to the present day among all Mohammedan writers. His poems
                    filled, according to all statements, one hundred volumes and consisted of one
                    million three hundred thousand verses; but of this there remain only fifty-two
                    kasidas, ghazals, and rubfi'is; of his epic masterpieces we have nothing beyond
                    a few stray lines found here and there as illustrations of ancient Persian words
                    and phrases in native dictionaries. But the most serious loss is that of his
                    translation of Ibn Mukaffa’s Arabic version of the old Indian fable book <hi
                    rend="italic">Kalilah and Dimnah,</hi> which he put into Persian verse at the
                    request of his royal patron, and for which he received the handsome reward of
                    40,000 dirhems. In his kasidas, which are all devoted to the praise of his
                    sovereign and friend, Rfidagi has left us unequalled models of a refined and
                    delicate taste, very different from the often bombastic compositions of later
                    Persian encomiasts, and these alone would entitle him to a foremost rank among
                    the poets of his country; but his renown is considerably enhanced by his odes
                    and epigrams. Those of a didactic tendency express in well-measured lines a sort
                    of Epicurean philosophy—in the loftiest sense of the word—on human life and
                    human happiness; more charming still are the purely lyrical pieces, sweet and
                    fascinating songs, which glorify the two everlasting delights of glowing hearts
                    and cheerful minds—love and wine. Rfidagi survived his royal friend, and died
                    long after the splendid days of Nasr’s patronage, the time of wealth and luxury,
                    had passed away—poor and forgotten by the world, as one of his poems, a
                    beautiful elegy, seems to indicate—in 954.</p>
