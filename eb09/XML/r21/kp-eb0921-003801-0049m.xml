                    science. It is the oldest scientific society in Great Britain, and one of the
                    oldest in Europe.</p>
                <p>The Royal Society is usually considered to have been founded in the year 1660,
                    but a nucleus had in fact been in existence for some years before that date.
                    Wallis informs us that as early as the year· 1645 weekly meetings were held of
                    “divers worthy persons, inquisitive into natural philosophy, and other parts of
                    human learning, and particularly of what hath been called the <hi rend="italic"
                    >New Philosophy</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Experimental Philosophy”</hi> and
                    there can be little doubt that this gathering of philosophers is identical with
                    the “Invisible College” of which Boyle speaks in sundry letters written in 1646
                    and 1647. These weekly meetings, according to Wallis, were first suggested by
                    Theodore Ilaak, “a German of the Palatinate then resident in London,” and they
                    were held sometimes in Dr Goddard’s lodgings in Wood Street, sometimes at the
                    Bull-Head Tavern in Cheapside, but more often at Gresham College.</p>
                <p>On November 28, 1660, the first journal book of the society was opened with a
                    “memorandum,” from which the following is an extract :—“Memorandum that Novemb.
                    28. 1660, These persons following, according to the usuall custom of most of
                    them, mett together at Gresham Colledge to heare Mr Wren’s lecture, viz., The
                    Lord Brouncker, Mr Boyle, Mr Bruce, Sir Robert Moray, Sir Paul Neile, Dr
                    Wilkins, Dr Goddard, Dr Petty, Mr Ball, Mr Rooke, Mr Wren, Mr Hill. And after
                    the lecture was ended, they did, according to the usuall manner withdrawe for
                    mutuall converse. MTiere amongst other matters that were discoursed of,
                    something was offered about a désigné of founding a Colledge for the promoting
                    of Physico-Mathe-maticall Experimentall Learning.” It was agreed at this meeting
                    that the company should continue to assemble on Wednesdays at 3 o’clock; an
                    admission fee of ten shillings with a subscription of one shilling a week was
                    instituted; Dr Wilkins was appointed chairman; and a list of forty-one persons
                    judged likely and fit to join the design was drawn up. On the following
                    Wednesday Sir Robert Moray brought word that the king (Charles II.) approved the
                    design of the meetings; a form of obligation was framed, and was signed by all
                    the persons enumerated in the memorandum of November 28, and by seventy-three
                    others. On December 12 another meeting was held at which fifty-five was fixed as
                    the number of the society,—persons of the degree of baron, fellows of the
                    College of Physicians, and public professors of mathematics, physic, and natural
                    philosophy of both universities being supernumeraries.</p>
                <p>Gresham College’ was now appointed to be the regular meeting-place of the
                    society. Sir Robert Moray was chosen president (March 6, 1661), and continued in
                    that office until the incorporation of the society, when he was succeeded by
                    Lord Brouncker. Iu October 1661 the king offered to be entered one of the
                    society, and next year the society was incorporated under the name of “The Royal
                    Society,” the charter of incorporation passing the great seal on the 15th July
                    1662, to be modified, however, by a second charter in the following year. The
                    council of the Royal Society met for the first time on May 13, 1663, when
                    resolutions were passed that debate concerning those to be admitted should be
                    secret, and that fellows should pay Is. a week to defray expenses.</p>
                <p>At this early stage of the society’s history one main part of their labours was
                    the “correspondence” which was actively maintained with Continental
                    philosophers, and it was from this that the <hi rend="italic">Philosophical
                    Transactions</hi> (a publication now of world-wide celebrity) took its rise. At
                    first the <hi rend="italic">Transactions</hi> was entirely the work of the
                    secretary, except that it was ordered (March 1, 1664-5) “that the tract be
                    licensed by the Council of the Society, being first reviewed by some of the
                    members of the same.” The first number, consisting of sixteen quarto pages,
                    appeared on Monday 6th March 1664-5. In 1750 four hundred and ninety-six numbers
                    or forty-six volumes had been published by the secretaries. After this date the
                    work was issued under the superintendence of a committee, and the division into
                    numbers disappeared. At present (1885) one hundred and seventy-five volumes have
                    been completed.</p>
                <p>Another matter to which the society turned their attention was the formation of a
                    museum, the nucleus being “the collection of rarities formerly belonging to Mr
                    Hubbard,” which, by a resolution of council passed February 21, 1666, was
                    purchased for the sum of £100. This museum, at one time the most famous in
                    London, was presented to the trustees of the British Museum in 1781, upon the
                    removal of the society to Somerset House.</p>
                <p>After the Great Fire of London in September 1666 the apartments of the Royal
                    Society in Gresham College were required for the use of the city authorities,
                    and the society were therefore invited by Henry Howard of Norfolk to meet in
                    Arundel House. At the same time he presented them with the library purchased by
                    his grandfather Thomas, earl of Arundel, and thus the foundation was laid of the
                    magnificent collection of scientific works, probably not far short of 45,000
                    volumes, which the society at the present time possesses. Of the Arundel MSS.
                    the bulk was sold to the trustees of the British Museum in 1830 for the sum of
                    «£3559, the proceeds being devoted <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit21newyrich/page/n50/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0921-0050-0039"/>to the purchase of scientific books. These MSS.
                    are still kept in the museum as a separate collection.</p>
                <p>Under date December 21, 1671, the journal-book records that “the lord bishop of
                    Sarum proposed for candidate Mr Isaac Newton, professor of the Inathematicks at
                    Cambridge.” Newton was elected a fellow January 11, 1671-2, and in 1703 he was
                    appointed president, a post which he held till his death in 1727. During his
                    presidency the society moved to Crane Court, their first meeting in the new
                    quarters being held November 8, 1710. In the same year they were appointed
                    visitors and directors of the Royal Observatory at Greenwich, a function which
                    they continued to perform until the accession of William IV., when by the new
                    warrant then issued the president and six of the fellows of the Royal
                    Astronomical Society were added to the list of visitors.</p>
                <p>In 1780, under the presidency of Sir Joseph Banks, the Royal Society removed from
                    Crane Court to the apartments assigned to them by the Government in the new
                    Somerset House, where they remained until they removed to Burlington House in
                    1857. The policy of Sir Joseph Banks was to render the fellowship more difficult
                    of attainment than it had been, and the measures which he took for this purpose,
                    combined with other circumstances, led to the rise of a faction headed by Dr
                    Horsley. Throughout the years 1783 and 1784 feeling ran exceedingly high, but in
                    the end the president was supported by the majority of the society. An account
                    of the controversy will be found in a tract entitled <hi rend="italic">An
                    AUthentic Narrative of the Dissensions and Debates in the Royal Society.</hi> In
                    connexion with this policy of Sir Joseph Banks may be mentioned a further step
                    in the same direction taken in the year 1847, when the number of candidates
                    recommended for election by the council was limited to fifteen, and the election
                    was made annual. Concurrently, however, with this gradual narrowing of the Royal
                    Society’s boundaries was the successive establishment of other scientific
                    bodies. The founding of the Linnean Society in 1788 under the auspices of
                    several fellows of the Royal Society was the first instance of the establishment
                    of a distinct scientific association under royal charter. The Geological Society
                    followed in 1807, and the Royal Astronomical Society in 1820. The Chemical, the
                    Royal Geographical, and the Entomological are the remaining chartered scientific
                    societies existing in London at the present time. The Royal Society continues,
                    however, to hold the foremost place among the scientific bodies of England, not
                    only from the number of eminent men included in its fellowship, but also from
                    its close official connexion with the Government.</p>
                <p>The following will serve as some indication of the variety and importance of the
                    scientific matters upon which they have been consulted by or have memorialized
                    the Government during the last seventy years:—1816, standard measures of length;
                    1817, expedition in search of North-West Passage; 1822, use of coal-tar in
                    vessels of war; best manner of measuring tonnage of ships; 1823, corrosion of
                    copper sheathing by sea-water; Babbage’s calculating-machine;
                    lightning-conductors for vessels of war; 1825, supervision of gas-works; 1826,
                    Parry’s North Polar expedition; 1832, tidal observations; 1835, instruments and
                    tables for testing the strength of spirits; 1839, Antarctic expedition; magnetic
                    observatories in the colonies; 1845, Franklin’s Arctic expedition; 1849-55,
                    Government grant for scientific research; 1862, the great Melbournetelescope;
                    1865, pendulum observations in India; 1866, reorganization of the meteorological
                    department; 1868, deep sea research; 1872, “Challenger” expedition; 1874, Arctic
                    expedition; 1875, eclipse expedition; 1876, Vivisection Bill; 1877, transit of
                    Venus expedition; 1879, prevention of accidents in mines; 1881, pendulum
                    observations; 1882, transit of Venus; cruise of the “Triton” in Faroe Channel;
                    1883, borings in delta of Nile; 1884, Bureau des Poids et Mesures; prime
                    meridian conference, &amp;c. One of the most important duties which the Royal
                    Society performs on behalf of the Government is the administration of the annual
                    grant of £4000 for the promotion of scientific research. This grant originated
                    in a proposal by Lord John</p>
                <p>Russell in 1849 that at the close of the year the president and council should
                    point out to the first lord of the treasury a limited number of persons to whom
                    the grant of a reward or of a sum to defray the cost of experiments might be of
                    essential service. This grant of £1000 afterwards became annual, and was
                    continued until 1876. In that year an additional sum of £4000 for similar
                    purposes was granted, and the two funds of £1000 and £4000 were administered
                    concurrently until 1881, in which year the two were combined in a single annual
                    grant of £4000 under new regulations. One of the most useful of the society’s
                    undertakings of late years is the great catalogue of scientific papers,—an
                    index, in eight quarto volumes, under authors’ names, of all the memoirs of
                    importance in the chief English and foreign scientific serials from the year
                    1800 to the year 1873. The work was prepared under the direction and at the
                    expense of the Royal Society, and was printed by H. M. Stationery Office.</p>
                <p>A statement of the trust funds administered by the Royal Society will be found in
                    their published <hi rend="italic">Proceedings</hi> under date November 30th of
                    each year, and the origin and history of these funds will be found in Weld’s <hi
                    rend="italic">History of the Royal Society,</hi> and in the late William
                    Spottiswoode’s “Anniversary Address for 1874” <hi rend="italic">(Proc. Roy.
                    Soe.,</hi> xxiii. p. 49). The income of the society is derived from the annual
                    contributions and composition fees of the fellows, from rents, and from interest
                    on various investments. The balance-sheet and an account of the estates and
                    property are published in the <hi rend="italic">Proceedings</hi> at each
                    anniversary. Four medals (a Copley, two Royal, and a Davy) are awarded by the
                    society every year, and the Rumford medal in alternate years. The first of these
                    originated in a bequest by Sir Godfrey Copley (1709), and is awarded “to the
                    living author of such philosophical research, either published or communicated
                    to the society, as may appear to the council to be deserving of that honour”;
                    the author may be an Englishman or a foreigner. The Rumford medal originated in
                    a gift from Count Rumford in 1796 of £1000 3 per cent, consols, for the most
                    important discoveries in heat or light made during the preceding two years. The
                    Royal medals were instituted by George IV., and are awarded annually for the two
                    most important contributions to science published in the British dominions not
                    more than ten years nor less than one year from the date of the award. The Davy
                    medal was founded by the will of Dr John Davy, F.R.S., the brother of Sir
                    Humphry Davy, and is given annually for the most important discovery in
                    chemistry made in Europe or Anglo-America. An enumeration of the awards of each
                    of the medals will be found at the end of the list of fellows which is published
                    annually by the society.</p>
                <p>Under the existing statutes of the Royal Society every candidate for election
                    must be recommended by a certificate in writing signed by six or more fellows,
                    of whom three at least must sign from personal knowledge. From the candidates so
                    recommended the council annually select fifteen by ballot, and on the first
                    Thursday in June the names so selected are submitted to the society in the form
                    of a printed balloting-sheet with space left for erasure and substitution of
                    names. Princes of the blood may, however, be proposed at any ordinary meeting
                    and put to the vote on the same day, and any member of H. M. privy council may
                    be balloted for on the third ordinary meeting from the day upon which his
                    certificate is read. Foreign members, not exceeding fifty, may be selected by
                    the council from among men of the greatest scientific eminence, and proposed to
                    the society for election. Every member of the privileged class is liable to an
                    admission fee of £10 and an annual payment of £4; other fellows pay £3 per
                    annum. The composition for annual payments is £60.</p>
                <p>The anniversary meeting for the election of the council and officers is held on
                    St Andrew’s Day. The council for the ensuing year, out of which are chosen the
                    president, treasurer, principal secretaries, and foreign secretary, must consist
                    of eleven members of the existing council and ten fellows who are not members of
                    the existing council. These are nominated by the president and council
                    previously to the anniversary meeting. The session of the society is from
                    November to June; the ordinary meetings are held every Thursday during the
                    session, at 4.30 P.M. The selection for publication from the papers read before
                    the society is made by the “Gommittee of Papers,” which consists of the members
                    of the council for the time being aided by referees. The papers so selected are
                    published either in the <hi rend="italic">Philosophical Transactions</hi> (4to)
                    or the <hi rend="italic">Proceedings of the Royal Society</hi> (8vo), and one
                    copy of each of these publications is presented gratis to every fellow of the
                    society and to the chief scientific societies throughout the world.</p>
                <p>The making and repealing of laws is vested in the council, and in every case the
                    question must be put to the vote on two several days of their meeting.</p>
