                <p><label type="entry">RUDE STONE MONUMENTS</label>. The raising of commemorative
                    monuments of such an enduring material as stone is a practice that may be traced
                    in all countries to the remotest times. The highly sculptured statues, obelisks,
                    and other monumental erections of modern civilization are but the lineal
                    representatives of the unhewn monoliths, dolmens, cromlechs, &amp;c., of
                    prehistoric times. Judging from the large number of the latter that have still
                    survived the destructive agencies (notably those of man himself) to which they
                    have been exposed during so many ages, it would seem that the ideas which led to
                    their erection had as great a hold on humanity in its earlier stages of
                    development as at the present time. In giving some idea of these rude monuments
                    in Britain and elsewhere, it will be convenient to classify them as follows (see
                    vol. ii. p. 383, figs. 1-4). (1) Isolated pillars or monoliths of unhewn stones
                    raised on end are called <hi rend="italic">Menhirs (maen,</hi> a stone, and <hi
                    rend="italic">hir,</hi> long). (2) When these monoliths are arranged in lines
                    they become <hi rend="italic">Alignments. (2&gt;)</hi> But if their linear
                    arrangement is such as to form an enclosure <hi rend="italic">(enceinte),</hi>
                    whether circular, oval, or irregular, the group is designated by the name of <hi
                    rend="italic">Cromlech</hi> (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Cromlech).</hi> (4)
                    Instead of the monoliths remaining separate, they are sometimes placed together
                    and covered over by one or more capstones so as to form a rude chamber; in this
                    case <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit21newyrich/page/n62/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0921-0062-0051"/>the monument is called a <hi rend="italic">Dolmen
                    (daul,</hi> a table, and <hi rend="italic">rnaen,</hi> a stone). This megalithic
                    chamber is sometimes partially or wholly imbedded in a mound of earth or stones
                    so as to form a tumulus or cairn. As, however, there are many tumuli and cairns
                    which do not contain megalithic chambers, we have only partially to deal with
                    them under the category of rude stone monuments.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Menhirs.—</hi> Rude monoliths fixed on end (see vol. ii. p.
                    383, fig. 1) have been used in all ages for a variety of purposes, commemorative
                    and religious. Stone pillars were also used ceremonially on the accession of
                    kings and chiefs. In Scotland, when stones were thus used, they were called
                    Tanist Stones, the most celebrated of which was the Lia Fail, formerly at Scone
                    (now at Westminster Abbey), on which the kings of Scotland used to be crowned.
                    We read also of Hare or Hoer Stones, Cambus or Camus Stones, Cat (cαZΛ, battle)
                    Stones, “Witch Stanes,” “Druid Staues,” &amp;c. The Hawk’s Stane, or <hi
                    rend="italic">Saxum Falconis,</hi> at St Madoes, Perthshire, was erected in
                    memory of the defeat of the Danes at Luncarty, and a monolith now standing on
                    the field of Flodden is said to mark the place where King James fell. When
                    menhirs were grouped together their number was often significant, <hi
                    rend="italic">e.g.,</hi> twelve (Josh. iv. 5) or seven (Herod., iii. 8). Some
                    standing stones are found to have been artificially perforated, and these
                    superstition has invested with some curious functions. As examples of this class
                    may be mentioned the famous Stone of Odin, near the circle of Stennis, the
                    Clach-Charra, or Stone of Vengeance, at Onich near Balachu-Iish in Argyllshire,
                    and Men-en-tol in Cornwall. Two rude monoliths in Scotland bear
                    inscriptions,—the famous Newton Stone in the district of Garioch, and the Cat
                    Stane near Edinburgh. Many others have cup-marks and spirals or concentric
                    circles. In Ireland, Wales, and the north of Scotland, they are occasionally
                    found with ogam inscriptions, and in the north-east of Scotland (Pietland) with
                    symbolical figures, which were subsequently continued on the beautifully
                    sculptured stones of early Christian date which are peculiar to that
                    locality.</p>
                <p>Menhirs are found in all megalithic countries. In the British Isles they are very
                    abundant, more especially in the less cultivated districts. In France over 1600
                    isolated examples have been recorded, of which about the half, and by far the
                    most remarkable, are within the five departments which constitute Brittany. In
                    the rest of France they are generally small, and not to be compared in grandeur
                    to those of Brittany. At Locmariaquer (Morbihaii) is the largest menhir in the
                    world. It is in the form of a rude but smooth-sided obelisk, and lies on the
                    ground broken into four portions, the aggregate length of which amounts to 20
                    <hi rend="superscript">-</hi> δ0 metres (about 67 feet). It was made of granite,
                    foreign to the neighbourhood, and its weight, according to the most recent
                    calculations, amounted to 347,531 kilogrammes or 342 tons <hi rend="italic">{H
                    Homme,</hi> 1885, p. 193). The next largest menhir is at Plésidy
                    (Côtes-du-Nord), measuring about 37 feet in height. Then follows a list of
                    sixty-seven gradually diminishing to 16 feet in height, of which the first ten
                    (all above 26 feet) are in Brittany. As regards form, these menhirs vary
                    greatly. Some are cylindrical, as the well-known “pierre du champ Dolent” at Dol
                    (height 30 feet), and that of Cadiou in Finistère (28 feet); while that of
                    Penmarch (26 feet) takes the shape of a partially expanded fan. On the
                    introduction of Christianity into France its adherents appear to have made use
                    of these menhirs at an early period; many of them at present support a cross,
                    and some a Madonna. The scattered positions of some monoliths and the no less
                    singular grouping of others show that, although they were sometimes used as
                    landmarks, this was only a secondary function. It is not uncommon to find a
                    monolith overtopping a tumulus, thus simulating the Bauta (grave or battle)
                    Stones OfScandinavia. In England, monoliths are often associated with the stone
                    circles, as the King’s Stone at Stanton Drew, Long Meg at Little Salkeld, the
                    Ring Stone at Avebury, &amp;c. One of the finest British monoliths stands in the
                    churchyard of Rudston, Yorkshire. Examples of a large size are met with in
                    Algeria, Morocco, India, Central Asia, &amp;c.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Alignments.—</hi> The most celebrated monuments of this class
                    are in the vicinity of Carnac in Brittany. They are situated in groups at Ménec,
                    Kermario, Kerlescant, Erdeven, and St Barbe—all within a few miles of each
                    other, and in the centre of a district containing the most remarkable megalithic
                    remains in the world. The first three groups are supposed by some archaeologists
                    to be merely portions of one original and continuous series of alignments, which
                    extended nearly 2 miles in length in a uniform direction from south-west to
                    north-east. Commencing at the village of Ménec, the menhirs are arranged in
                    eleven rows. At first they stand from 10 to 13 feet above the ground, but, as we
                    advance, they become gradually smaller till they attain only 3 or 4 feet, when
                    they cease altogether. After a vacant space of about 350 yards we come to the
                    Kermario group, which contains only ten lines, but they are nearly of the same
                    magnitude as at the beginning of the former group. After a still greater
                    interval the menhirs again appear, but this time in thirteen rows, at the
                    village o Kerlescant. In 1881 M. Felix Gaillard, Plouharnel, made a plaι of the
                    alignments at Erdeven, which shows that, out of a total o 1120 menhirs which
                    originally constituted the group, 290 are stil standing, 740 fallen, and 90
                    removed. The menhirs here may b&lt; traced for nearly a mile, but their linear
                    arrangement is not s&lt; distinct, nor are the stones so large as those at
                    Carnac. Aboui fifty alignments are known in France. At Penmarch there is on&lt;
                    containing over two hundred menhirs arranged in four rows. Others, however, are
                    formed of only a single row of stones, as al Kerdouadec, Leuré, and Camaret. The
                    first is 480 m. in length, and terminates at its southern extremity in a kind of
                    crois gammée. At Leuré three short lines meet at right angles. Tht third is
                    situated on the rising ground between the town of Camarel and the point of
                    Toulinguet. It consists of a base line, some 60C yards long, with forty-one
                    stones (others have apparently been removed), and two perpendicular lines as
                    short ofi'sets. Close tc it are a dolmen and a prostrate menhir. These monoliths
                    are all of coarse quartz and of small size, only one, at Leuré, reaching a
                    height of 9 feet. Alignments are also found in other countries. In the Pyrenees
                    they are generally in single file,—mostly straight, but sometimes reptiliform.
                    Oue at Peyrelade (Billiere) runs in a straight line from north to south for
                    nearly 300 yards, and contains ninety-three stones, some of which are of great
                    size. At St Columb in Cornwall, there is one called the Nine Maidens, which is
                    formed of eight quartz stones, extending in a perfectly straight line for 262
                    feet. In Britain they are more frequently arranged in double file, or in
                    avenues, leading to or from other megalithic monuments, such as still exist, or
                    formerly existed, at the circles of Avebury, Stonehenge, Shap, Callernish,
                    &amp;c. The only example in England comparable to the great alignments of Carnac
                    is in the Vale of the White Horse in Berkshire. Here the stones, numbering about
                    eight hundred, are grouped in three divisions, and extend over an irregular
                    Jiarallelograrn which measures from 500 to 600 yards in length and from 250 to
                    300 yards in breadth. Sir Henry Dryden describes groups of a similar character
                    in Caithness, as at Garry-Whin, Canister, Yarhouse, and the “many stones” at
                    Clyth. Alignments in single and multiple rows have also been observed in
                    Shetland, India, Algeria, &amp;c.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Cromlechs.—</hi> Enclosures <hi rend="italic">{enceintes)</hi>
                    formed of rude monoliths, placed at intervals of a few yards, have generally a
                    circular or oval shape. Rectangular forms are, however, not unknown, examples of
                    which may be seen at Curcunno (Morbihan), near the celebrated dolmen of that
                    name, and at Saint Just (Ille-et-Vilaine). The former measures 37 by 27 yards,
                    and is now composed of twenty-two menhirs, all of which are standing (some
                    fallen ones having been recently restored by the Government). About a dozen
                    menhirs would appear to be wanting. A donkey-shoe-shaped enclosure has been
                    described by Sir Henry Dryden, in the parish of Latheron, Caithness. It is 226
                    feet long and 110 feet wide in the middle, and the two extremities are 85 feet
                    apart. Stone circles are frequently arranged concentrically, as may be seen in
                    the circle at Kenmore, near Aberfeldy, Perthshire, as well as in many other
                    Scotch, Irish, and Scandinavian examples. More rarely one large circle surrounds
                    secondary groups, without having a common centre, as was the case at Avebury,
                    where the outer circle, 1200 feet in diameter, included two others, each of
                    which contained an inner concentric circle. At Boscawen, in Cornwall, there is a
                    group of circles confusedly attached, and, as it were, partially overlapping
                    each other. Circles may also be connected by an alignment or avenue, as at
                    Stanton Drew, Dartmoor, &amp;c. Cromlechs are often associated with other
                    megalithic monuments; thus at the head of the great Carnac alignments are the
                    remains of a large circle which can be readily traced, notwithstanding that some
                    houses are constructed within its area. In the British Isles and the north of
                    Europe cromlechs frequently surround the dolmens, tumuli, or cairns. A few
                    examples of a dolmen surrounded by one or more concentric circles have also been
                    recorded by M. Cartailhac, in the department of Aveyron in France. Outside the
                    cromlech there is also frequently to be found a circular ditch or vallum, as at
                    Avebury, Stonehenge, Arbor Low, Brogar, &amp;c. The most remarkable megalithic
                    monument of this class now extant is Stonehenge, which differs, however, from
                    its congeners in having the stones of its second inner circle partially hewn and
                    attached by large transverse lintels. The largest cromlech in France stands on
                    the Ile-aux-Moines (Morbihan), in the village of Kergonan. About half of it is
                    destroyed by the encroachment of the houses. The remaining semi-circumference
                    (slightly elliptical) contains thirty-six menhirs from 6 to 10 feet high, and
                    its diameter is about 100 metres (328 feet). Only a few of the British cromlechs
                    exceed these dimensions, among which may be mentioned Avebury (1260 by 1170
                    feet), Stonehenge (outer circle 300 feet, inner 106 feet), Stanton Drew (360
                    feet), Brogar (345 feet), Long Meg and her Daughters (330 feet). One near
                    Dumfries, called the Twelve Apostles, also closely approaches the 100-metre
                    size; but, generally speaking, the Scotch and Irish examples are of smaller
                    proportions, rarely <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit21newyrich/page/n63/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0921-0063-0052"/>exceeding IOO feet in diameter. That most of the
                    smaller circles ∣ have been used as sepulchres has been repeatedly proved by
                    actual ∣ excavations, which showed that interments had taken place; within their
                    area. It is difficult, however, to believe that this I could have been the main
                    object of the larger ones. At May-I borough, near Penrith, there is a circle
                    entirely composed of an immeuse aggregation of small stones in the form of a
                    gigantic ring enclosing a Hat area, about 300 feet in diameter. Near the centre
                    there is a fine monolith, one of several known to have formerly stood there. Of
                    the same type is the Giant’s Ring near Belfast, only the ring in this instance
                    is made of earth, and it is considerably larger in diameter (580 feet); the
                    central object is a fine dolmen. It is more probable that such enclosures were
                    used, like many of our modern churches, for the double purpose of burying the
                    dead and addressing the living.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Dolmens.—</hi> In its simplest form a dolmen consists of three,
                    four, or five stone supports, covered over with one selected megalith called a
                    capstone or table. A well-known example of this kind in England is Kit’s Cotty
                    House, between Rochester and Maidstone, which is formed of three large supports,
                    with a capstone measuring 11 by 8 feet. From this simple form there is an
                    endless variety of upward gradations till we reach the so-called Gaint Graves
                    and Grottes aux Fées, which are constructed of numerous supports and several
                    capstones. A dolmen (α∕Z&lt;⅛ <hi rend="italic">couverte)</hi> situated in a
                    plantation at the outskirts of the town of Saumur is composed of four flat
                    supports on each side, with one at the end, and four capstones. The
                    Iargestcapstone measures 7'5 metres in length, 7 in breadth, and 1 in thickness.
                    The chamber is 18 metres long, 6 <hi rend="superscript">-</hi> 5 broad, and 3
                    high. Another near Esse, called “la Roche aux Fées,” is equally long, and is
                    constructed of thirty supports, with eight capstones, including the vestibule.
                    Dolmens of this kind are extremely rare in the British Isles, the only one
                    approaching them being Calliagh Birra’s HouseinIreland. These (generally known
                    as allées couvertes) and many other examples of the simple dolmen show no
                    evidence of having been covered over with a mound. AVhen there was a mound it
                    necessitated, in the larger ones, an entrance passage, which was constructed,
                    like the chamber, of a series of side stones or supports and capstones. Some
                    archaeologists maintain that all dolmens were formerly covered with a cairn or
                    tumulus, —a theory which undoubtedly derives some favour from the condition of
                    many examples still extant, especially in France, where all stages of
                    degradation are seen, from a partial to a complete state of denudation. The
                    allées couvertes of France, Germany, and the Channel Islands had their entrance
                    at the end; but, on the other hand, the Hunuebedden of Holland had both ends
                    closed and the entrance was on the side facing the sun. The covered dolmens are
                    extremely variable in shape,—circular, oval, quadrangular, or irregular. The
                    entrance gallery may be attached to the end, as in the Grotte de Gavr’inis, or
                    to the side, as in the Gaint’s Grave (Jettestuer) at Oem near Roskilde. In other
                    instances there is no distinct chamber, but a long passage gradually widening
                    from the entrance; and this may be bent at an angle, as in the dolmen du
                    Rocher(Morbihan). Again, there may be several chambers Cummunieating with one
                    entrance, or two or three separate chambers having separate entrances, and all
                    imbedded in the same tumulus. An excellent example of this kind is the partially
                    destroyed tumulus of Rondosec, near Plouharnal railway station, which contains
                    three separate dolmens. That such variations are not due to altered customs, in
                    consequence of wideness of geographical range, is shown by M. de Mortillet, who
                    gives plans of no less than sixteen differently shaped dolmens <hi rend="italic"
                    >{Musée préhistorique,</hi> pi. 58), all within a confined district in
                    Morbihan.</p>
                <p>No dolmens exist in eastern Europe beyond Saxony. They reappear, however, in the
                    Crimea and Circassia, whence they have been traced through Central Asia to
                    India, where they are widely distributed. Similar megalithic structures have
                    also been recognized and described by travellers in Palestine, Arabia, Persia,
                    Australia, the Penrhyn Islands, Madagascar, Peru, &amp;c. The irregular manner
                    in which dolmens are distributed along the western parts of Europe has led to
                    the theory that all these megalithic structures were erected by a special
                    people, but as to the when, whence, and whither of this singular race there is
                    no knowledge whatever. Though the European dolmens have a strong family
                    likeness, however widely apart, they present some characteristic differences in
                    the various countries in which they are found. In Scandinavia they are confined
                    to the Danish lands and a few provinces in the south of Sweden. Here the exposed
                    dolmens are often on artificial mounds, and surrounded by cromlechs which are
                    either circular <hi rend="italic">GundAysser)</hi> or oval <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Iangdysser).</hi> In Sweden the <hi rend="italic">sepulture Λ galerie</hi> is
                    very rarely entirely covered up as in the giant graves of Denmark.</p>
                <p>Hanover, Oldenburg, and Mecklenburg are very rich in the remains of these
                    monuments. At Riestedt, near Uelzen in Hanover, there is, on the summit of a
                    tumulus, a very singular dolmen of oblong form, which measures about 40 feet
                    long and over 6 feet in breadth. Another at Naschendorf, near AVismar, consists
                    of a mound surrounded by a large circle of stones and a covered chamber on its
                    summit. Remains of a megalithic structure at Rudenbeck, in Mecklenburg, though
                    now imperfect, show that originally it was constructed like an allée couverte.
                    It had four supports on each side, two at one end (the other end forming the
                    entrance), and two large capstones. The length had been about 20 feet, breadth
                    7$ feet, and height from tho floor to the under-surface of roof about 3 feet.
                    According to Bonstetten, no less than two hundred of these monuments are found
                    distributed over the three provinces of Lüneburg, Osnabrück, and Stade; and the
                    most gigantic examples in Germany are in the duchy of Oldenburg.</p>
                <p>In Holland, with one or two exceptions, they are confined to the province of
                    Drenthe, where between fifty and sixty still exist. Here they get the name of
                    Hunnebedden (Huns’ beds). The Borger Hunnebed, the largest of this group, is 70
                    feet long and 14 feet wide. In its original condition it contained forty-five
                    stones, ten of which were capstones. They are all now denuded, but some show
                    evidence of having been surrounded with a mound containing an entrance passage.
                    Only one dolmen has been recorded in Belgium; but in France their number amounts
                    to 3410. Theyare irregularly distributed over seventy-eight departments, six
                    hundred and eighteen being in Brittany. In the centre of the country they are
                    also numerous, no less than four hundred and thirty-five being recorded in
                    Aveyrpn, but they are of much smaller proportions than in the former locality.
                    From the Pyrenees the dolmens are sparsely traced along the north coast of Spain
                    and through Portugal to Andalusia, where they occur in considerable numbers.
                    Crossing into Africa they are found in large groups in Morocco, Algeria, and
                    Tunis. General Faidherbe writes of having examined five or six thousand at the
                    cemeteries of Bou Merzoug, ∖Vady Berda, Tebessa, Gastal, &amp;C. <note

                    with. At Mout Cochon, near St Helier, there was lately discovered in a mound of
                    blown sand an allée couverte, and close to it a stone circle surrounding a
                    dolmen. <note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi

                    </p></note> In the British Isles they are met with in many localities,
                    particularly in the west of England, Anglesey, the Isle of Man, Ireland, and
                    Scotland. In the country last named, however, they are not the most striking
                    feature among its rude stone monuments—the stone circles and cistcd cairns
                    having largely superseded them.</p>
                <p>In the absence of historical knowledge all these megalithic structures were
                    formerly regarded as of Celtic origin. By some they were supposed to have been
                    constructed by the Druids, the so-called priests of the Celts; and hence they
                    were often described, especially since the time of Aubrey and Stukely, under the
                    name of Celtic or Dmidical monuments. But this theory is disproved by the fact
                    that the ethnographical range of the Celtic races does not correspond with the
                    geographical distribution of these rude stone monuments. Thus, for example, in
                    Europe, not to speak of their localization in non-Celtic countries, the
                    megaliths occupy an elongated stretch of territory on its western seaboard
                    extending from Pomerania to North Africa. This area crosses at right angles the
                    lands supposed to have been occupied by the Celtic or Aryan races on their
                    westward waves of migration. There can be no doubt from investigations of the
                    contents of dolmens that their primary object was sepulchral, and that the
                    megalithic chambers, with entrance passages, were used as family vaults. Against
                    the theory that any of them were ever used as altars there is <hi rend="italic"
                    >prima facie</hi> evidence in the care taken to have the smoothest and flattest
                    surface of the stones composing the chamber always turned inwards. Moreover, cup
                    marks, and other primitive markings when found on the capstones or supports, are
                    almost invariably on their inside, as, for example, at the dolmens of Keriaval,
                    KercadoDol au Marchant, Gavr’inis (Morbihan), and the great tumulus at New
                    Grange (Ireland). From its position in the centre of a large circular enclosure
                    no dolmen could be more suggestive of public sacrifices than that within the
                    Giant’s Ring near Belfast; yet nothing could be more inappropriate for such a
                    purpose than its capstone, which is in fact a large granite boulder presenting
                    on its upper side an unusually rounded surface.</p>
                <p>No chronological sequence can be detected in the evolution of the rude stone
                    monuments, with perhaps the exception of the primitive cist which gave origin to
                    the allées couvertes, giant graves, &amp;c., and these again to the tumuli with
                    microlithic built chambers. Much less can their appearance in different
                    countries be said to indicate contemporaneity. The dolmens of Africa are often
                    found to contain objects peculiar to the Iron Age, and it is said that in some
                    parts of India the people are still in the habit of erecting dolmens and other
                    megalithic monuments. Scandinavian archaeologists assign their dolmens
                    exclusively to the Stone Age. It would therefore appear as if a subsequent stage
                    of degradation occurred, when a tamer style of interment ensued, and the Bronze
                    Age barrows replaced the dolmens, and these again gave way to the Iron Age
                    burials—the ship-barrows and large tumuli of the vikings, as manifested in the
                    three tumuli of Thor, Odin, and Freya at <pb break="no"
