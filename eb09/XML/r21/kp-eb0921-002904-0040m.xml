                    scanty, until quite recent times, are the records of this art, which at certain
                    epochs has played no insignificant part in the world’s history. It was the oar
                    that brought Phoenician letters and civilization to Greece; it was the oar that
                    propelled the Hellenic fleet to Troy; it was the oar that saved Europe from
                    Persian despotism; it was the skilful use of the oar by free citizens which was
                    the glory of Athens in her prime. It is to be regretted that so little is known
                    of the details connected with it, or of the disposal of the rowers on board the
                    splendid fleet which started in its pride for Sicily, when 17,000 oars at a
                    given signal smote the brine, and 100 long ships raced as far as Aegina. The
                    vessels of the ancient Greeks and <pb break="no"

                    hexiremes—owed their pace to the exertions of men who plied the oar rather than
                    to the sails with which they were fitted, and which were only used when the wind
                    was favourable. Professor Gardner has shown that boat racing was not uncommon
                    among the Greeks; <note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi

                    was practised among the Romans Virgil testifies in the well-known passage in the
                    fifth book of the <hi rend="italic">Aeneid.</hi> And the Venetian galleys which
                    were subsequently used on the shores of the Mediterranean in mediaeval times
                    were only a modified form of the older kind of craft. These were for the most
                    part manned by slaves and criminals, and were in constant employment in most
                    European countries.</p>
                <p>Rowing was understood by the ancient Britons, as they trusted themselves to the
                    mercy of the waves in coracles composed of wicker-work covered with leather,
                    similar no doubt in many respects to those now used in Wales; but these frail
                    vessels were propelled by paddles and not by oars. The Saxons seem to have been
                    expert in the management of the oar, as well as the Danes and Norwegians, as it
                    is recorded that the highest nobles in the land devoted themselves to it. Alfred
                    the Great introduced long galleys from the Mediterranean, which were propelled
                    by forty or sixty oars on each side, and for some time these vessels were used
                    for war purposes. It is stated by William of Malmesbury that Edgar the Peaceable
                    was rowed in state on the river Dee from his palace, in the city of West
                    Chester, to the church of St John and back again, by eight tributary kings,
                    himself acting as coxswain.</p>
                <p>Boat quintain, or tilting at one another on the water, was first brought into
                    England by the Normans as an amusement for the spring and summer season, and
                    probably much of the success of the champions depended upon the skill of those
                    who managed the boats. Before the beginning of the 12th century the rivers were
                    commonly used for conveying passengers and merchandise on board barges and
                    boats, and until the introduction of coaches they were almost the only means of
                    transit for royalty, and for the nobility and gentry who had mansions and
                    watergates on the banks of the Thames. It is, however, impossible to trace the
                    first employment of bargemen, wherrymen, or watermen, but they seem to have been
                    well established by that time, and were engaged in ferrying and other waterside
                    duties. During the long frosts of the early part of the 13th century, frequent
                    mention is made in the chronicles of the distress among the watermen, from which
                    we may assume that their numbers were large. They were employed in conveying the
                    nobles and their retinues to Runnymede, where they met King John and where Magna
                    Charta was signed. Towards the close of this century the watermen of Greenwich
                    were frequently fined for overcharging at the established ferries, and about the
                    same time some of the city companies established barges for water processions.
                    We learn from Fabian and Middleton that in 1454 “Sir John Norman, then lord
                    mayor of London, built a noble barge at his own expense, and was rowed by
                    watermen with silver oars, attended by such of the city companies as possessed
                    barges, in a splendid manner,” and further “that he made the barge he sat in
                    burn on the water”; but there is no explanation of this statement. Sir John
                    Norman was highly commended for this action by the members of the craft, as no
                    doubt it helped to popularize the fashion then coming into vogue of being rowed
                    on the Thames by the watermen who plied for hire in their wherries. Tho lord
                    mayor’s procession by water to Westminster, which figures on the front page of
                    the <hi rend="italic">Illustrated London Neτvs,</hi> was made annually until <hi
                    rend="underline">the year 1856,</hi> when it was discontinued. The lord mayor’s
                    state barge was a magnificent species of shallop rowed by watermen; and the city
                    companies had for the most part barges of their own, all rowed double-banked
                    with oars in the fore half, the after part consisting of a cabin something like
                    that of a gondola. The watermen became by degrees so large and numerous a body
                    that in the sixth year of the reign of Henry VIIL (1514) an Act was passed
                    making regulations for them. This Act has from time to time been amended by
                    various statutes, and the last was passed in 1858. Much time seems to have been
                    spent in pleasuring on the water in the 15th and 16th centuries, and no doubt
                    competitions among the watermen were not uncommon, though there is no record of
                    them. The principal occupation of watermen, who were obliged to serve an
                    apprenticeship, used to be ferrying and rowing fares on the Thames, but in
                    process of time the introduction of bridges and steamers drove them from this
                    employment, and the majority of them now w <hi rend="superscript">τ</hi> ork as
                    bargemen, lightermen, and steamboat hands, having still to serve an
                    apprenticeship. For many years matches for money stakes were frequent (1831 to
                    1880), but the old race of watermen, of which Phelps, the senior Kelley,
                    Campbell, Coombes, Newell, the MacKinneys, Messenger, Pocock, and Henry Kelley
                    were prominent members, has almost died out, and some of the best English
                    scullers during the last fifteen years have been landsmen.</p>
                <p>Apart from the reference already made to the ancients, we do not find any records
                    of boat-racing before the establishment in England of the coat and badge,
                    instituted by the celebrated comedian Thomas Doggett in 1715, in honour of the
                    house of Hanover, to commemorate the anniversary of “King George I.’s happy
                    accession to the throne of Great Britain.” The prize was a red coat with a large
                    silver badge on the arm, bearing the white horse of Hanover, and the race had to
                    be rowed on the 1st of August annually on the Thames, by six young watermen who
                    were not to have exceeded the time of their apprenticeship by twelve months.
                    Although the first contest took place in the year above mentioned, the names of
                    the winners have only been preserved since 1791. The race continues at the
                    present day, but under slight modifications. The first regatta appears to have
                    occurred about sixty years later, for we learn from the <hi rend="italic">Annual
                    Register</hi> of the year 1775 that an entertainment called by that name (Ital.,
                    <hi rend="italic">regata),</hi> introduced from Venice into England, was
                    exhibited on the Thames off Ranelagh Gardens, and a lengthy account of it is
                    given at the end of the work. The lord mayor’s and several of the city
                    companies’ pleasure barges were conspicuous, and, although we learn very little
                    indeed of the competing wager boats, it seems clear they were rowed by watermen.
                    We find from Strutt’s <hi rend="italic">Sports and Pastimes</hi> (first
                    published in 1801) that the proprietor of Vauxhall Gardens had for some years
                    given a new wherry to be rowed for by watermen, two in a boat, which is perhaps
                    the first pair-oared race on record. Similar prizes w <hi rend="superscript"
                    >τ</hi> ere also given by Astley, the celebrated horseman and circus proprietor
                    of the Westminster Bridge Road, about the same period; but thus far rowing was
                    apparently viewed as a laborious exercise, and the rowers were paid. At the
                    commencement of the present century, however, rowing associations were formed,
                    and the “Star,” “Arrow,” “Shark,” and “Siren” Clubs had races amongst
                    themselves, generally over long courses and in heavy six-oared boats. The Star
                    and Arrow Clubs ceased to exist in the early years of this century, and were
                    merged in the newly formed Leander Club. The date of its establishment cannot be
                    fixed exactly, but it was probably about 1818 or 1819. It ranked high, because
                    the majority of its members had frequently distinguished themselves in matches
                    with the oar and sculls. They were the first to patronize and lend <pb

                    promise of aquatic fame, and they likewise instituted a coat and badge for
                    scullers.</p>
                <p>The first record of public-school racing which can now be seen is the Water
                    Ledger of Westminster School, which commences in the year 1813 with a list of
                    the crew of the six-oared Fly. This craft continued for some time to be the only
                    boat of the school, and in 1816 beat the Temple six-oar in a race from Johnson’s
                    Dock to Westminster Bridge by half a length. Eton possessed a fleet of boats in
                    1811, if not at an earlier date, consisting of a ten-oar and three boats with
                    eight oars. In those days some of the crews had a waterman to pull stroke and
                    drill the crew, but this practice was abolished in 1828, as the waterman
                    frequently rowed a bad stroke and the crew were obliged to subscribe for his
                    day’s pay, beer, and clothes; thenceforward the captain of each crew rowed the
                    stroke-oar. The earliest record of a race at Eton is when Mr Carter’s four rowed
                    against the watermen and beat them in 1817; but the professionals had a boat too
                    small for them. In 1818 ’ Eton challenged Westminster School to row from
                    Westminster to Kew Bridge against the tide, but the match was stopped by the
                    authorities; and it was not until 1829 that the first contest between the two
                    schools was brought to an issue.</p>
                <p>Rowing appears to have commenced at the universities soon after the beginning of
                    the century, but earlier at Oxford than at Cambridge. There were college boats
                    on the river for some time before there were any races. Those first recorded at
                    Oxford were in 1815, said to be college eights, but the boats used are more
                    likely to have been fours, when Brasenose was “head of the river” and Jesus
                    their chief opponent. These two clubs were constantly rowing races, but they
                    were not very particular about the oarsmen in the boats, as the Brasenose crew
                    in 1824 was composed of two members of the college, a AVorcester man, and a
                    waterman. The first authentic records commence in 1836, and the Oxford
                    University Boat Club was established in 1839. At Cambridge eight-oared rowing
                    was not in fashion so soon as at Oxford, the first eight (belonging to St John’s
                    College) not having been Iauncheduntil 1826; and between that year and 1829 the
                    Cambridge University Boat Club was formed. Eight-oared races were established on
                    the Cam in 1827, when First Trinity was “head of the river,” and in 1828 the
                    first Oxford and Cambridge University boat race was proposed and fixed for June
                    10, 1829, on the Thames, from Hambledon Lock to Henley Bridge. The race was
                    rowed at intermittent periods up to 1856, since which year it has been annual.
                    In 1830 the amateur championship of theThames was instituted by Mr Henry C.
                    AVingfield, who presented a pair of silver sculls to be rowed for annually by
                    the amateur scullers of the Thames on the IOth August from Westminster to Putney
                    at half flood, but the course and date of the race have been changed since then.
                    The first scullers’ race for the professional championship of the Thames was
                    rowed from AVestminster to Putney on the 8th September 1831, Charles Campbell of
                    Westminster defeating John Williams of AVaterloo Bridge. During the next eight
                    years rowing increased in favour among amateurs, and, as it had taken its proper
                    place among the national pastimes, and the want of a central spot for a regatta
                    was much felt, Henley-on-Thames was chosen, and it was decided that a regatta
                    should be held there in 1839, and the Grand Challenge cup for eight oars was
                    established. This has been an annual fixture ever since, prizes being given for
                    four oars, pair oars, and scullers, as well as for eight oars. In 1843 the Royal
                    Thames Regatta was started at Putney, and it gave a gold challenge cup for eight
                    oars and a silver challenge cup for four oars, to be rowed by amateurs. In 1844
                    Oxford beat Cambridge at this regatta, and in the same year the committee added
                    a champion prize for watermen. About this time the Old Thames Club was
                    established, and they carried off the gold challenge cup by winning it for three
                    years in succession, viz., 1846 to 1848. In 1852 the Argonauts Club first
                    appeared at Henley and won the Visitors’ cup, and in 1853 the Royal Chester
                    Rowing Club were successful in the Stewards’ cup for four oars, and won the
                    Grand Challenge cup for eight oars the next year. In 1856 the London Rowing Club
                    was established, but those members of it who rowed at Henley were obliged to
                    enter under the name of the Argonauts Club, as, not having been in existence a
                    year, its crew could not compete under its name. The next year, however, they
                    carried off the Grand Challenge cup from Oxford University, and were successful
                    in the Stewards’ cup as well. Many more clubs, suchasthe Kingston, Radley, AVest
                    London, Twickenham, Thames, Moulsey, and other metropolitan and provincial clubs
                    were subsequently established, and have met with varied success.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Boats.—</hi> The boats of the present day differ very much from
                    those formerly used, and the heavy lumbering craft which alone were known to our
                    forefathers have been superseded by a lighter description,—skiffs, gigs, and
                    racing outriggers. The old Thames wherry with its long projecting bow is now
                    seldom seen, and a roomy skiff, often used w <hi rend="superscript">τ</hi> ith a
                    sail when the wind is favourable, has taken its</p>
                <p>{dace. The gig is an open boat with several strakes, having the row-ocks, or
                    pieces of wood between which the oar works, fixed upon the gunwale, which is
                    level all round. The skiff is wider and longer than the gig and of greater
                    depth, and, rising higher fore and aft, with rowlocks placed on a curved and
                    elevated gunwale, has greater carrying power and rows lighter than the gig. The
                    wherry rises high at the bows with a long nose pointed upwards and a very low
                    stern, being consequently unsuited for rough water. The modern racing boat
                    differs much from the foregoing, as its width has been decreased so as to offer
                    as little resistance to the water as possible, while it is propelled by oars
                    working between rowlocks fixed on projecting iron rods and cross pieces which
                    are made fast to the timbers. These rods and cross pieces are rigged out from
                    the side of the boats, and hence the term outriggers. These boats are
                    constructed for single scullers, for pairs, for fours, for eights, and
                    occasionally for twelve oars. The outrigger was first brought to perfection by
                    the late Henry Clasper of Newcastle-on-Tyne, who is generally believed to have
                    been its inventor; but the first outriggers, which were only rude pieces of wood
                    fastened on the boat’s sides, w <hi rend="superscript">r</hi> ere used in 1828,
                    and were fixed to a boat at Ouseburn-On-Tyne. The first iron outriggers were
                    affixed to a boat in 1830 at Dents’ Hole on Tyne. In 1844 Clasper, who had been
                    improving upon these inventions, made his first boat of the kind and brought her
                    to London; but her-outriggers were only 8 inches in length, and she was built of
                    several strakes, with a small keel. In process of time keels were dispensed
                    with, the outriggers were lengthened, and the skin of the boat is now composed
                    of a single strake of cedar planed very thin and bent by means of hot water to
                    take the form of the timbers of the boat. It is fastened by copper nails to
                    curved timbers of ash, one extremity of which is fixed into the keelson while
                    the other is made fast to long pieces of deal that run from end to end of the
                    boat and are called inwales. The timbers in the middle are thicker than the
                    rest, so as to support the iron outriggers which are fastened to them, and the
                    thwart, which is wider than it used to be in order to carry the sliding seat,
                    which works backward and forward with the oarsman, is screwed to the inwales.
                    This seat moves to and fro on rollers made of steel, wood, or brass, and travels
                    over a distance varying from 12 to 6 inches according to the judgment of the
                    instructor. The sliding seat seems to have been the invention of an American
                    oarsman, w <hi rend="superscript">τ</hi> ho fixed one to a sculling boat in
                    1857, but it was not until 1870 that he had mastered the principles sufficiently
                    to discover how much was gained mechanically and physically. The value of the
                    improvement is now universally recognized, but it was some little time before it
                    was understood and came into general use. The members of the London Rowing Club,
                    who defeated the representatives of the New York Atalanta Club at Putney in June
                    1872, used sliding seats, and the club also had them fitted to their eight,
                    which easily carried off the Grand Challenge cup at Henley a few days
                    afterwards. In 1873 the sliding seat was adopted by the crews rowing in the
                    University boat race. The Americans have also the credit of two other
                    inventions, viz., the steering apparatus, Vriiichenables a crew to dispense with
                    a coxswain, and the swivel rowlock; but, though the former is now fitted to the
                    majority of non-coxswain pairs and fours, the use of the latter is confined for
                    the most part to sculling boats. In outrigged eights, fours, and pairs the
                    outriggers are placed, one for each thwart, at each side alternately, but in
                    gigs, skiffs, wherries, and funnies they aτe placed opposite one another, so as
                    to be used on either side at discretion. The oars generally used are about 12
                    feet long, varying with the width of the boat, and sculls are as much as 10 feet
                    long.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Directions for Rmoing.—</hi> In modem rowing the oarsman,
                    grasping the handle of the oar with both hands, sits forward on the edge of his
                    seat, stretches out his arms until they are fully extended—the blade of the oar
                    being, just previous to entering the water, at right angles to its surface. It
                    is then dipped into the water just so far as to cover it, and the handle pulled
                    towards the oarsman’s body, the weight bf the latter being thrown backward at
                    the same time, so as to make one movement, and the legs pressed hard against the
                    stretcher, and the handle finally pulled home to the chest with the arms, the
                    elbows being allowed to pass the sides until the handle of the oar just touches
                    the lower extremity of the breast. The blade of the oar thus appears to be
                    forced through the water, but in reality this is very slightly the case, as the
                    water, which is the fulcrum, remains almost immovable. In sculling, the
                    operation is the same except that the sculler has a scull in each hand and
                    drives the boat himself, whereas a man rowing an oar must have one or more
                    comrades to assist him. Rowing is made up of two parts, the stroke and the
                    feather. Feathering is turning the oar at the end of the stroke by lowering the
                    hands and dropping’the wrists, thus bringing the flat blade of the oar parallel
                    with the surface of the water, and is generally considered to include the
                    driving forward of the handle of the oar and the consequent carrying back of the
                    blade previous to the beginning of a new stroke.</p>
                <p>AVhen prepared to embark, the pupil should lay his oar on . the water if an
                    outside or upon the land if a shoreside oar, and step into the boat with his
                    face to the stern, when he should at once seat himself and ship his oar, and
                    then try the length of his stretcher to see that it suits his length of leg.
                    This arranged, he should <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit21newyrich/page/n43/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0921-0043-0032"/>proceed to settle himself firmly upon his thwart,
                    sitting &lt;jnite square and upright but not too near the edge of it, because if
                    so the chances are that the lower part of the back will not be straight, and if
                    his seat is not firm he cannot aid in balancing the boat. He should sit about
                    three quarters of the thwart aft in an ordinary racing boat, about an inch and a
                    half from the edge, and he must be exactly opposite the handle of his oar. His
                    feet must be planted firmly against the stretcher and immediately opposite his
                    body and oar,—the heel as well as the ball of the foot pressing against the
                    stretcher, and the two heels close together with the toes wide apart, so as to
                    keep the knees open and separate. Of course if the pupil sits fair and square,
                    and immediately opposite the handle of his oar, he will be at one side and not
                    in the centre of the boat. The stretcher, it may be added, should be as short as
                    possible conveniently for clearing the knees and for exercising complete control
                    over the oar. The body should be upright, not bent forward and sunk down upon
                    the trunk; the shoulders should be thrown back, the chest out, and the elbows
                    down close alongside the flanks. The oar should be held firmly, but withal
                    lightly, in both hands, not clutched and cramped as in a vice—the outside hand
                    close to the end of the handle, with the fingers above and the thumb underneath
                    it, and the inside hand, or that nearest the body of the oar, from an inch and a
                    half to 2 inches away from its fellow, but grasping the oar more convexly than
                    the latter, the thumb being kept underneath. The forearms should be below the
                    level of the handle, and the wrists dropped and relaxed, the oar lying flat and
                    feathered upon the surface of the water. The diverse positions of the two hands
                    and wrists enable the oar to be wielded with greater facility than if they were
                    alike, and allow both arms to be stretched out perfectly straight, a crooked arm
                    being perhaps the least pardonable fault in rowing. In taking the stroke the
                    body should be inclined forwards with the backbone straight, the stomach well
                    out and down between the legs, the chest forward and elevated as much as
                    possible. The knees must be pressed slightly outwards; and the shoulders should
                    come moderately forward, but perfectly level, and at an equal height. The arms
                    should play freely in the shoulder joints, and should be perfectly straight from
                    the shoulders to the wrists; the action of the hips also should be free. The
                    inside wrist, however, must be somewhat raised, and the outside one be bent
                    slightly round, in order that the knuckled may be parallel to the oar, and the
                    oar itself be firmly grasped with both hands, not with the tips of the fingers
                    but with the whole of the fingers well round it, and each one feeling the handle
                    distinctly; the knuckles of the thumbs should be about an inch and a half or 2
                    inches apart. In reaching forward the hands should be shot out straight from the
                    body without the least pause, and as soon as the oar has passed the knees the
                    wrists should be raised to bring the blade at right angles to the water
                    preparatory to dipping it, and when the arms are at their extreme limit, which
                    will be just over the stretcher, the oar should be struck down firmly and
                    decisively into the water until covered up to the shoulder, and the weight of
                    the body be thrown entirely upon it, by which the beginning of the stroke is
                    caught, and the stroke itself pulled through; in a word, the pupil should, as it
                    were, knit himself up, and then spring back like a bow when the string is
                    loosened, bringing the muscles of his back and legs into play. 'Ihe stroke
                    should be finished with the arms and shoulders, the elbows being kept close to
                    the sides, and the shoulders down and back, the head still up, and the chest
                    out, and the oar itself be brought straight home to the chest, the knuckles
                    touching the body about an inch or less below the bottom of the breast bone
                    where the ribs branch off; when there the hands should be dropped down and then
                    turned over, and shot out again close along the legs, the body following at
                    once. Care should likewise be taken not to lessen the force applied to the oar
                    as the stroke draws to a conclusion, but to put the whole strength of the arms
                    and shoulders into the finish of the stroke, where it will naturally diminish
                    quite fast enough, as the oar forms an obtuse angle with that portion of the
                    boat before the rowlock. To effect a quick recovery the back must be kept
                    straight, the knees must not be dropped too low, and the muscles of the body,
                    especially of the stomach, must be used to enable the pupil to get forward for
                    the next stroke. At the same time, no matter how minute and precise written
                    instructions may be, they can never inη*art the knowledge that can be picked up
                    by watching the actions of an accomplished oarsman for the space of five
                    minutes; hence the imιιerative necessity of a practical exponent of the
                    principles of the art in contradistinction to a merely theoretical “coach.”</p>
                <p>The foregoing are the essentials of rowing, and have been given at some length
                    and in detail as the motions are necessarily very complicated. The operations
                    are much the same whether a person be rowing on a fixed or sliding seat, but a
                    novice should be taught to row on a fixed seat, and he will afterwards be easily
                    able to acquire the art of sliding, which may soon be done from following the
                    accompanying directions. The oarsman, in getting forward, should extend his arms
                    to their full length, and with the assistance of the straps on the stretcher,
                    simultaneously draw himself as close up to the latter as he can, his knees being
                    slightly and symmetrically opened, and the body reached forward as much as
                    possible, the back being kept quite straight. On catching hold of the water, the
                    knees must be gradually straightened and the body thrown back, the two actions
                    going on simultaneously, so that the legs are straight out by the time the
                    stroke is finished and not before, the body and shoulders at the end of the
                    stroke being thrown well back. The body is then recovered to the upright
                    position from tho hips, the hands thrown forward, and by the time theyarejust
                    past the knees the body is being drawn forward, and the knees bent. The motion
                    then begins the same as before. (E. D. B. )</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Boat-Racing in America.—</hi> This pastime can be traced back
                    to the beginning of the present century. The earliest important affair was in
                    1811,—a sectional match, New York City against all Long Island, four-oared
                    barges, with coxswains, from Harsimus, New Jersey, to the flag-stafΓon the
                    Battery. New York won easily, and such was the popular enthusiasm over the race
                    that its boat, the “Knickerbocker,” was suspended in a public museum, w <hi
                    rend="superscript">τ</hi> here it remained for fifty-four years, a constant
                    recipient of public admiration until destroyed by fire in July 1865. Since this
                    historic contest no year has∙been without boat races. At that time the words
                    amateur and professional were unknown on the water; the Castle Garden Amateur
                    Boat Club Association—America’s first avowedly amateur club—was founded in
                    1834.</p>
                <p>There had been informal clubs and desultory racing at Yale College as early as
                    1833, but the first regular organization was in March 1843. Harvard follow <hi
                    rend="superscript">τ</hi> ed in September 1844, and Yale and Harvard first met
                    on the water at Lake Winnepiseogee, New Hampshire, August 3, 1852; since 1878
                    they have met annually at New London, Conn. In 1865 Harvard, Yale, Trinity, and
                    Brown formed the Union College Regatta Association, which lasted three years.
                    The Racing Association of American Colleges, which at one time included sixteen
                    colleges, died in 1876. In 1883 Bowdoin, Columbia, Cornell, Princeton, Rutgers,
                    Universityof Pennsylvania, and AVesleyan formed the Intercollegiate
                    RacingAssociation, which still flourishes and gives annual regattas.</p>
                <p>The control of amateur racing in America belongs to the National Association of
                    Amateur Oarsmen, founded in 1873, whose membership includes all the better class
                    of amateur boat clubs. Its management is vested in an Executive Committee of
                    nine members, three of whom are elected at each annual meeting of the
                    association. The rulings of this committee are subject to review, approval, or
                    reversal, at each annual meeting of the full association. This association gives
                    an annual open amateur regatta, similar to the Royal Henley Regatta in being the
                    chief aquatic event of the year, but unlike it in not being rowed always on the
                    same course, but moving about from year to year—having, since 1873, been rowed
                    at Philadelphia, Newark, Troy, and Watkins (N.Y. ), Detroit, Washington, anil
                    Boston. There are in the United States eleven regularly organized amateur rowing
                    associations, formed by the union of amateur rowing clubs and giving each year
                    one or more regattas. These associations are the National Association of Amateur
                    Oarsmen, the North-Western Amateur Rowing Association, the Mississippi Valley
                    Amateur Rowing Association, the Passaic River Amateur Rowdng Association, the
                    Intercollegiate Rowing Association, tho Harlem Regatta Association, the
                    Louisiana State Amateur Rowing Association, the Virginia State Rowing
                    Association, the Schuylkill Navy, the Upper Hudson Navy, and the Kill von Kull
                    Regatta Association. At English regattas it is usual to start three boats in a
                    heat, sometimes four, five being the utmost limit, whereas at Saratoga, in the
                    great regattas of 1874 and 1875, there were started abreast, in four separate
                    races, eleven singles (twice), thirteen coxswainless fours, and thirteen
                    coxswainless sixes.</p>
                <p>The primary division of American racing craft is into (α) lap-streaks or
                    clinkers, built of wood in narrow streaks with overlapping edges at each joint,
                    and (δ) smooth bottoms, made of wood or paper, and having a fair surface,
                    without projecting joint or seam. Lap-streak boats are, however, now rarely used
                    save in barge races. Then follows the subdivision into barges, which are open
                    inrigged boats, gigs, which are open outrigged boats, and shells, which are
                    covered outrigged boats. These three classes of boats are further subdivided, in
                    accordance with the means of propulsion, into single, double, and quadruple
                    sculling boats, and pair-, four-, six-, and eight-oared boats. In America the
                    double-scull is more frequent than the pair, and the six-oar much more common
                    than the eight-oar.</p>
                <p>The sliding seat is now being gradually superseded by various styles of rolling
                    seats, in which the actual seat travels backward aud forward on frictionless
                    wheels or balls. The best of these devices run more easily, are cleaner, and
                    less liable to accident than the ordinary sliding seat. English oarsmen use the
                    sliding seat as a means of making their old accustomed stroke longer and more
                    powerful. American oarsmen hold that what is needed by an oarsman is not the
                    addition of the long slide to the old-fashioned long swing, but the almost total
                    substitution of slide for swing, the transfer of the labour from back to legs—in
                    fact, a totally new <hi rend="superscript">τ</hi> style.</p>
