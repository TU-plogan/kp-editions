                <p><label type="entry">RUBENS</label><hi rend="smallcaps">Peter Paul</hi>
                    (1577-1610), the most eminent representative of Flemish art, and one of the
                    greatest painters of any school, was born very probably at Siegen, in
                    Westphalia, on the 29th of June 1577. Till some thirty years ago Cologne might
                    still claim the honour of having been the master’s birthplace; the Rhenish city
                    is mentioned by Rubens himself, in one of his letters, as closely connected with
                    his childhood, and through his father’s epitaph we learn that for more than
                    nineteen years Cologne was the family’s place of refuge amid the disturbances
                    prevailing in the Low Countries. This, however, has been proved to be but part
                    of the truth, and, if Rubens’s parents certainly during several years did live
                    at Cologne, they also resided elsewhere, and that for reasons so strong that
                    both wife and husband might well desire to see them for ever buried in
                    secrecy.</p>
                <p>Although of humble descent,—his father was a druggist, —John Rubens was a man of
                    learning. He had studied law at home and abroad, and became councillor and
                    alderman in his native town (1562). A Catholic by birth, it was not long before
                    he became, like many of his countrymen, a zealous upholder of the Reformation,
                    and we even find him spoken of by a contemporary as “le plus docte Calviniste
                    qui fust pour lors au Bas Pays.” After the plundering of the Antwerp churches in
                    1566, the magistrates were called upon for a justification. While openly they
                    declared themselves devoted sons of the church, a list of the followers of the
                    Reformed creed, headed by the name of Anthony Van Stralen, the burgomaster, got
                    into the hands of the duke of Alva. This was a sentence of death for the
                    magistrates, and John Rubens lost no time in quitting Spanish soil, ultimately
                    settling at Cologne (October 1568), with lιis wife and four children.</p>
                <p>In his new residence he became legal adviser to Anne of Saxony, the second wife
                    of the prince of Orange, William the Silent. Before long it was discovered that
                    their relations were not purely of a business kind. Thrown into the dungeons of
                    Dillenburg, Rubens lingered there for many months, his wife, Maria Pypelincx,
                    never relaxing her endeavours to get the undutiful husband restored to freedom.
                    Two years elapsed before the prisoner was released, and then only to be confined
                    to the small town of Siegen. Here he lived with his family, from 1573 to 1578,
                    and here most probably Maria Pypelincx gave birth to Philip, afterwards
                    town-clerk of Antwerp, and Peter Paul. A year after (May 1578) the Antwerp
                    lawyer got leave to return to Cologne, where he died on the 18th of March 1587,
                    after having, it is said, returned to Catholicism. As there are at Siegen no
                    records going back to the 16th century, the facts relating to the birth of Peter
                    Paul Rubens must, of course, remain conjectural, but his mother certainly was at
                    Siegen a few days before his birth, for we find her there, petitioning in favour
                    of John Rubens, on June 14, 1577.</p>
                <p>Rubens went to Antwerp with his mother when he was scarcely ten years of age, and
                    made good progress in his classical studies, which he had begun with the Jesuits
                    at Cologne. An excellent Latin scholar, he was also proficient in French,
                    Italian, English, German, and Dutch. Part of his boyhood he spent as a page in
                    the household of the countess of Lalaing, in Brussels; but, tradition adds, and
                    we may well believe, the youth’s disposition was such as to induce his mother to
                    allow him to follow his proper vocation, choosing as his master Tobias
                    Verhaecht, who was in some way connected with the family. Not the slightest
                    trace of this first master’s influence can be detected in Rubens’s works. Not so
                    with Adam Van Noort, to whom the young man was next apprenticed. Van Noort,
                    whose aspect of energy is well known through Van Dyck’s beautiful etching, was
                    the highly esteemed master of numerous painters,—among them Van Balen, Sebastian
                    Vrancx, and Jordaens, later his son-in-law. His pictures are almost exclusively
                    to be found in Antwerp churches.</p>
                <p>Rubens remained with Van Noort for the usual period of four years, thereafter
                    studying under Otto Voenius or Van Veen, a gentleman by birth, a most
                    distinguished Latin scholar, and a painter of very high repute. He was a native
                    of Leyden, and only recently settled in Antwerp, but the town gave him numerous
                    commissions of importance. Though Rubens never adopted his style of painting,
                    the tastes of master and pupil had much in common, and some pictures by Otto
                    Voenius can be pointed out as having inspired Rubens at a more advanced period.
                    For example, the Magdalene anointing Christ’s Feet, painted for the cathedral at
                    Malaga, and now at the Hermitage in St Petersburg, closely resembles in
                    composition the very important work of Otto Voenius in the church at Bergues
                    near Dunkirk.</p>
                <p>In 1598, Adam Van Noort acting as dean of the Antwerp guild of painters, Rubens
                    was officially recognized as “master,”—that is, was allowed to work
                    independently and receive pupils. We have no means of forming an idea of his
                    style at this early period, two years before his journey to Italy, but even the
                    somewhat later works found at Genoa, Mantua, and Rome differ considerably from
                    what may be termed the Rubenesque.</p>
                <p>From 1600 to the latter part of 1608 Rubens belonged to the household of Vincenzo
                    Gonzaga, duke of Mantua. Few princes in Italy surpassed the Gonzagas in
                    splendour. For them Mantegna, Giulio Romano, Titian, and Prima-ticcio had
                    produced some of their most admired works, and their now deserted palaces still
                    bear traces of the richest decoration. To the Mantuan collection the Pitti
                    palace, the Louvre, and the royal galleries of England owe some of their noblest
                    specimens of Italian art. How Rubens came to be engaged at Mantua has not been
                    explained. The duke, it is known, spent some time at Venice in July 1600, and is
                    supposed there to have met his future painter, but it is also to be remembered
                    that another Fleming, Francis Pourbus the younger, was at the time employed by
                    him in taking the likeness of the prettiest women of the day; and Rubens, much
                    against his will, was also, at first, it seems, intrusted with a similar task.
                    The influence of the master’s stay at Mantua was of extreme importance, and
                    cannot be too constantly kept in view in the study of his later works.</p>
                <p>Sent to Rome in 1601, to take copies from Raphael for his master, he was also
                    commissioned to paint several pictures for the church of Santa Croce, by the
                    archduke Albert of Austria, sovereign of the Spanish Netherlands, and once, when
                    he was a cardinal, the titular of that see. A copy of Mercury and Psyche after
                    Raphael is preserved in the museum at Pesth. The religious paintings—the
                    Invention of the Cross, the Crowning with Thorns, and the Crucifixion—are to be
                    found in the hospital at Grasse in Provence.</p>
                <p>At the beginning of 1603 “The Fleming,” as he was termed at Mantua, was sent to
                    Spain with a variety of presents for Philip III. and his minister the duke of
                    Lerma, and thus had opportunity to spend a whole year at Madrid and become
                    acquainted with some of Titian’s masterpieces. Two of his own works, known to
                    belong to the same period, are in the Madrid Gallery, Heraclitus and Democritus.
                    Of Rubens’s abilities so far back as 1604 we get a more complete idea from an
                    immense picture now in the Antwerp Gallery, the Baptism of Our Lord, originally
                    painted for the Jesuits at Mantua. Here it may be seen to what degree Italian
                    surroundings had <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit21newyrich/page/n53/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0921-0053-0042"/>influenced the painter of Vincenzo Gonzaga.
                    Vigorous to the extreme in design, he reminds us of Michelangelo as much as any
                    of the degenerate masters of the Roman school, while in decorative skill he
                    seems to be descended from Titian and in colouring from Giulio Romano. Equally
                    with this picture the Transfiguration, now in the museum at Nancy, and the
                    portraits of Vincenzo and his consort, kneeling before the Trinity, in the
                    library at Mantua, claim a large share of attention, apart from the interest
                    awakened by the name of their author.</p>
                <p>Two years later we meet a very large altarpiece of the Circumcision at St
                    Ambrogio at Genoa, the Virgin in a glory of Angels, and two groups of Saints,
                    painted on the wall, at both sides of the high altar in the church of Santa
                    Maria in Valicella, in Rome. Undoubtedly these works give an impression of
                    grandeur and effectiveness, but, in the immediate vicinity of the finest
                    productions of the Italian school, they rank higher as documentary evidence than
                    in intrinsic value, and remind us of a saying of Baglione, who was acquainted
                    with Rubens in Italy, “Apprese egli buon gusto, e diede in una maniera buona
                    ItaIiana.”</p>
                <p>While employed at Rome in 1608, Rubens received most alarming news as to the
                    state of his mother’s health. The duke of Gonzaga was then absent from Italy,
                    but the dutiful son, without awaiting his return, at once set out for the
                    Netherlands, though with the full intention of shortly resuming his post at
                    court, as we gather from a letter to Annibale Chieppio, the Mantuan minister.
                    When he arrived in Antwerp, Maria Pypelincx was no more. However strong his wish
                    might now be to return to Italy, his purpose was overruled by the express desire
                    of his sovereigns, Albert and Isabella, to see him take up a permanent residence
                    in the Belgian provinces. Scarcely a year before, the archduke had
                    unsuccessfully attempted to free the painter from his engagement at Mantua, and
                    he could not fail to take advantage of the opportunity now presented for the
                    fulfilment of his wishes. On August 3, 1609, Rubens was named painter in
                    ordinary to their Highnesses, with a salary of 500 livres, and “the rights,
                    honours, privileges, exemptions,” &amp;c., belonging to persons of the royal
                    household, not to speak of the gift of a gold chain. Not least in importance for
                    the painter was his complete exemption from all the regulations of the guild of
                    St Luke, entitling him to engage any scholars or fellow-workers, without being
                    obliged to have them enrolled,—a favour, it must be added, which has been the
                    source of considerable trouble to the historians of Flemish art.</p>
                <p>Although so recently returned to his native land, Rubens seems to have been, with
                    one accord, accepted by his countrymen as the head of their school, and the
                    municipality was foremost in giving him the means of proving his acquirements.
                    The first in date among the numerous repetitions of the Adoration of the Magi is
                    a picture in the Madrid Gallery, measuring 12 feet by 17, and containing no
                    fewer than eight-and-twenty life size figures, many in gorgeous attire, warriors
                    in steel armour, horsemen, slaves, camels, &lt;fcc. This picture, painted in
                    Antwerp, at the town’s expense in 1609, had scarcely remained three years in the
                    town-hall when it went to Spain as a present to Don Rodrigo Calderon, count of
                    Oliva. The painter has represented himself among the horsemen, bareheaded, and
                    wearing his gold chain. Cumberland speaks of this picture as the standard work
                    of its author, and certainly it was well calculated to bring Rubens to the front
                    rank in his profession. From a Ietterwritten in May 1611 we know that more than
                    a hundred young men were desirous to become his pupils, and that many had, “for
                    several years,” been waiting with other masters, until he could admit them to
                    his studio. It was thus from the beginning regarded as a great favour to be
                    admitted a pupil of Rubens.</p>
                <p>Apart from the success of his works, another powerful motive had helped to detain
                    the master in Antwerp,—his marriage with Isabella Brant (October 1609). Many
                    pictures have made us familiar with the graceful young woman who was for
                    seventeen years to share the master’s destinies. We meet her at The Hague, St
                    Petersburg, Florence, at Grosvenor House, but more especially at Munich, where
                    Rubens and his wife are depicted at full length on the same canvass. “His wife
                    is very handsome,” observes Sir Joshua Reynolds, “and has an agreeable
                    countenance;” but the picture, he adds, “is rather hard in manner.” This, it
                    must be noted, is the case with all those pictures known to have immediately
                    followed Rubens’s return, when he was still dependent on the assistance of
                    painters trained by others than himself. Even in the Raising of the Cross, now
                    in the Antwerp cathedral, and painted for the church of St Walburg in 1610, the
                    dryness in outline is very striking.</p>
                <p>According to the taste still at that time prevailing, the picture is tripartite,
                    but the wings only serve to develop the central composition, and add to the
                    general effect. In Witdoeck’s beautiful engraving the partitions even disappear.
                    Thus, from the first, we see Rubens quite determined upon having his own way,
                    and it is recorded that, when he painted the Descent from the Cross, St
                    Christopher, the subject chosen by the Arquebusiers, was altered so as to bring
                    the artistic expressions into better accordance with his views. Although the
                    subject was frequently repeated by the great painter, this first Descent from
                    the Cross has not ceased to be looked upon as his masterpiece. Begun in 1611,
                    the celebrated work was placed in 1614, and certainly no more striking evidence
                    could be given of the rapid growth of the author’s abilities. Rubens received
                    2400 florins for this picture.</p>
                <p>Although it is chance that has brought the Raising of the Cross and the Descent
                    from the Cross into their present close juxtaposition, it is not improbable that
                    their uniformity in size may have been designed. In many respects, Italian
                    influence remains conspicuous in the Descent. Rubens had seen Ricciarelli’s
                    fresco at the Trinita de’ Monti, and was also acquainted with the grandiose
                    picture of Baroccio in the cathedral of Perugia, and no one conversant with
                    these works can mistake their influence. But in Rubens strength of personality
                    could not be overpowered by reminiscence; and in type, as well as in colouring,
                    the Descent from the Cross may be termed thoroughly Flemish and Rubenesque. As
                    Waagen justly observes: “the boldness of the composition, the energy in the
                    characters, the striking attitudes, and the effects of the grouping, together
                    with the glowing vigorous colouring, belong to his later style, whereas a few of
                    the heads, particularly that of the Virgin, display the careful execution of his
                    earlier period. The interior of the wings, on which are painted the Visitation
                    and the Presentation in the Temple, exhibit, on the other hand, a greater
                    resemblance to the conjugal picture already alluded to, owing to a certain
                    repose in action, a more elevated expression of delicacy and feeling in the
                    characters, and a less glowing though still admirable colouring.”</p>
                <p>Legend, in some way, connects Van Dyck with the Descent from the Cross, and
                    ascribes to the great portrait painter an arm and shoulder of Mary Magdalene,
                    which had been damaged by a pupil’s carelessness. Plain truth here, once more,
                    seems to contradict romance. Van Dyck was a pupil of Van Balen’s in 1609, and
                    most probably remained with him several years before coming to Rubens.</p>
                <p>If Sir Dudley Carleton could speak of Antwerp in 1616 as “Magna civitas, magna
                    solitudo,” there was no place <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0921-0054-0043"/>period, of the existence of such a portrait.”
                    While in England, Rubens very narrowly escaped drowning while going to Greenwich
                    in a boat. The fact is reported by Lord Dorchester in a letter to Sir Isaac Wake
                    (Sainsbury, cxvi.). At the beginning of March the painter’s mission came to a
                    close.</p>
                <p>Rubens was now fifty-three years of age; he had been four years a widower, and
                    before the end of the year (December 1630) he entered into a second marriage
                    with the beautiful girl of sixteen, named Helena Fourment, with whom his
                    pictures have made the world so well acquainted. More than twenty portraits of
                    her are described by Smith, and she also figures in perhaps twice as many of the
                    master’s creations. Whether Rubens was more powerfully led in the choice of his
                    second wife by her personal beauty or by the strength of a certain resemblance
                    to his feminine ideal is questionable. Anyhow, she was an admirable model, and
                    none of her husband’s works may be more justly termed masterpieces than those in
                    which she is represented (Munich, St Petersburg, Blenheim, Liechtenstein, the
                    Louvre, &amp;c.).</p>
                <p>Although the long months of absence could not be termed blanks in Rubens’s
                    artistic career, his return was followed by an almost incredible activity.
                    Inspired more than ever by the glorious works of Titian, he now produced some of
                    his best creations. Brightness in colouring, breadth of touch and pictorial
                    conception, are specially striking in those works we know to have been painted
                    in the latter part of his lifetime. Could anything give a higher degree of
                    Rubens’s genius than, for example, the Feast of Venus, the portrait of Helena
                    Fourment ready to enter the bath, or the St Ildefonso. This last picture— now,
                    as well as the two others just alluded to, in the Vienna Gallery—was painted for
                    the church of the convent of St Jacques, in Brussels. On the wings are
                    represented the archdukes in royal attire, under the protection of their patron
                    saints. The presence of these figures has led to some mistake regarding the date
                    of the production, but it has been proved beyond doubt, through a document
                    published by Mr Castan (1884), that the St Ildefonso belongs to the series of
                    works executed after the journeys to Spain and England. Archduke Albert had been
                    dead ten years. The picture was engraved by Witdoeck in 1638.</p>
                <p>Isabella died in 1633, and we know that to the end Rubens remained in high favour
                    with her, alike as an artist and as a political agent. The painter was even one
                    of the gentlemen she deputed to meet Mary de’ Medici at the frontier in 1631,
                    after her escape from France.</p>
                <p>Spain and the Netherlands went to war again, the king never ceasing to look upon
                    the Dutch as rebels. The subject need not be dwelt upon; suffice it to say that
                    much useless trouble and suspicion came upon the great artist. As to the real
                    nature of his communings with Frederick Henry of Orange, whom he is known to
                    have interviewed, nothing as yet has been discovered.</p>
                <p>Ferdinand of Austria, the cardinal-infant of Spain, was called to the government
                    of the Netherlands on the death of his aunt. He was the king’s younger brother,
                    and arrived at Antwerp in May 1635. The streets had been decorated with
                    triumphal arches and “spectacula,” arranged by Rubens, and certainly never
                    equalled by any other works of the kind. <note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>Manysketchesof the arches are still preserved in the museums
                    of painters.” </p></note> Several of the paintings detached from the arches were
                    offered as presents to the new governor-general, a scarcely known fact, which
                    accounts for the presence of many of these works in public galleries (Vienna,
                    Dresden, Brussels, &amp;c.). Rubens was at the time laid up with gout, but
                    Prince Ferdinand was desirous of expressing his satisfaction, and called upon
                    the painter, remaining a long time at his house. Rubens and Ferdinand had met at
                    Madrid, and only a short time elapsed before the painter was confirmed in his
                    official standing,—a matter of small importance, if we consider that the last
                    years of his life were almost exclusively employed in working much more for the
                    king than for his brother. About a hundred and twenty paintings of considerable
                    size left Antwerp for Madrid in 1637, 1638, and 1639; they were intended to
                    decorate the pavilion erected at the Pardo, and known under the name of Torre de
                    la Parada. Another series had been begun, when Ferdinand wrote to Madrid that
                    the painter was no more, and Jordaens would finish the work. Rubens breathed his
                    last on the 30th of May 1640.</p>
                <p>More fortunate than many artists, Rubens left the world in the midst of his
                    glory. Not the remotest trace of approaching old age, not the slighest failing
                    of mind or skill, can be detected even in his latest works, such as the
                    Martyrdom of St Peter at Cologne, the Martyrdom of St Thomas at Prague, or the
                    Judgment of Paris at Madrid, where his young wife appears for the last time.
                    “She is the handsomest person in Antwerp,” writes Ferdinand to his brother, in
                    announcing the completion of what he terms ‘ ‘ the best painting Rubens has
                    done.”</p>
                <p>If Rubens was something of a diplomatist, it cannot be denied that alike in body
                    as in mind he is portrayed in his own works with the utmost straightforwardness.
                    His productions are what they are, as if they could not have been otherwise, and
                    the fact is that, in reply to any observations he may happen to receive, we
                    constantly find him asserting the necessities of his subjects, thus confirming a
                    remark made by Sir Joshua Reynolds that his subjects always seem to suit his
                    style.</p>
                <p>Rubens is so well known that it hardly seems necessary to dwell upon his outward
                    appearance. From his own letters and those in which he is referred to we become
                    acquainted w <hi rend="superscript">τ</hi> ith a man of vast erudition, great
                    good sense, dignity, and kindness, none more worthy of being called a gentleman;
                    and Sir Dudley Carleton, we know, termed him not only the prince of painters but
                    of gentlemen.</p>
                <p>Those with whom he dealt in questions of learning proclaim his artistic
                    excellence to be second only to his other qualifications, and even such critics
                    as Winckelmann, who are least likely to sympathize with his style, do homage to
                    his superior genius. “Rubens,” he writes to Count Cobenzl, “is the glory of art,
                    of his school, of his country, and of all coming centuries; the fertility of his
                    imagination cannot be overrated; he is correct in his design, magnificent in his
                    drapery; and he must be looked upon as the great model for chiaroscuro, although
                    in this branch he may be termed fanciful, but he has not sacrificed to the
                    goddesses of beauty (TTorae) and the Graces.”</p>
                <p>Rubens, indeed, although his type of feminine beauty is generally most pleasing,
                    has little of the Italian grace and refinement, but then he was a Fleming
                    throughout, notwithstanding his frequent recollections of those Italian masters
                    whom he most admired, and who themselves have little, if anything, in common
                    with Raphael. But it must be borne in mind how completely his predecessors were
                    frozen into stiffness through Italianization, and how necessary it was to bring
                    back the Flemish school to life and nature. Critics have spoken of Rubens’s
                    historical improprieties. Of course nobody could suppose that his classical
                    learning did not go far enough to know that the heroines of the Old Testament or
                    of Roman history were not dressed out as ladies of his time; but in this respect
                    he only follows the example of Titian, PaulVeronese, and many others. In no
                    other school do we find these animated hunts of lions, tigers, and even the
                    hippopotamus and the crocodile, which may be reckoned among the finest specimens
                    of art, and here again are life and nature displayed with the utmost power. “His
                    horses are perfect in their kind,” says Reynolds; his dogs are of the strong
                    Flemish breed, and his landscapes the most charming pictures of Braban-tine
                    scenery, in the midst of which lay his seat of Steen. As a portrait painter,
                    although less refined than Van Dyck, he show <hi rend="superscript">r</hi> s
                    that eminent master the way, and his pure fancy subjects, as the Garden of Love
                    (Madrid and Dresden) and the Village Feast (Louvre), have never been equalled.
                    As Mrs Jameson so justly</p>
                <p>_ remarks, “Rubens is the most popular because the most intelligible in Antwerp,

                    artistic enterprise. Spain and the United Provinces were for a time at peace;
                    almost all the churches had been stripped of their adornments; monastic orders
                    were powerful and richly endowed, guilds and corporations eager to show the
                    fervour of their Catholic faith, now that the “monster of heresy” seemed for
                    ever quelled. Here were opportunities without number for painters as well as
                    sculptors and architects. Gothic churches began to be decorated according to the
                    new fashion adopted in Italy. Altars magnified to monuments, sometimes reaching
                    the full height of the vaulted roof, displayed, between their twisted columns,
                    pictures of a size hitherto unknown. No master seemed better fitted to be
                    associated with this kind of painting than Rubens, whose works we have already
                    met with in churches newly erected at Rome, Genoa, and Mantua, by the Jesuits,
                    in the gorgeous style which bears their name, and which Rubens commends in the
                    preface to his <hi rend="italic">Palazzi di Genova</hi> (Antwerp, 1622). The
                    temple erected by the reverend fathers in Antwerp was almost entirely the
                    painter’s work, and if he did not, as we often find asserted, design the front,
                    he certainly was the inspirer of the whole building, which, after all, was but a
                    reminiscence of the churches in Genoa. And the temple of the Jesuits in Antwerp
                    remained for a century the only example of its kind in Belgium. Hitherto no
                    Fleming had undertaken to paint ceilings with foreshortened figures, and blend
                    the religious with the decorative art after the style of those buildings which
                    are met with in Italy, and owe their decorations to masters like Titian,
                    Veronese, and Tintoretto. No less than forty ceilings were composed by Rubens,
                    and painted under his direction in the space of two years. All were destroyed by
                    fire in 1718. Sketches in watercolour were taken some time before the disaster
                    by De Wit, and from these were made the etchings by Punt which alone enable us
                    to form a judgment of the grandiose undertaking. In the Madrid Gallery we find a
                    general view of the church in all its splendour. The present church of St
                    Charles in Antwerp is, externally, with some alteration, the building here
                    alluded to.</p>
                <p>Rubens delighted in undertakings of the vastest kind. “The large size of a
                    picture,” he writes to W. Trumbull in 1621, “gives us painters more courage to
                    represent our ideas with the utmost freedom and semblance of reality. .... I
                    confess myself to be, by a natural instinct, better fitted to execute works of
                    the largest size.” The correctness of this appreciation he was very soon called
                    upon to demonstrate most strikingly by a series of twenty-four pictures,
                    illustrating the life of Mary de’ Medici, queen-mother of France. The gallery at
                    the Luxembourg Palace, which these paintings once adorned, has long since
                    disappeared, and the complete work is now exhibited in the Louvre. Drawings, it
                    seems, had been asked from Quentin Varin, the French master who incited Poussin
                    to become a painter, but Rubens was ultimately preferred. This preference may in
                    some degree be ascribed to his former connexion with the court at Mantua, Mary
                    de’ Medici and the duchess of Gonzaga being sisters. The story of Mary de’
                    Medici may be regarded as a poem in painting, and no person conversant with the
                    literature of the time can fail to recognize that strange mixture of the sacred
                    and the mythological in which the most admired authors of the 17th century,
                    beginning with Malherbe, delight. Absolutely speaking, Mrs Jameson may be right
                    in criticizing Rubens’s “coarse allegories, historical improprieties, &lt;kc.”;
                    but a man belongs to his time, and uses its language in order to make himself
                    understood. From the crad'e to the day of her reconciliation with Louis XIII.,
                    we follow Mary de’ Medici after the manner in which it vzas customary in those
                    days to consider personages of superior rank. The Fates for her have spun the
                    silken and golden thread; Juno watches over her birth and intrusts her to the
                    town of Florence; Minerva, the Graces, and Apollo take charge of her education;
                    Love exhibits her image to the king, and Neptune conveys her across the seas;
                    Justice, Health, and Plenty endow her son; Prudence and Generosity are at her
                    sides during the regency; and, when she resigns the helm of the state to the
                    prince, Justice, Strength, Religion, and Fidelity hold the oars. The sketches of
                    all these paintings—now in the Munich Gallery—were painted in Antwerp, a
                    numerous staff of distinguished collaborators being intrusted with the final
                    execution. But the master himself spent much time in Paris, retouching the whole
                    work, which was completed within less than four years. On May 13, 1625, Rubens
                    writes from Paris to his friend Peiresc that both the queen and her son are
                    highly satisfied with his paintings, and that-Louis XIII. came on purpose to the
                    Luxembourg, “where he never has set foot since the palace was begun sixteen or
                    eighteen years ago.” We also gather from this letter that the picture
                    representing the Felicity of the Regency was painted to replace another, the
                    Departure of the Queen, which had caused some offence. “If I had been let
                    alone,” he says, “the other subjects would have been better accepted by the
                    court, and without scandal or murmur.” “And I fear,” he adds, “far greater
                    difficulties will be found with the subjects of the next gallery.” Richelieu
                    gave himself some trouble to get this part of the work, intended to represent
                    the life of Henry IV., bestowed upon Cavalier d’Arpina, but did not succeed in
                    his endeavours. The queen’s exile, however, prevented the undertaking from going
                    beyond a few sketches, and two or three panels, one of which, the Triumph of
                    Henry IV., now in the Palazzo Pitti, is one of the noblest works of Rubens or of
                    any master. Most undoubtedly the painter here calls to his aid his vivid
                    recollections of the Triumph of Caesar by Mantegna, now at Hampton Court, but in
                    his day adorning the palace at Mantua; of this he made a copy, inscribed No. 315
                    in the catalogue of his effects sold in 1640, and now in the National
                    Gallery.</p>
                <p>On the Ilth of May 1625 Rubens was present at the nuptials of Henrietta Maria at
                    Notre Dame in Paris, when the scaffolding on which he stood gave way, and he
                    tells us he was just able to catch an adjoining tribune.</p>
                <p>No painter in Europe could now pretend to equal Rubens either in talent or in
                    renown. Month after month productions of amazing size left the Antwerp studio;
                    and to those unacquainted with the master’s pictures magnificent engravings by
                    Vorsterman, Pontius, and others had conveyed singularly striking
                    interpretations. “Whatever work of his I may require,” writes Moretus, the
                    celebrated Antwerp printer, “I have to ask him six months before, so as that he
                    may think of it at leisure, and do the work on Sundays or holidays; no week days
                    of his could I pretend to get under a hundred florins.”</p>
                <p>Of the numerous creations of his pencil, none, perhaps, will more thoroughly
                    disclose to us his comprehension of religious decorative art than the Assumption
                    of the Virgin at the high altar of the Antwerp cathedral, finished in 1625. It
                    is, of twenty repetitions of this subject, the only example still preserved at
                    the place it was intended by the painter to occupy. In spirit we are here
                    reminded of Titian’s Assunta in the cathedral at Verona, but Rubens’s proves
                    perhaps a higher conception of the subject. The work is seen a considerable way
                    off, and every outline is bathed in light, so that the Virgin is elevated to
                    dazzling glory with a power of ascension, scarcely, if ever, attained by any
                    master.</p>
                <p>Able to rely so greatly on his power as a colourist, Rubens is not a mere
                    decorator. He penetrates into the <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0921-0056-0045"/>spirit of his subjects more deeply than, at first
                    sight, seems consistent with his prodigious facility in execution. The Massacre
                    of the Innocents, in the Munich Gallery, is a composition that can leave no
                    person unmoved,—mothers defending their children with nails and teeth. If Mrs
                    Jameson terms this picture atrocious, it ought to be recollected how atrocious
                    is the subject. When St Francis attempts to shelter the universe from the
                    Saviour’s wrath (Brussels Gallery), Rubens, drawing his inspiration from a
                    passage of St Germain, “Ostendit mater filio pectus et ubera,” recalls to our
                    memory that most dramatic passage of the <hi rend="italic">Iliad</hi> when
                    Hecuba, from the walls of Troy, entreats her son Hector to spare his life. The
                    subject is inconsistent with the spirit of Christianity, says Waagen, evidently
                    forgetting that to Catholic eyes nothing could be more impressive than the
                    Virgin’s intervention at this supreme moment, when Christ, like another Jupiter,
                    brandishes his thunderbolt against mankind. Rubens was a man of his time; his
                    studies of Italian art in no way led him back to the Quattrocentisti nor the
                    Raffae-Ieschi; their power was at an end. The influence of Michelangelo, Titian,
                    Tintoretto, more especially Baroccio, Polydoro, and even Parmigiano, is no less
                    visible with him than with those masters who, like Spranger, Chr. Schwartz, and
                    Goltzius, stood high in public estimation immediately before his advent.</p>
                <p>In the midst of the rarest activity as a painter, Rubens was now called upon to
                    give proofs of a very different kind of ability. The truce concluded between
                    Spain and the Netherlands in 1609 ended in 1621; archduke Albert died the same
                    year. His widow sincerely wished to prolong the arrangement, still hoping to see
                    the United Provinces return to the Spanish dominion, and in her eyes Rubens was
                    the fittest person to bring about this conclusion. The painter’s comings and
                    goings, however, did not remain unheeded, for the French ambassador writes from
                    Brussels in 1624,—“Rubens is here to take the likeness of the prince of Poland,
                    by order of the infanta. I am persuaded he will succeed better in this than in
                    his negotiations for the truce.” But, if Rubens was to fail in his efforts to
                    bring about an arrangement with the Netherlands, other events enabled him to
                    render great service to the state.</p>
                <p>Rubens and Buckingham met in Paris iu 1625; a correspondence of some importance
                    had been going on between the painter and the Brussels court, and before long it
                    was proposed that he should endeavour to bring about a final arrangement between
                    the crowns of England and Spain. The infanta willingly consented, and King
                    Philip, who much objected to the interference of an artist, gave way on hearing,
                    through his aunt, that the negotiator on the English side, B. Gerbier—a Fleming
                    by birth—was likewise a painter. Rubens and Gerbier very soon met in Holland.
                    “Rubens is come hither to Holland, where he now is, and Gerbier in his company,
                    walking from town to town, upon their pretence of pictures,” writes Sir
                    DudleyCarleton to Lord Conwayin July 1627, “which may serve him for a few days
                    if he dispatch and be gone; but yf he entertayne tyme here long, he will
                    infallibly be Iayd hold of, or sent with disgrace out of the country .... This I
                    have made known to Rubens least he should meet with a skorne what may in some
                    sort reflect upon others.” Matters, however, went on very well, and Rubens
                    volunteered to go to Spain and lay before the council the result of his
                    negotiations (1628). Nine months were thus spent at Madrid; they rank among the
                    most important in Rubens’s career. He had brought with him eight pictures of
                    various sizes and subjects as presents from the infanta, and he was also
                    commissioned to take several portraits of the king and royal family. An
                    equestrian picture of Philip IV., destroyed by fire in last century, became the
                    subject of a poem by Lope de Vega, and the description enables us to identify
                    the composition with that of a painting now in the Palazzo Pitti, ascribed to
                    Velazquez.</p>
                <p>Through a letter to Peiresc we hear of the familiar intercourse kept up between
                    the painter and the king. Philip delighted to see Rubens at work in the studio
                    prepared for him in the palace, where he not only left many original pictures,
                    but copied for his own pleasure and profit the best of Titian’s. No less than
                    forty works were thus produced, and, says the author of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Annals of the Artists of Spain,</hi> “the unwearied activity of his well-stored
                    mind is exemplified by the fact that amid his many occupations he was seeking in
                    the libraries materials for an edition of Marcus Aurelius, on which his friend
                    Gaspard Gevaerts was then engaged.” An artistic event of some importance
                    connected with the sojourn in Spain is the meeting of Rubens and Velazquez, to
                    the delight, and we venture to add, advantage of both.</p>
                <p>Great as was the king’s admiration of Rubens as a painter, it seems to have been
                    scarcely above the value attached to his political services. Far from looking
                    upon Rubens as a man of inferior calling, unworthy to meddle with matters of
                    state, he now commissioned the painter to go to London as bearer of his views to
                    Charles I. Giving up his long cherished hope of revisiting Italy on his return
                    from Spain, Rubens, honoured with the title of secretary of the king’s privy
                    council in the Netherlands, started at once on his new mission. Although he
                    stopped but four days in Antwerp, he arrived in London just as peace had been
                    concluded with France. In this conjuncture of affairs, it can hardly be doubted
                    that the eminent position of Rubens as a painter greatly contributed to his
                    ultimate success as an envoy. Received by Charles with genuine pleasure, he very
                    soon was able to ingratiate himself so far as to induce the king to pledge his
                    royal word to take part in no undertakings against Spain so long as the
                    negotiations remained unconcluded, and all the subsequent endeavours of France,
                    Venice, and the States found him immovable in this resolution. Although the
                    privy council in Madrid, as well they might, passed several votes of thanks to
                    Rubens, the tardiness of the Spanish court in sending a regular ambassador
                    involved the unfortunate painter in distressing anxieties, and the tone of his
                    dispatches is very bitter. But he speaks with the greatest admiration of England
                    and the English, regretting that he should only have come to know the country so
                    late. His popularity must have been very great, for on September 23, 1629, the
                    university of Cambridge conferred upon him the honorary degree of master of
                    arts, and on February 21, 1630, he was knighted, the king presenting him with
                    the sword used at the ceremony, which is still preserved by the descendants of
                    the artist.</p>
                <p>When the council at Madrid had to deliberate as to recognition of the title
                    conferred upon Rubens in England, they remembered that Titian had been made a
                    knight by the emperor Charles V., and the matter was settled without difficulty;
                    but, the painter’s name having been mentioned as a possible envoy to the British
                    court, Olivares objected that it was quite out of the question to make an
                    ambassador of one who lived by the work of his hands.</p>
                <p>Although, it seems, less actively employed as an artist in England than in Spain,
                    Rubens, besides his sketches for the decoration of the Banqueting House at
                    Whitehall, painted the admirable picture of the Blessings of Peace, now in the
                    National Gallery. There is no reason to doubt, with Smith, that “His Majesty sat
                    to him for his portrait, yet it is not a little remarkable that no notice occurs
                    in any of the royal catalogues, or the writers of the <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit21newyrich/page/n57/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0921-0057-0046"/>of Seneca, the only copy of which is in the Print
                    Room at the British Museum, anil a beautiful figure of St Catherine, we can
                    admit none of the other plates, said to proceed from Rubens, as authentic.
                    Rubens nevertheless exercised an immense influence on the art of engraving.
                    Under his direct guidance Soutman, Vorstennan, Pontius, Witdoeck, the two
                    Bolswerts, Peterde JodeN. Lauwers, and many others of less note left an immense
                    number of beautiful plates, reproducing the most celebrated of his paintings. To
                    give an idea of what his influence was capable of accomplishing, Pictorially
                    speaking, it might be sufficient to notice the transformation undergone by the
                    Antwerp school of engraving under Kubens; even the modern school of engraving,
                    in more than one respect, is a continuation of the style first practised in
                    Antwerp. His influence is scarcely less apparent in sculpture, and the
                    celebrated Luke Fayd’herbe was his pupil.</p>
                <p>Neither in name nor in fact did the Flemish school ever find a second Rubens.
                    None of his four sons became a painter, nor did any of his three daughters marry
                    an artist. According to Rubens’s will, his drawings were to belong to that one
                    of his sons who might become a painter, or in the event of one of his daughters
                    marrying a celebrated artist they were to be her portion. The valuable
                    collection was dispersed only in 16δ9, and of the pictures sold in 1640
                    thirty-two became the property of the king of Spain. The Madrid Gallery alone
                    possesses a hundred of his works. Four years after her husband’s death Helena
                    Fourment married J. B. Van Brouckhoven de Bergheyck, knight of St James, member
                    of the privy council, &lt;kc. She died in 1673. In 1746 the male line of
                    Rubens’s descendants was completely extinct. In the female line more than a
                    hundred families of name in Europe trace their descent from him.</p>
                <p>The paintings of Rubens are found in all the principal galleries in Europe:
                    Antwerp and Brussels, Madrid, Paris, Lille, Dresden, Berlin, Munich, Vienna, St
                    Petersburg, London, Florence, Milan, Turin exhibit several hundreds of his
                    works. J. Smith’s <hi rend="italic">Cedalogice</hi> gives descriptions of more
