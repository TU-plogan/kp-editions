                    (1712-1778), was born at Geneva on the 28th June.1712. His family had
                    established themselves in that city at the time of the religious wars, but tlιey
                    were of pure French origin. Rousseau’s father Isaac was a watchmaker; his
                    mother, Suzanne Bernard, was the daughter of a minister; she died in childbirth,
                    and Rousseau, who was the second son, was brought up in a very haphazard
                    fashion, his father being a dissipated, violent-tempered, and foolish person.
                    He, however, taught him to read early, and seems to have laid the foundation of
                    the flighty sentimentalism in morals and politics which Rousseau afterwards
                    illustrated with his genius. When the boy was ten years old his father got
                    entangled in a disgraceful brawl and fled from Geneva, apparently without
                    troubling himself about Jean Jacques. The father and son had little more to do
                    with each other and rarely met. Rousseau was, however, taken charge of <pb

                    xml:id="kp-eb0921-0035-0024"/>by his mother’s relations and was in the first
                    place committed by them to the tutorship of a M. Lambercier, pastor at Bossey.
                    Of these times as of the greater part of his life there are ample details in the
                    <hi rend="italic">Confessions,</hi> but it may be as well to remark at once that
                    this famous book, however charming as literature, is to be used as documentary
                    evidence only with great reserve. In 1724 he was removed from this school and
                    taken into the house of his uncle Bernard, by whom he was shortly afterwards
                    apprenticed to a notary. His master, however, found or thought him quite
                    incapable and sent him back. After a short time (April 25, 1725) he was
                    apprenticed afresh, this time to an engraver. He did not dislike the work, but
                    was or thought himself cruelly treated by his master. At last in 1728, when he
                    was sixteen, he ran away, the truancy being by his own account unintentional in
                    the first instance, and due to the fact of the city gates being shut earlier
                    than usual. Then began a very extraordinary series of wanderings and adventures,
                    for much of which there is no authority but his own. He first fell in with some
                    proselytizers of the Roman faith at Confignon in Savoy, and by them he was sent
                    to Madame de Warens at Annecy, a young and pretty widow who was herself a
                    convert. Her influence, however, which was to be so great, was not immediately
                    exercised, and he was, so to speak, passed on to Turin, where there was an
                    institution specially devoted to the reception of neophytes. His experiences
                    here were (according to his own account, it must always be understood)
                    sufficiently unsatisfactory, but he abjured duly and was rewarded by being
                    presented with twenty francs and sent about his business. He wandered about in
                    Turin for some time, and at last established himself as footman to a Madame de
                    Vercellis. Here occurred the famous incident of the theft of a ribbon, of which
                    he accused a fellow servant—a girl too. But, though he kept his place by this
                    piece of cowardice, Madame de Vercellis died not long afterwards and he was
                    turned off. He found, however, another place with the Comte de Gouvon, but lost
                    this also through coxcombry. Then he resolved to return to Madame de Warens at
                    Annecy. The chronology of all these events is somewhat obscure, but they seem to
                    have occupied about three years.</p>
                <p>Even then Rousseau did not settle at once in the anomalous but to him charming
                    position of domestic lover to this lady, who, nominally a converted Protestant,
                    was in reality, as many women of her time were, a kind of deist, with a theory
                    of noble sentiment and a practice of libertinism tempered by good nature. It
                    used to be held that in her conjugal relations she was even more sinned against
                    than sinning. But recent investigations seem to show that M. de Vuarrens (which
                    is said to be the correct spelling of the name) was a very unfortunate husband,
                    and was deserted and robbed by his wife. However, she welcomed Rousseau kindly,
                    thought it necessary to complete his education, and he was sent to the
                    seminarists of St Lazare to be improved in classics, and also to a music master.
                    In one of his incomprehensible freaks he set off for Lyons, and, after
                    abandoning his companion in an epileptic fit, returned to Annecy to find Madame
                    de Warens gone no one knew whither. Then for some months he relapsed into the
                    life of vagabondage, varied by improbable adventures, which (according to his
                    own statement) he so often pursued. Hardly knowing anything of music, he
                    attempted to give lessons and a concert at Lausanne; and he actually taught at
                    Neuchâtel. Then he became or says he became secretary to a Greek archimandrite
                    who was travelling in Switzerland to collect subscriptions for the rebuilding of
                    the Holy Sepulchre; then he went to Paris, and, with recommendations from the
                    French ambassador at Soleure, saw something of good society; then he returned on
                    foot through Lyons to Savoy, hearing that Madame de Warens was at Chambéry. This
                    was in 1732, and Rousseau, who for a time had unimportant employments in the
                    service of the Sardinian crown, <hi rend="superscript">-</hi> was shortly
                    installed by Madame de Warens, whom he still called Maman, as <hi rend="italic"
                    >amant en titre</hi> in her singular household, wherein she diverted herself
                    with him, with music, and with chemistry. In 1736 Madame de Warens, partly for
                    Rousseau’s health, took a country house, Les Charmettes, a short distance from
                    Chambéry. Here in summer, and in the town during winter, Rousseau led a
                    delightful life, which he has delightfully described. In a desultory way he did
                    a good deal of reading, but in 1738 his health again became bad, and he was
                    recommended to go to Montpellier. By his own account this journey to Montpellier
                    was in reality a <hi rend="italic">voyage à Cythere</hi> in company with a
                    certain Madame de Larnage. This being so, he could hardly complain when on
                    returning he found that his official position in Madame de Warens’s household
                    had been taken by a person named Vintzenried. He was, however, less likely than
                    most men to endure the position of second in command, and in 1740 he became
                    tutor at Lyons to the children of M. de Mably, not the well-known writer of that
                    name, but his and Condillac’s elder brother. But Rousseau did not like teaching
                    and was a bad teacher, and after a visit to Les Charmettes, finding that his
                    place there was finally occupied, he once more went to Paris in 1741. He was not
                    "without recommendations. But a new system of musical notation which he thought
                    he had discovered was unfavourably received by the Académie des Sciences, where
                    it was read in August 1742, and he was unable to obtain pupils. Madame Dupin,
                    however, to whose house he had obtained the entry, procured him the honourable
                    if not very lucrative post of secretary to M. de Montaigu, ambassador at Venice.
                    With him he stayed for about eighteen months, and has as usual infinite
                    complaints to make of his employer and some strange stories to tell. At length
                    he threw up his situation and returned to Paris (1745).</p>
                <p>Up to this time—that is to say, till his thirty-third year— Rousseau’s life,
                    though continuously described by himself, was of the kind called subterranean,
                    and the account of it must be taken with considerable allowances. There are, to
                    say the least, grave improbabilities in it; there are some chronological
                    difficulties; and in one or two instances his accounts have been flatly denied
                    by persons more or less entitled to be heard. He had written nothing, and if he
                    was known at all it was as an eccentric vagabond. From this time, however, he is
                    more or less in view; and, though at least two events of his life—his quarrel
                    with Diderot and his death—are and are likely long to be subjects of dispute,
                    its general history can be checked and followed with reasonable confidence. On
                    his return to Paris he renewed his relations with the Dupin family and with the
                    literary group of Diderot, to which he had already been introduced by M. de
                    Mably’s letters. He had an opera, <hi rend="italic">Les Muses Galantes,</hi>
                    privately represented; he copied music for money, and received from Madame Dupin
                    and her son-in-law M. de Francueil a small but regular salary as secretary. He
                    lived at the Hotel St Quentin for a time, and once more arranged for himself an
                    equivocal domestic establishment. His mistress, whom towards the close of his
                    life he married after a fashion, was Thérèse le Vasseur, a servant at the inn.
                    She had little beauty, no education or understanding, and few charms of any kind
                    that his friends could discover, besides which she had a detestable mother, who
                    was the bane of Rousseau’s life. But he made himself at any rate for a time
                    quite happy with her, and (according to Rousseau’s account, the accuracy of <pb
                    break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit21newyrich/page/n36/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0921-0036-0025"/>which has been questioned) five children were born
                    to them, who were all consigned to the foundling hospital. This disregard of
                    responsibility was partly punished by the use his critics made of it when he
                    became celebrated as a writer on education and a preacher of the domestic
                    affections. Diderot, with whom he became more and more familiar, admitted him as
                    a contributor to the <hi rend="italic">Encyclopédie.</hi> He formed new musical
                    projects, and he was introduced by degrees to many people of rank and influence,
                    among whom his warmest patron for a time was Madame d’Épinay. It was not,
                    however, till 1749 that Rousseau made his mark. The academy of Dijon offered a
                    prize for an essay on the effect of the progress of civilization on morals.
                    Rousseau took up the subject, developed his famous paradox of the superiority of
                    the savage state, won the prize, and, publishing his essay next year, became
                    famous. The anecdotage as to the origin of this famous essay is voluminous. It
                    is agreed that the idea was suggested when Rousseau went to pay a visit to
                    Diderot, who was in prison at Vincennes for his <hi rend="italic">Lettre sur les
                    Aveugles.</hi> Rousseau says he thought of the paradox on his way down; Morellet
                    and others say that he thought of treating the subject in the ordinary fashion
                    and was laughed at by Diderot, who showed him the advantages of the less obvious
                    treatment. Diderot himself, who in such matters is almost absolutely
                    trustworthy, does not claim the suggestion, but uses words which imply that it
                    was at least partly his. It is very like him. The essay, however, took the
                    artificial and crotchety society of the day by storm. Francueil gave Rousseau a
                    valuable post as cashier in the receiver general’s office. But he resigned it
                    either from conscientiousness, or crotchet, or nervousness at responsibility, or
                    indolence, or more probably from a mixture of all four. He went back to his
                    music copying, but the salons of the day were determined to have his society,
                    and for a time they had it. In 1752 he brought out at Fontainebleau an operetta)
                    <hi rend="italic">Devindu Village,</hi> which was very successful. He received a
                    hundred louis for it, and he was ordered to come to court next day. This meant
                    the certainty of a pension. But Rousseau’s shyness or his perversity (as before,
                    probably both) made him disobey the command. His comedy <hi rend="italic"
                    >Narcisse,</hi> written long before, was also acted, but unsuccessfully. In the
                    same year, however, a letter <hi rend="italic">Sur la Musique Française</hi>
                    again had a great vogue. <note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"
                    ><p>Rousseau’s influence on French music was greater than might have been
                    expected from his very imperfect education; in truth, he was a musician by
                    natural instinct only, but his feeling for art was very strong, and, though
                    capricious, based upon true perceptions of the good and beautiful. The system of

                    their attachment to the Italian “opera buffa,” as opposed to the true French

                    published in 1753, he indulged in a violent tirade against French music, which
                    he declared to be so contemptible as to lead to the conclusion “that the French

                <p>year with him, the Dijon academy, which had founded his fame, announced the
                    subject of “The Origin of Inequality,” on which he wrote a discourse which was
                    unsuccessful, but at least equal to the former in merit. During a visit to
                    Geneva in 1754 Rousseau saw his old friend and love Madame de Warens (now
                    reduced in circumstances and having lost all her charms), while after abjuring
                    his abjuration of Protestantism he was enabled to take up his freedom as citizen
                    of Geneva, to which his birth entitled him and of which he was proud. Some time
                    afterwards, returning to Paris, he accepted a cottage near Montmorency (the
                    celebrated Hermitage) which Madame d’Épinay had fitted up for him, and
                    established himself there in April 1756. He spent little more than a year there,
                    but it was a very important year. Here he wrote <hi rend="italic">La Nouvelle
                    Heldise</hi>; here he indulged in the passion which that novel partly
                    represents, his love for Madame d’Houdetot, sister-in-law of Madame d’Épinay, a
                    lady still young and extremely amiable but very plain, who had a husband and a
                    lover (St Lambert), and whom Rousseau’s burning devotion seems to have partly
                    pleased and partly annoyed. Here too arose the incomprehensible triangular
                    quarrel between Diderot, Rousseau, and Grimm which ended Rousseau’s sojourn at
                    the Hermitage. It is impossible to discuss this at length here. The supposition
                    least favourable to Rousseau is that it was due to one of his numerous fits of
                    half-insane petulance and indignation at the obligations which he was
                    nevertheless always ready to incur. That most favourable to him is that he was
                    expected to lend himself in a more or less complaisant manner to assist and
                    cover Madame d’Épinay’s adulterous affection for Grimm. It need only be said
                    that Madame d’Épinay’s morals and Rousseau’s temper are equally indefensible by
                    anyone who knows anything about either, but that the evidence as to the exact
                    influence of both on this particular transaction is hopelessly inconclusive.
                    Diderot seems to have been guilty of nothing but thoughtlessness (if of that) in
                    lending himself to a scheme of the Le Vasseurs, mother and daughter, for getting
                    Rousseau out of the solitude of the Hermitage. At any rate Rousseau quitted the
                    Hermitage in the winter, and established himself at Montlouis in the
                    neighbourhood.</p>
                <p>Hitherto Rousseau’s behaviour had frequently made him enemies, but his writings
                    had for the most part made him friends. The quarrel with Madame d’Épinay, with
                    Diderot, and through them with the philosophe party reversed this. In 1758
                    appeared his <hi rend="italic">Lettre à d’Alembert contre les Spectacles,</hi>
                    written in the winter of the previous year at Montlouis. This was at once an
                    attack on Voltaire, who was giving theatrical representations at Les Délices, on
                    D’Alembert, who had condemned the prejudice against the stage in the <hi
                    rend="italic">Encyclopedic,</hi> and on one of the favourite amusements of the
                    society of the day. Diderot personally would have been forgiving enough. But
                    Voltaire’s strong point was not forgiveness, and, though Rousseau no doubt
                    exaggerated the efforts of his “enemies,” he was certainly henceforward as
                    obnoxious to the philo<pb break="no"

                    however, had no lack of patrons—lie never had—though his unsurpassable
                    perversity made him quarrel with all in turn. The amiable duke and duchess of
                    Luxembourg, who were his neighbours at Montlouis, made his acquaintance, or
                    rather forced theirs upon him, and he was eagerly industrious in his literary
                    work—indeed most of his best books were produced during his stay in the
                    neighbourhood of Montmorency. A letter to Voltaire on his poem about the Lisbon
                    earthquake embittered the dislike between the two, being surreptitiously
                    published. <hi rend="italic">La Nouvelle Heloise</hi> appeared in the same year
                    (1760), and it was immensely popular. In 1662 appeared the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Contrat Social</hi> at Amsterdam, and <hi rend="italic">Émile,</hi> which was
                    published both in the Low Countries and at Paris. For the latter the author
                    received 6000 livres, for the <hi rend="italic">Contrat</hi> 1000.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Julie, ou La Nouvelle Heldise,</hi> is a novel λvritten in
                    letters describing the loves of a man of low position and a girl of rank, her
                    subsequent marriage to a respectable freethinker of her own station, the mental
                    agonies of her lover, and the partial appeasing of the distresses of the lovers
                    by the influence of noble sentiment and the good offices of a philanthropic
                    Englishman. It is too long, the sentiment is overstrained, and severe moralists
                    have accused it of a certain complaisance in dealing with amatory errors; but it
                    is full of pathos and knowledge of the human heart. The <hi rend="italic"
                    >Contrat Social,</hi> as its title implies, endeavours to base all government on
                    the consent, direct or implied, of the governed, and indulges in much ingenious
                    argument to get rid of the practical inconveniences of such a suggestion. <hi

                    novel, though a certain amount of narrative interest is kept up throughout.</p>
                <p>Rousseau’s reputation was now higher than ever, but the term of the comparative
                    prosperity which he had enjoyed foe nearly ten years was at hand. The <hi
                    rend="italic">Contrat Social</hi> was obviously anti-monarchic; the <hi
                    rend="italic">Nouvelle Heldise</hi> was said to be immoral; the sentimental
                    deism of the “Profession du vicaire Savoyard” in <hi rend="italic">Emile</hi>
                    irritated equally the philosophe party and the church. On June 11, 1662, <hi
                    rend="italic">Emile</hi> was condemned by the parlement of Paris, and two days
                    previously Madame de Luxembourg and the Prince de Conti gave the author
                    information that he would be arrested if he did not fly. They also furnished him
                    with means of flight, and he made for Yverdun in the territory of Bern, whence
                    he transferred himself to Motiers in Neuchâtel, which then belonged to Prussia.
                    Frederick II. was not indisposed to protect the persecuted when it cost him
                    nothing aud might bring him fame, and in Marshal Keith, the governor of
                    Neuchâtel, Rousseau found a true and firm friend. He was, however, unable to be
                    quiet or to practise any of those more or less pious frauds which, were
                    customary at the time with the unorthodox. . The archbishop of Paris had
                    published a pastoral against him, and Rousseau did not let the year pass without
                    a <hi rend="italic">Lettre à M. de Beaumont.</hi> The council of Geneva had
                    joined in the condemnation of <hi rend="italic">Emile,</hi> and Rousseau first
                    solemnly renounced his citizenship, and then, in the <hi rend="italic">Lettres
                    de la Montagne</hi> (1763), attacked the council and the Genevan constitution
                    unsparingly. AU this excited public opinion against him, and gradually he grew
                    unpopular in his own neighbourhood. This unpopularity is said on very uncertain
                    authority to have culminated in a nocturnal attack on his house, which reminds
                    the reader remarkably of an incident in the life of the greatest French man of
                    letters of the present century. At any rate he thought he was menaced if he was
                    not, and migrated to the île St Pierre in the Lake of Bienne, where he once more
                    for a short, and the last, time enjoyed that idyUic existence which he loved.
                    But the Bernese Government ordered him to quit its territory. He was for some
                    time uncertain where to go, and thought of Corsica (to join Paoli) and Berhn.
                    But finally David Hume offered him, late in 1765, an asylum in England, and he
                    accepted. He passed through Paris, where his presence w ’ as tolerated for a
                    time, and landed in England on January 13, 1766. Thérèse travelled separately,
                    and was entrusted to the charge of James Boswell, who had already made
                    Rousseau’s acquaintance. Here he had once more a chance of settling peaceably.
                    Severe English moralists like Johnson thought but ill of him, but the public
                    generally was not unwilling to testify against French intolerance, and regarded
                    his sentimentalism with favour. He was lionized in London to his heart’s content
                    and discontent, for it may truly be said of Rousseau that he was equally
                    indignant at neglect and intolerant of attention. When, after not a few displays
                    of his strange humour, he professed himself tired of the capital, Hume procured
                    him a country abode in the house of Mr Davenport at Wootton in Derbyshire. Here,
                    though the place w ’ as bleak and lonely, he might have been happy enough, and
                    he actually employed himself in writing the greater part of his <hi
                    rend="italic">Confessiotis.</hi> But his habit of self-tormenting and tormenting
                    others never left him. His own caprices interposed some delay in the conferring
                    of a pension which George III. was induced to grant him, and he took this as a
                    crime of Hume’s. The publication of a spiteful letter (really by Horace Walpole,
                    one of whose worst deeds it was) in the name of the king of Prussia made
                    Rousseau believe that plots of the most terrible kind were on foot against him.
                    Finally he quarrelled with Hume because the latter would not acknowledge all his
                    own friends and Rousseau’s supposed enemie3 of the philosophe circle to be
                    rascals. He remained, however, at Wootton during the year and through the
                    winter. In May 1767 he fled to France, addressing letters to the lord chancellor
                    and to General Conway, which can only be described as the letters of a lunatic.
                    He was received in France by the Marquis de Mirabeau (father of the great
                    Mirabeau), of whom he soon had enough, then by the Prince de Conti at Trye. From
                    this place he again fled and wandered about for some time in a wretched fashion,
                    still writing the <hi rend="italic">Confessions,</hi> constantly receiving
                    generous help, and always quarrelling with, or at least suspecting, the helpers.
                    In the summer of 1770 he returned to Paris, resumed music copying, and was on
                    the whole happier than he had been since he had to leave Montlouis. He had by
                    this time married Thérèse le Vasseur, or had at least gone through some form of
                    marriage with her.</p>
                <p>Many of the best-known stories of Rousseau’s life date from this last time, when
                    he was tolerably accessible to visitors, though clearly half-insane. He finished
                    his <hi rend="italic">Confessions,</hi> wrote his <hi rend="italic"
                    >Dialogues</hi> (the interest of which is not quite equal to the promise of
                    their curious sub-title <hi rend="italic">Rousseau juge de Jean Jacques),</hi>
                    and began his <hi rend="italic">Reveries du Promeneur Solitaire,</hi> intended
                    as a sequel and complement to the <hi rend="italic">Confessions,</hi> and one of
                    the best of all his books. It should be said that besides these, which complete
                    the list of his principal works, he has left a very large number of minor w <hi
                    rend="superscript">τ</hi> orks and a considerable correspondence. During this
                    time he lived in the Rue Platière, which is now named after him. But his
                    suspicions of secret enemies grew stronger rather than weaker, and at the
                    beginning of 1778 he was glad to accept the offer of M. de Girardin, a rich
                    financier, and occupy a cottage at Ermenonville. The country w <hi
                    rend="superscript">τ</hi> as beautiful; but his old terrors revived, and his
                    woes were complicated by the alleged inclination of Thérèse for one of M. de
                    Girardin’s stable boys. On July 2d he died in a manner which has been much
                    discussed, sus<pb break="no"

                    been frequent. On the whole the theory of a natural death due to a fit of
                    apoplexy and perhaps to injuries inflicted accidentally during that fit seems
                    most probable. He had always sufiered from internal and constitutional ailments
                    not unlikely to bring about such an end.</p>
                <p>Rousseau’s character, the history of his reputation, and the intrin si P. value
                    of his literary work are all subjects of much interest. There is little doubt
                    that for the last ten or fifteen years of his life, if not from the time of his
                    quarrel with Diderot and Madame d’Épinay, he was not wholly sane—the combined
                    influence of late and unexpected literary fame and of constant solitude and
                    discomfort acting upon his excitable temperament so as to overthrow the balance,
                    never very stable, of his fine and acute but unrobust intellect. He was by no
                    means the only man of letters of his time who'had to submit to something like
                    persecution. Freron on the orthodox side had his share of it, as well as
                    Voltaire, Helvétius, Diderot, and Montesquieu on that of the innovators. But
                    Rousseau had not, like Montesquieu,.a position which guaranteed him from serious
                    danger; he was not wealthy like Helvétius; he had not the wonderful suppleness
                    and trickiness which even without his wealth would probably have defended
                    Voltaire himself; and he lacked entirely the “bottom” of Fréron and Diderot.
                    When he was molested he could only shriek at his enemies and suspect his
                    friends, and, being more given than any man whom Iiistorymentions to this latter
                    weakness, lie suffered intensely from it. His moral character was undoubtedly
                    weak in other ways than this, but it is fair to remember that but for his
                    astounding <hi rend="italic">Confessions</hi> the more disgusting parts of it
                    would not have been known, and that these <hi rend="italic">Confesswns</hi> were
                    written, if not under hallucination, at any rate in circumstances entitling the
                    self-condemned criminal to the benefit of very considerable doubt. If Rousseau
                    had held his tongue, he might have stood lower as a man of letters; he would
                    pretty certainly have stood higher as a man. He was, moreover, really sinned
                    against, if still more sinning. The conduct of Grimm to him was certainly very
                    bad; and, though Walpole was not his personal friend, a worse action than his
                    famous letter, considering the well-known idiosyncrasy of the subject, would be
                    difficult to find. It was his own fault that he saddled himself with the Le
                    Vasseurs, but their conduct was probably if not certainly ungrateful in the
                    extreme. Only excuses can be made for him; but the excuses for a man born, as
                    Hume after the quarrel said of him, “without a skin” are numerous and
                    strong.</p>
                <p>It was to be expected that his peculiar reputation would increase rather than
                    diminish after his death; and it did so. During his life his personal
                    peculiarities and the fact that his opinions were nearly as obnoxious to the one
                    party as to the other worked against him, but it was not so after his death. The
                    men of the Revolution regarded him with something like idolatry, and his
                    literary merits conciliated many who were very far from idolizing him as a
                    revolutionist. His style was taken up by Bernardin de Saint Pierre and by
                    Chateaubriand. It was employed for purposes quite different from those to which
                    he had himself applied it, and the reaction triumphed by the very arms which had
                    been most powerful in the hands of the Revolution. Byron’s fervid panegyric
                    enlisted on his side all who admired Byron—that is to say, the majority of the
                    younger men and women of Europe between 1820 and 1850—and thus different sides
                    of his tradition were continued for a full century after the publication of his
                    chief books. His religious unorthodox}* was condoned because he never scoffed;
                    his political heresies, after their first effect was over, seemed harmless from
                    the very want of logic and practical spirit in them, while part at least of his
                    literary secret was the common property of almost everyone who attempted
                    literature. At the present day persons as different as M. Renan and Mr Ruskin
                    are children of Rousseau.</p>
                <p>It is therefore important to characterize this influence which was and is so
                    powerful, and there are three points of view—those of religion, politics, and
                    literature—which it is necessary to take in doing this. In religion Rousseau was
                    undoubtedly what he has been called above—a sentimental deist; but no one who
                    reads him with the smallest attention can fail to see that sentimentalism was
                    the essence, deism the accident of his creed. In his time orthodoxy at once
                    generous and intelligent hardly existed in France. There were ignorant persons
                    who were sincerely orthodox; there were intelligent persons who pretended to be
                    so. But between the time of Massillon and D’Aguesseau and the time of Lamennais
                    and Joseph de Maistre the class of men of whom in England Berkeley, Butler, and
                    Johnson were representatives simply did not exist in France. Little inclined by
                    nature to any but the emotional side of religion, and utterly undisciplined in
                    any other by education, course of life, or the general tendency of public
                    opinion, Rousseau naturally took refuge in the nebulous kind of natural religion
                    which was at once fashionable and convenient. If his practice fell very far
                    short even of his own very arbitrary standard of morality as much may be said of
                    persons far more dogmatically orthodox.</p>
                <p>In politics, on the other hand, there is no doubt that Rousseau was a sincere
                    and, as far as in him lay, a convinced republican. He had no great tincture of
                    learning, he was by no means a profound logician, and he was impulsive and
                    emotional in the extreme— characteristics which in political matters undoubtedly
                    predispose the subject to the preference of equality above all political
                    requisites. He saw that under the French monarchy the actual result was the
                    greatest misery of the greatest number, and he did not look much further. The
                    <hi rend="italic">Contrat Social</hi> is for the political student one of the
                    most curious and interesting books existing. Historically it is null; logically
                    it is full of gaping flaws; practically its manipulations of the <hi
                    rend="italic">volonté de tous</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">volonté
                    générale</hi> are clearly insufficient to obviate anarchy. But its mixture of
                    real eloquence and apparent cogency is exactly such as always carries a
                    multitude with it, if only for a time. Moreover, in some minor branches of
                    politics and economics Rousseau w ’ as a real reformer. Visionary as his
                    educational schemes (chiefly promulgated in <hi rend="italic">Émile}</hi> are in
                    parts, they are admirable in others, and his protest against mothers refusing to
                    nurse their children hit a blot in French life which is not removed yet, and has
                    always been a source of weakness to the nation.</p>
                <p>But it is as a literary man pure and simple—that is to say, as an exponent rather
                    than as an originator of ideas—that Rousseau is most noteworthy, and that he has
                    exercised most influence. The first thing noticeable about him is that he defies
                    all customary and mechanical classification. He is not a dramatist—his work as
                    such is insignificant—nor a novelist, for, though his two chief works except the
                    <hi rend="italic">Confessions</hi> are called novels, <hi rend="italic"
                    >Émile</hi> is one only in name, and <hi rend="italic">La Nouvelle Héloïse</hi>
                    is as a story diffuse, prosy, and awkward to a degree. He was perfectly without
                    command of poetic form, and he could only be called a philosopher in an age when
                    the term w ’ as used with such meaningless laxity as was customary in the 18th
                    century. If he must be classed, he w <hi rend="superscript">τ</hi> as before all
                    things a describer —a describer of the passions of the human heart and of the
                    beauties of nature. In the first part of his vocation the novelists of his own
                    youth, such as Marivaux, Richardson, and Prévost, may be said to have shown him
                    the way, though he improved greatly upon them; in the second he was almost a
                    creator. In Combiningthe two and expressing the effect of nature on the feelings
                    and of the feelings on the aspect of nature he was absolutely without a
                    forerunner or a model. And, as literature since his time has been chiefly
                    differentiated from literature before it by the colour and tone resulting from
                    this combination, Rousseau may be said to hold, as an influence, a place almost
                    unrivalled in literary history. The defects of all sentimental
                    writing—occasional triviality and exaggeration of trivial things, diffuseness,
                    overstrained emotion, false sentiment, disregard of the intellectual and the
                    practical—are of course noticeable in him, but they are excused and palliated by
                    his wonderful feeling, and by what may be called the passionate sincerity even
                    of his insincere passages. Some cavils have been made against his French, but
                    none of much weight or importance. And in such passages as the famous “Voila de
                    la pervenche” of the <hi rend="italic">Confessions,</hi> as the description of
                    the isle of St Pierre in the <hi rend="italic">Rêveries,</hi> as some of the
                    letters in the <hi rend="italic">Nouvelle Hetowe</hi> and others, he has
                    achieved the greatest success possible—that of absolute perfection in doing what
                    he intended to do. The reader, as it has been said, may think he might have done
                    something else with advantage, but he can hardly think that he could have done
                    this thing better.</p>
                <p>The dates of most of Rousseau’s works published during Iiislifetime have been
                    given above. The <hi rend="italic">Confessions</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >Rêveries,</hi> which, read in private, had given much umbrage to persons
                    concerned, and which the author did not intend to be published until the end of
                    the century, appeared at Geneva in 1782. In the same year and the following
                    appeared a complete edition in forty-seven small volumes. There have been many
                    since, the most important of them being that of SIusset-Pathay (Paris, 1823).
                    Some unpublished works, chiefly letters, were added by Bosscha (Paris, 1858) and
                    Streckcisen SIoultou (Paris, 1861). The most convenient edition is perhaps that
                    of Didot in 4 vols, large 8vo, but a handsome and well-edited collection is
                    still something of a desideratum. Works on Rousseau are innumerable. The chief
                    are—in French that of Saint SIarc Girardin (1874), in English the excellent book
                    of Sir John SIorley. (G. SA.)</p>
