                    ancient capital of Normandy, and now the administrative centre of the department
                    of Seine Inférieure, the seat of an archbishopric and a court of appeal, and the
                    headquarters of the third corps d’armée, stands on a level site on the right
                    bank of the Seine in 49° 26' N. lat. and 1° 6' E. long, at the point where it is
                    joined by the Aubette and the small Rivière de Robec; it has also crept some
                    distance up the hills which enclose the valley on the right, and has an
                    extension on the plain on the left bank. The faubourgs by which it is surrounded
                    are, reckoning from the east, Martainville (on the left bank of the Robec), St
                    Hilaire, Beauvoisine, Bouvreuil, and Cauchoise; and the portion which lies on
                    the left bank of the Seine is known as the Faubourg St Sever. Between the old
                    town and the faubourgs runs a line of boulevards. Communication between the two
                    banks of the river is maintained by ferryboats and by two bridges; the upper
                    bridge, a stone structure, is divided into two parts by the Lacroix island and
                    decorated by a statue of Corneille; the lower is an iron suspension bridge which
                    opens in the middle to let masted vessels pass. The railway from Havre to Paris
                    crosses the Seine a little above Rouen, and having passed by a tunnel under the
                    higher quarters of the city reaches a station on the north at a distance of 87
                    miles from Paris and 55 from Havre. Another station at Martainville is the
                    terminus of the line from Rouen to Amiens; and at St Sever are those of the
                    lines to Paris and to Orleans by Elbeuf. Since about 1860 wide streets have been
                    driven through the old town, and tramway lines now traverse the whole city and
                    its environs. Rouen, which is 78 miles from the sea, stands fourth in the list
                    of French ports, coming next to Marseilles, Havre, and Bordeaux. Embankments
                    constructed along the lower Seine have forced the river to deepen its own
                    channel, and the land thus reclaimed has more than repaid the expenses incurred.
                    The port is now accessible to vessels drawing 21 feet of water, and by means of
                    easy dredgings this will be increased to from 25 feet to 28 according to the
                    tide. The expansion of the traffic as the improvements have advanced is shown by
                    the following returns: whereas in 1856 the number of vessels entered and cleared
                    was 6220, with an aggregate burden of 570,314 tons, the corresponding figures
                    were 4511 and 748,076 in 1876, and 5189 and 1,438,055 in 1880. What is now
                    wanted is an increased amount of quay accommodation, the old line of quays
                    scarcely exceeding 1 mile in length. The building of new quays and
                    repairing-docks for large vessels is in active progress; the port is being
                    dredged and deepened; and schemes are under consideration for a slip, a
                    petroleum dock, and corn elevators. <note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                <p>sians, a people of secondary rank, and it did not attain to any eminence till it

                    indebted to its first bishops—</p>
                <p>from St Mello, the apostle of the region, who flourished about 260, to St
                    Remigius, who died in 772. Ten or twelve of those prelates have the title of
                    saints; they built in their city many churches, and their tombs became in turn
                    the origin of new sanctuaries, so that Rouen was already, at that early period,
                    what it has remained to the present time, and in spite of its political
                    character—a religious city full of ecclesiastical monuments. From this period
                    there has been preserved the precious crypt of St Gervais, which contains the
                    tomb of the second bishop of Rouen, St Avitian. Under Louis “le Débonnaire” and
                    his successors Normans several times sacked the city, but the conversion of
                    Rollo in 912 made Rouen the capital of Normandy, and raised it to a greater
                    degree of prosperity than ever. The first Norman kings of England rather
                    neglected Roucn in favour first of Caen and afterwards of Poitiers, Le Mans, or
                    Angers; but the monasteries, the local trade and manufactures, and the communal
                    organization, which the people of Rouen had exacted from their sovereigns in
                    1145, maintained a most flourishing state of affairs, indicated by the
                    rebuilding of several sumptuous churches, and notably of the great abbey which
                    had been erected in the 5th century by St Victrix, and afterwards took the name
                    of St Ouen from the bishop whose tomb it contained. Of this restoration there
                    remains in the present building a small apse of two stories, Uie only Norman
                    fragment of any importance preserved by the ancient capital of Normandy. The
                    union of this province to</p>
                <p>France by Philip Augustus in 1204 did no damage to the prosperity of Rouen,
                    although its inhabitants submitted to their new master only after a siege of
                    nearly three months. To this period belong, if not the commencement, at least
                    the rapid erection of the most important building in the town, the cathedral of
                    Notre Dame, whose vast pile, erected between 1200 and 1220 by an architect
                    called Ingelram or Enguerrand, underwent so many alterations, restorations, and
                    extensions that it took its final form only in the 16thccntury. It is in plan a
                    Latin cross 427 feet in length, with aisles completely surrounding it and giving
                    access to the three great chapels of the choir. The west façade and those of the
                    transept are of extreme richness. Each was surmounted by two towers, of which
                    only one—the Butter Toiver (Tour de Beurre)— was completed. The western façade,
                    frequently enlarged, embellished, or restored from its first construction to the
                    present time, has two Charmingside doorways of the close of the 12th century, a
                    great central doorway, a rose window, and countless arcades and Gothic pinnacles
                    and turrets of the close of the 15th and the beginning of the 16th century. The
                    width of the front is increased by the projection of the two towers: that on the
                    left hand, the Tour Saint-Romain, was commenced about 1200, and raised to a
                    greater height in 1465-1477; that on the right hand, the finer, has a Iieightof
                    260 feet, and takes its name of Butter Tower from the fact that it was erected
                    between 1485 and 1507 by means of the moneys paid by the faithful for permission
                    to eat butter in Lent. On the north side of the cathedral are various accessory
                    buildings dating from the AIiddle Ages, and the Booksellers’ Portal,
                    corresponding to the Portail de la Calcnde in the south transept. Both portals
                    are adorned with statues, and both, as well as the towers which flank them, date
                    from the reigns of St Louis and Philip the Fair. Above the transept rises the
                    central tower, which was rebuilt in the 15th and 16th centuries, and had before
                    its destruction by fire in 1822 a Iieightof 430 feet. The iron spire added in
                    1876, though unfortunately much too slender, has raised it to a height of 485
                    feet, and thus made it the highest erection in Europe after the spires of
                    Cologne cathedral. While more harmonious in its style than the exterior, the
                    interior of Notre Dame de Rouen presents nothing peculiar in its architecture,
                    with the exception of the false gallery along the nave with passages running
                    round the pillais; but the artistic curiosities are numerous and varied. In the
                    choir may be noted a fine series of 13th-century stained-glass windows, carved
                    stalls of the 15th century, the tombs of the English kings Henry II. and Richard
                    I., that of Bishop Maurille, who built the larger part of the present structure,
                    an elegant Gothic staircase, and various tombs of archbishops and nobles.</p>
                <p>Philip Augustus built a castle at Rouen, but it was rather a fortress than a
                    palace, and the kings of France never treated it as a residence; a round keep
                    called Joan of Arc’s Tower still stands. On the other hand, nothing remains of
                    the castle erected by Henry V. of England when he took possession of Rouen in
                    1418 after a san <pb break="no"

                    his Continental residences, but it was never completed. It was in Philip
                    Augustus’s castle that Joan of Arc was imprisoned and tried, and one of the
                    public squares was the place where she was burned alive in 1431. From that year
                    began a series of attempts on the part of the French to recapture the town.
                    Rieardville in 1432 and Xaintrailles in 143G failed in spite of the secret
                    Connivanceof the inhabitants. In 1449 a stronger and better-planned expedition
                    was successful, and Somerset, the English commander, was obliged, in order to
                    secure an honourable capitulation, to surrender the principal fortified places
                    in Normandy. The English rule, though badly supported by the citizens, had not
                    been without its influence on the prosperity of Rouen. It was then that the
                    present church of St Ouen was continued and almost completed; the foundation was
                    laid in 1311, but the choir alone had been constructed in the 14th century. In
                    spite of the juxtaposition of the second and third or “radiant” and “flamboyant”
                    styles of Gothic, the building taken altogether presents in its general lines
                    the most perfect unity—a unity which even the modern addition of a façade with
                    two bell towers has failed to mar, though no regard was had to the original
                    plans. St Ouen is the largest church erected in France during the War of the
                    Hundred Years; in length (450 feet) it exceeds the cathedral. The central tower,
                    not unlike the Butter Tower, with which it is contemporary, is 265 feet high;
                    the two new towers with their spires are somewhat lower. Apart from its enormous
                    dimensions and the richness of its southern portal, St Ouen has nothing that
                    need long detain the visitor; its style is cold and formal; the interior, bare
                    and stripped of its ancient stained glass, was further despoiled in 1562 and in
                    1791 of its artistic treasures and of almost all its old church-furniture. The
                    organ dates from 1630, and the rather handsome roodscreen from the 18th century.
                    The close of the 15th century and the first half of the 16th—the reigns of
                    Charles VIII., Louis XII., Francis I.; and Henry IL, and the episcopates of
                    Cardinal Estoutteville (1453-1483), Cardinal Georges d’Amboise (1494-1510), and
                    his nephew of the same name (1511-50)—rendered Rouen for nearly a hundred years
                    the metropolis of art and taste in France; and it was one of the first towns
                    where the splendours of the Renaissance burst forth. At this time the church of
                    St Maclou was erected, a building that can hardly be brought into comparison
                    with the cathedral and St Ouen, but is justly celebrated for the value and
                    variety of its artistic treasures, such as the carved work of the principal
                    doors, partly executed by Jean Goujon, the beautiful stained glass, and an
                    organ-loft reached by an open-work staircase. The spire, 285 feet high, is a
                    structure of the present century. Beside the church is the old parish cemetery,
                    called the Aitre of Saint Maclou, surrounded by charming Renaissance galleries
                    and famous for its <hi rend="italic">danse macabre</hi> formed by a series of
                    sculptured groups. Other churches of the same period—St Godard, St Patrice, St
                    Vincent—are no less interesting from the profusion of their architectural
                    details than from their magnificent 16th-century stained-glass windows. There
                    are two glass windows in St Godard, and a regular collection in St Patrice; but
                    the latter, though the most famous, are in the eyes of connoisseurs of less
                    worth than the stained glass in St Vincent, due to two incomparable artists of
                    Beauvais, Engrand and Jean Le Prince,—the two principal subjects treated by them
                    being the Gifts of Mercy and the Glorification of the Virgin. St Godard
                    contains, besides, old frescos worthy of note. The church of St Laurent, no
                    longer used for worship, and the tower of St André are both of 16th-century
                    origin. At the same period the cathedral received great embellishments, the
                    central flèche was erected, and the portals were decorated with new sculptures.
                    Georges d’Amboise, the virtuous minister of Louis XII., chose the chapel of the
                    Virgin for his place of burial; he caused his mausoleum, constructed after the
                    plans of the architect Roland Ie Roux, to be composed entirely of marble, as
                    well as his statue, which he ordered from Jean Goujon. Georges d’Amboise the
                    second was, according to his desire, interred in his uncle’s tomb, but his
                    statue is of much less value. Near this tomb are two others erected for the
                    lords of Brézé; both are very remarkable; the oldest belongs to tho Gothic
                    style; the other, the tomb of Diana of Poitiers’s husband, is a Renaissance
                    structure of the time of Henry IL, but, contrary to what was long believed,
                    contains nothing from the hand of Jean Goujon. Under Louis XIL the archbishops
                    of Rouen also rebuilt their palace at the side of the cathedral; but in spite of
                    the richness of its architecture this lordly mansion cannot compete with the
                    “palace of justice” begun in the same year, 1499, when the exchequer of
                    Normandy, which had been established at Rouen in 1302, was erected into a <hi
                        rend="italic">parlement,</hi> though the title was not adopted till 1515.
                    This sumptuous building is in the Gothic style; but the Hôtel de Bourgtheroulde,
                    which dates from the time of Francis I., is Undisguisedly of the Renaissance,
                    and is justly celebrated for its bas-reliefs, the subjects of which are borrowed
                    from two quite different orders of things—the allegories from Petrarch’s <hi
                        rend="italic">Triumphs,</hi> and the interview of the Field of the Cloth of
                    Gold between Henry VIII. and Francis I. Many other secular Renaissance buildings
                    in Rouen bear witness to the great commercial prosperity of its citizens and to
                    their keen appreciation of the arts: —numerous private houses in stone and
                    especially in wood; the gate of the great clock; and a unique structure, the
                    “fierte” of St Romain, a sort of pulpit from which every year a person condemned
                    to death raised before the people the shrine or fierte <hi rend="italic"
                        >Jeretrnm)</hi> of St Romain, and then received pardon and liberty.</p>
                <p>This splendour of the arts began to decline during the wars of religion; in 1562
                    the town was sacked by the Protestants, which did not prevent the League from
                    obtaining so firm a footing there that Henry IV., after having vainly besieged
                    it, did not obtain entrance till long after his abjuration. To the 18th century
                    belong the exchange and the claustral buildings of the abbey of St 0uen,
                    transformed into an hôtel de ville. Much more important works have been executed
                    in recent times, but in great part at the expense of the historic and
                    picturesque features of the town. On the other hand, handsome structures of
                    various kinds have been erected in the interests of public utility or
                    embellishment—churches, civil and military establishments, fountains, statues,
                    &amp;c.; and many old buildings have been carefully restored or completed.
                    Rouen, moreover, has recently been provided with museums of antiquities, of fine
                    arts, of ceramic art, of natural history, and of industry,—the first two being
                    very important. During the Franco-German War the city was occupied by the
                    invaders from 5th December 1870 to 22d July 1871, and had to submit to heavy
                    requisitions. Among the famous men born at Rouen are the brothers Corneille,
                    Fontenelle, the journalists Arrnand Carrel and De Villemessant, the composer
                    Boieldieu, the painters Jouvenet, Restout, and Géricault, the architect Blondel,
                    Dulong the physicist, and La Salle the American explorer. (A. S.-P.)</p>
