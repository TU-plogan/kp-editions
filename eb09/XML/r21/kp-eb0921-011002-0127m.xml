                    xml:id="kp-eb0921-0128-0111"/>Hagiographa, is usually reckoned as the second of
                    the five Megilloth or Festal Rolls. This position corresponds to the Jewish
                    practice of reading the book at the Feast of Pentecost; Spanish MSS., however,
                    place Ruth at the head of the Megilloth (see Canticles); and the Talmud, in a
                    well-known passage of <hi rend="italic">Baba Bathra,</hi> gives it the first
                    place among all the Hagiographa. On the other hand the Septuagint, the Vulgate,
                    and the English version make Ruth follow Judges. It has sometimes been held that
                    this was its original place in the Hebrew Bible also, or rather that Ruth was
                    originally reckoned as an appendix to Judges, since it is only by doing this,
                    and also by reckoning Lamentations to Jeremiah, that all the books of the Hebrew
                    canon can be reduced to twenty-two, the number assigned by Josephus and other
                    ancient authorities. But it has been shown in the article Lamentations <hi
                    rend="italic">(q.v.)</hi> that the argument for the superior antiquity of this
                    way of reckoning breaks down on closer examination, and, while it was very
                    natural that a later rearrangement should transfer Ruth from the Hagiographa to
                    the historical books, and place it between Judges and Samuel, no motive can be
                    suggested for the opposite change. That the book of Ruth did not originally form
                    part of the series of <hi rend="italic">Prophetae priores</hi> (Judges-Kings) is
                    further probable from the fact that it is quite untouched by the process of
                    “prophetic” or “Deuteronomistic” editing, which gave that series its present
                    shape at a time soon after the fall of the kingdom of Judah; the narrative has
                    no affinity with the point of view which looks on the whole history of Israel as
                    a series of examples of divine justice and mercy in the successive rebellions
                    and repentances of the people of God. <note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>The religious pragmatism lacking in the original is in part
                    supplied by the Targum (i. 5, 6). </p></note> But if the book had been known at
                    the time when the history from Judges to Kings was edited, it could hardly have
                    been excluded from the collection; the ancestry of David was of greater interest
                    than that of Saul, which is given in 1 Sam. ix. 1, whereas the old history names
                    no ancestor of David beyond his father Jesse. In truth the book of Ruth does not
                    offer itself as a document written soon after the period to which it refers; it
                    presents itself as dealing with times far back (Ruth i. 1), and takes obvious
                    delight in depicting details of antique life and obsolete usages; it views the
                    rude and stormy period before the institution of the kingship through the
                    softening atmosphere of time, which imparts to the scene a gentle sweetness very
                    different from the harsher colours of the old narratives of the book of Judges.
                    In the language, too, there is a good deal that makes for and nothing that makes
                    against a date subsequent to the captivity, and the very designation of a period
                    of Hebrew history as “the days of the judges” is based on the Deuteronomistic
                    additions to the book of Judges (ii. 16 <hi rend="italic">sq.)</hi> and does not
                    occur till the period of the exile. An inferior limit for the date of the book
                    cannot be assigned with precision. It has been argued that, as the author seems
                    to take no offence at the marriage of Israelites with Moabite women, he must
                    have lived before the time of Ezra and Nehemiah (Ezra ix.; Neh. xiii.); but the
                    same argument would prove that the book of Esther was written before Ezra, and
                    indeed “a disposition to derive prominent Jewish families from proselytes
                    prevailed to a much later date,” and finds expression in the Talmud (see
                    Wellhausen-Bleek, p. 205). The language of Ruth, however, though post-classical,
                    does not seem to place it among the very latest Old Testament books, and the
                    manner in which the story is told is as remote from the legal pragmatism of
                    Chronicles as from the prophetic pragmatism of the editor of the older
                    histories. The tone of simple piety and graciousness which runs through the
                    narrative, unencumbered by the pedantry of Jewish legality, seems to indicate
                    that the book was written before all the living impulses of Jewish literature
                    were choked by the growing influence of the doctors of the law. In this respect
                    it holds in Hebrew prose writing a position analogous to that of the older <hi
                    rend="italic">Chokma</hi> in Hebrew poetry. But the triumph of the scribes in
                    literature as well as in law was not accomplished till long after the time of
                    Ezra.</p>
                <p>Wellhausen in Bleek, 4th edition, p. 204 <hi rend="italic">sq.,</hi> finds the
                    clearest indication of the date of Ruth in the appended genealogy, Ruth iv.
                    18-22; compare his remarks in <hi rend="italic">Prol. GescK Israels,</hi> p. 227
                    (Eng. tr., pp. 217 <hi rend="italic">sq.).</hi> Salma (Salmon), father of Boaz,
                    is a tribe foreign to old Judah, which was not “father” of Bethlehem till after
                    the exile, and the names of Salma’s ancestors are also open to criticism. But
                    this genealogy is also found in Chronicles, and is quite in the manner of other
                    genealogies in the same book. That it was borrowed from Chronicles and added to
                    Ruth by a later hand seems 'certain, for the author of Ruth clearly recognizes
                    that Obed was legally the son of Mahlon, not of Boaz (iv. 5, 10), so that from
                    his standpoint the appended genealogy is all wrong.</p>
                <p>The design of the book of Ruth has been much discussed and often in too narrow a
                    spirit; for the author is an artist who takes manifest delight in the touching
                    and graceful details of his picture, and is not simply guided by a design to
                    impart historical information about David’s ancestors, or enforce some
                    particular lesson. Now the interest of the story, as a work of art, culminates
                    in the marriage of Boaz and Ruth, not in the fact that their son was David’s
                    ancestor, which, if the book originally ended with iv. 17, is only mentioned in
                    a cursory way at the close of the story. Had the author’s main design been to
                    illustrate the history of the house of David, as many critics think, or to make
                    the point that the noblest stock in Israel was sprung from an alien mother
                    (Wellhausen), this design would certainly have been brought into more
                    prominence. The marriage acquires an additional interest when we know that Ruth
                    was David’s great-grandmother, but the main interest is independent of that, and
                    lies in the happy issue of Ruth and Naomi from their troubles through the loyal
                    performance of the kinsman’s part by Boaz. Doubtless the writer meant his story
                    to be an example to his own age, as well as an interesting sketch of the past;
                    but this is effected simply by describing the exemplary conduct of Naomi, Ruth,
                    Boaz, and even Boaz’s harvesters. All these act as simple, kindly, God-fearing
                    people ought to act in Israel.</p>
                <p>There is one antique custom which the writer follows with peculiar interest and
                    describes with archaeological detail as a thing which had evidently gone out of
                    use in his own day. By old Hebrew law, as by the old law of Arabia, a wife who
                    had been brought into her husband’s house by contract and payment of a price to
                    her father was not set free by the death of her husband to marry again at will.
                    The right to her hand lay with the nearest heir of the dead. Originally we must
                    suppose, among the Hebrews as among the Arabs, this law was all to the
                    disadvantage of the widow, whose hand was simply part of the dead man’s estate;
                    but, while this remained so in Arabia to the time of Mohammed, among the Hebrews
                    the law early took quite an opposite turn; the widow of a man who died childless
                    was held to have a right to have a son begotten on her by the next kinsman, and
                    this son was regarded as the sou of the dead and succeeded to his inheritance so
                    that his name might not be cut off from Israel. The duty of raising up a son to
                    the dead lay upon his brother, and in Deut. xxv. 5 is restricted to the case
                    when brothers live together. In old times, as appears from Gen. xxxviii., this
                    was not so, and the law as put in the book of Ruth appears to be that the
                    nearest kinsman of the dead in general had a right to “redeem for himself” the
                    dead man’s estate, but at the same time was bound to marry the widow. The son of
                    this marriage was reckoned as the dead man’s son and succeeded to his property,
                    so that the “redeemer” had only a temporary usufruct in it. Naomi was too old to
                    be married in this way, but <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit21newyrich/page/n129/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0921-0129-0112"/>she had certain rights over her husband’s estate
                    which the next kinsman had to buy up before he could enter on the property. And
                    this he was willing to do, but he was not willing also to marry Ruth and beget
                    on her a son who would take the name and estate of the dead and leave him out of
                    pocket. He therefore withdraws and Boaz comes in in his place. That this is the
                    sense of the transaction is clear; there is, however, a little obscurity in iv.
                    5, where one letter seems to have fallen out and we must read on ונםאתיות and
                    translate “What day thou buyest the field from Naomi thou must also buy Ruth,”
                    &amp;c. Comp. vv. 9, 10.</p>
