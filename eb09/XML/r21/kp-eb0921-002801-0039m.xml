                    (ç.v.).</hi> It was bounded on the south by the Pyrenees, on the west by the
                    county of Foix, on the north by Languedoc, and on the east by the Mediterranean.
                    The province derived its name from a small bourg near Perpignan, the capital,
                    called Ruscino (Rosceliona, Castel Rossello), where the Gallic chieftains met to
                    consider Hannibal’s request for a conference. The district formed part of the
                    Roman province of Gallia Narbonensis from 121 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> to
                    462 <hi rend="smallcaps">a.d.,</hi> when it was ceded with the rest of
                    Septimania to Theodoric II., king of the Visigoths. His successor, Amalaric, on
                    his defeat by Clovis in 531 retired to Spain, leaving a governor in Septimania.
                    In 719 the Saracens crossed the Pyrenees, and Septimania was held by them until
                    their defeat by Pippin in 756. On the invasion of Spain by Charlemagne in 778 he
                    found the borderlands wasted by the Saracenic wars, and the inhabitants hiding
                    among the mountains. He accordingly made grants of land to Visigothic refugees
                    from Spain, and founded several monasteries, round which the people gathered for
                    protection. In 792 the Saracens again invaded France, but were repulsed by
                    Louis, king of Aquitaine, whose rule extended over all Catalonia as far as
                    Barcelona. The different portions of his kingdom in time grew into allodial
                    fiefs, and in 893 Suniaire II. became the first hereditary count of Roussillon.
                    But his rule only extended over the eastern part of what became the later
                    province. The western part, or Cerdagne, was ruled in 900 by Miron as first
                    count, and one of his grandsons, Bernard, was the first hereditary count of the
                    middle portion, or Bésalu. In Illl Raymond-Bérenger III., count of Barcelona,
                    inherited the fief of Bésalu, to which was added in 1117 that of Cerdagne; and
                    in 1172 his grandson, Alphonso II., king of Aragon, united Roussillon to his
                    other states on the death of the last count, Gerard IL The counts of Roussillon,
                    Cerdagne, and Bésalu were not sufficiently powerful to indulge in any wars of
                    ambition. Their energies had been accordingly devoted to furthering the welfare
                    of their people, who enjoyed both peace and prosperity under their rule. Under
                    the Aragonese monarchs the progress of the united province still continued, and
                    Collioure, the port of Perpignan, became a centre of Mediterranean trade. But
                    the country was in time destined to pay the penalty of its position on the
                    frontiers of France and Spain in the long struggle for ascendency between these
                    two powers. James I. of Aragon had wrested the Balearic Isles from the Moors and
                    left them with Roussillon to his son James (1276), with the title of king of
                    Majorca. The consequent disputes of this monarch with his brother Pedro III. of
                    Aragon were not lost sight of by Philip III. of France in his quarrel with the
                    latter about the crown of the Two Sicilies. Philip espoused James’s cause and
                    led his army into Spain, but retreating died at Perpignan in 1285. James then
                    became reconciled to his brother, and in 1311 was succeeded by his son Sancho,
                    who founded the cathedral of Perpignan shortly before his death in 1324. His
                    successor James II. refused to do homage to Philip VI. of France for the
                    Seignioryof Montpellier, and applied to Pedro IV. of Aragon for aid. Pedro not
                    only refused it, but on various pretexts declared war against him, and seized
                    Majorca and Roussillon in 1344. The province was now again united to Aragon, and
                    enjoyed peace until 1462. In this year the disputes between John II. and his son
                    about the crown of Navarre gave Louis XI. of France an excuse to support John
                    against his subjects, who had risen in revolt. Louis at the fitting time turned
                    traitor, and the province having been pawned to him for 300,000 crowns was
                    Occupied by the French troops until 1493, when Charles VIIL restored it to
                    Ferdinand and Isabella. During the war between France and Spain (1496-98) the
                    people suffered equally from the Spanish garrisons and the French invaders. But
                    dislike of the Spaniards was soon effaced in the pride of sharing in the glory
                    of Charles V., and in 1542, when Perpignan was besieged by the dauphin, the
                    Roussillonnais remained true to their allegiance. Afterwards the decay of Spain
                    was France’s opportunity, and, on the revolt of the Catalans against the
                    Castilians in 1641, Louis XIII. espoused the cause of the former, and by the
                    treaty of 1659 secured Roussillon to the French crown.</p>
