                    two rivulets to form a small serpentine estuary, Rye harbour, the mouth of which
                    is connected with the town by means of a branch line of railway. In bygone
                    years, when the adjacent marshes were flooded with tidal water, the efflux was
                    so powerful as to effectually maintain safe and free entrance into Rye harbour;
                    and in the reign of Charles II. a frigate of 50 guns could enter and ride at
                    anchor. Now the harbour suffers seriously from the shifting sand and shingle,
                    and considerable sums of money have been expended by the harbour commissioners
                    with the view of overcoming these impediments, with but partial success. The
                    trade is chiefly in coal, timber,</p>

                <p>and bark, and shipbuilding is carried on as well as fishing. There is a large
                    market every alternate Wednesday, and considerable business in cattle, sheep,
                    corn, wool, and hops is transacted. Rye is a quaint, compactly-built town
                    perched upon the rock to which for centuries it was restricted, but in the
                    course of the last half-century it has gradually extended itself over the
                    northern slopes beyond the town wall. It is excellently drained, abundantly
                    supplied with clear spring water, and very healthy. The church, said to be the
                    largest parish church in England, is of very mixed architecture, chiefly
                    Transitional, Norman, and Early English; the nave and high chancel were
                    judiciously restored in 1882, according to designs by the late Mr G. E. Street.
                    Of the old fortifications there still remain portions of the town wall, much
                    hidden by newer buildings, a strong quadrangular tower built by William of
                    Ypres, earl of Kent, and lord warden in the time of Stephen, and now forming
                    part of the police station, and a handsome gate with a round tower on each side,
                    known as the Sandgate, at the entrance into Rye from the London road. Rye ceased
                    in 1885 to be a parliamentary borough, but gives its name to the eastern
                    division of the county. The population in 1881 was 4224.</p>
                <p>Of the early history of Rye little is known. In the mediaeval French chronicles
                    it is always mentioned as “La Rie.” Having been conferred upon the abbey of
                    Fecamp by Edward the Confessor, it was taken back by King Henry III. into his
                    own hands, “for the better defence of his realm,” and received from that
                    sovereign the full rights and privileges of a Cinque Port under the title of
                    “Ancient Town.” In consequence of the frequent incursions of the French, by whom
                    it was sacked and burnt three times in the 14th century, it was fortified by
                    order of Edward III. on the landward side, the steep precipitous sides of the
                    rock affording ample protection towards the sea. In addition to the naval
                    services rendered by Rye as a Cinque Port under the Plantagenet and Tudor
                    sovereigns, it was a principal port of communication with France in times of
                    peace,—for which reason successive bands of Huguenots fled thither between 1562
                    and 1685, many of whom settled at Rye and have left representatives now
                    living.</p>
