                <p><label type="entry">ROTHE</label><hi rend="smallcaps">Richard</hi> (1799-1867),
                    theologian, was born at Posen, January 28, 1799, of parents in a good position.
                    After passing through the grammar schools of Stettin and Breslau, he studied
                    theology in the universities of Heidelberg and Berlin (1817-20) under Daub,
                    Schleiermacher, and Neander, the philosophers and historians Hegel, Creuzer, and
                    Schlosser, exercising a considerable influence in shaping his thought. From 1820
                    to 1822 he was in the clerical seminary at Wittenberg, and spent the next year
                    in private study under his father’s roof at Breslau. In the autumn of 1823 he
                    was appointed chaplain to the Prussian embassy in Rome, of which Baron Bunsen
                    was the head. This post he exchanged in 1828 for a professorship in the
                    Wittenberg seminary, and hence in 1837 he removed to Heidelberg as professor and
                    director of a new clerical seminary; in 1849 he accepted an invitation to Bonn
                    as professor and university preacher, but in 1854 he returned to Heidelberg as
                    professor of theology and member of the Oberkirchenrath, a position he held
                    until his death, August 20, 1867. Rothe’s mental and religious development was
                    one of continuous progress. As a youth he was the subject of deep religious
                    feeling, with a decided bent towards a supernatural mysticism; his chosen
                    authors were those of the romantic school, and Novalis remained his life through
                    a special favourite. In Berlin and Wittenberg he came under the influence of
                    Pietism as represented by such men as Stier and Tholuck, though the latter
                    pronounced him a “very modern Christian.” He afterwards himself confessed that,
                    though he had been a sincere, he was never a happy Pietist. In Rome, where he
                    enjoyed the intimate friendship of Bunsen, and studied church history under the
                    broadening influence of classical and ecclesiastical art, his mind broke loose
                    from the straitened life and narrow views of Pietism and he learned to look at
                    Christianity in its human and Universalistic aspects. From that time he began to
                    develop and work out his great idea, the inseparable relation of religion and
                    morals, finding in the latter the necessary sphere and the realization of the
                    idea of the former. He began then, and particularly after the revolution of July
                    1830, likewise to give a more definite form to his peculiar view of the
                    relations of church and state. In consequence of this enlargement of his ideas
                    of tho world, religion, morals, Christianity, the church and the state, Rothe
                    gradually found himself out of harmony with the Pietistic thought and life of
                    Wittenberg, and his removal to Heidelberg in 1837 and the publication of his
                    first important work <hi rend="italic">(Anfänge der christlichen Kirchen</hi> in
                    that year coincide with the attainment of the principal theological positions
                    with which his name is associated. During the middle period of his career
                    (1837-61) he led the life of a scholastic recluse, taking no active public part
                    in ecclesiastical affairs in any way. During the last six years of his life
                    (1861-67), partly owing to his liberation from great domestic cares and partly
                    to the special circumstances of the church in Baden, he came forward publicly
                    and actively as the advocate of a free theology and of the <hi rend="smallcaps"
                        >Protestantenvereih</hi><hi rend="italic">(g.v.</hi><hi rend="italic">∖</hi>
                    This important change in Rothe’s practice was preceded by the publication of a
                    valuable series of theological essays (in the <hi rend="italic">Studien und
                        Kritiken</hi> for 1860), afterwards published in a separate volume <hi
                        rend="italic">(Zur Dogmatik,</hi> Gotha, 1st ed. 1863, 2d ed. 1869), on
                    revelation and inspiration more particularly. These essays were a very searching
                    examination of the relation of revelation to Scripture, and provoked much
                    hostile criticism in quarters previously friendly to Rothe, where the relation
                    was usually treated as almost one of identity. In consequence of this
                    publication, and his advocacy of the programme of the Protestantenverein, he was
                    classed at the end of his life amongst the more decided theological liberals
                    rather than with the moderate orthodox party, amongst whom so many of his
                    personal friends were to be found.</p>
                <p>Rothe was one of the most if not the most profound and influential of modern
                    German theologians next to Schleiermacher. Like the latter he combined with the
                    keenest logical faculty an intensely religious spirit, while his philosophical
                    tendencies were rather in sympathy with Hegel than Schleiermacher, and
                    theosophic mysticism was more congenial to him than the abstractions of Spinoza,
                    to whom Schleiermacher owed so much. He classed himself amongst the
                    theosophists, and energetically claimed to be a convinced and happy
                    supernaturalist in a scientific age. A peculiarity of his thought was its
                    systematic completeness and consistency; aphoristic, unsystematic,</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit21newyrich/page/n11/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0921-0011-0002"/>
                <p>timidly halting speculation was to him intolerable. Though his own system may
                    seem to contain extremely doubtful or even fantastic elements, it is allowed by
                    all that it is in its general outlines a noble massive whole, constructed by a
                    profound, comprehensive, fearless, and logical mind. Another peculiarity of his
                    thought was the realistic nature of his spiritualism: his abstractions are all
                    real existences; his spiritual entities are real and corporeal; his truth is
                    actual being. Hence Rothe, unlike Schleiermacher, lays great stress, for
                    instance, on the personality of God, on the reality of the worlds of good and
                    evil spirits, and on the visible second coming of Christ. Hence his religious
                    feeling and theological speculation demanded their realization in a kingdom of
                    God coextensive with man’s nature, terrestrial history, and human society; and
                    thus his theological system became a <hi rend="italic">Theologische Ethik.</hi>
                    It is on the work published under this title that Rothe’s permanent reputation
                    as a theologian and ethical writer will rest. The first edition, in three
                    volumes, was published in 1845-48, and remained twelve years out of print before
                    the second (1867—71, in five volumes) appeared. It was the author’s purpose to
                    rewrite the whole, but he had completed the first two volumes only of the new
                    edition when death overtook him. The remainder was reprinted from the first
                    edition by Prof. Holtzmann, with the addition of some notes and emendations left
                    by the author.</p>
                <p>Tliis work begins with a general sketch of the author’s system of speculative
                    theology in its two divisions, theology proper and cosmology, the latter falling
                    into the two subdivisions of <hi rend="italic">Physik</hi> (the world of nature)
                    and <hi rend="italic">Ethik</hi> (the world of spirit). It is the last
                    subdivision with which the body of the work is occupied. After an analysis of
                    the religions consciousness, which yields the doctrine of an absolute personal
                    and spiritual God, Rothe proceeds to deduce from his idea of God the process and
                    history of creative development, which is eternally proceeding and bringing
                    forth, as its unending purpose, worlds of spirits, partially self-creative and
                    sharing the absolute personality of the Creator. As a thorough-going
                    evolutionist Rothe regards the natural man as the consummation of the
                    development of physical nature, and obtains spirit as the personal attainment,
                    with divine help, of those beings in whom the further creative process of moral
                    development is carried on. His theory leaves the natural man, without
                    hesitation, to be developed by the natural processes of animal evolution. The
                    attainment of the higher stage of development is the moral and religious
                    vocation of man; this higher stage is self-determination, the performance of
                    every human function as a voluntary and intelligent agent, or as a person,
                    having as its cosmical effect the subjection of all material to spiritual
                    existences. This personal process of spiritualization is the continuation of the
                    eternal divine work of creation. Thus the moral life and the religious life
                    coincide, and when normal are identical; both have the same aim and are occupied
                    with the same task, the accomplishment of the spiritualization of the world.
                    “Piety, that it may become truth and reality, demands morality as its fulfdment,
                    as the only concrete element in which the idea of fellowship with God is
                    realized; morality, that it may find its perfect unfolding, requires the aid of
                    piety, in the light of which alone it can comprehend its own idea in all its
                    breadth and depth.” Rothe follows Schleiermacher in dividing his ethical system
                    into the three parts of the doctrine of moral ends <hi rend="italic"
                        >(Güterlehre'),</hi> or the products of moral action, the doctrine of virtue
                    ( <hi rend="italic">Tugendlehre),</hi> or of the power producing moral good, and
                    the doctrine of duty <hi rend="italic">(Pfiiehtenlehre),</hi> or the specific
                    form and manner in which that power obtains its results. The process of human
                    development Rothe regards as necessarily taking an abnormal form and passing
                    through the phase of sin. This abnormal condition necessitates a fresh creative
                    act, that of salvation, which was, however, from the first part of the divine
                    plan of development. As a preparation for this salvation supernatural revelation
                    was required for the purifying and revivification of the religious
                    consciousness, and the Saviour Himself had to appear in human Iiistory as a
                    fresh miraculous creation, born of a woman but not begotten by a man. In
                    conseπuence of His Supeniatural birth the Saviour, or the second Adam, was free
                    from original sin. By His own moral and religious development He made possible a
                    relation of perfect fellowship between God and man, which was the new’ and
                    highest stage of the divine creation of mankind. This stage of development
                    inaugurated by the Saviour is attained by means of His kingdom or the community
                    of salvation, which is both moral and religious, and in the first instance and
                    temporarily only religious—that is, a church. As men reach the full development
                    of their nature, and appropriate the perfection of the Saviour, the separation
                    between the religiousand the moral life will vanish, and the Christian state, as
                    the highest sphere of human life representing all human functions, will displace
                    the church. “In proportion as the Saviour Christianizes the state by means of
                    the church must the progressive completion of the structure of the church prove
                    the cause of its abolition.” The declino of the church is therefore not to be
                    deplored, but recognized as the consequence of the independence and
                    complctenessof the Christian life. It is the third section of his work—the <hi
                        rend="italic">Pfiichtxnlehre-</hi> which is generally most highly valued,
                    and where his full strength as an ethical thinker is displayed, without any
                    mixture of thcosophic speculation.</p>
