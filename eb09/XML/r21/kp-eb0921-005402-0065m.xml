                    grow thickly round the neck of the male, who is considerably larger than the
                    female, known as the Reeve. In many respects this species, the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Tmnga pugnαx</hi> of Linnaeus and the <hi rend="italic">Machetes pugnax</hi> of
                    the majority of modern ornithologists, is one of the most singular in existence,
                    and yet its singularities have been very ill appreciated by zoological writers
                    in general. <note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Mr Darwin,
                    though frequently citing ( <hi rend="italic">Descent of Man and Sexual
                    Selection,</hi> i. pp. 270, 306; ii. pp. 41, 42, 48, 81, 84, 100, 111) the Ruff
                    as a witness in various capacities, most unfortunately seems never to have had
                    its peculiarities presented to him in such a form that he could fully perceive
                    their bearings. However, the significance of the lesson that the Ruff may teach
                    was hardly conceivable before he began to write; but the fact is not the less to
                    be regretted that he never elucidated its importance, not only in regard to
                    “Sexual Selection,” but more especially with respect to “Polymorphism.” He
                    appears not to have consulted Montagu’s original account of this bird, and seems
                    to have known it only by the excerpt given by Macgillivray, in which were not
                    included the important passages on the extreme diversity of plumage exhibited by
                    the males—that author passing over this wonderful peculiarity in a paragraph of
                    less than a score of lines. </p></note> These singularities would require almost
                    a volume to describe properly. The best account of them is unquestionably that
                    given in 1813 by Montagu <hi rend="italic">(Suppl. On. Dictionary),</hi> who
                    seems to have been particularly struck by the extraordinary peculiarities of the
                    species, and, to investigate them, expressly visited the fens of Lincolnshire,
                    possibly excited thereto by the example of Pennant, whose information,
                    personally collected there in 1769, was of a kind to provoke further inquiry,
                    while Daniel <hi rend="italic">(Rural Sports,</hi> iii. p. 234) had added some
                    other particulars, and subsequently Graves in 1816 repeated in the same district
                    the experience of his predecessors. Since that time the great changes produced
                    by the drainage of the fen-country have banished this species from nearly the
                    whole of it, so that Lubbock <hi rend="italic">(Obs. Fauna of Norfolk,</hi> pp.
                    68-73) and Mr Stevenson <hi rend="italic">(Birds of Norfolk,</hi> ii. pp.
                    261—271) can alone be cited as modern witnesses of its habits in England, while
                    the trade of netting or snaring Ruffs, and fattening them for the table has for
                    many years practically ceased.</p>
                <p>The cock-bird, when out of his nuptial attire, or, to use the fenman’s
                    expression, when he has not “his show on,” and the hen at all seasons, offer no
                    very remarkable deviation from ordinary Sandpipers, and outwardly <hi
                    rend="superscript">2</hi> there is nothing, except the unequal size of the two
                    sexes, to rouse suspicion of any abnormal peculiarity. But when spring comes all
                    is changed. In a surprisingly short time the feathers clothing the face of the
                    male are shed, and their place is taken by <hi rend="italic">papillae</hi> or
                    small caruncles of bright yellow or pale pink. From each side of his head
                    sprouts a tuft of stiff curled feathers, giving the appearance of long ears,
                    while the feathers of the throat change colour, and beneath and around it
                    sprouts the frill or ruff already mentioned as giving the bird his name. The
                    feathers which form this remarkable adornment, quite unique among birds, are,
                    like those of the “ear-tufts,” stiff and incurved at the end, but much
                    longer—measuring more than two inches. They are closely arrayed, capable of
                    depression or elevation, and form a shield to the front of the breast
                    impenetrable by the bill of a rival. <hi rend="superscript">3</hi> More
                    extraordinary than this, from one point of view, is the great variety of
                    coloration that obtains in these temporary outgrowths. It has often been said
                    that no one ever saw two Ruffs alike. That is perhaps an over-statement; but,
                    considering the really few colours that the birds exhibit, the variation is
                    something marvellous, so that fifty examples or more may be compared without
                    finding a very close resemblance between any two of them, while the individual
                    variation is increased by the “ear-tufts,” which generally differ in colour from
                    the frill, and thus produce a combination of diversity. The colours range from
                    deep black to pure white, passing through chestnut or bay, and many tints of
                    brown or ashy-grey, while often the feathers are more or less closely barred
                    with some darker shade, and the black is very frequently glossed with violet,
                    blue, or green—or, in addition, spangled with white, grey, or gold-colour. The
                    white, on the other hand, is not rarely freckled, streaked, or barred with grey,
                    rufous-brown, or black. In some examples the barring is most regularly
                    concentric, in others more or less broken-up or undulating, and the latter may
                    be said of the streaks. It was ascertained by Montagu, and has since been
                    confirmed by the still wider experience and if possible more carefully conducted
                    observation of Mr Bartlett, that every Ruff in each successive year assumes
                    tufts and frill exactly the same in colour and markings as those he wore in the
                    preceding season; and thus, polymorphic as is the male as a species, as an
                    individual he is unchangeable in his wedding-garment —a lesson that might
                    possibly be applied to many other birds. The white frill is said to be the
                    rarest.</p>
                <p>That all this wonderful “show” is the consequence of the polygamous habit of the
                    Ruff can scarcely be doubted. No other species of Limicoline bird has, so far as
                    is known, any tendency to it. Indeed, in many species of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Limicolss,</hi> as the Dotterel, the <hi rend="smallcaps">Godwits</hi> (vol.
                    <hi rend="smallcaps">x.</hi> p. 720), Phalaropes, and perhaps some others, the
                    female is larger and more brightly coloured than the male, who in such cases
                    seems to take upon himself some at least of the domestic duties. Both Montagu
                    and Graves, to say nothing of other writers, state that the Ruffs, in England,
                    were far more numerous than the Reeves; and their testi mony can hardly be
                    doubted; though in Germany Naumann ( <hi rend="italic">V'og. Deutschlands,</hi>

                    Elizabethan or Jacobean costume, but it is essentially different, since that was

                    decorative apparel is most developed in front and at the sides and scarcely
                    exists behind.</p>

                    and that later the females greatly outnumber the males. It remains to say that
                    the moral characteristics of the Ruff exceed even anything that might be
                    inferred from what has been already stated. By no one have they been more
                    happily described than by Wolley, in a communication to Hewitson <hi
                    rend="italic">{Eggs of Brit. Birds,</hi> 3d ed., p. 346), as follows: —</p>
                <p>“The Ruff, like other fine gentlemen, takes much more trouble with his courtship
                    than with his duties as a husband. Whilst the Reeves are sitting on their eggs,
                    scattered about the swamps, he is to be seen far away flitting about in flocks,
                    and on the ground dancing and sparring with his companions. Before they are
                    confined to their nests, it is wonderful with what devotion the females are
                    attended by their gay followers, who seem to be each trying to be more attentive
                    than the rest. Nothing can be more expressive of humility and ardent love than
                    some of the actions of the Ruff. He throws himself prostrate on the ground, with
                    every feather on his body standing up and quivering; but he seems as if he were
                    afraid of coming too near his mistress. If she flies off, he starts up in an
                    instant to arrive before her at the next place of alighting, and all his actions
                    are full of life and spirit. But none of his spirit is expended in care for his
                    family. He never comes to see after an enemy. In the [Lapland] marshes, a Reeve
                    now and then flies near with a scarcely audible <hi rend="italic"
                    >ka-ka-kuk</hi>; but she seems a dull bird, and makes no noisy attack on an
                    invader.”</p>

                    towards the east. They winter in India, reaching even Ceylon, and Africa as far
                    as the Cape of Good Hope. The Ruff also occasionally visits Iceland, and there
                    are several well-authenticated records of its occurrence on the eastern coast of
                    the United States, while an example is stated <hi rend="italic">{Ibis,</hi>
