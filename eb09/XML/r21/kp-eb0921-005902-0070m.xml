                    on the 30th of September 1207 (601 A.H. 6th of Rabi' I.) at Balkh, in KhorasAn,
                    where his family had resided from time immemorial, rich in property and public
                    renown. He claimed descent from the caliph Abilbekr, and from the KhwArism shah
                    SultAn 'AlA-uddin b. Tukush (1199-1220), whose only daughter, Malika-i-JahAn,
                    had been married to JalAhuddin’s grandfather. Her son, Mohammed, commonly called
                    BahA-uddin Walad, was a famous doctor of Balkh, who, to escape the jealousy with
                    which the sultan viewed his influence, emigrated to Asia Minor in 1212. Young
                    JalAhuddin was only five years old at that time, but the signs of his future
                    greatness in spiritual matters began already to manifest themselves in
                    precocious knowledge and in ecstasies and visions. After residing for some time
                    at Malatiyah and afterwards at ErzinjAn in Armenia, BahA-uddin was called to
                    LArindah in Asia Minor, as principal of the local college, and there young
                    JalAhuddin, who had meanwhile grown under the careful tuition of his father in
                    wisdom and holiness, attained his maturity, and married in 1226 Jauhar KhAtiin,
                    the daughter of LAlA Sharahuddin of Samarkand. Finally, BahA-uddin was invited
                    to Iconium by 'AlA-uddin KaikubAd (1219-1236), the sultAn of Asia Minor, or, as
                    it is commonly called in the East, Rιim,—whence JalAl-uddin’s surname <hi
                    rend="italic">(takhallus)</hi> Rιimi.</p>
                <p>After BahA-uddin’s death in 1231, JalAhuddin went to Aleppo and Damascus for a
                    short time to study, but, as the mere positive sciences in which he had been
                    particularly trained failed to satisfy him, on his return to Iconium, where he
                    became by and by professor of four separate colleges, he took for nine years as
                    his spiritual guide Sayyid BurhAn-uddin Husaini of Tirmidh, one of his father’s
                    disciples, and later on the wandering Süfi Shams-uddin of Tabriz, who arrived in
                    Iconium on the 29th of November 1241, and soon acquired the most powerful
                    influence over JalAhuddin, who even adopted his name as takhallus in his ghazals
                    or mystic odes. Shams-uddin’s rather aggressive character, however, roused the
                    indignation of the people of Iconium against him, and during a riot in which
                    JalAl-uddin’s eldest son, 'AlA-uddin, was killed, he was arrested and probably
                    executed; at least he was no more seen. This fate of his teacher and friend,
                    together with the untimely death of his son, threw JalAhuddin into deep
                    melancholy, and in remembrance of these victims of popular wrath lie founded the
                    order of the Maulawi or (in Turkish pronunciation) Mewlewi dervishes, famous for
                    their piety as well as for their peculiar garb of mourning, their music and
                    their mystic dance (samA), which is the outward representation of the circling
                    movement of the spheres, and the inward symbol of the circling movement of the
                    soul caused by the vibrations of a Siifi’s fervent love to God. The
                    establishment of this order, which still possesses numerous cloisters throughout
                    the Turkish empire, and the leadership of which has been kept in JalAl-uddin’s
                    family in Iconium uninterruptedly for the last six hundred years, gave a new
                    stimulus both to the zeal and energy and the poetical inspiration of the great
                    shaikh. Most of his matchless odes, in which he soars on the wings of a genuine
                    enthusiasm, high over earth and heaven up to the throne of Almighty God, were
                    composed in honour of the Maulawi dervishes, and even his <hi rend="italic">opus
                    magnum,</hi> the <hi rend="italic">Mathnawi</hi> or, as it is usually called,
                    <hi rend="italic">The Spiritual Mathnawi</hi> (mathnawi-i-ma'nawi), a production
                    of the highest poetical and religious intuition in six books or daftars, with
                    30,000 to 40,000 double-rhymed verses, can be traced to the same source. The
                    idea of this immense collection of ethical and moral precepts, interwoven with
                    numerous anecdotes and comments on verses of the KorAn and sayings of the
                    Prophet, which the Eastern world reveres as the greatest devotional work, the
                    study of which secures eternal bliss, was first suggested to the poet by his
                    favourite disciple Hasan, better known as HusAm-uddin, who became in 1258
                    JalAl-uddin’s chief assistant. He had frequently observed that the members of
                    the Maulawi fraternity read with great delight the mystic mathnawis of SanA’i
                    and Farid-uddiii 'AttAr, and induced his master to compose a similar poem on a
                    larger scale. JalAhuddin readily fell in with this suggestion and dictated to
                    him, with a short interruption, the whole work during the remaining years of bis
                    life. Soon after the completion of this masterpiece JalAhuddin died on the 17th
                    of December 1273 (672 <hi rend="smallcaps">a.</hi> H. 5th of JumAdA II.),
                    worshipped as a saint by high and low. His first successor in the rectorship of
                    the Maulawi fraternity was HusAm-uddin himself, after whose death in 1284
                    JalAl-uddin’s younger and only surviving son, Shaikh BahAudd-in Ahmed, commonly
                    called SultAn Walad, and favourably known as author of the mystical mathnawi,
                    <hi rend="italic">Rabdbnama,</hi> or the Book of the Guitar (died 1312), was
                    duly installed as grand-master of the order.</p>
