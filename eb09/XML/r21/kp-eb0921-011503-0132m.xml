                    being the natural boundary between the two. On the left of the Oka the surface
                    often consists of sands, marshes, and forests; while on the right the fertile
                    black-earth prairies begin, occupying especially the southern part of the
                    government (the districts of Ranenburg, Sapojok, and Dankoff). The whole of
                    Ryazan is a plateau about 700 feet above the sea, but deeply cut by the river
                    valleys and numerous ravines. The geological formations represented are the
                    Devonian, the Carboniferous, the Jurassic, and the Quaternary. The Devonian
                    appears in the deeper valleys in the south, and belongs to the well-known
                    “Malevka-Muraevnya horizon,” now considered as equivalent to the <hi
                    rend="italic">Cypridina Serratostriata</hi> Upper Devonian deposits of the
                    Eifel. The Carboniferous deposits are widely spread, and appear at the surface
                    in the bottoms of the ravines and valleys. They contain strata of excellent coal
                    between plastic blue clays, "which are worked at several places. Upper
                    Carboniferous limestones, as also sandstones, the age of which has not yet been
                    determined, but which seem to be Lower Jurassic, cover the Carboniferous clays.
                    The Upper Jurassic deposits are widely spread, but they have been much destroyed
                    and now appear as separate insular tracts. They belong to the Oxford and
                    Callovian horizons, the former containing corals, which are very rare on the
                    whole in the Russian Jurassic deposits. The Quaternary deposits are represented
                    by the Glacial boulder clay and more recent alluvial deposits, which occupy wide
                    areas in the valley of the Oka. Iron-ores, limestone, grindstone grits, potters’
                    clays, and thick beds of peat are worked, besides coal. The northern parts of
                    Ryazan belong to the forest regions of Russia, and, notwithstanding the
                    wholesale destruction of forests in that part of the country, these (chiefly
                    Coniferous) still cover one-third of the surface in several districts. In the
                    south, where the proximity of the Steppes is felt, they are much less extensive,
                    the prevailing species being oak, birch, and other deciduous trees. They cover
                    an aggregate area of more than 2 million acres.</p>
                <p>The Oka is the chief river; it is navigable throughout, and receives the
                    navigable Pronya, Pra, and Tsna, besides a great many smaller streams utilized
                    for floating timber. Steamers ply on the Oka to Kasimoff and Nijni Novgorod. The
                    Don and the Lyesnoi Voronezh belong to Ryazan in their upper courses only. On
                    the whole, the south districts are not well watered. Small lakes are numerous in
                    the broad depression of the Oka and elsewhere, while extensive marshes cover the
                    north-east districts; a few attempts at draining several of these on the banks
                    of the Oka have resulted in the reclamation of excellent pasture lands. The
                    climate is a little warmer than at Moscow, the average temperature at Ryazan
                    being 41°.</p>
                <p>The territory of Ryazan was occupied in the 9th century by Finnish stems
                    (Mordvinians, Mers, Muroms, and Meschers), which for the most part have either
                    given way before or disappeared amongst the Slavonian colonizers. The population
                    is now Great Russian throughout, and contains only a trifling admixture of some
                    6000 Tartars, 1500 Poles, and 500 Jews in towns. Some Tartars immigrated into
                    the Kasimoff region in the 15th century, and are noted for their honesty of
                    character as well as for their agricultural prosperity. The people of the Pra
                    river are described as Mescheriaks, but their manners and customs do not differ
                    from those of the Russians.</p>
                <p>The chief occupation in Ryazafi is agriculture. Out of 10,100,000 acres only
                    838,000 are unfit for tillage. 5,482,000 acres are under crops, and the annual
                    produce is estimated at about 4,248,000 <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0921-0133-0116"/>quarters of corn and 972,000 quarters of potatoes.
                    The area under cultivation and the crops themselves are increasing, as also is
                    the export of corn. But even here, in one of the wealthiest governments of
                    Russia, the situation of the peasants is far from satisfactory. Cattle-breeding
                    is rapidly falling olf on account of want of pasturo lands, but hay, which is
                    abundant, especially on the rich meadow lands of the Oka, is exported. In 1882
                    there were 283,500 horses, 262,200 cattle, and 839,600 sheep, the figures having
                    been 446,000, 297,000, and 847,000 respectively in 1858. Iu the northern part of
                    the government various industries are carried on, such as boatbuilding, the
                    preparation of pitch and tar, the manufacture of wooden vessels, sledges,
                    &amp;c. Various other petty trades, such as weaving, lace-making, and
                    boot-making, are combined with agriculture. Manufactures also have lately begun
                    to make progress, and in 1882 their aggregate production reached 13,000,000
                    roubles (cotton and flax-spinning mills, glass-works and metal-ware works, and
                    distilleries, the last-named producing to the value of 1,850,000 roubles).
                    Trade, especially in com and other agricultural produce and in merchandise
                    manufactured in the villages, is very active. The railway from Ryazan to Moscow
                    is one of the most important in Russia, from the amount of goods carried from
                    the south-east Steppe governments. The Oka is another artery of traffic, the
                    aggregate amount shipped to or sent from its ports within Ryazan reaching
                    3,634,000 cwts. in 1880. The government is divided into twelve districts, the
                    chief towns of which, with their populations in 1883, are subjoined: Ryazah
                    (30,325 inhabitants), Dankoff (2475), Egorievsk (6055), Kasimoff (15,260),
                    Mikhailoff (2720), Pronsk (1740), Ranenburg (4500), Ryazhsk (4265), Sapojok
                    (2670), Skopin (10,260), Spassk (4320), and Zaraisk (5870). Ranenburg, Skopin,
                    and Zaraisk are important markets for corn and hemp. Several villages, such as
                    Muraevnya, Dyedinovo (6600) and Lovtsy (loading places on the Oka), and Ukolovo
                    (market for corn), have more commerce and industry than the district towns.
                    Large villages are numerous, about sixty having each from 2500 to 7000
                    inhabitants.</p>
                <p>The Slavonians began to colonize the region of Ryazafi as early as the 9th
                    century, penetrating thither both from the north-west (Great Russians) and from
                    the Dnieper (Little Russians). As early ns the 10th century the principality of
                    Murom and Ryazafi is mentioned in the chronicles. During the following centuries
                    this principality increased both in extent and in wealth and included parts of
                    what are now the governments of Kaluga and Moscow. Owing to the fertility of the
                    soil, its Russian population rapidly increased, while the Finnish stems which
                    formerly inhabited it migrated farther east, or became merged among the
                    Slavonians. A dozen towns, all fortified and commercial, are mentioned as
                    belonging to the principality towards the end of the 12th century. The Mongolian
                    invasion stopped all this development. The horsemen of Batu burned and destroyed
                    several towns in 1237, and killed many people, desolating the country. The
                    principality, however, still continued to exist; its great princes strongly
                    opposed the annexation plans of Moscow, making alliance with the Mongols and
                    with Lithuania, but they succumbed, and, the last of them, Ivan, having been
                    imprisoned in Moscow, his principality was definitively annexed in 1517.</p>
