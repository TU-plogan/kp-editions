                <p><hi rend="italic">Princeps</hi> or chieftain. In England before the Conquest the
                    <hi rend="italic">Comitatus</hi> had developed or degenerated into the
                    thegnhood, and among the most eminent and powerful of the king’s thegns, were
                    his dishthegn, his bowerthegn, and his horsethegn or staller. In Normandy at the
                    time of the Conquest a similar arrangement, imitated from the French court, had
                    long been established, and the Norman dukes, like their overlords the kings of
                    France, had their seneschal or steward, their chamberlain, and their constable.
                    After the Conquest the ducal household of Normandy was reproduced in the royal
                    household of England; and since, in obedience to the spirit of feudalism, the
                    great offices of the first had been made hereditary, the great offices of the
                    second were made hereditary also, and were thenceforth held by the grantees and
                    their descendants as grand-serjeanties of the crown. The consequence was that
                    they passed out of immediate relation to the practical conduct of affairs either
                    in both state and court or in the one or the other of them. The steward and
                    chamberlain of England were superseded in their political functions by the
                    justiciar and treasurer of England, and in their domestic functions by the
                    steward and chamber-lain of the household. The marshal of England took the place
                    of the constable of England in the royal palace, and was associated with him in
                    the command of the royal armies. In due course, however, the marshalship as well
                    as the constableship became hereditary, and, although the constable and marshal
                    of England retained their military authority until a comparatively late period,
                    the duties they had successively performed about the palace had been long before
                    transferred to the master of the horse. Under these circumstances the holders of
                    the original great offices of state and the household ceased to attend the court
                    except on occasions of extraordinary ceremony, and their representatives either
                    by inheritance or by special appointment have ever since continued to appear at
                    coronations and some other public solemnities, such as the opening of the
                    parliament or trials by the House of Lords. <note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                <p>The materials available for a history of the royal household are somewhat scanty
                    and obscure. The earliest record relating to it is of the reign of Henry II.,
                    and is contained in the <hi rend="italic">Blaxk Book of the Exchequer.</hi> It
                    enumerates the various inmates of the king’s palace and the daily allowances
                    made to them at the period at which it was compiled. Hence it affords valuable
                    evidence of the antiquity and relative importance of the court offices to which
                    it refers, notwithstanding that it is silent as to the functions and formal
                    subordination of the persons who filled them. <note anchored="true"

                    >Statutes of Eltham</hi> were meant for the practical guidance merely of those
                    who were responsible for the good order and the sufficient supply of the
                    sovereign’s household at the time they were issued. But the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Black Book of the Household,</hi> besides being a sort of treatise on princely
                    magnificence generally, professes to be based on the regulations established for
                    the governance of the court by Edward III., who, it affirms, was “the first
                    setter of certeynties among his domesticall meyne, upon a grounded rule” and
                    whose palace it describes as “the house of very policie and flowre of England;”
                    and it may therefore possibly, and even probably, take us back to a period much
                    more remote than that at which it was actually put together. <note

                <p>In its main outlines the existing organization of the royal household is
                    essentially the same as it was under the Tudors or the Plantagenets. It is now,
                    as it was then, divided into three principal departments, at the head of which
                    are severally the lord steward, the lord chamber-lain, and the master of the
                    horse, and the respective provinces of which may be generally described as
                    “below stairs,” “above stairs,” and “out of doors.” But at present, the
                    sovereign being a queen, the royal household is in some other respects rather
                    differently arranged from what it would be if there were a king and a queen
                    consort. λVhen there is a king and a queen consort there is a <pb break="no"

                    department of the master of the horse of her own, and all the ladies of the
                    court from the mistress of the robes to the maids of honour are in her service.
                    At the commencement of the reign of Queen Victoria the two establishments were
                    combined, and on the whole considerably reduced. Hence the royal household,
                    although it is of course much larger than that of a queen consort would be, is
                    also appreciably smaller than that of a king and queen consort together has been
                    since the reigning family acceded to the throne. <note anchored="true"

                    sons of peers, and privy councillors. But the duties which in theory belong to
                    the lord steward, treasurer, and comptroller of the household are in practice
                    performed by the master of the household, who is a permanent officer and resides

                    the day, a peer, and a privy councillor. He carnes a white staff, and wears a
                    golden or jewelled key, typical of the key of the palace, which is supposed to
                    be in his charge, as the ensigns of his office. He is responsible for the
                    necessary arrangements connected with state ceremonies, such as coronations and
                    royal marriages, christenings, and funerals. All invitations to court are sent
                    out in his name by command of the sovereign, and at drawing rooms and levees he
                    stands next to the sovereign and announces the persons who are approaching the
                    throne. It is also part of his duty to conduct the sovereign to and from his or
                    her carriage. <note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>The lord

                    privy councillor.</p>
                <p>When there is a king the groom of the stole comes next to the vice-chamberlain in
                    rank and authority. At present, however, the mistress of the robes in some

                    She is the only lady of the court who comes into office and goes out with the
                    administration, and the duties she performs are merely occasional and formal.
                    She is always a duchess, and attends the queen at all state ceremonies and
                    entertainments, but is never in permanent residence at the palace. <note

                    question” of 1839 the settled practice has been for all the ladies of the court
                    except the mistress of the robes to receive and continue in their appointments
                    independently of the political connexions of their husbands, fathers, and
                    brothers (see Mr Gladstone's <hi rend="italic">Gleanings of Past Years,</hi>

                    vol. ii. p. 304). </p></note> On the contrary the ladies of the bedchamber share
                    the function of personal attendance on the sovereign throughout the year. Of
                    these there are eight, always peeresses, and each is in waiting for about a
                    fortnight or three λveeks at a time. But the women of the bedchamber, of whom
                    there are also eight, appear only at court ceremonies and entertainments
                    according to a roster annually issued under the authority of the lord
                    chamberlain. They are usually the daughters of peers or the wives of the sons of
                    peers, and in the old time, like the mistress of the robes and the ladies of the
                    bedchamber, habitually assisted the queen at her daily toilette. But this has
                    long ceased to be done by any of them. The maids of honour, whose situations are
                    by no means sinecures, are likewise eight in number and have the same terms of
                    waiting as the ladies of the bedchamber. They are commonly if not always the
                    daughters Orgranddaughtersof peers, and when they have no superior title and
                    precedence by birth are called “honourable” and placed next after the daughters
                    of barons. The queen as a special mark of Iierfavour nominates “extra” ladies
                    and women of the bed-chamber and maids of honour. But their position is
                    altogether honorary and involves no charge on the civil list. There are eight
                    lords and eight grooms, who are properly described as “of the bedchamber” or “in
                    waiting,” according as the reigning sovereign is a king or a queen, and whose
                    terms of attendance are of similar duration to those of the ladies of the
                    bedchamber and the maids of honour. Occasionally “extra” lords and grooms in
                    waiting are nominated by the queen, who, however, are unpaid and have no regular
                    duties. The master, assistant master, and marshal of the ceremonies are the
                    officers whose special function it is to enforce the observance of the <hi
                    rend="italic">etiquette</hi> of the court. The reception of foreign potentates
                    and ambassadors is under their particular care, and they assist in the ordering
                    of all entertainments and festivities at the palace. <note anchored="true"

                    and is in constant attendance on the House of Lords, from whom, either
                    personally or by his deputy the yeoman usher of the black rod, it is part of his

                    with the horses and hounds of the sovereign are within his jurisdiction. The
                    master of the buckhounds, who is also one of the ministry, ranks next to him,
                    and it is his duty.to attend the royalhunt and to head the procession of royal
                    equipages on the racecourse at Ascot, where he presents himself on horseback in
                    a green and gold uniform wearing the couples of a hound as the badge of his
                    office. The hereditary grand falconer <note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    the master of the horse. But the practical management of the royal stables and
                    stud in fact devolves on the chief or crown equerry, formerly called the
                    gentleman of the horse, who is never in personal attendance on the sovereign,
                    and whose appointment is permanent. The clerk marshal has the supervision of the
                    accounts of the department before they are submitted to the Board of Green
                    Cloth, and is in waiting on the sovereign on state occasions only. Exclusive of
                    the crown equerry there are seven regular equerries, besides extra and honorary
                    equerries, one of whom is always in attendance on the sovereign and rides at the
                    side of the royal carriage. They are always officers of the army, and each of
                    them is “on duty” for about the same time as the lords and grooms in waiting.
                    There are also three pages of honour in the master of the horse’s department,
                    who must not be confounded with tho pages of various κinds who are in the
                    department of the lord chamberlain. They are youths aged from twelve to sixteen,
                    selected by the sovereign in person, to attend on her at state ceremonies, when
                    two of them arrayed in an antique costume assist the groom of the robes in
                    carrying the royal train.</p>
                <p>It remains to be said that to the three ancient departments of the royal
                    household which we have already noticed two others have been added in
                    comparatively recent times. The departments of the private secretary and the
                    keeper of the privy purse to the sovereign, which are for the present combined,
                    originated no longer ago than the earlier part of the current century. Very
                    great doubts were at one time entertained as to whether such an office as that
                    of private secretary to the sovereign could constitutionally exist, and the
                    privy purse itself was unknown until after the passing of Burke’s Act of 1782.
                    As at present organized these branches of the royal household consist of the
                    private secretary and keeper of the privy purse, two assistant private
                    secretaries and keepers of the privy purse, aud a secretary and two clerks of
                    the privy purse. By the statute which settled the civil list at the beginning of
                    the current reign (1 &amp; 2 Vict. c. 2) the privy purse was fixed at £60,000 a
                    year, am I the salaries, allowances, and other expenses of the royal household
                    were fixed at £303,760 a year. (F. DR.)</p>
