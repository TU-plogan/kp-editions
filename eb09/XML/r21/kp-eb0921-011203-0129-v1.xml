                <p><label type="entry">RUTHERFURD or Rutherford</label>, Samuel (1600-1661),
                    Scottish divine, was born about 1600 at the village of Nisbet in Roxburghshire.
                    He is supposed to have received his early education at Jedburgh, and he entered
                    the university of Edinburgh in 1617. He graduated M.A. in 1621, and two years
                    afterwards was elected professor of humanity. On account of some alleged
                    indiscretion or irregularity connected with his marriage in 1625, he resigned
                    his professorship in that year, but, after studying theology, he was in 1627
                    appointed minister of An-woth, Kirkcudbrightshire, where he displayed remarkable
                    diligence and zeal, alike as preacher, pastor, and student, and soon took a
                    leading place among the clergy of Galloway. In 1636 his first book, entitled <hi
                        rend="italic">Exerdtationes de Gratia</hi> —an elaborate treatise against
                    Arminianism—appeared at Amsterdam, and attracted some attention both in Great
                    Britain and on the Continent. Combined with his strict and non-conforming
                    presbyterianism, the severe Calvinism set forth in this work led to a
                    prosecution by the new bishop of the diocese, Sydserff, in the High Commission
                    Court, first at Wigtown and afterwards at Edinburgh, with the result that
                    Rutherfurd was deposed from his pastoral office, and sentenced to confinement in
                    Aberdeen during the king’s pleasure. His banishment lasted from September 1636
                    to February 1638, and was chiefly remarkable for the epistolary activity he
                    displayed, the greater number of his published <hi rend="italic">Letters</hi>
                    belonging to this period of his life. He was present at the signing of the
                    Covenant in Edinburgh in 1638, and afterwards at the meeting of the Glasgow
                    Assembly the same year, which restored him to his parish. In 1639 he was
                    appointed professor of divinity in St Mary’s College, St Andrews, and shortly
                    afterwards became colleague to Robert Blair in the church of St Andrews. He was
                    sent up to London in 1643 as one of the eight commissioners from Scotland to the
                    Westminster Assembly. Arriving along with Baillie in November, and remaining at
                    his post over three years, he did great service to the cause of his party. In
                    1642 he had published his <hi rend="italic">Peaceable and Temperate Plea for
                        Paul’s Presby-tede in Scotland,</hi> and the sequel to it in 1644 on <hi
                        rend="italic">The Due Right of Presbyteries</hi> provoked Milton's
                    contemptuous reference to “mere A. S. and Rutherfurd” in his sonnet <hi
                        rend="italic">On the New Forcers of Consdence under the Long
                        Parliament.</hi> In 1644 also appeared Rutherfurd’s <hi rend="italic">Lex
                        Rex, a Dispute for the Just Prerogative of King and People,</hi> which gives
                    him a recognized place among the early writers on constitutional law; it was
                    followed by <hi rend="italic">The Divine Right of Church Government</hi> (1646),
                    and <hi rend="italic">Free Disputation against Pretended Liberty of
                        Conscience</hi> (1649). Among his other works are the <hi rend="italic"
                        >Tryal and Triumph of Faith</hi> (1645), <hi rend="italic">Chdst Dying and
                        Drawing Sinners to Himself</hi> (1647), and <hi rend="italic">Survey of the
                        Spirtual Antichrist</hi> (1648). In 1647 he returned to St Andrews to become
                    principal of the New College there, and in 1648 and 1651 he declined successive
                    invitations to theological chairs at Harderwijk and Utrecht. His last days were
                    assailed by the persecution which followed the</p>
                <p>Restoration in 1660. His <hi rend="italic">Lex Rex</hi> was ordered to be burned
                    at the cross of Edinburgh, and also at the gate of the college. He was deprived
                    of all his offices, and on a charge of high treason was cited to appear before
                    the ensuing parliament. His health, however, now utterly broke down, and knowing
                    that he had not long to live he drew up, on 26th February 1661, a <hi
                        rend="italic">Testimony,</hi> which was posthumously published. He died on
                    the 20th of the following March.</p>
                <p>The fame of Rutherfurd now rests principally upon his remarkable <hi
                        rend="italic">Letters,</hi> on which Wodrow thus comments:—“He seems to have
                    outdone even himself as w <hi rend="superscript">τ</hi> ell as everybody else in
                    his admirable and every way singular letters, which, though jested upon by
                    profane wits because of some familiar expressions, yet will be owned of all who
                    have any relish of piety to contain such sublime flights of devotion and to be
                    fraughted with such massy thoughts as loudly speak a soul united to Jesus Christ
                    in the closest embraces, and must needs at once ravish and edify every serious
                    reader.” In addition to the other works already mentioned, Rutherfurd published
                    in 1651 a treatise <hi rend="italic">De Divina Provulentia,</hi> against
                    Molinism, Socinianism, and Arminianism, of which Richard Baxter, not without
                    justice, remarked that “as the <hi rend="italic">Letters</hi> were the best
                    piece so this was the worst he had ever read.”</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Letters,</hi> to the number of 215, were first published
                    anonymously by M ’ Ward, an amanuensis, at Rotterdam, in 1664. They have been
                    frequently reprinted, the best edition (365 letters) being that by Rev. A. A.
                    Bonar, 1848, with a sketch of his life. See also a short <hi rend="italic"
