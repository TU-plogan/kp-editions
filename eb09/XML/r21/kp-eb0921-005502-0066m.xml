                    situated on a table-land rising from the southern bank of the Avon, at the
                    junction of several railway lines, and near the Grand Junction Canal, 30 miles
                    E.S.E. of Birmingham, and 20 S.S.W. of Leicester. It is a well-built town, with
                    a large number of modern houses erected for private residences. It occupies C,
                    gravel site, is well drained, and has a good supply of water. It owes its
                    importance to the grammar school, built and endowed by Laurence Sheriff, a
                    merchant grocer and servant to Queen Elizabeth, and a native of the neighbouring
                    village of Brownsover. The endowment consisted of the parsonage of Brownsover,
                    Sheriff’s mansion house in Rugby, and one-third (8 acres) of his estate in
                    Middlesex, near the Foundling Hospital, London, which, being let on building
                    leases, gradually increased to about £5000 a year. The full endowment was
                    obtained in 1653. The school originally stood opposite the parish church, and
                    was removed to its <pb break="no"

                    1710 and 1750. In 1809 it was rebuilt from designs by Hake-will; the chapel,
                    dedicated to St Lawrence, was added in 1820. At the tercentenary of the school
                    in 1867 subscriptions were set on foot for founding scholarships, building
                    additional schoolrooms, rebuilding or enlarging the chapel, and other objects.
                    The chapel was rebuilt and reconsecrated in 1872. A swimming bath was erected in
                    1876; the Temple observatory, containing a fine equatorial refractor by Alvan
                    Clark, was built in 1877, and the Temple reading room with the art museum in
                    1878. The workshops underneath the gymnasium were opened in 1880, and a new big
                    school and class rooms were erected in 1885. There are three major and four
                    minor exhibitions for students to any university in the United Kingdom. From
                    about 70 in 1777 the numbers attending the school have increased to over 400. A
                    great impulse was given to the progress of the school during the headmastership
                    of Dr Arnold, 1827-1842. The best known of Arnold’s successors are Tait,
                    afterwards archbishop of Canterbury, and Temple, the present bishop of London.
                    The parish church of St Andrew’s is, with the exception of the tower and the
                    north arcade in the nave, entirely modern, having been built from designs by Mr
                    Butterfield at a cost of £22,000, and reconsecrated in 1879. The daughter church
                    of the Holy Trinity, a handsome building by Sir Gilbert Scott, in close
                    proximity to St Andrew’s, was erected in 1853. St Marie’s Catholic Church is in
                    the Early English style. A town-hall was erected in 1858, at a cost of £7000.
                    There are a number of charities, including Laurence Sheriff’s almshouses
                    (founded 1567), Elborow’s almshouses (1707), Miss Butlin’s almshouses (1851),and
                    the hospital of StCross, opened in 1884, at a cost of £20,000. A public
                    recreation ground was provided by the local government board in 1877. The town
                    has an important cattle market. The population of the urban sanitary district
                    (area 1617 acres) in 1871 was 8385, and in 1881 it was 9891.</p>
                <p>Rugby was originally a hamlet of the adjoining parish of Clifton-on-Dunsmore, and
                    is separately treated of as such in Domesday Book. Ernaldus de Bosco (Ernald de
                    Bois), lord of the manor of Clifton, seems to have erected the first chapel in
                    Rugby, in the reign of Stephen, about 1140. It was afterwards granted by him,
                    with certain lands, to endow the abbey of St Mary, Leicester, which grant was
                    confirmed by his successors and by royal charter of Henry II. In the second year
                    of King John (1200) a suit took place between Henry de Rokeby, lord of the manor
                    of Rugby, and l’aul, abbot of St Mary, Leicester, which resulted in the former
                    obtaining possession of the advowson of Rugby, on condition of homage and
                    service to the abbot of Leicester. By virtue of this agreement the chapel was
                    converted into a parish church, and the vicarage into a rectory. In 1350 Ralph,
                    Lord Stafford, became possessed of the manor and advowson of Rugby, and
                    considerably enlarged the parish church. Subsequent alterations, notably in 1814
                    and 1831, left little of this structure remaining except the tower and north
                    arcade in the nave. The advowson of Kugby is now the property of the earl of
                    Craven; and the late rector was widely known and honoured as “the poet pastor,”
                    John Moultrie.</p>
