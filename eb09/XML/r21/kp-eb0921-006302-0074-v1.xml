                    centre of Liberalism, and dwelt in the house of Prof. Playfair, whom he
                    afterwards described as “one of the best and noblest, the most upright, the most
                    benevolent, and the most liberal of all philosophers.” On leaving the
                    university, he determined upon taking a foreign tour, and, as the greater part
                    of Europe was overrun by French troops, he landed at Lisbon with the intention
                    of exploring the countries of Portugal and Spain. Lord John <pb break="no"

                    conclusion that the j continuance of the war with France was necessary for the ∣
                    restoration of the peace of Europe, and his convictions ∣ were deepened by the
                    experience of travel. On the 4th May 1813, ere he was of age, he was returned
                    for the ducal borough of Tavistock, and in this he resembled Lord Chesterfield
                    and other aristocratic legislators, who were J entrusted with the duty of
                    law-making before they had ∣ arrived at years of discretion. /Yfter the battle
                    of λ∖ ater- ∣ loo the Whig representatives in parliament concentrated ∣ their
                    efforts in promoting financial reform, and in resisting those arbitrary
                    settlements of the Continental countries which found favour in the eyes of
                    Metternich and Castle-reagh. In foreign politics Lord John Russell s oratorical
                    talents were especially shown in his struggles to prevent the union of Norway
                    and Sweden. In domestic questions he cast in his lot with those who opposed the
                    repressive measures of 1817, and protested that the causes of the discontent at
                    home should be removed by remedial legislation. λVhen failure attended all his
                    efforts he resigned his seat for Tavistock, and meditated permanent withdrawal
                    from public life, but was dissuaded from this step by the arguments of his
                    friends, and especially by a poetic appeal from Tom Moore. In the parliament of
                    1818-20 he again represented the family borough in Devon, andin May 1819 began
                    his long advocacy of parliamentary reform by moving for an inquiry into the
                    corruption which prevailed in the Cornish constituency of Grampound. During the
                    first parliament (1820-26) of George IV. the county of Huntingdon accepted Lord
                    John Russell’s services as its representative, and it was his good fortune to
                    secure in 1821 the disfranchisement of Grampound, but his satisfaction at this
                    triumph was diminished by the fact that the seats were not transferred to the
                    constituency which he desired. This was the sole parliamentary victory which the
                    advocates of a reform of the representation obtained before 1832, but they found
                    cause for congratulation in other triumphs. Lord John Russell paid the penalty
                    for his advocacy of Catholic emancipation with the loss in 1826 of his seat for
                    Huntingdon county, but he found a shelter in the Irish borough of Bandon Bridge.
                    He led the attack against the Test Acts by carrying in February 1828 with a
                    majority of forty-four a motion for a committee to inquire into their
                    operations, and after this decisive victory they were repealed. He warmly
                    supported the Wellington ministry when it realized that the king’s government
                    could only be carried on by the passing of a Catholic Relief Act. For the
                    greater part of the short-lived parliament of 1830-31 he served his old
                    constituency of Tavistock, having been beaten in a contest for Bedford county at
                    the general election by one vote; and, when Lord Grey’s Reform ministry was
                    formed, Lord John Russell accepted the office of paymaster-general, though,
                    strange to say, he was not admitted into the sacred precincts of the cabinet.
                    This exclusion from the official hierarchy was rendered the more remarkable by
                    the circumstance that he was selected (1st March 1831) to explain the provisions
                    of the Reform Bill, to which the cabinet had given its formal sanction. The Whig
                    ministry were soon met by defeat, but an appeal to the country increased the
                    number of their adherents, and Lord John Russell himself had the satisfaction of
                    being chosen by the freeholders of Devon as their member. After many a period of
                    doubt and defeat, “the bill, the whole bill, and nothing but the bill” passed
                    into law, and Lord John stood forth in the mind of the people as its champion.
                    Although it was not till some years later that he became the leader of the
                    Liberal party, the height of his fame was attained in 1832. After the passing of
                    the Reform Bill he sat for the southern division of Devon, and continued to
                    retain the place of paymaster-general in the ministries of Lord Grey and Lord
                    Melbourne. The former of these cabinets was broken up by the withdrawal of Mr
                    Stanley, afterwards Lord Derby, on the proposal for reforming the Irish Church,
                    when he emphasized Lord John Russell's part in the movements by the saying
                    “Johnny ’s upset the coach ;” the latter was abruptly, if not rudely, dismissed
                    by William IV. when the death of Lord Spencer promoted the leader of the House
                    of Commons, Lord Althorp, to the peerage, and Lord John Russell was proposed as
                    the spokesman of the ministry in the Commons. At the general election which
                    ensued the Tories received a considerable accession of strength, but not
                    sufficient to ensure their continuance in office, and the adoption by the House
                    of Commons of the proposition of the Whig leader, that the surplus funds of the
                    Irish Church should be applied to general education, necessitated the
                    resignation of Sir Robert Peel’s ministry. In Lord Melbourne’s new
                    administration Lord John Russell became home secretary and leader of the House
                    of Commons, but on his seeking a renewal of confidence from the electors of
                    South Devon, he was defeated and driven to Stroud. Although the course of the
                    Whig ministry was not attended by uniform prosperity, it succeeded in passing a
                    Municipal Reform Bill, and in carrying a settlement of the tithe question in
                    England and Ireland. At the close of its career the troubles in Canada
                    threatened a severance of that dependency from the home country, whereupon Lord
                    John Russell, with a courage which never deserted him, took charge of the
                    department, at that time a dual department, of war and the colonies. In May
                    1839, on an adverse motion concerning the administration of Jamaica, the
                    ministry was left with a majority of five only, and promptly resigned the seals
                    of office. Sir Robert Peel’s attempt to form a ministry was, however, frustrated
                    by the refusal of the queen to dismiss the ladies of the bedchamber, and the
                    Whigs resumed their places. Their prospects brightened when Sir John Yarde
                    Buller’s motion of “no confidence” was defeated by twenty-one, but the glimpse
                    of sunlight soon faded, and a similar vote was some months later carried by a
                    majority of one, whereupon the Whig leader announced a dissolution of parliament
                    (1841). At the polling booth his friends were smitten hip and thigh; the return
                    of Lord John Russell for the City of London was almost their solitary triumph.
                    On Sir Robert Peel’s resignation (1846) the task of forming an administration
                    was entrusted to Lord John Russell, and he remained at the head of affairs from
                    1846 to 1852, but his tenure of office was not marked by any great legislative
                    enactments. His celebrated Durham letter on the threatened assumption of
                    ecclesiastical titles by the Roman Catholic bishops weakened the attachment of
                    the “Peelites” and alienated his Irish supporters. The impotence of their
                    opponents, rather than the strength of their friends, kept the Whig ministry in
                    power, and, although beaten by a majority of nearly two to one on Mr Locke
                    King’s County Franchise Bill in February 1851, it could not divest itself of
                    office. Lord Palmerston’s unauthorized recognition of the French <hi
                        rend="italic">coup d'etat</hi> was followed by his dismissal, but he had his
                    revenge in the ejectment of his old colleagues a few months later. During Lord
                    Aberdeen’s administration Lord John Russell led the Lower House, at first as
                    foreign secretary, then without portfolio, and lastly as president of the
                    council. In 1854 he brought in a Reform Bill, but in consequence of the war with
                    Russia the bill was allowed, much to its author’s mortification, to drop. His
                    popularity was diminished by this failure, and although he resigned in January
                    1855, on Mr Roebuck’s Crimea motion, he did not regain his old position in the
                    country. At the Vienna conference (1855) Lord John Russell was England’s
                    representative, and immediately on his return <pb break="no"

                        xml:id="kp-eb0921-0076-0065"/>he became secretary of the colonies; but the
                    errors in his negotiations at the Austrian capital followed him and forced him
                    to retire. For some years after this he was the “stormy petrel” of politics. He
                    was the chief instrument in defeating Lord Palmerston in 1857. He led the attack
                    on the Tory Reform Bill of 1859. A reconciliation was then effected between the
                    rival Whig leaders, and Lord John Russell consented to become foreign secretary
                    in Lord Palmerston’s ministry, and to accept an earldom. During the American War
                    Earl Russell’s sympathies with the North restrained his country from embarking
                    in the contest, but he was not equally successful in his desire to prevent the
                    spoliation of Denmark. On Lord Palmerston’s death (October 1865) Earl Russell
                    was once more summoned to form a cabinet, but the defeat of his ministry in the
                    following June on the Reform Bill which they had introduced was followed by his
                    retirement from public life. His leisure hours were spent after this event in
                    the preparation of numberless letters and speeches, and in the composition of
                    his <hi rend="italic">Recollections and Suggestions,</hi> but everything he
                    wrote was marked by the belief that all philosophy, political or social, was
                    summed up in the Whig creed of fifty years previously. Earl Russell died at
                    Pembroke Lodge, Richmond Park, 28th May 1878.</p>
                <p>For more than half a century Earl Russell lived in the excitement of political
                    life. He participated in the troubles of Whiggism before 1832, and shared in its
                    triumph after that event. He expounded the principles of the first Reform Bill
                    and lived to see a second carried into law by the Conservative ministry of Lord
                    Derby. Unlimited confidence in his own resources exposed him to many jests from
                    both friend and foe, but he rightly estimated his powers, and they carried him
                    to the highest places in the state. His tragedies and his essays are forgotten,
                    but his works on Fox are among the chief authorities on Whig politics. Earl
                    Russell was twice married, —first, in 1835, to Adelaide, daughter of Mr Thomas
                    Lister, and widow of Thomas, second Lord Ribblesdale, and secondly, in 1841, to
                    Lady Frances Ann Maria, daughter of the second earl of Minto. By the former he
                    had two daughters, by the latter three sons and one daughter. His eldest son,
                    Lord Amberley, predeceased him 9th January 1876. (W. P. C.)</p>
