                    extending from the Volta to the Niger, and from the Kong Mountains to the sea;
                    but recent investigation has shown that the true limits of the state are much
                    more closely circumscribed, Dahomey proper being probably not more than 120
                    miles from north to south, and the same, or perhaps less, from east to west,
                    lying between 6° 15' and 7° 30' N. lat. and 1° 30' and 2° 30' E. long, or
                    thereby. On the AV. and N.W. are the semi-independent races of Aja and Atakpame;
                    on the N. the Mahees or Makhis, now completely subjugated; and on the N.E. and
                    E. the Eyos and the Egbas, both the hereditary enemies of the Dahomans. On the
                    S.E. is the kingdom of Porto Novo, a nation of kindred race, over which the king
                    of Dahomey claims suzerainty. The southern portion of Dahomey is confined to the
                    narrow tongue of dry land which lies between the Avon and the Denham lagoons and
                    the swamps to the north of them, while the actual coastline included in the
                    dominion extends only from Mount Pulloy (near Great Popo) on the west to Cotonau
                    on the east. The frontier is said to be marked for some distance inland by the
                    River Agomey on the west and the Denham water and its tributary, the Ouellon or
                    Whemi river, on the east. The seaboard is about 35 miles long, and forms a
                    portion of the 120 miles of coast which intervene between the British
                    possessions of the Gold Coast proper and Lagos. Between the Gold Coast and the
                    Dahoman frontier occur several independent townships or coast settlements of
                    mixed race, each under a separate chief. The principal centre of trade with the
                    interior in this debateable land is the town of Gridgi, where a market is held
                    every few days.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Physical Features.—</hi> The physical geography of Dahomey
                    possesses some peculiarities. The ancient limit of the continent now lies about
                    50 miles inland, and the low ground intervening between the former coast-line
                    and the present shore is protected from the ocean by a natural bank of <pb

                    to prevent the incursions of the sea except at a few points, of which the
                    channels of Great Popo and Lagos are well defined. Behind the sand-bank runs a
                    lagoon affording carriage along almost the whole coast. A line drawn from the
                    coast at Appi northwards to Abomey would represent roughly the almost
                    imperceptible water-shed of the country, dividing the two systems of drainage
                    which communicate with the sea at Great Popo and Lagos respectively. Recent
                    charts show two vast lakes, the Avon and the Denham waters, extending many miles
                    inland, and communicating with the lagoon which skirts the coast-line, but it is
                    now certain that the extent of these lakes has been much exaggerated, and that
                    the greater portion of what has been considered as navigable water is really
                    low-lying land, more or less marshy according to the season of the year, and
                    intersected by rivers and streams. The steamer “Eko” from Badagry ascended the
                    Whemi river for a considerable distance in the autumn of 1876, and found plenty
                    of water; while M. Guil-levin, a French naval officer, who some years ago
                    penetrated to the same river at Kassa near Abomey, not many mile’s further up in
                    the month of April, that is during the dry season, reported that there was then
                    little water in the stream.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"
                    ><p>More recently Mr Dumaresq, the late administrator of Lagos, who was on board
                    the “Eko,” when it explored the Whemi after the rains of 1876, has again
                    ascended the river for 20 miles in an open boat for the purpose of ascertaining
                    the depth of water during the dry season. He is reported to have found it to
                    average 2 fathoms, but with a depth of 34 feet only on the bar at the entrance
                    of the river. The breadth was 150 yards, and the stream was free from swamps. It
                    must, however, he remarked that the character of the river in the latitude of
                    the Agrime swamp-remains still undetermined.</p></note> The whole question of
                    the geography of this coast is very fully discussed by the Abbe Borghero in a
                    letter explaining the discrepancies between the English maps and his own. The
                    letter is published in the <hi rend="italic">Bulletin de la Societe de
                    Geographie</hi> of July 1866. The subject has considerable interest in
                    connection with recent events on the Slave Coast, and in regard to the possible
                    extension of the British protectorate over the interval of coast-line which now
                    separates the two sections of the Gold Coast Colony. The sketch which
                    illustrates this article is based upon M. Borghero’s map, but it differs from it
                    in the important particular of the position of Abomey. The latitude now assigned
                    has been determined by a careful comparison of the itineraries of all the
                    principal travellers, and the length of the route is found to correspond exactly
                    with that given by Commodore Wilmot in 1862. It is a singular fact that the
                    distance of Abomey from the coast, according to the accounts of successive
                    travellers, has been gradually diminishing from 200 miles in 1724 to the present
                    estimate. The longitude of Abomey is undetermined, but preference has been given
                    to the English accounts which place it slightly more to the west than the French
                    map.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Communication.—</hi> The interior of Dahomey is traversed by
                    road a extending from Whydah to Abomey, the capital, a distance of 65 miles. The
                    road, for the first 40 miles, lies through forest, gradually increasing in
                    density to the edge of the AgrimA or Great Swamp. Round the villages, and here
                    and there in the forest, clearings are met with, cultivated in places, but in
                    others now partially overgrowm. The soil is naturally fertile, and there is
                    evidence of former prosperity, but everywhere the process of depopulation is
                    apparent, and the country is described as a luxuriant wilderness. The swamp
                    which is supposed to connect the marshes at the head of the Avon and Denham
                    waters is seven or eight miles broad. It is covered with stunted trees and its
                    surface is rough and uneven. So far as any movement of its waters has been
                    observed, it drains towards the west. The passage is attended by considerable
                    difficulties during the rainy months, but in dry seasons it is scarcely
                    distinguishable from the rest of the route. There are two known tracks across
                    the swamp. The right is the more direct of the two; it passes through Akpwd and
                    AgrimA The left road, said to be slightly longer owing to the obligation imposed
                    upon all travellers to halt at Cana, branches off at Henvi, and enters the marsh
                    at Toffo; it is used in the rainy season, the passage of the swamp being less
                    difficult at this point. The “koh.” or swamp, once passed, the difficulties of
                    the journey are left behind, and the character of the country undergoes a
                    complete change; instead of dense forest and dismal swamps, a vast and gently
                    undulating plain, with a gradual ascent towards the Kong Mountains, stretches
                    out as far as the eye can reach. The approach to Cana has been described by
                    several travellers as one of much beauty.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Port and Towns.—</hi> The principal seaport is Whydah. It is
                    situated on the north bank of the coast lagoon about two miles from the sea.
                    There is no harbour at the beacli, and landing is effected in boats made
                    expressly to pass through the surf, which is here particularly heavy. The town
                    is two miles long and half a mile deep, and has about 12,000 inhabitants. There
                    are five quarters, the English, French, Portuguese, Brazilian, and native, and
                    the three first have the remains of once formidable forts.</p>
                <p>Cana is the country residence of the king; the town straggles over three miles of
                    ground, but the precincts include more field than habitation, the population
                    being from 4000 to 5000. The distance from Cana to Abomey is eight miles; the
                    road, apparently level, has an imperceptible rise the whole way; it is 20 yards
                    broad and is kept carefully clear of grass.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Abomey.—</hi> The site of the capital is a rolling plain,
                    nearly surrounded by marsh, and terminating in short bluffs tt&gt; the
                    north-west, where it is bounded by a long depression. Scattered over this hollow
                    are the principal pans which scantily supply the city with water. For some
                    reason visitors are not permitted to approach this quarter, and it was only by
                    infringing the royal commands that Captain Burton, setting out at 4 o’clock one
                    misty morning, was able to explore it. The city is about eight miles in
                    circumference. The enceinte consists of a ditch 5 feet deep, filled with a dense
                    growth of prickly acacia, the usual defence of West African strongholds. It is
                    entered by six gates, which are simply clay walls, with two apertures, built
                    across the roads leading into the town. Within the walls are several royal
                    palaces, a market-place, a large square containing the barracks, &amp;c., many
                    cultivated farms and several large wastes; and outside the gates on the south
                    there is a suburb with three other palaces. Notwithstanding the great area
                    occupied by the habitations, the population is estimated by Burton at not more
                    than 12,000, or about the same as that of Whydah, which only covers one-sixth of
                    the area.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Mahee country.—</hi> From Abomey a road leads across a marsh
                    northwards into the Mahee country, which is entered about 30 miles from the
                    capital, and extends in a series of gradually rising terraces to the heart of
                    the Kong Mountains. It is a rugged country of varied surface, and produces iron
                    ore, which is smelted and worked up into agricultural and other implements. The
                    mahogany tree and the African oak abound, and the much esteemed sheabutter tree
                    is met with: the cotton plant is indigenous. The towns are built on the level
                    summits of the hills with a view to defence.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Productions.—</hi> The soil of Dahomey proper is naturally
                    fertile, and is capable of being highly cultivated. It consists of a rich clay
                    of a deep red colour. Finely powdered quartz and yellow mica are met with,
                    denoting the deposit of disintegrated granite from the interior. The principal
                    <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit06newyrich/page/n801/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0906-0801-0766"/> product is palm-oil, which i3 made in large
                    quantities throughout the country. The district of Toffo is particularly noted
                    for its oil-palm orchards; these are chiefly owned by the officials of the
                    capital, many of whom have houses and grounds there. Palm-wine, said to be
                    superior to the finest cider, is also made, but the manufacture is prohibited
                    excepting in the bush, as the process destroys the tree. Next to palm-oil the
                    principal vegetable products are maize, guinea-corn, cassava (the substitute for
                    bread), yams, sweet potatoes, plantains, cocoa-nuts, oranges, limes, and the
                    African apple, which grows almost wild. The country also produces ground-nuts,
                    Kola-nuts, pine-apples, guavas, spices of all kinds, ginger, okros <hi
                    rend="italic">(Hibiscus),</hi> sugar-cane, onions, tomatoes, and papaws. Cattle,
                    sheep, and goats are scarce, and fowls are not plentiful.</p>
                <p>The medium of exchange is the cowrie, which is imported from Zanzibar by the
                    European merchants. At Whydah fifty cowries make a string, and fifty strings one
                    “head;” a dollar is worth four heads; the head is Is. ljd., and a string
                    therefore about a farthing. Inland, the value of the cowrie is enhanced by
                    reducing the number in the string.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">climate</hi> of this part of the Slave Coast is the same as
                    on the remainder of the Bight of Benin. Whydah is considered slightly more
                    healthy than either Lagos or Badagry. Near the sea the heat is not excessive,
                    the average temperature being about 80° Fahr. The year may be divided into four
                    seasons :—summer, the rains, autumn, and the harmattan. During the summer, which
                    continues from March to May, the heat is greatest, and dysentery prevails. The
                    rains are ushered in by violent thunderstorms, and they last from May until
                    August, with a break of fine weather in June; at the close of the rains
                    thunderstorms are again prevalent This is the coolest season of the year, but
                    mosquitoes and sandflies abound. The autumn months are from September to
                    November; thunderstorms and tornadoes occur at intervals; the climate assumes a
                    more unhealthy phase, and Guinea worm is troublesome. The harmattan, so called
                    owing to the prevalence of a cold dry wind which blows from the north and
                    north-east, continues from December to February. It prevails for several days in
                    succession, and alternates with winds from the south and south-west; its
                    approach is generally foretold by a thick white fog known as “the smokes.”
                    During its continuance the thermometer falls about 10’, there is not the
                    slightest moisture in the atmosphere, vegetation dries up or droops, the skin
                    parches and peels, and all woodwork is liable to warp and crack with a loud
                    report. This season is considered healthy, but in the intervals of the harmattan
                    wind, when it is usually hot, mild fever may be expected. Tornadoes occur
                    occasionally. During nine months of the year the climate is tempered by a
                    sea-breeze, which is felt as far inland as Abomey. It generally commences in the
                    forenoon, and in the summer it often increases to a stiff gale at sundown.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">history</hi> of Dahomey before the last 200 years is
                    unknown. The country now occupied by Dahomey and Porto-Novo was, at the
                    commencement of this period, comprised in the extensive kingdom of Ardrah, of
                    which the capital was the present town of Alladd, on the road from Whydah to
                    Abomey. About the beginning of the 17th century the state became dismembered on
                    the death of a reigning sovereign, and three separate kingdoms were constituted
                    under his three sons. One state was formed by one brother round the old capital
                    of Alladd, and retained the name of Ardrah; another brother migrated to the east
                    and formed a state also called Ardrah, but now known under the name of Porto
                    Novo; while the third brother travelled northwards, and after some vicissitudes
                    established the kingdom of Dahomey. The Western Ardrah, or Alladd, appears to
                    have been subsequently further subdivided by the formation of the separate
                    kingdom of "Whydah to the south. About 1724-28 Dahomey, having become a powerful
                    state, invaded and conquered successively AlladA and Whydah. Towards the north
                    it was unable to extend its power, being hemmed in by the Mahees and the still
                    more powerful Eyos or Oyos. The people of Whydah who escaped massacre or capture
                    retreated along the coast to the west, and established themselves in the islands
                    of the lagoon about Great Popo. The Whydahs from time to time made several
                    attempts to recover their country, but without success, while on the other hand
                    the Dahomans failed in all their expeditions against Popo. It is related that
                    the repulses they met with in this quarter led to the standing order that no
                    Dahoman warrior is to enter a canoe. The Dahomans have at several times
                    penetrated along the beach towards the east as far as Badagry, but the king of
                    Porto Novo became jealous of their incursions, and invoked the aid of the Eyos
                    to put a stop to them. This was the state of affairs at the accession of Gezo
                    about the year 1818. This monarch, who reigned forty years, raised the power of
                    Dahomey to its highest pitch. He boasted of having first organized the amazons,
                    to which force he attributed his successes. In 1825 he attacked the Eyos at Cana
                    and abolished the tribute, thus freeing his country from the incubus on the
                    north-east. He next (1840) overran Atakpamd on the west, and subjugated the
                    Mahees on the north. Shortly after this began the quarrels with Abbeokuta, which
                    continue to this day, and have proved one of the main causes of the decline of
                    the Dahoman power. In 1848 Gezo fell unexpectedly on Okiadan and completely
                    destroyed it. In 1851 he attacked Abbeokuta, the centre of the Egba power, but
                    was beaten back. Gezo never recovered from this blow; he died in 1858, and was
                    succeeded by his son Geleld.</p>
                <p>Geleld’s principal exploit was me capture of the Egba town of Ishagga in 1862. He
                    slew the chief and carried off amongst the prisoners some native Christian
                    converts and a native scripture-reader called William Doherty. This unfortunate
                    man was crucified on a tree at Abomey, and his body was seen in this position by
                    M. Euschart, a Dutch merchant of Whydah. In 1864 Geleld attacked Abbeokuta and
                    received an exemplary defeat, which will probably be sufficient to prevent him
                    from again seriously attempting the capture of the place. Abomey has been
                    frequently visited by representatives of the British Government. The later
                    missions have had a threefold object—the suppression of the slave trade, the
                    abolition of human sacrifices, and the dissuasion of the king from attacking
                    Abbeokuta. Little result has ever been obtained from any of these visits.</p>
                <p>From the time of Captain Burton’s visit in 1863 there was little change in the
                    political situation of Dahomey, until the spring of 187 6, when in an evil
                    moment Geleld caused an Englishman resident in Whydah to be treated
                    ignominiously. Brought to task by the commodore on the station the king refused
                    to pay the fine of palm-oil awarded, and defied the British flag. Accordingly,
                    for the fourth time in the history of Dahomey, a blockade of the coast was
                    proclaimed.</p>
                <p>Throughout the history of Dahomey, with very few exceptions, Europeans appear to
                    have been treated with kindness, but they have often felt the inconvenience of
                    placing themselves within the power of an uncivilized despot. It has always been
                    an object with the king to secure the presence of white men at his “customs,”
                    and even casual visitors to Whydah have found themselves compelled to accept an
                    invitation to visit the capital. Once there the length of their stay has
                    depended on the caprice of the king, and even the envoys of European powers have
                    <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit06newyrich/page/n802/mode/1up"

                    etiquette of the savage court. As a notable instance of vexatious delay, Mr
                    Skertchley, who visited Why dab in 1871, was induced to go to Abomey under
                    promise of return to the port in eight days, and was compelled to remain eight
                    months.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic superscript"> ,f</hi><hi rend="italic">customs”</hi> consist
                    of an annual festival which takes place about October, and lasts several weeks.
                    During the saturnalia many human victims are put to death with great barbarity.
                    At one stage of the customs the unfortunate wretches, chiefly captives taken in
                    war, are dressed in white shirts and long white night-caps and tied into
                    baskets. They are then taken to the top of a high platform, and paraded on the
                    heads of amazons, together with an alligator, a cat, and a hawk in similar
                    baskets. The king now makes a speech explaining that the victims are sent to
                    testify to his greatness in spirit-land, the men and the animals each to their
                    kind. They are then hurled down into the middle of a surging crowd of natives,
                    and meet with a horrible death. At another stage of the festival human
                    sacrifices are offered at the shrine of the king’s ancestors, and the blood is
                    sprinkled on their graves. The skulls are used to adorn the palace walls, and
                    the king’s sleeping-chamber is paved with the heads of his enemies. The skulls
                    of the conquered kings are turned into royal drinking cups, and their conversion
                    to this use is esteemed an honour.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Amazons.—</hi> But the most singular institution of this
                    strange race is found in the treatment of the female sex. About one-fourth of
                    the whole are said to be married to the fetish, many even before their birth,
                    and the remainder are entirely at the disposal of the king. The most favoured
                    are selected as his own wives or enlisted into the regiments of amazons, and
                    then the chief men are liberally supplied. Of the female captives the most
                    promising are drafted into the ranks as soldiers, and the rest become amazonian
                    camp followers and slaves in the royal households.</p>
                <p>With such an appropriation of the women it is not surprising that the population
                    of Dahomey is found to be decreasing. No estimate can be formed of the number of
                    inhabitants, but evidences of depopulation strike the traveller. It is a mistake
                    to ascribe the diminution to human sacrifices, for the number of these is
                    comparatively insignificant, and the victims are principally foreign
                    captives.</p>
                <p>The army of Dahomey was formerly held in high repute, but its prowess was
                    probably overrated. The amazons form the flower of the army. They are marshalled
                    in regiments, each with its distinctive uniform and badges, and they take the
                    post of honour on the flanks of the battle line. Their number has been variously
                    stated. Captain Burton had a good opportunity of judging, as he saw the army
                    marching out of Cana on an expedition in 1862, and he computed the whole force
                    of women troops at 2500, of whom one-third were unarmed or only half armed.
                    Their weapons are blunderbusses, flint muskets, and bows and arrows. Whether
                    their arrows are poisoned or not is a point on which there is difference of
                    opinion.</p>
                <p>A recent writer estimates the number of amazons at 1000, and the male soldiers at
                    10,000. The system of warfare is one of surprise. The army marches out, and,
                    when within a few days’ journey of the town to be attacked, silence is enjoined
                    and no fires are permitted. The regular highways are avoided, and the advance is
                    by a road specially cut through the bush. The town is surrounded at night, and
                    just before daybreak a rush is made and every soul captured if possible; none
                    are killed except in self-defence, as the first object is to capture, not to
                    kill. The season usually selected for expeditions is from January to March, or
                    immediately after the annual customs. The amazons are carefully trained, and the
                    king is in the habit of holding “autumn manoeuvres” for the benefit of
                    foreigners. Many visitors have witnessed a mimic assault, and they are agreed in
                    ascribing a marvellous power of endurance to the women troops. Lines of thorny
                    acacia are piled up one behind the other to represent defences, and at a given
                    signal the amazons, barefooted and without any special protection, charge and
                    disappear from sight Presently they emerge within the lines torn and bleeding,
                    but apparently insensible to pain, and the parade closes with a march past, each
                    warrior leading a pretended captive bound with a rope.</p>
                <p>It is said that at the death of the king a horrid scene ensues; the wives, after
                    the most extravagant demonstrations of grief and breaking and destroying
                    everything within their reach, attack and murder each other, and remain in an
                    uproar until order is restored by the new sovereign. The throne descends
                    rightfully to the eldest son, but, as in the case of the present monarch, a
                    younger brother is not unfrequently preferred, should the chiefs consider the
                    heir unfitted to assume the reins of government. (w. K. E.)</p>
