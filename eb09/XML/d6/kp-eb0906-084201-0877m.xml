                    been assigned for his birth and death, the earliest being that of Geoffrey of
                    Monmouth, who fixes his death in 542, and the latest that of the <hi
                    rend="italic">Annales Cambrice,</hi> which fixes it in 601. Many writers follow
                    Ussher in stating that he died in 544, aged eighty-two; but the latest
                    authorities, Jones and Freeman <hi rend="italic">(History of St David's')</hi>
                    and Haddan and Stubbs (C'ouncifs <hi rend="italic">and Ecclesiastical
                    Documents),</hi> accept the date of the <hi rend="italic">Annales Cambrice.</hi>
                    The narrative of St David’s life is overlaid with legendary matter to an unusual
                    extent, and it is impossible to determine accurately what is historical and what
                    is fictitious. Such stories as that he possessed the power of working miracles,
                    even before his birth, that he was eighteenth in descent from the Virgin Mary,
                    and that he was attended by an angel in his infancy, may obviously be referred
                    at once to the latter category; but there are many other details which, even
                    though not obviously improbable, must be regarded as extremely doubtful.
                    According to the account given by Rice Rees <hi rend="italic">(Welsh
                    Saints)</hi> as historical, St David was the son of Sandde or Xantus, prince of
                    Ceretica (Cardiganshire), and was born at Hen-Menen or Menevia (now St David’s).
                    After spending a number of years at the college of a celebrated teacher
                    Paulinus, he founded a college or monastery in the Vale of Rhos, near his native
                    place, which was distinguished for the severity of its rule. His fame as a
                    theologian led to his being summoned to the synod of Brefi to confute the
                    Pelagian heretics. So well did he acquit himself of this task that the synod
                    elected him archbishop of Caerleon and primate of Wales,—Dubriciu3, the occupant
                    of the see, having resigned to make room for him. Soon after his election St
                    David found it necessary to convene another synod, which is styled in the annals
                    the Synod of Victory, so complete was the triumph obtained over the Pelagians.
                    Somewhat later the primate obtained leave to transfer his seat from Caerleon to
                    Menevia (St David’s). He died at an advanced age, and was buried in the church
                    of St David’s. His shrine is to be seen in the existing cathedral. Recent
                    criticism, while admitting that St David founded a see at Menevia, and that he
                    probably took an active part in the undoubtedly historical synod of Brefi, has
                    discredited his archiepiscopal jurisdiction. This is almost certainly the
                    invention of those in a later age who wished to maintain the independence of the
                    Welsh church, and supremacy in that church of the see of St David’s. It was the
                    view that naturally commended itself to the author of the earliest life of St
                    David, Rythmark, or Ricemarchus, bishop of St David’s in the 11th century, who
                    wrote at a time when the independence of the Welsh church was seriously
                    threatened. His narrative is followed in the main by Giraldus Cambrensis and
                    later authorities. St David was canonized by Pope Calixtus II., in the 12th
                    century. His festival is celebrated on the 1st March.</p>
