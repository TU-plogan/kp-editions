                    March 1789. His father was a sculptor, or rather a carver, but he had thrown
                    aside the mallet and taken the musket, fighting against the Chouans of La
                    Vendde. He returned to his trade at the end of the civil war, to find his
                    customers gone, so that young David was born into poverty. As the boy grew up
                    his father wished to force him into some more lucrative and certain way of life.
                    At last he succeeded in surmounting the opposition to his becoming a sculptor,
                    and in his eighteenth year left for Paris to study the art upon a fund of eleven
                    francs. As far as we know his works, the genius on which he relied was not very
                    great; but after struggling against want for a year and a half, he succeeded in
                    taking the prize at the Ecole des Beaux Arts. Energy and perseverance stood in
                    the place of natural ability, and now fortune aided him in the shape of an
                    annuity of 600 francs (£24), granted by the municipality of his native town, by
                    the name of which he was proud to be called ever after. This was in 1809, and in
                    1811 his Epaminondas gained the prize of Rome, where he spent five years, rather
                    too much impressed by the works of Canova.</p>
                <p>Returning from Rome about the time of the restoration of the Bourbons, he would
                    not remain in the neighbourhood of the Tuileries, swarming with foreign
                    conquerors and returned royalists; he found his way to London, having made
                    several English acquaintances in Rome. Here, if we are to believe the statement
                    in his biography, he was offered the commission to erect a monument
                    commemorative of Waterloo,—more probably he received an invitation to offer a
                    design for some such work, which he might misunderstand from his ignorance of
                    English. At the same time his resources were exhausted; and Flaxman and others
                    visited upon him the sins of David the painter, to whom he was supposed to be
                    related. With great difficulty he made his way to Paris again, where a
                    comparatively prosperous career opened upon him. His medallions and busts were
                    in much request, and monumental works also came to him. One of the best of these
                    was that of Gutenberg at Strasburg; but those he himself valued most were the
                    statue of Barra, a drummer boy who fell in the war in La Vendee, who continued
                    to beat his drum till the moment of death, and the monument to the Greek
                    liberator Bozzaris. This was a young female figure he called “Reviving Greece,”
                    of which his friend Victor Hugo says rather absurdly, “It is difficult to see
                    anything more beautiful in the world; this statue joins the grandeur of Phidias
                    to the expressive manner of Puget.” His busts and medallions were very numerous,
                    and among his sitters may be found not only the illustrious men and women of
                    France, but many others both of England and Germany—countries which he visited
                    professionally in 1827 and 1829. His medallions, it is affirmed, number 500. He
                    died on the 4th of January 1856.</p>
                <p>David d’Angers was respected for his consistency and benevolence. As an example
                    of the latter may be mentioned his rushing off to the sickbed of Rouget de
                    Lille, the author of the <hi rend="italic">Marseillaise llymn,</hi> modelling
                    and carving him in marble without delay, making a lottery of the work, and
                    possibly saving the poet’s life by sending him the proceeds, £72, when in the
                    extremity of need.</p>
