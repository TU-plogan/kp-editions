                <p><label type="entry">DANCE</label>. The term dancing in its widest sense includes
                    three things :—(1) the spontaneous activity of the muscles under the influence
                    of some strong emotion, such as social joy or religious exultation; (2) definite
                    combinations of graceful movements performed for the sake of the pleasure which
                    the exercise affords to the dancer or to the spectator; (3) carefully trained
                    movements which are meant by the dancer vividly to represent the actions and
                    passions of other people. In the highest sense it seems to be for prose-gesture
                    what song is for the instinctive exclamations of feeling. Pantomime in the
                    emphatic form of dancing scarcely exists in this century, but it has had an
                    important history. Regarded as the outlet or expression of strong feeling,
                    dancing does not require much discussion, for the general rule applies that such
                    demonstrations for a time at least sustain and do not exhaust the flow of
                    feeling. The voice and the facial muscles and many of the organs are affected at
                    the same time, and the result is a high state of vitality which among the
                    spinning Dervishes or in the ecstatic worship of Bacchus and Cybele amounted to
                    something like madness. Even here there is traceable an undulatory movement
                    which, as Mr Spencer says, is “habitually generated by feeling in its bodily
                    discharge.” But it is only in the advanced or volitional stage of dancing that
                    we find developed the essential feature of <hi rend="italic">measure,</hi> which
                    has been said to consist in “the alternation of stronger muscular contractions
                    with weaker ones,” an alternation which, except in the cases of savages and
                    children, “is compounded with longer rises and falls in the degree of muscular
                    excitement.” In analyzing the state of mind which this measured dancing
                    produces, we must first of all allow for the pleasant glow of excitement caused
                    by the excess of blocd sent to the brain. But apart from this, there is an
                    agreeable sense of uniformity in the succession of muscular efforts, and in the
                    spaces described, and also in the period of their recurrence. If the steps of
                    dancing and the intervals of time be not precisely equal, there is still a
                    pleasure depending on the gradually increasing intensity of motion, on the
                    undulation which uniformly rises in order to fall. As Florizel says to Perdita,
                    “When you do dance, I wish you a wave of the sea” (<hi rend="italic">Winter's
                    Tale,</hi> iv. 3). The mind feels the beauty of emphasis and cadence in muscular
                    motion, just as much as in musical notes. Then, the figure of the dance is
                    frequently a circle or some more graceful curve or series of curves,—a fact
                    which satisfies the dancer as well as the eye of the spectator. But all such
                    effects are intensified by the use of music, which not only brings a perfectly
                    distinct set of pleasurable sensations to dancer and spectator, but by the
                    control of dancing produces an inexpressibly sweet harmony of sound and motion.
                    This harmony is further enriched if there be two dancing together on one plan,
                    or a large company of dancers executing certain evolutions, the success of which
                    depends on the separate harmonies of all the couples. The fundamental condition
                    is that throughout the dance all the dancers,keep within their bases of gravity.
                    This is not only required for the dancers’ own enjoyment, but, as in the famous
                    Mercury on tiptoe, it is essential to the beautiful effect for the spectator.
                    The idea of much being safely supported by little is what proves attractive in
                    the modern posturing ballet. But this is merely one condition of graceful
                    dancing, and if it be made the chief object, the dancer sinks into the acrobat.
                    These psychological principles have still to be applied to the phenomena
                    presented by the dances of different nations. (See Read’s <hi rend="italic"
                    >Characteristic National Dances,</hi> 1853).</p>
                <p>We shall first consider the varieties of dance which without any apparent mimetic
                    object seem to be suggested by the mere pleasure of movement felt by the
                    performer or by the spectator. In Tigre the Abyssinians dance the <hi
                    rend="italic">chassee</hi> step in a circle, and keep time by shrugging their
                    shoulders and working their elbows backwards and forwards. At intervals the
                    dancers squat on the ground, still moving the arms and shoulders in the same
                    way. The Bushmen dance in their low-roofed rooms supporting themselves by
                    sticks; one foot remains motionless, the other dances in a wild irregular
                    manner, while the hands are occupied with the sticks. The Gonds, a hill-tribe of
                    Hindustan, dance generally in pairs, with a shuffling step, the eyes on the
                    ground, the arms close to the body, and the elbows at an angle with the closed
                    hand. Advancing to a point, the dancer suddenly erects his head, and wheels
                    round to the starting point. The women of the Pultooah tribe dance in a circle,
                    moving backwards and forwards in a bent posture. The Santal women, again, are
                    slow and graceful in dance; joining hands, they form themselves into the arc of
                    a circle, towards the centre of which they advance and then retire, moving at
                    the same time slightly towards the right, so as to complete the circle in an
                    hour. The Kukis of Assam have only the rudest possible step, an awkward hop with
                    the knees very much bent. The national dance of the Kamchadale is one of the
                    most violent known, every muscle apparently quivering at every moment. But
                    there, and in some other cases where men and women dance together, there is a
                    trace of deliberate obscenity; the dance is, in fact, a rude representation of
                    sexual passion. It has been said that some of the Tasmanian <hi rend="italic"
                    >corrobories</hi> have a phallic design. The Yucatan dance of <hi rend="italic"
                    >naual</hi> may also be mentioned. The Andamans hop on one foot and swing the
                    arms violently backwards and forwards. The Veddahs jump with both feet together,
                    patting their bodies, or clapping their hands, and make a point of bringing
                    their long hair down in front of the face. In New Caledonia the dance consists
                    of a series of twistings of the body, the feet being lifted alternately, but
                    without change of place. The Fijians jump half round from side to side with
                    their arms akimbo. The only modulation of the Samoan dance is one of time—a <hi
                    rend="italic">crescendo</hi> movement, which is well-known in the modern
                    ball-room. The Javans are perhaps unique in their distinct and graceful gestures
                    of the hand and fingers. At a Mexican feast called Huitzilopochtli, the noblemen
                    and women danced tied together at the hands, and embracing one another, the arms
                    being thrown over the neck. This resembles the dance variously known as the
                    Greek Bracelet or Brawl, ’Opp.os, or Bearsfeet; but all of them<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Compare the Chica of South
                    America, the Fandango of Spain, and the Angrismene or la Fach^e of modern

                    probably are to a certain extent symbolical of the relations between <pb

                    xml:id="kp-eb0906-0834-0799"/> the sexes. Actual contact of the partners,
                    however, is quite intelligible as matter of pure dancing <hi rend="italic">;
                    for,</hi> apart altogether from the pleasure of the embrace, the harmony of the
                    double rotation adds very much to the enjoyment. In a very old Peruvian dance of
                    ceremony before the Inca, several hundreds of men formed a chain, each taking
                    hold of the hand of the man beyond his immediate neighbour, and the whole body
                    moving forwards and backwards three steps at a time as they approached the
                    throne. In this, as in the national dance of the Coles of Lower Bengal, there
                    was perhaps a suggestion of “l’union fait le force.” In Yucatan stilts were
                    occasionally used <hi rend="superscript"> r</hi> or dancing.</p>
                <p>It seldom happens that dancing takes place without accompaniment, either by the
                    dancer or by others. This is not merely because the feelings which find relief
                    in dancing express themselves at the same time in other forms; in some cases,
                    indeed, the vocal and instrumental elements largely predominate, and form the
                    ground-work of the whole emotional demonstration. Whether they do so or not will
                    of course depend on the intellectual advancement of the nation or tribe, and
                    upon the particular development of their aesthetical sensibility. A striking
                    instance occurs among the Zulus, whose grand dances are merely the accompaniment
                    to the colloquial war and hunting songs, in which the women put questions which
                    are answered by the men. So also in Tahiti there is a set of national ballads
                    and songs, referring to many events in the past and present lives of the people.
                    The fisherman, the woodsman, the canoe-builder, has each his trade song, which
                    on public occasions at least is illustrated by dancing. But the accompaniment is
                    often consciously intended, by an appeal to the ear, to regulate and sustain the
                    excitement of the muscles. And a close relation will be found always to exist
                    between the excellence of a nation’s dancing and the excellence or complexity of
                    its music and poetry. In some cases the performer himself sings or marks time by
                    the clanking of ornaments on his person. In others the accompaniment consists
                    sometimes of a rude chant improvised by those standing round, or of music from
                    instruments, or of mere clapping of the hands, or of striking one stick against
                    another or on the ground, or of “marking time,” in the technical sense. The
                    Tasmanians beat ou a rolled up kangaroo-skin. The Kamchadales make a noise like
                    a continuous hiccough all through the dance. The Andamans use a large hollow
                    dancing-board, on which one man is set apart to stamp. Sometimes it is the
                    privilege of the tribal chief to sing the accompaniment while his people dance.
                    The savages of New Caledonia whistle and strike upon the hip.</p>
                <p>The rude imitative dances of early civilisation are of extreme interest. In the
                    same way, the dances of the Ostyak tribes (Northern Asiatic) imitate the
                    habitual sports of the chase and the gambols of the wolf and the bear and other
                    wild beasts, the dancing consisting mainly of sudden leaps and violent turns
                    which exhaust the muscular powers of the whole body. The Kamchadales, too, in
                    dancing, imitate bears, dogs, and birds. The <hi rend="italic">Kru</hi> dances
                    of the Coast Negroes represent hunting scenes; and on the Congo, before the
                    hunters start, they go through a dance imitating the habits of the gorilla and
                    its movements when attacked. The Damara dance is a mimic representation of the
                    movements of oxen and sheep, four men stooping with their heads in contact, and
                    uttering harsh cries. The canter of the baboon is the humorous part of the
                    ceremony. The Bushmen dance in long irregular jumps, which they compare to the
                    leaping of a herd of calves, and the Hottentots not only go on all-fours to
                    counterfeit the baboon, but they have a dance in which the buzzing of a swarm of
                    bees is represented. The Kennowits in Borneo introduce the mi as and the deer
                    for the same purpose. The Australians and Tasmanians in their dances called <hi
                    rend="italic">corrobories</hi> imitate the frog and the kangaroo (both leaping
                    animals). The hunt of the emu is also performed, a number of men passing slowly
                    round the fire and throwing their arrows about so as to imitate the movements of
                    the animal’s head while feeding. The Gonds are fond of dancing the bison hunt,
                    one man with skin and horns taking the part of the animal. Closely allied to
                    these are the mimic fights, almost universal among tribes to which war is one of
                    the great interests of life. The Bravery Dance of the Dahomans and the Hoolee of
                    the Bhil tribe in the Vindhya Hills are illustrations. The latter seems to have
                    been reduced to an amusement conducted by professionals w ho go from village to
                    village,— the battle being engaged in by women with long poles on the one side,
                    and men with short cudgels on the other. There is here an element of comedy,
                    which also appears in the Fiji club-dance. This, although no doubt originally
                    suggested by war, is enlivened by the presence of a clown covered with leaves
                    and wearing a mask. The monotonous song accompanying the club-dance is by way of
                    commentary or explanation. So also, in Guatemala there is a public <hi
                    rend="italic">baile</hi> or dance, in which all the performers, wearing the
                    skins and heads of beasts, go through a mock battle, which always ends in the
                    victory of those wearing the deer’s head. At the end the victors trace in the
                    sand with a pole the figure of some animal; and this exhibition is supposed to
                    have some historical reference. But nearly all savage tribes have a regular
                    war-dance, in which they appear in fighting costume, handle their weapons, and
                    go through the movements of challenge, conflict, pursuit or defeat. The women
                    generally supply the stimulus of music. There is one very picturesque dance of
                    the Natal Kaffirs, which probably refers to the departure of the warriors for
                    the battle. The women appeal plaintively to the men, who slowly withdraw,
                    stamping on the ground and darting their short spears or <hi rend="italic"
                    >assegais</hi> towards the sky. In Madagascar, when the men are absent on war,
                    the women dance for a great part of the day, believing that this inspires their
                    husbands with courage. In this, however, there may be some religious
                    significance. These wardances are totally distinct from the Institution of
                    military drill, which belongs to a later period, when social life has become
                    less impulsive and more reflective.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    little doubt that some of the characteristic movements of these primitive
                    hunting and war-dances survive in the smooth and ceremonious dances of the
                    present day. But the early mimetic dance was not confined to these two subjects;
                    it embraced the other great events of savage life— the drama of courtship and
                    marriage, the funeral dance, the consecration of labour, the celebration of
                    harvest or vintage;<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>The
                    Greek Lenaia and Dionysia had a distinct reference to tne seasons.</p></note>
                    sometimes,too, purely fictitious scenes of dramatic interest, while other dances
                    degenerated into games. For instance, in Yucatan one man danced in a cowering
                    attitude round a circle, while another followed, hurling at him <hi
                    rend="italic">bohordos</hi> or canes, which were adroitly caught on a small
                    stick. Again, in Tasmania, the dances of the women describe their “clamber for
                    the opossum, diving for shellfish, digging for roots, nursing children, and
                    quarrelling with husbands.” Another dance, in which a woman by gesture taunts a
                    chieftain with cowardice, gives him an opportunity of coming forward and
                    recounting his courageous deeds in dance. The funeral dance of the Todas
                    (another Indian hill tribe), consists in walking backwards and forwards, without
                    variation, to a howling tune of <hi rend="superscript"> u</hi> ha! hoo !” The
                    meaning of this is obscure, but it can <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0906-0835-0800"/> scarcely be solely an outburst of grief. In
                    Dahomey the blacksmiths, carpenters, hunters, braves, and bards, with their
                    various tools and instruments, join in a dramatic dance. We may add here a form
                    of dance which is almost precisely equivalent to the spoken incantation. It is
                    used by the professional devil-dancer of the wild Veddahs for the cure of
                    diseases. An offering of eatables is put on a tripod of sticks, and the dancer,
                    decorated with green leaves, goes into a paroxysm of dancing, in the midst of
                    which he receives the required information. This, however, rather belongs to the
                    subject of religious dances.</p>
                <p>It is impossible here to enumerate either the names or the forms of the sacred
                    dances which formed so prominent a part of the worship of antiquity. A mystic
                    philosophy found in them a resemblance to the courses of the stars. This
                    Pythagorean idea was expanded by Sir John Davies, in his epic poem <hi
                    rend="italic">Orchestra,</hi> published in 1596. They were probably adapted to
                    many purposes,—to thanksgiving, praise, supplication, and humiliation. It is
                    only one striking illustration of this wide-spread practice, that there was at
                    Rome a very ancient order of priests especially named Salii, who struck their
                    shields and sang <hi rend="italic">assamenta</hi> as they danced. The practice
                    re-appeared in the early church, special provision being made for dancing in the
                    choir. Scaliger, who astonished Charles V. by his dancing powers, says the
                    bishops were called <hi rend="italic">Pr</hi><hi rend="italic">ae</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">sules,</hi> because they led the dance on feast days. According to
                    some of the fathers, the angels are always dancing, and the glorious company of
                    apostles is really a <hi rend="italic">chorus</hi> of dancers. Dancing, however,
                    fell into discredit with the feast of the <hi rend="italic">Agap</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">ae</hi><hi rend="italic">.</hi> St Augustine says, “Melius est
                    fodere quam saltare;” and the practice was generally prohibited for some time.
                    No church or sect has raged so fiercely against the cardinal sin of dancing as
                    the Albigenses of Languedoc and the Waldenses, who agreed in calling it the
                    devil's procession. After the middle of the 18th century, there were still
                    traces of religious dancing in the cathedrals of Spain, Portugal, and
                    Roussillon,—especially in the Mussarabian Mass of Toledo. An account of the
                    numerous secular dances, public and private, of Greece and Rome will be found in
                    the classical histories, and in Mr Weaver’s <hi rend="italic">Essay towards a
                    History of Dancing,</hi> London, 1712, which, however, must be revised by more
                    recent authorities. The Pyrrhic (derived from the Memphitic) in all its local
                    varieties, the Bacchanalia, and the Hymensea were among the more important. The
                    name of Lycurgus is also associated with the Trichoria. Among the stage dances
                    of the Athenians, which formed interludes to the regular drama, one of the
                    oldest was the Delian dance of the Labyrinth, ascribed to Theseus, and called Τ
                    <hi rend="italic">έρα</hi><hi rend="italic">vos,</hi> from its resemblance to
                    the flight of cranes, and one of the most powerful was the dance of the
                    Eumenides. A farther development of the art took place at Rome, under Augustus,
                    when Pylades and Bathyllus brought serious and comic pantomime to great
                    perfection. The subjects chosen were such as the labour of Hercules, and the
                    surprise of Venus and Mars by Vulcan. The state of public feeling on the subject
                    is well shown in Lucian’s amusing dialogue <hi rend="italic">De Saltatione.</hi>
                    Before this Rome had only very inferior buffoons, who attended dinner parties,
                    and whose art traditions belonged not to Greece, but to Etruria.<note

                    of the theatre, were by temperament not great dancers in private. Cicero says,
                    “Nemo fere saltat sobrius, nisi forte insanit.” But the Italic Dance of the
                    imperial theatre, supported by music and splendid dresses, supplanted for a time
                    the older dramas. It was the policy of Augustus to cultivate other than
                    political interests for the people; and he passed laws for the protection and
                    privilege of the pantomimists. They were freed from the <hi rend="italic">jus
                    virgarum,</hi> and they used their freedom against the peace of the city.
                    Tiberius and Domitian oppressed and banished them; Trajan and Aurelius gave them
                    such titles as decurions and priests of Apollo; but the pantomime stage soon
                    yielded to the general corruption of the empire.</p>
                <p>The modern ballet seems to have been first produced on a considerable scale in
                    1480, at Tortona, before Duke Galeazzo of Milan. It soon became a common
                    amusement on great occasions at the European courts. The ordinary length was
                    five acts, each containing several <hi rend="italic">entrees,</hi> and each <hi
                    rend="italic">entree</hi> containing several quadrilles. The accessories of
                    painting, sculpture, and movable scenery were employed, and the representation
                    often took place at night, The allegorical, moral, and ludicrous ballets were
                    introduced to France by Baϊf in the time of Catherine de’ Medici. Balthasar of
                    Beaujeu appears also as a director of court ballets, in which amusement the
                    royal families of France continued for long to take an active part. The complex
                    nature of these exhibitions may be gathered from the title of one played at
                    Turin in 1634— <hi rend="italic">La verita nemica della apparenza, sollevata dal
                    tempo.</hi> Of the ludicrous, one of the best known was the Venetian ballet of
                    <hi rend="italic">La verita raminga.</hi> Now and then, however, a high
                    political aim may be discovered, as in the “Prosperity of the Arms of France,”
                    danced before Richelieu in 1641, or “Religion uniting Great Britain to the rest
                    of the World,” danced at London on the marriage of Princess Elizabeth to the
                    Elector Frederick. Outside the theatre, the Portuguese revived an ambulatory
                    ballet which was played on the canonization of Carlo Borromeo, and to which they
                    gave the name of the Tyrrhenic Pomp. During this time also the ceremonial ball
                    (with all its elaborate detail of <hi rend="italic">courante,</hi> minuet, and
                    saraband) was cultivated. The fathers of the church assembled at Trent gave a
                    ball in which they took a part. Masked balls, too, resembling in some respects
                    the Roman Saturnalia, became common towards the end of the 17th century. In
                    France a ball was sometimes diversified by a masquerade, carried on by a limited
                    number of persons in character-costume. Two of the most famous were named “au
                    Sauvage” and “des Sorciers.” In 1715 the regent of France started a system of
                    public balls in the opera-house, which did not succeed. Dancing, also, formed a
                    leading element in the <hi rend="italic">Opéra Fran</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >ç</hi><hi rend="italic">ais</hi> introduced by Quinault. His subjects were
                    chiefly marvellous, drawn from the classical mythologies; and the choral dancing
                    was not merely <hi rend="italic">divertissement,</hi> but was intended to assist
                    and enrich the dramatic action of the whole piece. The ideas of military
                    evolution and of magic incantation reappear. Although Lully wrote the music, and
                    the representation was supported by splendid decoration and mechanical effects,
                    the success of this new “tragedy” was short-lived, and since then the modern
                    ballet has never been more than a lyrical interlude. In this humbler function,
                    however, it was greatly improved by La Motte, whose piece <hi rend="italic"
                    >L'Europe Galante</hi> (1697) is a sparkling and elegant production. The lyrical
                    ballet draws much from Fairyland and Arcadia. The possibility of theatrical
                    dance has been strenuously maintained by M. de Cahusac in his <hi rend="italic"
                    >La Danse, Ancienne et Moderne,</hi> 3 vols., 1751; by M. de Noverre in his <hi
                    rend="italic">Lettres sur les Arts Imitateurs;</hi> and by Diderot in the <hi
                    rend="italic">Encyclopédie Méthodique,</hi> 1786. It was illustrated by the
                    performance of <hi rend="italic">Pygmalion</hi> by Mdlle. Sallé in London
                    (1732).<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Among the last
                    <hi rend="italic">demi-caractére</hi> ballets may be mentioned the <hi

                <p>Among the antiquities of this subject chorography, or orchesography, the art of
                    dancing notation, deserves a place. The idea is as old as 1598; but about 1700
                    M. Feuillet published a complicated system, which was twice translated <pb
                    break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit06newyrich/page/n836/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0906-0836-0801"/> into English at the beginning of the 18th century
                    by Mr Weaver and Mr Essex. A separate sign was used for each position, bend,
                    rising, step, leap, cabriole, falling, slide, turn, and cadence; and the track
                    of the dance was represented by curved lines. These were sometimes printed along
                    with the music. Such diagrams as still exist are interesting enough as visible
                    history of extinct dances; but as a practical aid in teaching or composing
                    dances chorography was entirely thrown aside as too cumbrous by Noverre, and by
                    Sir John Gallini, the proprietor of the ancient concert rooms in Hanover Square,
                    who wrote on this subject in 1726. The difficulty of the process may be seen by
                    applying it to so comparatively simple a dance as the Scotch reel, which
                    contains no less than 10 single steps—the ceum-siubhaile (forward step), the
                    ceum-coisiche (footing step), the leum-trasd (cross-spring,—French, <hi
                    rend="italic">sissonne),</hi> the siabadh-trasd (chasing step), the aiseag-trasd
                    (cross-passes), the fosgladh (open step), the cuartag (turning step), and
                    others. As may be seen from the technical language of dancing (assemblée, jetée,
                    chassée, glissada, contre-danse, contre-temps, coupé, entrechat, bourrée,
                    gaillarde, fleuret, &amp;c.) it has undoubtedly been brought to greatest
                    perfection in France. But space does not permit us to explain the steps or to
                    describe the picturesque forms of dance which are still practised in town and
                    country.</p>
                <p>One sentence in conclusion upon dancing or musical gymnastics as an important
                    branch of physical education. Long ago Locke pointed out (<hi rend="italic"
                    >Education,</hi> secs. 67,196) that the effects of dancing are not confined to
                    the body; it gives to children, he says, not mere outward gracefulness of
                    motion, but manly thoughts and a becoming confidence. Only lately, however, has
                    the advantage been recognized of making gymnastics attractive by connecting it
                    with what Homer calls “the sweetest and most perfect of human enjoyments.” The
                    practical principle against heavy weights and intense monotonous exertion of
                    particular muscles is thus stated by Mr Smiles <hi rend="italic">(Physical
                    Education,</hi> p. 148) :— “The greatest benefit is derived from that exercise
                    which calls into action the greatest number of muscles, and in which the action
                    of these is intermitted at the shortest intervals.” It required only one further
                    step to see how, if light and changing movements were desirable, music would
                    prove a powerful stimulus to gymnastics. It touches the play-impulse, and
                    substitutes a spontaneous flow of energy for the mechanical effort of the will.
                    The force of imitation or contagion, one of the most valuable forces in
                    education, is also much increased by the state of exhilaration into which
                    dancing puts the system. This idea was embodied by Froebel in his <hi
                    rend="italic">Kindergarten</hi> plan, and has been developed by Jahn and
                    Schreber in Germany, by Dio Lewis in the United States, and by Ling (the author
                    of the <hi rend="italic">Swedish Cure Movement}</hi> in Sweden. It is of course
                    not merely on aesthetic grounds (though these are sufficient) that musical
                    gymnastics, as distinguished from the process of manufacturing a shell of
                    muscle, are invaluable, They are, according to the testimony of all competent
                    persons, indispensable to complete development and general health.</p>

                    included several complex games at hall and tilting—the Greek <hi rend="italic

                    the Χερο or hand-movement is indicated by Ovid :—“Si vox est, canta; si mollia
